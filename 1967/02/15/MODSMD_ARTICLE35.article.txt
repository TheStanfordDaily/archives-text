# Report Of The Fraternity Subcommittee
## 
### 
This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a

build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.

split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
IFC, the A.S.S.U. Legislature, etc.)
which, within the next three years, will
consider whether each fraternity house
shall be allowed to remain within this

University. Such a decision shall be
based upon performance. The President
of the University is asked to constitute
such a Board in cooperation with the
academic council.
E. It is asked that the Board of Trus
tees be notified in detail of the substance
of this study and asked for its judge
ment.
F. That the fraternities state pub
licly their immediate intention of ig
noring and resisting any and all re
strictions on the race or religion of
their members, and that in such cases
where the fraternity does not so state,
the University no longer provide any
financial assistance.
G. It is asked, finally, that should
these measures, or measures incorpor
ating similar intentions, be ignored,
that the freshman class of this year
take special note of the means avail
able to it to improve the character of
its forthcoming upperclass life.

This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
"athletic conversationalist of good
build." All houses wanted to avoid
individuals who might have a "person
ality clash" with an active except the
Lambda Nus who said "much goes on
in the subconscious." Most stated that
they were not quite sure what made
a rushee acceptable.
Several houses, according to inter
views with house presidents, do have
membership restriction of a racial or
religious character. Kappa Sigma has
no written restrictions, but there is a
gentleman's agreement with the na
tional and with alumni that there
should be no Negro members. There is
presently one such pledge, but because
of academic complications which at
present prevent his initiation, no crisis
has been officially precipitated. The
Kappa Alpha national at present bars
Orientals, Jews and Negros, but the
local chapter presently has a special
waiver from this restriction which is
renewable yearly. The house president
speculated that the national policy
might possibly change soon. One mem
ber of the house interviewed independ
ently stated that the restriction is at
present honored by a gentleman's agree
ment with the understanding that if
this is broken, ties between the local
chapter and the national will be sev
ered. The Phi Delta Theta president
admitted that there is a clause in the
charter to restrict Negro membership.
This restriction might be deleted due
to a vote at convention last summer,
but he noted the decision must still go
through the proper channels to reach
national approval. Some chapters, he
noted have received a waiver on this
clause, though he added at Stanford,
alumni are important in considering
pledges.
In all cases but that of the KA house,
Dekes, Betas, Delta Chis and Alpha
Delts, ties to the national are weak,
meaningless, or nonexistent. However,
in some houses, suggestions for initia
tion ritual come from the national.
To facilitate getting a bid from
another house, half of the fraternities
stated that they will inform a rushee
if his chances of being bid are slim.
The Delta Chis said they would say
nothing to a rushee, though he was cer
tain to be rejected.
Although some changes in the rush
procedures were reported, the system
remains basically the same at Stan
ford. The Phi Sigs and the Theta Chis
mention the growing "informality" of
the rush situation. The Kappa Sigs
now use an opaque projector with
frosh book pictures.
Hell /Help Week
For the most part, Hell Week (also
called Help Week, pledge training, and
initiation in various combinations) is
kept very secret. The Betas, Theta
Chis, Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Alpha
Delt presidents refused to discuss cer
tain aspects of their Hell Week pro
cedures. The reasons for secrecy are
varied: The Fijis stated that Hell Week
is only for the Fijis to know about; the
Phi Delt's and the DU's Hell Weeks
are apparently in violation of Califor
nia State Law and the Fundamental
Standard, and to avoid legal interfer
ence, secrecy is maintained. The KA's
feared the reactions of certain "nar
row-minded administrators." The Phi
Sigs thought secrecy added to the
pleasure of the pledges, as did the
Beta and Theta Chi houses. The Kappa
Sigs feared their Hell Week "might
be against California State Law." This
was the program formulated under su
pervision of a faculty, alumni, and
Dean's Office advisory committee
forced upon the house after Hell Week
1964-65. Most thought Hell Week
should not be of campus concern. In
view of these comments by fraternity
presidents, it seems that President
Sterling's observation in the 1964 Rush
Book, that "Hell Weeks" have been re
replaced by "Help Weeks," was a bit
premature.
Except for the Phi Delts, faculty ad
visors were never present at Hell Week
functions. The Deke House did not
know who its faculty advisor was.
Many of the houses did not have fac
ulty advisors, so their presence was
impossible.
The duration of Hell Week varies:
Alpha Delts, 3 days; Alpha Sigs, Chi
Psis, Delta Chis, Dekes, KAs, Lambda
NUs, Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Sigma Chis,
Fijis, Theta Chis, and the Theta Chis,
one week, the rest were from 3-5 days.
It was usually held late in the autumn.
Some information on the content of
JleU Week was ohtalrted. It,should.he

compared to the California State Law,
section 8 of the Educational Code,
which reads:
10851: As used in this article, "hazing"
includes any method of initiation
into a student organization or
any pastime or amusement en
gaged in with respect to such or
ganization which causes or is
likely to cause, bodily danger or
physical harm to any student or
other person attending any
school, college, university or
other educational institution in
this state.
10852: No student shall conspire to en
gage in hazing, participate in
hazing, or commit any act that
injures, degrades, or disgraces,
or tends to injure, degrade, or
disgrace any fellow student or
person attending the institution.
The Deke president was thoroughly
evasive and denied the existence of
a Hell Week. The information included
below comes from a pledge and a de
pledged member. At the Deke house,
every week pledges were struck with
paddles from one to five "hacks" cor
responding to a fine of one to five dol
lars. To "inform the pledge of his
group plight," group punishment with
a paddle was administered. The pledges
were required to return nightly at
10:30 for 'fun and games." They ex
ercise, roll on the floor, change beds,
and then beg the actives for permis
sion to sleep. This year one pledge
was held to the floor and faced a 100
watt light bulb moved near his head.
The active slipped and burned the
pledge's neck badly.
The Alpha Sigs, Chi Psis, DU's,
KA's, Phi Delts, and SAE's all have
pledge tests .The Phi Delts throw food
at the pledges during and after dinner.
The Phi Kap pledge dips his head in
simulated urine. One fraternity de
cided at the last moment not to paint
its pledges.
Pre-initiation ritual at the Fiji house
requires nightly "hacks" administered
with a leather paddle. These are called
"good night kisses" and must be re
quested by each pledge. If a pledge
fails to beg for his, the other pledges
have an extra administered and, in an
attempt to build "unity," it is made
abundantly clear that this is the fault
of their errant "brother."
This kind of activity creates social
pressure from within the pledge class
which, along with threat of non-initia
tion, secures compliance with the "Hell
or Help" Week programs. A second
type of pressure is the subtle insinua
tion that the failure of a pledge to per
form an activity is a reflection on
either his "manliness" or "desire" to
join a house.
Several houses have instituted sig
nificant changes in Hell Week pro
cedures. The Delta Chi, Phi Kap, SAE,
and Theta Delt Hell Weeks all centered
around a pledge project. Many house
presidents reported attempts to make
the program more justifiable to
pledges.
The general purpose of the "pledge
training" programs are to "integrate"
the pledge class and build "pledge class
unity." ATO called it a "leveling pro
cess" and the Alpha Delts, an attempt
to "physically break down a pledge
so he has to give in to the group." The
Chi Psi's follow their national program
because it has "some sort of meaning
for the Chi Psi's across the nation."
Even in houses which have technic
ally eliminated a Hell Week which
exists as a serious physical and mental
obstacle course, there is a series of
prescribed activities which are often
annoying or embarrasing and certain
ly non-educational.
Since such activities do exist, the
Dean's office role in relation to them
is one which must be examined. This
fall, Dean Gordon said "Stanford Uni
versity does not condone 'hazing' in
any form. Any individuals or groups
violating the state law are subject to
serious disciplinary action." However,
he also emphasized the Dean's office
intention to avoid "policing" and said
that there was really no apparatus for
gathering information of this nature.
On the other hand, every fraternity
does have a Resident Assistant chosen
by the Dean's office, on its paid staff
and responsible to it. Perhaps these
persons could be utilized.
Since there is no formal system by
which the Dean's office obtains informa
tion, they have to rely upon what they
accidentally, rim across,, or that which is

brought directly to their attention. The
incidents upon which they act, then,
would tend strongly to be those in which
some sort of crisis was already precipi
tated. The present information gather
ing mechanism is not geared primarily
to preventing crises, but rather to mak
ing what changes are possible after the
damage has been done.
In short, the gross negligence in haz
ing which resulted in some of the trage
dies of the 1950's and early 60's can
probably be avoided, but the subtler
forms of hazing (which won't generally
result in serious physical injury, but are
equally proscribed by California State
law) will seldom be brought to the atten
tion of the Dean's office. Indeed, from
the statements of house presidents, it
seems that there is much going on that
has either escaped the attention of the
Dean's office, or has been ignored.
Faculty Contact
Another force besides the Dean's of
fice which might help to change frater
nities Is increased or extended faculty
contact. There is at present no wide
spread contact or associate program.
When asked about whether faculty ad
visors knew of the Hell Week program,
72% replied that their faculty advisor
wasn't aware of what went on in their
Hell Week program. Seven houses re
plied that they had no faculty advisor
and though not specifically asked, oth
ers volunteered that their contact with
a faculty advisor was weak. The fact
that only four seem to have known
about Hell Week (the spirit of which
isn't difficult to hide) suggests that wide
spread and prolonged faculty contact is
practically nonexistent. Several houses
mentioned that they do have professors
for dinner and even hold a lecture series
or special faculty cocktail hours — for
which nonattendance in at least one case
is fined. The fault for this situation does
not rest entirely upon the shoulders of
the fraternity. In many cases, though
the house goes to some effort to make
arrangements, professors are simply
non-cooperative, claiming they have too
much work or just failing to associate
regularly. The most hopeful innovation
along these lines is the Lambda Nu pro
gram, which has extended an invitation
to faculty and administrators to live in
the house for up to three days in a guest
in-residence program. It wiil be interest
ing to see how well this attempt is re
ceived and utilized by faculty and ad
ministration. The shoe is sometimes on
the other foot also, as when Prof. Moth
ershead complains the only person who
bothers to speak to him at a meal is the
student who extended the invitation.
Rush
In general, rush criteria emphasize
congeniality and probably mirror a deep
er lack of surety of direction within the
house. With a few exceptions, notably
those houses which attempt to gather
athletes, houses tend to assume that
most people would be acceptable except
for certain objectionable personality
traits, etc. Those houses which attempt
to use positive criteria often find them
superficial or unmanageable. The con
tinuation of the ding system emphasizes
that negative rather than positive selec
tion seems to predominate in the rush
system.
If a house wishes to begin and sus
tain momentum in a given direction,
those aims would be better insured by
choosing with positive criteria, rather
than negative. Then the diversity which
is a constantly recurrent theme in the
rushing rhetoric could be insured, ra
ther than either weeded out or artificial
ly defined.
Selection
The effect of the present selection sys
tem is very nearly a random distribu
tion of talents, interests and personali
ties by a non-random method which can
inflict psychological scars on many
freshmen.
Take, for example, the rush in those
ten or more houses with 100 plus visitors
at each open house. The three hour pe
riod would allow a single housp member
1.8 minutes or less per rushee if he wore
to meet each one. Generously assuming
that the rushoe showed up at every open
house and only visited one fraternity
during this period, a house member
could expect approximately eleven min
utes of a formal cocktail-type situation
in which to make a character assessment
and decide how well an individual ful
filled the given rush "criteria." One
might wonder how effectively a house
can screen all the rushees for prospec
tive pledges given the conditions under
which rush has been conducted.
, The new rush, policy .tends to, mitigate

some of the problems of rush by extend
ing contact and by allowing both fresh
men and fraternities to develop more
meaningful criteria for selection. This
increment of increased contact may also
prove insufficient, and one should not
overlook the possibility that within the
framework dictated by academic and
practical demands, "sufficient" contact
may be impractical.
Pledge Training
Nearly all houses stressed the useful
ness of Hell Week in building "pledge
class unity" and in "helping the pledges
to get to know one another." Integra
tion of the new members into the house
and creating a sense of achievement
among the pledges are generally, though
not always, secondary. Constructive
house improvements are more a means
toward these other ends than ends in
themselves. In the last few years, a cou
ple of houses have begun to realize that
"getting to know each other" is not best
accomplished through common suffer
ing. Enforced calisthenics, rigid submis
sion to authoritarian structures, and the
elimination of individual responses rare
ly serve interpersonal communication.
The idea that physical exercise and
constructive work, even though worthy
activities in themselves, lead to meaning
ful and productive human relationships
is little more than a rationalization for
both the best and the worst in Hell
Weeks. This attitude exemplifies the su
perficial understanding of human con
tact which characterizes the fraternities'
emphasis on physcial rather than men
tal or verbal activity. Certainly getting
to know some one well involves more
an understanding of how the other per
son thinks, feels, and believes, than an
appreciation of his physical prowess and
endurance.
The fraternities' concept of brother
hood, a natural extension of "pledge
class unity," contributes to the phenom
enon of tolerance of each others' actions,
no matter how outrageous or immoral.
True "brotherhood," if it means any
thing at all, means the development of
a willingness to learn from each other,
to argue and discuss, always with sym
pathy. It does not mean blind acceptance
of the other person simply because he is
your brother. The argument is not that
real interpersonal communication does
not occur. They do, as they do in all hu
man societies. But the means that fra
ternities use to achieve these ends con
tradict the ends themselves. Profound
relationships develop in spite of, rather
than because of Hell Week and rush.
Change in Fraternities
The minutes from the IFC hostel this
fall state "Fraternities have been chal
lenged from without. They should have
been challenged from within." Implicit
in this statement is the IFC's recogni
tion that fraternities haven't been re
forming themselves.
Presently, in many houses there are
large minorities of both recent pledges
and old actives who are pushing for
change both in membership voting pro
cedure and over reform of present Hell
Week practices. For example, the Phi
Kap pledge training committee was con
sciously composed of three "hawk s"
and three "doves." Thr DU's, whose pres
ident admitted to a "Hell Week" which
was injurious, degrading or disgraceful,
has what the president called a 60/40
split on whether to continue it next year.
Most frequently the reason for chang
ing the old traditional practices (to the
degree that they really have been
changed) is a pledge class "revolt" or
dissatisfaction. Within the houses them
selves, the new pledges seem to be the
forces for change and innovation.
It seems that one of the most effective
and beneficial ways for the fraternities
to police their own Hell Weeks would be
through the IFC. This has not been done
In the past, and every house said that
their pledge training was in no way af
fected by IFC policy.
It should be noted, however, that the
IFC has instituted quiet hours in fra
ternity areas on week-ends in response
to complaints of excessive noise by local
residents. Complaints are now directed
to the IFC president rather than the po
lice.
Despite the work of an exceptionally
creative IFC steering committee this
year, and continuing efforts by vocal mi
norities in individual fraternities, the
educative improvements In the Stanford
fraternities appear to be the result of
general community pressure rather
than the IFC pulling any houses up by
their boot straps.
Some Conclusions and Proposals
; On.thff basis .0/ Uie con
tained in this report, three areas of con
cern can be established: (1) the relation
ship of the fraternity to the Stanford
educational process; (2) the extent and
kind of reciprocity involved between the
rushee and the fraternity and between
the pledge and his house; (3) the preva
lent and intentional indignities charac
teristic of some fraternities. In this last
regard, the Deke house, the Phi D e 11
house, and the Fiji house may be singled
out for special consideration. The DU
house may also be needful of particular
review.
However, in view of the concurrence
of all administrators and faculty inter
viewed, no fraternity can be exempt
from energetic investigation and change.
It is clear that the IFC has failed to
provide more than superficial help in
these matters. Intra-house committees
have, except in a few cases, been of no
avail.
Therefore, it behooves the University
and the University community to inter
vene.
It is clear that the fraternity as it
now exists, and as it has existed tradi
tionally, is opposed in action (and often
in spirit) to the education of its mem
bers. In dividing the life of the student
member as it has, it has not only sepa
rated entertainment and education, but
rendered them combatants.

Institutional rebellion against educa
tion per se is not to be tolerated at a uni
versity such as Stanford.
It has become clear that the Univer
sity has remained passive to the condi
tion of the fraternity, excepting its phy
sical plant, in all cases but those produc
ing scandal.
The educational influence of the fra
ternity is now seen to be nonexistant
in the most precise meaning of that
term.
It is now konwn that the rushee is
thoroughly disadvantaged by the rush
process and that the persistent claims
of reciprocity and mutual choice are
phantasmagoric; the rush process, as it
is now constituted, is unworthy of this
University and of the students who come
here hopeful of a decent, informative
and productive university life.
The Hell Week procedures are known
in many cases to be injurious to the body
and degrading to the person. In some
cases they are unlawful. The University
cannot allow any such procedures to
continue.
In light of these remarks, the follow
ing proposals are respectfully submit
ted:
A. Immediate investigation by the Of
fice of the Dean into all Hell Week pro
cedures. In such cases where the Office
of the Dean'is unable or unwilling to act,

it is advised that the District Attorney
of the County of Santa Clara be in
formed of current situations and his in
vestigative and prosecutive assistance be
enlisted. Needless to say, it is hoped
that in no case will county judicial in
tervention be needed. It is also asked
that the result of all investigations be
made public through regular and effi
cient channels of communication.
R. That the fraternities submit notor
ized affidavits explaining their proced
ure during the last Hell/Help Week.
These affidavits shall be public and
available before the beginning of Win
ter Quarter Dead Week.
C. It is asked that the IFC arrange
the following rxperiment: that in no
less than eight of Ihe current fraterni
ties' houses, twenty-five per cent (25%)
of the pledge spaces available be given
under a draw. These houses may not in
clude Beta Chi; in such cases where
there are insufficient volunteers, the
needed amount be determined by a ran
dom method.
D. It is asked that a Faculty Review
Board be established this year (which
may include administrators, students,
and student organizations such as the
