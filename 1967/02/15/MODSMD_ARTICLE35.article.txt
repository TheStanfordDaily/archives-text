# Report Of The Fraternity Subcommittee
## 
### 
This report is submitted in conjunc
tion with the general study of the
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission on resi
dence living at Stanford University.
This part of the broader study concerns
itself with the fraternity system and its
components, especially within the past
three years.
The need for such a study has long
been clear. In the past, the fraternity
has attracted attention only through its
troubles, and that attention has been en
tirely practical in intention. With the
exception of the Inter-fraternity Coun
cil's revision of rush procedure, the im
provement of the fraternity has been
1-ft co the exigencies of the moment;
the possibility of radical change at the
fraternity has been, on the whole, ig
nored. Granting that a university need
not rely solely upon the effects of age,
the necessity for an evaluative study is
all but obvious.
This report, therefore, attempts to be
both informative and evaluative, mind
ful of the University's renewing interest
in its own betterment.
It need hardly be argued, however,
that there are limitations to both the
scope and accuracy of any study of resi
dence living. In general, many of the
most important aspects of a student's
life are beyond the scope of any formal
approach, even with the most extrava
gent expenditures of time, funds, and
effort.
In the face of that fact, then, this sub
committee on fraternity life has been
modest in its goals. It has consistently
concentrated upon the formal contribu
tions and demands of a fraternity which
the fraternity itself sees as important.
Without seeking the inappropriate
end of establishing a standard for the
fraternity, certain assumptions were
prerequisite. Since the Housing Commis
sion desired to be comparative in con
tent, it was important to decide what,
in fact, distinguishes the fraternity
from other residence alternatives, tried
and untried. We feel the major distinc
tion from most houses is the rush pro
cess and the traditional Hell/Help Week.

Small group living, financial indepen
dence, charter constitution, and so forth,
are all qualities which any living system
might enjoy. Therefore, in this report,
rush and Hell Week are emphasized.
Were, however, we merely to considv r
those two processes, we should be most
incomplete. Many of the situations at
the fraternities have their sources in
such activities; and in our effort to pre
sent as full an understanding as pos
sible, we have included what some might
call details.
This report in no sense sees itself as
definitive, but rather as suggestive;
with that qualification, it is respectfully
submitted.
The information for this report was
obtained Fall Quarter, 1966, from the
following general sources:
—interviews with house representa
tives
—Dean's Office
—individuals of the house (includ
ing inactives)
—general administrative staff
In most cas->s information was twice
checked, except when of a statistical
nature. Dubious data was not included
unless it was rechecked and found cer
tain beyond all question.
This report contains no information,
remarks, or allusions to the Delta Tau
Delta, or the Zeta Psi fraternities,
purely because of circumstances beyond
the subcommittee's control.
The information presented falls un
der four categories:
1. House functions or activities
2. House obligations
3. House rush method
4. House Hell Week/Help Week struc
ture.
Occasionally, information was gath
ered of a more general character. Such
information has been introduced at an
appropriate point. We have distin
guished our evaluative remarks from
our factual remarks in the interests
of clarity and directness.
House Functions and Activities
With the exception of faculty cock*
tail parties and after dinner discussions

at a few houses, and in three cases,
the teaching of class at a house (Phi
Sig, ATO, and Beta Chi), there are
no organized activities with explicite
educational purpose. In all cases the
fraternity felt academics was an indi
vidual matter. Many houses recognize
their educational responsibility through
encouragement of a high grade point
average. Scholarships or awards are
given for such in the Chi Psi house
(largest amount), the Phi Sigs, the
KA's, the SAE's, and the ATO's (the
ATO house awards liquor). Many
houses have study tables and quiet
hours. However, the houses usually
look to the individual for academic and
educational arrangements.
The important house traditions
varied. The Phi Delts, Phi Sigs, Phi
Psis emphasized parties; the Phi Delts,
the Lambda Nus, the TTieta Delts em
phasized pinning songs; the Theta
Chis give showers on a member's
twenty-first birthday, while the ATO's
and the Chi Psi's provide for liquor
on the same occasion. The Fijis men
tioned Con Home benefits. The Dekes
reported a book drive; the Fijis also
reported "living together"; DU's in
clude parties, intramurals, and sym
phony tickets as house traditions. The
Theta Chis listed parties, intramurals,
faculty cocktail parties, and the water
melon stomp as particularly tradition
al. No house reported any educational
or academic traditions. The Delta Chis
mentioned the "house mouse," an in
dividual given special tasks for a week,
and practical jokes were listed by the
SAEs. The Theta Delts, Phi Kaps, and
Dekes described their current situation
as "transitional."
Ilouse Obligations
Except in unusual circumstances, the
rush functions were mandatory, and
in all cases pledge participation in
Hell/Help Week was mandatory, except
for strong reasons. In all houses a fine
system was organized, generally rang
ing from 75 cents to $5.00, but up to
$20.00 for Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi.
Fines were usually applied for absence

at house meetings, failure to perform
house work (generally a sophomore
responsibility), or absence from Pledge
Week and rush activities. In all cases
the social assessment, initiation fee,
and /or rush fees were mandatory.
Bush Procedure
The general format of rush is de
termined by the ad hoc Rush Commit
tee; it sets number of meetings, dates
of meetings, number of parties, bidding
procedure, and finally pledging pro
cedure. Within these regulations, how
ever, there is an amount of latitude.
The method of pledge selection is de
sided wholly by the house-
The mechanics of rush are difficult
to specify. Of particular importance,
however, is the number of rushees dur
ing an evening of an open house: Phi
Gamma Delta, Theta Chi, Phi Sig,
Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig, Delta Chi
all had 50 per; Lambda Nu and SAE
had over 200 per; the Dekes 25-30; the
remaining houses usually had about
100.
In order for an individual to receive
a bid, he requires unanimous approval
at the Phi Gamma Delta House, at
Theta Chi, at SAE, at Kappa Alpha,
at Phi Sig, at the Dekes and at ATO.
With the exception of Theta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi, the other
houses had a two or three "ding" sys
tem. Most house presidents did de
emphasize the importance of the ding
system. Theta Chi accepts a member
if 2/3 of house voting approve him,
and those voting constitute more than
50 per cent of the house. The Lambda
Nus have eliminated the ding system
and pledges are bid in descending or
der on a positive vote scale whereby
each member has ten votes which he
may allot to each of ten rushees. Beta
Chi has instituted a draw system.
The criteria for acceptance at a fra
ternity vary: all emphasized social
ease; the Phi Delts wouldn't bid a
"quiet guy," the Dekes want a "gentle
man," th<? Kappa Sigs want "person
ality," while thr Sigma Chis want an
