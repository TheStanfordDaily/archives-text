# Report Of The Stern Subcommittee
## 
### 
The A.S.S.U. Housing Commission
subcommittee on women's housing has
compiled its report from the individual
research of committee members, but
above all with the aid of the survey con
ducted by Dean Bushnell this past fall.
We have found the results of this sur
vey extremely valuable — due to the
careful thought given to the preparation
of the questionnaire form. The hieh per
centage of returned questionnaires (ap
proximately 70%) also contributed to
the quality of the results.
1. Education and Residence —
Women's Housing
Diversity within individual living
groups, necessary for the optimal edu
cational atmosphere, exists to a greater
degree in women's residences (with the
exceptions of Branner and Roble where
freshmen are segregated from the rest
of the community) than in men's resi
dences, as a direct result of the draw
system. Because this is so, the women's
subcommittee finds that while the edu
cational aspect of the system might be
greatly improved, the situation is not
so gravely in need of change as the
men's system. Dean Bushnell's poll con
cluded that of fourteen specific goals
for University residences ranging from
physical facilities to academic atmo
sphere, the highest percentage of wom
en (31.38 per cent) considered "an in
tellectual atmosphere conducive to high
scholastic interest and achievement"
most important. (The second highest
category was "The opportunity for each
student to choose the group with which
he/she will associate within the limits

of practical necessities" with 22.78 per
cent. The other fifty per cent scattered
among many categories.) We find the
womnn to be deeply concerned with the
problem of the dichotomy between their
personal lives and the questions that
are raised in the classroom and lecture
hall. If education is to be meaningful
we must work to end this dichotomy.
Significantly, 74.48 pr>r cent of the wom
en polled in Dean Bushnell's survey felt
that the Stanford residence experience
"realized" the stated goal of an "intellec
tual atmosphere..." only "to some ex
tent" or "hardly at all" (44.29 per cent
in the first category, 30.19 per cent in the
second). The women were also deeply
concerned about their living situation
as related to the total university experi
ence. 83.2 per cent replied that they felt
this relation to be "extremely impor
tant" or "quite important", and 84.42
per cent indicated that they felt "it mat
ters a greal deal" and "quite a bit" what
the University does in the way of hous
ing programs and residence policies for
undergraduate women.
The women's subcommittee finds the
Report of the Subcommittee to Study
Student Life at Amherst College especi
ally relevant to our residence problems
at Stanford. In that report the authors
wrote, "A moment of educational com
munication between a student and a
book, a painting, a teacher, a course, an
idea, a fellow student, or any new experi
ence occurs at least as often by accident
as by design. We have tried to imagine
a college where such accidental en
counters could occur more frequently
and more freely than they do at the

present time — a college in which, as
far as possible, present limitations dis
couraging such encounters would be re
duced. If a moment of education cannot
be caused, the possibility of it occurring
can be encouraged and promoted."
These words can be applied without al
teration to the residence system at Stan
ford, the woman's residences in particu
lar. In the years ahead we must strive
to create a residence where these "acci
dental moments of education are en
couraged and promoted".
The women's subcommittee advocates
an end to the policy of segregated fresh
man women's residences, and supports
the proposed coed, integrated experi
ment for Wilbur Hall next year, as two
means of combatting the problem of an
atmosphere within the residence that is
stifling to educational programs. At the
risk of abbreviating its report (but more
important, in the interest of not repeat
ing arguments heretofore enumerated)
the subcommittee refers consideration
of thr> proposed experiment in Wilbur,
and the question of segregated versus
integrated freshman housing, to the re
port of the freshman year suboommitte •.
We find these two issues treated fully
in that report and concur in the argu
ments advanced in favor of integrated
and coed housing. Dean Bushnell's poll
indicated that a large number of wom
en are in favor of coed housing (and
also student co-operatives and on-cam
pus apartments such as Hoskins House)
as an alternative to the present choice
of on-campus residences for women.
The women's subcommittee points to
the Overseas Campuses and to the Grove

House as examples of successful coedu
cational (or "co-habitated" houses, as
the administration uses the term) ex
periments at Stanford, and believes that
coed housing would help to create the
intellertual atmosphere in the residence
desired bv virtually all women.
2. The Question of the
OfT Campus Alternative
The women's subcommittee favors an
alternative of off-campus living for all
women except freshmen. We do not.
however, feel that the issue is as simple
as the leaders of the OFF movement
have presented it.
We feel that all segments of the uni
versity community, men and women to
gether, should combine to work toward
th n achievement of a residence univer
sity that would offer so great a stimula
tion to the education of its students that
each student would want to live on the
campus. We find ourselves emphatically
in support of the concept of the residence
university. Yet we find the administra
tion lackadaisical at best in support of
this ideal. Our conception of the ideal
residence university is one where men
and women are both granted the privi
lege to live off campus, yet through the
attraction of the residence system, each
student desires to live on the campus.
But students must be free to make their
choice, rather than being coerced into
it.
