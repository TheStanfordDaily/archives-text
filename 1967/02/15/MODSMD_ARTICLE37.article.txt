# Report Of The Stern Subcommittee
## 
### 
The co-chairman of the Housing Com
mission have taken the prerogative of
editing the Report of the Stern subcom
mittee in order to present cogently and
suecintly the findings of the committee
and to avoid repetition of facts, criti
cisms, and arguments presented in
other sections of the Housing Report.
The basic aim of the Stern subcom
mittee, common to all the Housing Com
mission subcommittees, is to look at
their residences in terms of education,
formulate criticisms, and state propos
als to make Stern a better residence in
terms of education. The idea of educa
tion as a change within the mind, pos
sible only in confronting different and
challenging circumstances, forms the
basis upon which the Stern subcommit
tee has made four considerations about
residential living. These considerations
are 1) social improvement, 2) academic
improvement, 3) physical improvement,
and 4) recommendations concerning
housing proposals.
I. Social Improvement
A. Crucial to the stimulation of intel
lectual interest and an atmosphere of
learning is diversity â€” the presentation
of different and challenging circum
stances, people, and points of view. To

insure vitality and inter-action of ideas,
opinions, and temperaments, Stern
should be integrated with full freshman
representation, graduate students, and
women. In order to provide continuity
in a single hou< , no more than 30 per
cent of a Stern house should be fresh
men.
B. This diversity would directly ad
dress two of Stern's perennial prob
lems, the tendency of upperclassmen to
move off campus and the "turkey" im
age. Coed housing should be attractive
enough to keep upperclassmen in Stern,
and, by definition, would dispel the "tur
key" image (anti-social "booker").
C. These changes should be made be
fore the Moore houses open. This would
guard against two trends, namely, that
men make mass exoduses out of Stern
for the more attractive Moore complex,
and that Stern's "turkey" image will be
more difficult to eliminate once the first
trend starts.
D. Residences should be built by the
University to provide for faculty resi
dents near the four houses without
them.
11. Academic Improvement
A. Classes should continue to be held
in the Stern houses.

B. The advising program proposed by
John Luzan in 1966 should be imple
mented. This program consists of assign
ing an overall faculty advisor, both to
counsel the upper-class advisors and to
advise their freshman advisees. Ideally
these faculty advisors should be 1) out
standing advisors committed in all prob
ability to advising for two consecutive
years and 2) attached to the houses
through the faculty associate program.
111. Physical Improvements
A. More single rooms, four-man
suites, and provision for some six man
suites would offer a greater and more
appealing variety of living possibilities
within Stern.
B. The organization of a Stern Im
provement Board would provide a chan
nel for student suggestions about im
provements and approval of proposed
changes.
C. The institution of a coffee house
along the lines of the Jester in Wilbur.
D. Stern is large enough to merit the
investment of tools for a workshop
where students could make room im
provements or simply enjoy the arts of
wood-working, sculpting, and painting.
IV. General Recommendations
A. The University should make spe

cial provision for transfer men to live
on campus if they wish to.
B. The Stern subcommittee supports
the right of women to live off campus.
The subcommittee also recommends
that the Board of Trustees give serious
consideration to increasing the number
of undergraduate women at Stanford
with the long range goal of equalizing
the ratio of men to women.
C. Finally, the Stern subcommittee
urges the University to continue Hos
kins as a residence for undergraduate
women and to establish further apart
ment facilities and co-operative living
units on campus.
The subcommittee enthusiastically
supports the Wilbur coed integrated pro
posal for next year, and asks that its
recommendation be considered in the
light of that proposal. Hence, if the pro
posal is accepted, our recommendations
should be applied to residences for up
perclassmen, i.e., the present women's
row houses.
