'"there's been a contrived lack of
confidence regarding the issue of selec
tion of students for the Packer Com
mittee," said Dean of Students Joel
Smith, speaking last night at Donner
in Stern.
Talking on "Student Participation
in the Decision-Making Process,"
Smith added that he "can't see how
LASSU certification would improve
the responsiveness of committee mem
bers" unless they were held formally
responsible to report on the commit
tee's progress to LASSU.
"It's fundamentally wrong for
LASSU to certify the members,"
Smith said, but he added that it's a
"complicated issue."
Explaining that the committee's job
is to make an intensive review and
formulate recommendation, he added
that to have LASSU certify members
of such a committee would be to "give
political implication that the repre
sentatives would be responsible to a
constituency. There is more to be ac
complished if the group can have
freedom to exercise judgment and not
feel the limitation of an obligation to
representation," he said.
In regard to student participation in
the decisionmaking process in gen
eral, Smith said that there are "cer
tain areas" where students have a
definite part, such as areas of resi
dence policy and standards of per
sonal behavior.
"But there are certain areas where
student experience doesn't qualify
them to participate," he added. Some
of these areas are those of business
and financial decision and basic cur
riculum curriular decisions.
Smith indicated that students al
ways have the right to express an

opinion in regard to decisions in the
university, but that there is a distinct
difference between such expression
and actual participation in policy mak
ing-
"A voluntary student-organized
group might suggest that Stanford sell
the medical school to Palo Alto ... but
students would not be legally or moral
ly responsible to participate in a de
cision about the future of the medi
cal school," he said.
While some subjects are "off limits"
to student participation, Smith added
that if the categories of subjects were
clearly defined, there would be "less
recalcitrance in accepting student par
ticipation in the areas where it is legi
timate."
Regarding residence policies, Smith
commented that the "notion" of com
bining academic and residence facili
ties is appealing â€” but we must be
"realistic" about what's possible. He
said that any such program must be
carried out in a "systematic way" and
added that he wasn't impressed with
"occasional projects" which might de
velop.
Smith added that there was some
question as to whether students really
wanted such a residence situation.
"There seems to be a strong wish
among some to have a substantial part
of the faculty members in residence.
"But this is ideal. . .quixotic," There
is a trend of pressure on faculty mem
bers to assign high priority to a num
ber of other responsibilities," he said.
Smith further suggested "student
graduate and undergraduate students,
with the opportunity to develop "edu
cational rapport" without the aid of
faculty members. He cited "spontan
eous suspicion" of persons very much
older as a deterrent to student accep
tance of fuller faculty participation.
