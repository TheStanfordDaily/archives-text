# Stern And Women's Subcommittees Contribute To Criticism Of Housing
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
In their reports to the ASSU Hous
ing Commission, the subcommittees
on women's housing and Stern Hall
have expressed somewhat greater sat
isfaction with the present systems
jthan did those on fraternities and
freshman housing (see The Daily, Feb.
IB & 14). They did, however, call for
a number of improvements to be
made.
The Stern Committee concluded that
changes should be made to correct
two main problems — the "turkey"
'mage (of the "antisocial 'booker"')
And the tendency of upperclass men
to move off campus.
The report lists four areas requir
ing attention. For social improvement
the subcommittee proposed full inte
gration of the Stern Houses, bringing
in women and more freshmen. It also

proposed building houses for faculty
residents for the four houses that
don't have them.
For academic improvement the sub
committee recommended holding clas
ses in Stern and "assigning an over
all faculty advisor." Suggested physi
cal improvements include more single
rooms and four-man suites and pro
vision for some six-man suites; the
organization of a Stern Improvement
Board; the establishment of a coffee
house like the Jester in Wilbur Hall;
and a crafts workshop.
In addition the Stern subcommittee
supported the off-campus option for
women, more opportunities for trans
fer men to live on campus, more on
campus apartments for women (like
Hoskins House) and implementation
of the Wilbur Experiment for inte
grated, co-ed dormitories.

The women's housing subcommittee
also supported the off-campus option
for women (except freshmen) and the
Wilbur Experiment proposal. It also
concluded that diversity in women's
housing is now better implemented
than for men, due to the draw system.
The report on women's housing was
based in large measure on the results
of the recent survey of undergraduate
women by Assistant Dean of Students
Shirley Bushnell. The survey revealed
that many women favor co-ed housing
and on-campus apartments, and that
a majority wants the option to live
off campus.
The women's subcommittee found
that women are "deeply concerned
with the problem of the dichotomy be
tween their personal lives and the
questions that are raised in the class
room and lecture hall." The commit
tee's support of the Wilbur Experi
ment and the abolition of segregated
freshman housing come, the report
says, as an answer to these problems.

The guiding principles of the ASSU
Housing Commission, as set forth by
Chairmen John Trimbur and Jan Jaco
bi in a preface to the full report, are
a belief in the residence university as

an ideal and the conviction that their
commission should not attempt to map
out a total plan for a residence univer
sity.
Their feeling was that the residence
program at Stanford should be "so
exciting and challenging that each
student at Stanford would want to
live on campus — and that there might
be places for every student who would
wish to live on campus."
This would mean, they concede, a
greater financial commitment by the
University. But they insist the cost
would be worth it if, as stated in an
introduction to the report by Commis
sion members Jonathan Roise and
Michael Couzens, "Stanford residences
can realize the ideal of community and
enhance and profoundly intensify the
meaning of a Stanford education "
The report of the Housing Commis
sion was intended to answer the ques

fill the obligation of a residence sys
tem to educate the students who live
within it; in essence, is education be
ing carried from the lecture hall, the
seminar room, the library, to the resi
dence?" The Commission's conclusion

The guiding principles of the ASSU
Housing Commission, as set forth by
Chairmen John Trimbur and Jan Jaco
bi in a preface to the full report, are
a belief in the residence university as

an ideal and the conviction that their
commission should not attempt to map
out a total plan for a residence univer
sity.
Their feeling was that the residence
program at Stanford should be "so
exciting and challenging that each
student at Stanford would want to
live on campus — and that there might
be places for every student who would
wish to live on campus."
This would mean, they concede, a
greater financial commitment by the
University. But they insist the cost
would be worth it if, as stated in an
introduction to the report by Commis
sion members Jonathan Roise and
Michael Couzens, "Stanford residences
can realize the ideal of community and
enhance and profoundly intensify the
meaning of a Stanford education "
The report of the Housing Commis
sion was intended to answer the ques
tions: "does (the present system) ful
fill the obligation of a residence sys
tem to educate the students who live
within it; in essence, is education be
ing carried from the lecture hall, the
seminar room, the library, to the resi
dence?" The Commission's conclusion
was that, at Stanford, for the most
part it is not.
In their reports to the ASSU Hous
ing Commission, the subcommittees
on women's housing and Stern Hall
have expressed somewhat greater sat
isfaction with the present systems
jthan did those on fraternities and
freshman housing (see The Daily, Feb.
IB & 14). They did, however, call for
a number of improvements to be
made.
The Stern Committee concluded that
changes should be made to correct
two main problems — the "turkey"
'mage (of the "antisocial 'booker"')
And the tendency of upperclass men
to move off campus.
The report lists four areas requir
ing attention. For social improvement
the subcommittee proposed full inte
gration of the Stern Houses, bringing
in women and more freshmen. It also

proposed building houses for faculty
residents for the four houses that
don't have them.
For academic improvement the sub
committee recommended holding clas
ses in Stern and "assigning an over
all faculty advisor." Suggested physi
cal improvements include more single
rooms and four-man suites and pro
vision for some six-man suites; the
organization of a Stern Improvement
Board; the establishment of a coffee
house like the Jester in Wilbur Hall;
and a crafts workshop.
In addition the Stern subcommittee
supported the off-campus option for
women, more opportunities for trans
fer men to live on campus, more on
campus apartments for women (like
Hoskins House) and implementation
of the Wilbur Experiment for inte
grated, co-ed dormitories.

The women's housing subcommittee
also supported the off-campus option
for women (except freshmen) and the
Wilbur Experiment proposal. It also
concluded that diversity in women's
housing is now better implemented
than for men, due to the draw system.
The report on women's housing was
based in large measure on the results
of the recent survey of undergraduate
women by Assistant Dean of Students
Shirley Bushnell. The survey revealed
that many women favor co-ed housing
and on-campus apartments, and that
a majority wants the option to live
off campus.
The women's subcommittee found
that women are "deeply concerned
with the problem of the dichotomy be
tween their personal lives and the
questions that are raised in the class
room and lecture hall." The commit
tee's support of the Wilbur Experi
ment and the abolition of segregated
freshman housing come, the report
says, as an answer to these problems.
