# NSA Receives Aid From CIA; Spying Denied At Stanford
## 
### LINDSAY BLACKMAN 
Reports that the National Student
Association (NSA) has been in part
subsidized from the "early 1950'5"
until recently by the U.S. Central In
telligence Agency (CIA) were confirm
ed yesterday by the State Department.
Officials admitted privately that the
subsidy was initiated in 1952 and that
it had been approved at "high levels
of government."
Spokesmen explained that the pro
gram of secret aid was begun at a
time when Communist countries were
providing heavy financial support to
permit members of Communist youth

organizations to travel and participate
in international events, while Ameri
can student groups lacked such funds.
Stanford NSA coordinator Jerry
Massey, contacted yesterday, stated
that Stanford students connected with
NSA have not been involved in any
intelligence activity for the CIA. He
pledged that at any future time Stan
ford's NSA members "will not co
operate with any spying on the Stan
ford campus."
Massey believes that, at the time
NSA began to receive aid from the
CIA, student leaders in the NSA na
tional office were unaware that funds
were being contributed by the CIA.
Once the origin of these funds be
came known to NSA leaders, attempts
were made in planning budgets to eli
minate the CIA money.
Characterizing the goals of NSA as
"the promotion of world understand
ing and peace," Massey noted that it
would seem inconsistent for the CIA
to support NSA, which has frequently
opposed U.S. administration policy
statements. In recent years NSA has
condemned U.S. intervention in the
Dominican Republic, recommended ad
mission of Red China to the U.N.,
urged abolition of the House Commit
tee on Un-American Activities, and op
posed conscription and the war in
Vietnam.
Massey maintains that such posi
tions by the NSA demonstrate that
leadership in the group is not domi
nated by the CIA. NSA has recently
gained subsidies from over 40 foun
dations, a situation which makes funds
from the CIA more easily eliminated
from the NSA budget.
Ramparts Ad
Public disclosure of the funding ar
rangement between the CIA and NSA
was prompted by full-page ads by
Ramparts magazine published in yes
terday's Washington Post and New
York Times- The Ramparts ads pro
claimed that the March edition of the
magazine will contain an account of
"how the CIA has infiltrated and sub
verted the world of American student
leaders over the past 15 years" and
how "it used students to spy."
Massey professes respect for Ram
parts, believing that its positions on
issues is a valuable expression of op
position. He recommends that stu
dents read the Ramparts article for
themselves, before judging the issue.
He also hopes that students will not
make a negative prejudgment of NSA
on the basis of the subsidy program. .
NSA projects at Stanford include
a tutorial program at Ravenswood
High School and the development of
a student discount service.
