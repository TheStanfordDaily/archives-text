# Negro Group To Fill 'Leadership Vacuum'
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Twenty Negro students have formed
a new group, Interact, designed to
help Negroes at Stanford and East
Palo Alto.
Interact has two purposes, accord
ing to Ron Miller, a senior political
major, and one of the originators of
the group with Gene Washington, a
sophomore. First, the group will pro
vide Negro leaders with whom stu
dents at Ravenswood High School stu
dents can identify.
Miller said that both he and Wash
ington discovered the lack of leader
ship in the Ravenswood community
last December when Washington at
tended a banquet in East Palo Alto.
Washington saw that the students
were anxious to talk to a Negro who
was a college athlete, but that no ath
letes lived in East Palo Alto.
Formed In January
Washington and Miller discussed
the problem with other Negro students

at Stanford. The result was the forma
tion of Interact near the end of Janu
ary.
Neither of them had previously sus
pected that this problem existed. In
Miller's words, "Both of us are from
large cities where there are Negro
leaders who you can identify with in
the ghettos, but there are not too many
big people in Ravenswood."
Another of Interact's goals is great
er interaction between whites and Ne
groes on campus. "There are diffi
culties in adjustment for new stu
dents, and we plan to ease the ten
sion," Miller said.
99.9 Percent Negro
'The high school I went to in Oak
land was 99.9 percent Negro," Miller
said. "When I came to Stanford, it
was a shock to be surrounded by
whites instead of Negroes."
Interact's program to help Ravens
wood students will include fund rais
ing for a scholarship specifically for
the East Palo Alto area. The first

phase of the program will be the Com
mittee's appearance in Dinkelspiel Fri
day afternoon- The committee is a San
Francisco comedy group with spe
cializes in satirical skits.
Washington made all of the arrange
ments and the show will be Interact's
first public function.
Miller said that he hoped to make
a start toward the scholarship fund
through ticket sales for the Commit
tee appearance. Other events will be
scheduled throughout the year, he
said.
Community Improvement
Interact is specifically concerned
with community improvement and so
cial activities, not political action, ac
cording to Miller. It is not intended
to be a Black Power organization, and
white students are invited to join, he
said.
Miller said he did not know of any
other campus with a group like Inter
act. "Berkeley has a black union, San
Jose State has Negro fraternities, and

some Eastern universities have black
unions, but none of them have the
same purpose as Interact," he said.
"Understanding" is one of Miller's
specific goals, "It would be of tre
mendous value," he said, "and the
understanding is for both Negro and
white students."
Large Group Planned
The ideal situation for Interact
would be to have all 70 Negro students
as members, according to Miller. He
said that he hopes the group will be
come much larger.
Other activities planned for Inter
act will be the commemoration of
the second anniversary of the death of
Malcolm X. Malcolm X was gunned
down during a New York speech Feb
ruary 21, 1965.
An Interact dance at Ravenswood
High School is also scheduled for
March 4. It's purpose, according to
Miller, is to promote contact between
students of both Stanford and Ravens
wood.
