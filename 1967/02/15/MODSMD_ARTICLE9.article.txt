# Poli Science Consultation Now Available
## 
### 
Student advising is the main
feature of the recently created
Political Science Consultation
Program. The program was
created last quarter after num
erous students requested such a
service at one of LASSLJ's Com
mittee of Undergraduate Educa
tion meetings.
Two senior political science
majors, Barbara Dudley and Bob
Fellmeth, run the service. They
spend about two hours a week
giving advice in the office of
Professor .Richard A. Brody in
room 22J.
Started In Pre-Reg
Dudley stated that the pro
gram was most active during
pre-reg week and has already
given advice to more than 25
students. Both freshmen and
upperclassmen are coming at the
rate of 4 to 5 a week.
Freshmen usually want to
know why or why not they
should become political science
majors. To answer their ques
tions, the two tell them where
the study of political science will
lead and what will be studied in
political science classes-
Political Science Majors
Students who are already po
litical science majors usually
seek advice on how to get out of
or meet specific requirements.
They may also ask which
courses and professors would be
the best for them.
Dudley added that after such a
service was called for by the
students, three other depart
ments also have started similar
programs.
