C. Is the grading system satisfactory?
1. What do we expect grades to accomplish? Should there be a dif
ference at undergraduate and graduate levels? If so, how should
we handle grading in courses with enrollments from both levels?
2. Are the objectives of grading being achieved?
3. Is the present pass-fail system succeeding in its aim of broadening
student programs? Should it be expanded beyond present limits?
Should we inaugurate a pass-fail freshman year?
D. Is there a place at Stanford for educational television? Other inno
vations made possible by advancing technology?
E. Should some attempt be made to use personality tests, or statements
of preference toward teaching methods, in assigning students to
sections of large (especially freshman) courses?
V. OVERSEAS CAMPUSES AND PROGRAMS
A. Should Stanford be engaged in overseas academic operations?
B. How satisfactory is our present undergraduate overseas program?
1. Are campus facilities and locations adequate? Should we consider
centers in non-western areas—Latin America? Asia? Africa?
Would consortia with other universities be a good way to expand
our facilities?
2. Are course offerings satisfactory? Meaningful to all students?
Relevant to the location?
. Is the out-of-classroom program as it should be? Consistent with
the home campus policies, insofar as special local problems exist?
4. Should there be more special academic preparation for students
going overseas?
5. Is the sophomore year the best time for overseas study?
6. Should the program be expanded so that all who wish to go can
have the opportunity? Should it be limited to those most likely to
benefit?
C. Should we provide overseas graduate centers? Attach graduate stu
dents to present undergraduate centers?
VI. ADMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL AID
A. How well are we doing in selecting undergraduate students from
those applying?
1. Are selection methods as objective as possible? Should they be?
If some subjectivity is desirable or unavoidable, how can it best
be employed?
2. What are our selection criteria? Do they give proper attention to
creativity? Maturity? A heterogeneous student population?
3. Are admissions tests adequate and properly interpreted?
a. Is the freshman year CPA prediction an adequate formula? Do
we properly balance verbal-math results?
b. Should we explore the use of tests which measure personality
variables?
c. Should we demand well-developed writing ability of all appli
cants?
4. Do we make adequate use of advanced placements tests?
B. Why do some undergraduates drop out? Can the number be re
duced by revising admissions procedures?
C. Should we seek a more widely representative student body?
1. Should recruiting be directed toward broader national representa
tion at undergraduate and graduate levels?
2. Are we too conservative about attracting students from culturally
deprived populations? Students with special talents and interests?
D. Do our present financial aid policies adequately support whatever
objectives are agreed to in A-C above? Is it feasible or desirable
to rely less on grants and more on loans?
E. Is adequate control being exercised over graduate admissions? Are
there inequities or imbalances among schools and departments?
F. Is graduate financial aid equitably distributed? Should we seek
to subsidize fully the beginning of graduate work, with later support
to come from teaching or research appointments?
VII. ADVISING AND COUNSELLING
A. How can we best coordinate the several activities—advising, coun
selling, placement, health service—which are provided to aid and
guide students at Stanford? Are faculty and other persons who deal
with students sufficiently informed about student services and how
to use them?
B. How can advising be improved?
1. How can we improve in recruiting, briefing and assigning general
studies (and department) advisors? Should there be special com
pensation for advisers? Can we develop a notational system that
includes advising as part of the teaching load?
2. Should students play a greater part in advising?
a. Formally appointed student advisers, in and out of departments?
b. Graduate student advisers? Should all graduate students prepar
ing for academic careers be expected to do some advising?
c. Should there be a central information center to serve students
(and perhaps faculty as well) who are uncertain about details
of academic requirements, rights of petition, etc.?
C. How can we best help students plan the next steps in their careers?
1. Should the placement service add a career guidance program?
2. Should there be a central source of information and assistance on
graduate study?
D. How can we improve services intended to help students who have
personal, medical or psychological problems?
1. Should formal counselling be confined to a single center instead
of divided as at present?
2. What test data on students are being gathered, and are we making
full use of results?
3. How can we help students to obtain full advantage from coun
selling and medical services offered?
VIII. RESIDENCE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES
A. Should Stanford strive to be a residential campus for all undergrad
uates, or should off-campus living be considered a major alternative
to residence hall options?
1. Should on-campus residence be compulsoiy for any group?
2. If women are allowed the off-campus option, what, if any, age or
parental permission requirements should apply?
B. What changes should be made in the undergraduate residence pro
gram?
1. Should we continue the segregated freslunan year?
2. To what extent should "co-ed" arrangements be extended. How
should this relate to any future changes in the male-female ratio?
3. Should additional options (e.g., co-ops, apartments, international
house) be provided?
C. What kind of educational activities should be carried out in under
graduate residences?
1. Should "residential education" be an extension of formal academic
programs or simply the assurance of an intellectually stimulating
environment?
2. What management and facilities changes would enhance the de
sired program?
D.What organizational pattern would best fill student residence needs?
1. Should there be additional faculty residents? Faculty directors?
What is the role of RA's? Sponsors?
2. How can a meaningful faculty associate program be devised?
E. What is the approprite role of fraternities and eating clubs?
F. Are present board and room charges in line?
1. Is it possible to lower them by shifting upkeep tasks to students?
Other devices?
2. Should rent charges be uniform across the campus or varied in
accordance with the quality of facilities?
G. What changes are needed in graduate student residences?
1. Should we seek to provide additional campus residences for single
graduate students? Married students?
2. Is it desirable to provide residences which are exclusively for
students in a particular school or program?
3. Is there need for a graduate center? If so, what should it include?
IX. STUDENTS AND THE EXTRA CURRICULUM
A. What is the proper role and structure of student government?
1. Is it adequately representative?
2. Should it be more, or less, independent of the formal University
