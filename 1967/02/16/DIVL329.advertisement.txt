Engineering is a social science
To save itself from extinction, society
must transform itself into something radi
cally different than what we know today.
To do this, the social scientists discover
what human needs really are. But it's up to
technology to show us how to fill these needs.
The problems are many: food, air and
water pollution, mass transportation and
urban renewal. In these fields, as in defense
and space, McDonnell engineers are actively
concerned. They are working toward solu
tions. Are you?
Build a better future for your country and
yourself at McDonnell.
