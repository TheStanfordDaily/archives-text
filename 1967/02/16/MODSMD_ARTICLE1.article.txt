People who live on the Row and be
yond it will recognize the objects
pictured here, which used to be
beautiful trees. The men of the
ATO house called the Planning
Commission to find out why the
time wasn't taken to trim the small

lowed the greenery to grow back

the professionals

"Those who watch and those who
are watched" presented their views
of student representation and partici
pation in the decision making process
yesterday afternoon in a panel dis
cussion.
Discussing the selection of students
to the Steering (Packer) Committee,
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer said,
"Those carrying on this enterprise
have the final say on how that enter
prise is to be carried on."
He also said that while subcommit
tee positions on the study will be open
to "all interested parties" of the Stan
ford community, selection of subcom
mittee members will be made by the
Steering Committee itself.
Also participating in the discussion
were David Harris, ASSU president,
Robert Hind, Associate Dean of Un
dergraduate Education, Tom Forsten
zer, LASSU Speaker and Norton Bat
kin, Steering Committee appointee.
Prof. Ernest Hilgard moderated the
discussion.
Forstenzer pointed out that the re
search work of the study "would be
best served by guaranteeing partici
pation of individuals of varying roles
in the community. Objectivity is best
served by having groups choosing the
people that reflect their own con
cerns," he said.
Forstenzer added that there are
"other ways to guarantee objectivity
than preventing the selection of mem
bers by constituencies."
Advisory Committee
Packer explained that students will
have a chance to participate directly
with the formation of advisory com
mittees whose purpose it will be to
reflect the views of "particular con
stituencies" in regard to specific
Either the Steering Committee or
President Sterling will request Inter
est groups to select their own repre
sentatives to the committees.
"The study is bound up in one con
stituency — that of the administra
tion," said Harris. Various constitu
encies make up cultures within the
university... there should be a means

of representation which will allow
each to put forward its voice
... the student should choose whom
they think best to represent them,"
he said.
Packer explained that a "sense of
objectivity" was one of the prime
criteria used in selecting student
members of the Steering Committee.
He said that student members had
been chosen also for their "awareness
and concern of significant problems"
and "high degree of critical intelli
gence."
Harris also expressed concern that
the study might be a "dumping
ground" for many issues now bogged
down in other quarters. He cited as
an example the recent decision of
Committee of Fifteen to refer the
OFF issue to the Steering Committee
rather than considering it themselves.
"The Steering Committee is at
tempting to take on the entire breadth
of Stanford when it cannot reasonably
do that in the fashion it is now organ
ized," he said. He added that there are
some issues such as OFF which are
"issues of basic rights" rather than
just subjects of study.
Only A Study
"The Steering Committee is only
a study; it has no mandate to change
... and no power other than the per
suasiveness that its recommendations
appear to command," Packer .said
"The recommendations must then go
to whatever authority or agency has
the power to act."
He named the Academic Council,
the Board of Trustees and the Presi
dent as those authorities. In regard
to LASSU or student approval of the
recommendations he said that the
"judgment" and opinions of such
groups would be considered.
Packer said he could not address
himself to the "abstract question of
whether we are seeking the judgment
or the approval of LASSU." He ex
plained that the committee would
take its recommendations to LASSU
and to the faculty to "find out wheth
er we are on the right track." The
recommendations would then go to
President Sterling for final decision
or referral to the Board of Trustees.

Packer explained that students will
have a chance to participate directly
with the formation of advisory com
mittees whose purpose it will be to
reflect the views of "particular con
stituencies" in regard to specific
Either the Steering Committee or
President Sterling will request Inter
est groups to select their own repre
sentatives to the committees.
"The study is bound up in one con
stituency — that of the administra
tion," said Harris. Various constitu
encies make up cultures within the
university... there should be a means

of representation which will allow
each to put forward its voice
... the student should choose whom
they think best to represent them,"
he said.
Packer explained that a "sense of
objectivity" was one of the prime
criteria used in selecting student
members of the Steering Committee.
He said that student members had
been chosen also for their "awareness
and concern of significant problems"
and "high degree of critical intelli
gence."
Harris also expressed concern that
the study might be a "dumping
ground" for many issues now bogged
down in other quarters. He cited as
an example the recent decision of
Committee of Fifteen to refer the
OFF issue to the Steering Committee
rather than considering it themselves.
"The Steering Committee is at
tempting to take on the entire breadth
of Stanford when it cannot reasonably
do that in the fashion it is now organ
ized," he said. He added that there are
some issues such as OFF which are
"issues of basic rights" rather than
just subjects of study.
Only A Study
"The Steering Committee is only
a study; it has no mandate to change
... and no power other than the per
suasiveness that its recommendations
appear to command," Packer .said
"The recommendations must then go
to whatever authority or agency has
the power to act."
He named the Academic Council,
the Board of Trustees and the Presi
dent as those authorities. In regard
to LASSU or student approval of the
recommendations he said that the
"judgment" and opinions of such
groups would be considered.
Packer said he could not address
himself to the "abstract question of
whether we are seeking the judgment
or the approval of LASSU." He ex
plained that the committee would
take its recommendations to LASSU
and to the faculty to "find out wheth
er we are on the right track." The
recommendations would then go to
President Sterling for final decision
or referral to the Board of Trustees.
