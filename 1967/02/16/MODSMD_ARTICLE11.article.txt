# Dollies, TA's Spoof System

### CICELY BATES 
Stanford English T.A.s lolling
about drunk at Branner Hall?
Tuesday night amid valentine
hearts, red lights, and hamburg
er, such an event almost occur
red. At the last moment how
ever, the T.A.s regained their
composure and persuaded Kim
Dunster to lead the Branner
Dollies in a skit showing the
true feelings of the frustrated
English T.A.s.
The play begins . . . Grod,
known In official circles as Al
bert J. Guerard is presiding over
an English orgy ... or rather
meeting. The main concern of
the group is the promotion of
creativity among the freshmen.
Robert (Weston) thinks the
problem can be solved by talk
ing to the freshmen themselves,
and Mark (Mirsky) likes the
idea provided the T.A.s talk to
the freshmen women. Lewd
laughter is heard from the play
ers (and from their audience
alter egos?) as they break into
song, first telling their problems,
"We must publish or perish"
and then giving a general out
line of Freshmen English, "your
virtue we'll shock".
Four slurping dollies come
clawing into the room in search

of food as the song ends and
freeze as Mark accuses them of
lacking originality and creativ
ity. In defense of such biting ac
cusations, the dollies answer
that they lack creativity because,
"our lives are a rat race, we
study â€” never think; social life
is one big frat race; on Satur
day's we drink."
It is evident that the T.A.s
are greatly moved by such a sad
situation but they are all heart
and charge onward to solve the
problem. Mark is the fastest
thinker and makes the brilliant
suggestion that a spontaneous
morality play is the answer. He
further reasons that nothing
has more morality than Christ
mas, so a Christmas pageant is
immediately begun.
Larry (Friedlander) sounds
the horns and Mary (Jack
Hawkes) and Joseph enter reli
giously on a motorcycle. A Bible
is slowly raised and in majestic
tones the Word is heard . . .
"In those days a decree went out
from Wally Sterling that all the
farm should be reviewed" . . .
As the decree is concluded an
angel appears praising Grod and
saying "Glory to Grod in the
highest, and at Stanford creati
vity among men."

With reverent, beaming faces,
the T.A.s gather around Mary as
she displays the savior, (one
newly born tape-recorder). With
innocence in their eyes (signi
fying that the players are once
more to be considered Branner
Dollies) they raise their voices
in praise . . . "Freshmen teach
ers all we hail. Creativity re
deemed. English now shall nev
er fail, with the birth of this
machine. Grod and Hawkes,
where will ye lead us? Shep
herds, give thy staff thy rules.
All the country wants and needs
us. Relevance to local schools."
