lor of Architecture degrees,
while nearly 1,986 were first
professional degrees or higher.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and
MIT are sending more and more
of their "sons" to Stanford, a
report by University Registrar
Harvey Hall shows.
All four of these prestigious
Eastern institutions now rank
among the top six outside sour
ces of Stanford graduate stu
dents. The University of Califor
nia at Berkeley and nearby San
Jose State College round out
the group.
Together, these six institutions
sent 978 graduates to Stanford,
about one-fifth of the total Uni
versity enrollment at this level.
The shares were Berkeley (274),
Harvard (172), MIT (156), San
Jose State (136), Yale (127), and
Princeton (113). The figures In
parentheses are number enroll
ed in 1963-66.
Other institutions among the
top 20 suppliers were Cornell
(103), Columbia (94), Washing
ton (94), Purdue (85), Michigan
(83), Northwestern (83), UCLA
(82), Illinois (82), Dartmouth
(80), San Francisco State (80),
Wisconsin (69), Caltech (65),
Colorado (60), and Minnesota
(59).

A total of 1,055 undergraduate
alumni of Stanford continued
their studies here at the gradu
ate level.
Other highlights from the reg
istrar's report for 1965-66:
* Public high school graduates
outnumber private school
graduates by a 3-to-l margin
among undergraduate stu
dents.
* Four out of five Stanford ent
ering freshmen completed their
graduate work four years lat
er, a rate about twice the na
tional average.
* Last year's graduate students
came from 508 different insti
tutions, while undergraduates
came from 930 different high
schools, junior colleges, and
universities.
* The University conferred a to
tal of 3,519 degrees, including
2,656 to men and 863 for wom
