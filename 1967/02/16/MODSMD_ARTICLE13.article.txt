# Rush: Lesson In Shallowness?
## 
### DOUG SORENSON 
There are those who would
-maintain that rush is not edu
cational. Not so. Freshmen: this
is a unique opportunity—where
else does the university offer
such a quick, thorough (and en
tertaining) demonstration of the
.shallowness of self-pretensions?
Don't miss the open houses.
Notice how enthusiastically you
are greeted at the door. Then
step aside and watch them wel
come the next five in line.
Listen to the conversations
going on around you. Notice the
questions they ask to "size you
up." Listen and decide what it
is they are interested in know
ing about you — which things
they consider important.
Imagine what they will single
out as your outstanding chara
cteristic in the ding session af
ter you've gone. Close your eyes
and listen to the conversation
again without seeing the sport
coats and ties.
No Faith
Two or three nights on the
row can be very educational in
deed — never again will you put
as much faith in grooming or
firm handshakes.
But suppose you've had a
rather insecure year anyway,
and your resistance is down
along with your sex life and
your GPA.
After all, in America young
men don't have much occasion
to be overtly flattered until they
become businessmen or teachers
and the sight of four campus
gods reverently holding out a
pledge pin and murmuring "We
want you, Irving," can look like
the best deal since you left your
mother.
"Great Guys"
But before you decide that the
"great guys" are all the reason
you need, spend a few minutes
considering the system itself —
a system you will not only live
with for three years but, by your
acceptance endorse and perpetu
ate.
What is a fraternity anyway?
Their distinguishing mark, the
IFC proudly points out, is selec
tivity; the small groups, the
parties, the food you can get
elsewhere.
"Selective living," we are told,

is more than a mechanism for
choosing membership, it is a
way of life. This is undoubtedly
correct.
Euphemisms
But, what kind of a way? Is
"selectivity" simply a facetious
euphemism for a form of insti
tuionalized paranoia?
A little reflection on the op
eration of the ding system itself
will reveal its true purpose and
function: it was never designed
to allow an active to "select"
potential brothers, but to pro
tect him from those he finds
distasteful.
In fact, he cannot select some
one he may like very much if
he is 'bonged' by a small minor
ity. The essence of the frater
nity, is merely the exclusion of
undesirables.
Choice
Is this what you would choose
as a "way of life?"
This exclusion of undesirables
is the sum total of the philoso
phical justification of the frater
nity. No less an authority than
Dean of Fraternities John Han
sen has told me that their virtue
lies in "building brotherhood:
the kind of feeling that develops
among soldiers, that makes a
man jump on a grenade to save
his buddies."
Is that the way you want to
live at a university? Can you
form no other relationships than
those bred upon a common fear,
a common enemy, a common re
jection of other individuals?

Then perhaps you should go
ahead and join. Those who have
no "I" must find themselves in
a "we" against a "they."
Fraternities, like iron lungs,
are not evil — some people need
them. But do you?
