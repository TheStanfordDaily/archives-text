# 'Interaction'
## Key To A Kingdom 
### KENT REED DOUGLASS 
To understand the question of
whether or not rush is worth
while one must clearly define
what one means by "rush."
Too often rush is seen as a
vast set of generalizations: it is
"the party" "the freshmen," "the
chouse." When one deals in terms
like these, it is simple to see
from where the criticism of rush
comes. It is in this atmosphere
of abstraction that the opponents
of the fraternity can rightly ac
cuse them of "the ding system,"
"the snow job," etc. In all cases
is looking at the framework of
rush.
I firmly believe there is some
thing worthwhile beneath the
framework. It is far removed
from the abstractions that are
so vulnerable to attack both from
within and without.
The essence of rush is per
sonal interaction, one man shar
ing ideas and thoughts with an
other. Anyone who attempts to
attack the value of this com
munication will have to do so
by clouding the issue with a
blanket a "framework" argu
ments.
The problem with rush as I
see it is that fraternities have
lost sight of the essence of
rush. In the dog battle for get
ting "the pledge class" (which

is always refered to in terms of
a large two digit number), inter
action becomes secondary to the
main goal of getting "the num
ber" The pressure is a real one.
It is unfortunate that the fra
ternity is forced to sacrifice the
one tool that makes rush mean
ingful in order to "beat out the
Sigma Delts."
It is for this very reason that
I propose the framework
changes: increased emphasis on
informal group meetings and ex
changes between freshmen and
fraternity men with a concur
rent deemphasis of open houses
and, more particularly, rush-end
parties.
Although the present system
is infinitely superior to that em
ployed at most universities
where freshmen are pledges be
fore they are enrolled, it needs
a little straightening out.
What is the purpose of de
ferred rush if the freshman is
not allowed to have contact with
the fraernity? Is the wishdom of
his advisor sufficient to guide
him? Are we simply not having
the rush of other universities
six months later?
Although the Wilbur exchange
programs are combatting this
there is something more needed.
The fraternity is still allowed to
hide behind a curtain of mys

tique, open only during certain
short hours every week. The
freshman may never know what
life in the fraternity is like.
I would propose opening con
tact between freshmen and fra
ternities at least two weeks be
fore any open houses or parties.
It is very difficult to imagine fra
ternities being able to generate
"the image" for that period of
time. Interaction possibilities
soar in such a "hang loose"
atmposhere.
Possibly in the near future
this would be extended to com
plete abolition of contact restric
tions. I have never understood
their value, except as protection
for those fraternities which al
ways seem to have so many
"friends" in Wilbur.
Essentially the fraternity must
strive for honesty in its relations
with each and every freshman.
As a class the freshmen get
smarter every year and more and
more individuals are able to un
derstand and thus resist pres
sure and "snow job" tactics.
Unless emphasis can be chan
neled away from a system that
fosters deceit, the dogs will be
fighting over sparse and very
mealy scraps.

To understand the question of
whether or not rush is worth
while one must clearly define
what one means by "rush."
Too often rush is seen as a
vast set of generalizations: it is
"the party" "the freshmen," "the
chouse." When one deals in terms
like these, it is simple to see
from where the criticism of rush
comes. It is in this atmosphere
of abstraction that the opponents
of the fraternity can rightly ac
cuse them of "the ding system,"
"the snow job," etc. In all cases
is looking at the framework of
rush.
I firmly believe there is some
thing worthwhile beneath the
framework. It is far removed
from the abstractions that are
so vulnerable to attack both from
within and without.
The essence of rush is per
sonal interaction, one man shar
ing ideas and thoughts with an
other. Anyone who attempts to
attack the value of this com
munication will have to do so
by clouding the issue with a
blanket a "framework" argu
ments.
The problem with rush as I
see it is that fraternities have
lost sight of the essence of
rush. In the dog battle for get
ting "the pledge class" (which

is always refered to in terms of
a large two digit number), inter
action becomes secondary to the
main goal of getting "the num
ber" The pressure is a real one.
It is unfortunate that the fra
ternity is forced to sacrifice the
one tool that makes rush mean
ingful in order to "beat out the
Sigma Delts."
It is for this very reason that
I propose the framework
changes: increased emphasis on
informal group meetings and ex
changes between freshmen and
fraternity men with a concur
rent deemphasis of open houses
and, more particularly, rush-end
parties.
Although the present system
is infinitely superior to that em
ployed at most universities
where freshmen are pledges be
fore they are enrolled, it needs
a little straightening out.
What is the purpose of de
ferred rush if the freshman is
not allowed to have contact with
the fraernity? Is the wishdom of
his advisor sufficient to guide
him? Are we simply not having
the rush of other universities
six months later?
Although the Wilbur exchange
programs are combatting this
there is something more needed.
The fraternity is still allowed to
hide behind a curtain of mys

tique, open only during certain
short hours every week. The
freshman may never know what
life in the fraternity is like.
I would propose opening con
tact between freshmen and fra
ternities at least two weeks be
fore any open houses or parties.
It is very difficult to imagine fra
ternities being able to generate
"the image" for that period of
time. Interaction possibilities
soar in such a "hang loose"
atmposhere.
Possibly in the near future
this would be extended to com
plete abolition of contact restric
tions. I have never understood
their value, except as protection
for those fraternities which al
ways seem to have so many
"friends" in Wilbur.
Essentially the fraternity must
strive for honesty in its relations
with each and every freshman.
As a class the freshmen get
smarter every year and more and
more individuals are able to un
derstand and thus resist pres
sure and "snow job" tactics.
Unless emphasis can be chan
neled away from a system that
fosters deceit, the dogs will be
fighting over sparse and very
mealy scraps.
