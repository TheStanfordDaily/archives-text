# Blackball Selectivity—Draw Now
## 
### ALAN CATHCART 
Rush is a topic of great de
bate at Stanford these days.
The arguments against the sys
tem as it now stands generally
fall into three groups, summar
ized as follows:
• The lack of sincerity, the
"phoniness" apparent on both
sides of the rush situation make
a mockery of the selective pro
cess by making honest and cor
rect decisions a matter of luck.
• The relatively short time
available to freshmen for exam
ining the numerous eating clubs

and fraternities also subtracts
from the efficiency of rush.
• The whole idea of "ins" and
"outs," dings and blackballs is
repugnant on purely moral
grounds.
Mechanics
The first two categories are
closely related and deal with
the mechanics of rush. The
third, however, is (perhaps) a
minority opinion which seems
to strike at the foundations of
the selective living principle. Be
cause it has to do with the
philosophy of rush around which

our mechanics must be con
structed, I will deal with this
complaint first.
The purpose of rush must be
to bring together rushees and
groups in the most harmonious
way posible; not in the sense of
eliminating disagreement, but at
least with the intention of mini
mizing discomfort.
Since fraternities and clubs
are relatively fixed quantities,
the problem reduces to that of
finding for the freshman a place
where he will be accepted and
will accept those around him.
It is my belief that selective liv
ing is the answer to this prob
lem.
With a properly conducted
rush, such a brutal and discrim
inatory regulatory instrument
as the ding would be as unnec
essary as it is distasteful. It
even subtracts from the efficien
cy of rush, since under a ding
system, the emphasis among
rushees is on supression of pos
sibly controversial personalities
and the masking of personal
traits to avoid giving offense.
Framework
Superficiality and deception are
imposed on the rushing system
by the framework of regulation
within which it operates. Be
cause the "hard sell" is the most
regulated part of rush, it is the
most emphasized.
Because rushees can meet
with us only at certain times,
and can't stay long, we and they
must both be on our best be
haviour at those times. Because
bidding is restricted and pres
sure discouraged, we feel com
pelled to push the legal limits
to get our bids out and get them
signed.
When bidding is abolished, the
University's rush regulations
must go also. In particular, open
houses, meal exchanges, even
parties should be unrestricted
in time and number. The second
in our list of grievances is per
haps the most crucial from a
mechanical standpoint.
Granted unlimited contact and
sufficient time for a considered
decision, the freshman should be
able rationally and successfully
to select his next year's living
group.
My proposal, then, is this:
first, abolish all university reg

ulations on rush, except those
designed to curtail high-pressur
ing of freshmen. Eliminate the
living group from the selection
process, and institute a draw
system based on individual pref
erences and randomly assigned
priorities.
Informal Open House
Fraternities and eating clubs
would conduct informal open
houses, probably beginning win
ter quarter, to discuss rush.
These should be frequent and
supplemented by activities such
as meal exchanges and semi
nars.

At any time a freshman would
be allowed to indicate a pref
erence for a particular living
group, although he would not be
allowed to enter into contracts
for food or housing before his
sophomore year, and his free
dom to change his affiliation
thereafter should be limited only
by such contracts.
Once these reforms are
achieved, I am confident that an
easier, more efficient and far
more equitable rush procedure
will be the result.
