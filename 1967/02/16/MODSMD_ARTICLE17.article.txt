# An Open Mind, An Open Hand

### STEVEN H. LEVINSON 
If someone were to ask the
question, "Six months at a for
eign campus—is it worth it?" he
would probably be sent off to En
cina Hall for counseling and test
ing. Yet this question is asked
of fraternity rush without bat
ting an eye.
I would not presume to specu
late about the motives of those
who ask the question, but I can

not help but be struck by its
forced nature. An overseas cam
pus could provide the basis for
a terribly rewarding experience,
or it could be a complete waste
of time.
Is it worth the trouble to take
the chance? Critics of the Pan
hans notwithstanding, I submit
that one benefits from any given
experience to the extent that he
cares to make the effort, provid
ing that the situation contains
the possibility for such bene
fit.
It seems to me that the same
can be said of fraternities and
rush. I would argue that rush
(which, you will excuse the blas
phemy, can actually be fun) is
very much worth the effort—
both for those who are interested
in fraternities and for those who
aren't afraid to keep an open
mind—simply because fraterni
ties can be stimulating and re
warding places to live.
Participate
A fraternity is a self-perpet
uating group of university stu
dents who have the opportunity
to live together and to partici
pate (to whatever degree they
wish) In a co-ordinated social,
cultural, and Intellectual pro
gram.
This is neither a surprising nor
revolutionary definition. A fra
ternity, as is true of any living
group, can make whatever it de
sires of its opportunities in these
areas.
It would seem reasonable to
say that fraternities tend to have
more extensive social calendars

that other living groups, and
freshmen should consider this
fact in terms of their own inter
est.
In any case, fraternities have
much more to offer than a form
alized social program. They fa
cilitate—in my opinion, to a
greater extent than other living
groups—the development of a
large number of close friend
ships; that is to say, one can
get to know more people more
easily.
Opportunity
They provide unusual oppor
tunities for self-government. And
they can even provide, contra
opionem omnium, the sort of aca
demic environment compatible
with the serious student.
Now, obviously, any living
group can do these things; the
point is that they do them in
different ways. I happen to en
joy the fraternities' style.
It is also obvious, although it
is usually overlooked, that any
given individual can make; a
complete flop of his experience
in any living group. Stern H&ll
or an off-campus apartment need
not be used as refuges from the
university, but they certainly
can be, and indeed are in many
cases.
Quite clearly, the responsibil
ity rests with the individual as to
what he will make of his oppor
tunities. By the same token, it
is up to the individual to decide
what sort of living group he
would like to choose.
I happen to like my fraterni
ty.
Self-Perpetuating
The self-perpetuating nature
of the fraternities seems to have
come under rather fashionable
attack these days. No one seems
bothered by the selective pow
ers of The Daily staff, or of the
football coach, or of the Wil
bur sponsors, or of the Univer
sity department of admissions.
No one seems concerned that
these groups cannot possibly con
duct selectivity according to ob
jective standards. But that's an
other story.
Fraternity living is an alterna
tive enjoyed by a substantial
percentage of Stanford's under
graduate men. We like it and
think it has a lot to offer. If
you think so too, then I trust
that you will find rush "worth
