# LASSU To Discuss Admissions Policy
## 
### 
Resolutions concerning dis
crimination in University admis
sions and publicity of judicial
council cases will be the main
items of business at tonight's
LASSU meeting.
Both bills were on last week's
agenda but were not discussed.
The meeting was adjourned
early because a quorum was
lacking.
An appropriation of $706.15
for the lIR Foreign Policy In
stitute will be reported back
from the finance committee.
Also, the committee to study

community government, ap
pointed a few weeks ago, will
give its first progress report.
Other committees, such as
those studying proposals to im
prove student access to the
Board of Trustees and to initiate
a plan for a permanent student
self-study, are presently prepar
ing reports, reported Legislature
Speaker Tom Forstenzer. These
reports will probably be present
ed next week.
Tonight's legislature meeting
will be held at 7:30 in room 320
in Geology Corner.
