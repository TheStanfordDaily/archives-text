## FDA Infiltrates Student Spies 
### MINDY MATHISON 
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration currently has about 200
agents working in various cities
to locate "illicit sources" of
mind-expanding drugs, accord
ing to Fred Garfield, deputy di
rector of the FDA's Bureau of
Drug Abuse Control, a bureau
established by Congress a year
ago this month to probe into
illegal drug traffic.
These FDA agents are posing
as college students on various
caihpuses to find out where LSD
and other drugs are obtained.
The agents are "young boys,
just out of school," Garfield said
and thus are able to pass for
students.
Trained In Berkeley
Some have been specially
trained at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley's School of
Criminology. There, the agents
study law, techniques of enforce
ment, criminology, drugs, physi
cal evidence, weapons training
and physical conditioning. (A
recent U.S. Senate report indi
cates the largest number of LSD
users at any school exists at
Berkeley. The report attributed
2500 LSD users to the Berke
ley campus.)
Although FDA officials claim
they are primarily interested in
finding illegitimate sources of
drug supply, rather than in find
ing individual users, they ad
mit to cooperating with local law
enforcement officials in geo
graphical areas where the pos
session of such drugs violates
the law.
Federal statute prohibits the
sale of LSD, but the possession

for individual use is not a crim
inal act. FDA's agents, however,
are authorized to use "executive
seizure" in confiscating LSD un
der the provisions of the Fed
eral Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Amendments of 1965.
Seizure is permissible because
LSD, lacking FDA approval, is
not in "legal distribution."
Ask Cooperation
Dr. James L. Goddard, food
and drug commissioner, in a let
ter sent to 200 college deans in
April, 1966, asked that "any in
stances of the illegal use or pos
session (of LSD or ampheta
mine) be reported at once to
the Food and Drug Administra
tion district office."
In response, some college ad
ministrators have taken indepen
dent action concerning student
drug users.
Haverford College president
Hugh Borton told students that
they faced possible suspension
for repeated drug use. Borton
said drug use is "largely socially
unacceptable and hence puts the
good name of the college in
jeopardy."
The Pennsylvania college has
a physician, a psychiatrist and
counselors available to privately
discuss matters concerning drug
use. Borton said that the first
use of drugs by a Haverford stu
dent would be considered a re
sult of "lack of accurate infor
mation or of some medical or
psychological problem.
Amherst College's Committee
on Guidance and Counseling
mailed a letter to the student
body indicating the school's
"concern about the use of drugs

because of possible physical and
physiological dangers and dam
aging effects to the individual
user." The letter encouraged stu
dents desiring further informa
tion about drugs to contact the
Counseling Center or the Stu
dent Health Office, and included
a discussion of federal and state
laws governing drug use and a
brief discussion of the effects
of LSD and marijuana.
Discipline
The University of Montana
considers disciplinary action
against student drug users and
the Rhode Island School of De
sign usually dismisses a student
from school if he is found guilty
of a drug offense.
The greatest controversy is
over the question of after-effects.
FDA officials claim that at least
5 per cent of individuals using

LSD experience serious psycho
logical after-effects. Other re
ports estimate as low as 1 per
cent suffer after-effects of any
consequence.
This can only be determined
by the subjects' own responses.
William H. McGlothlin of the
University of Southern Cali
fornia's psychiatry department
suggests that "persons who re
port naturally occuring hyp
notic-like experiences, are orient
ed toward ideas and intuition,
and prefer to live an unstruc
tured life, tend to react more
strongly to LSD. Those who pre
fer a more practical and orderly
life tend to have less intense
reactions."
Studies have been done here
at Stanford on the effects on
mental and creative perform
ances under LSD by Drs. Wil

liam Harman and James Fadi
man.
It is not commonly thought, at
least among Stanford's "hip
pies," that FDA agents are pos
ing as students on the Stanford
campus.
