# Eating Clubs Started In 1901 Offer Cuisine And Social Life
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
For 66 years, eating clubs have been
a part of Stanford. Their function is
described by the nameâ€”they pro
vide eating facilities and a social life
for members.
The first eating club, Los Acros,
was established on an informal basis
in 1901 and was known as Entre Nous
until the name was changed to Los
Arcos.
Breakers was founded in 1909 in
a College Terrace home, near the
present site of Escondido Village. Sev
eral other clubs were established off
campus, but all were eventually dis
banded.
In 1912, El Campo and El Toro were
organized and these two clubs plus
Breakers moved into the "Little Quad"
near Encina Hall. The Little Quad
was razed during World War II "for
health reasons," according to a 1951
Stanford University press release.
El Capitan and El Cuadro were
formed in 1921 and, together with Los
Arcos, moved into the newly-opened
Encina Commons. El Tigre was orga
nized in 1922.
On Or Off Campus
Some of the eating club members
live in Toyon Hall, which is reserved
almost exclusively for eating club use,
although several independents live
there. Many members live off-campus.
Eating Clubs are operated by the
members and receive little support
from their alumni. None are orga
nized on a national basis.
During World War 11, all seven
clubs suspended operation due to a
lack of members. From 1946 until
1951, when the present buildings were
completed, the clubs ate together in a
large dining room in Encina Com
mons. Each club now has its own
building located near Toyan Hall.
Social programs for the clubs are
on a voluntary basis. Occasional fines
are levied for non-attendance, but
these exceptions are rare.
No More Rites
The eating clubs have also done
away with initiation rites, secret hand
shakes, and secret songs, although
some pledge hazing does occur each
Spring Quarter.
High grade point averages are al
ways a strong selling point of the
clubs. During fall quarter, El Tigre
amassed the highest average of any

men's living group on campus, a 2.97.
Each club controls its own finances,
buys its own food, and hires its own
cook. Student business managers run
the individual clubs and a student is
in charge of the entire operation, of
ficially called the Stanford Eating
Clubs. All seven clubs merged their
resources last year to provide a more

stable financial situation.
Within the next ten to 15 years,
the eating clubs may move to a new
dormitory-dining room setup, a plan
which has been advocated by the Inter-
Club Council. The relocation is still
tentative and no money has yet been
raised for the project.
