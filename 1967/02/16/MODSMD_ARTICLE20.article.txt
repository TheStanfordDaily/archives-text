# Fall Opening Expected For Services Center
## 
### 
By next summer the remodel
ing of the Old Union into a stu
dent services building will be
complete. The new office space
will bring together divisions of
the University that were form
erly located on the Quad and in
Encina Hall into a centralized
location on White Plaza-
Future residents will be the
offices of the Dean of Students,
Financial Aids, Student Ac
counts, Housing, the Committee
on Public Exercises, and Coun
selling and Testing. Others to
occupy space are Admissions,
the Registrar, the National Ser
vice Advisor, and a branch of
the Cashier's office.
"Being together in a conven
ient place should make their
operations a lot more efficient,"
said Everett Swagert head of the
Planning Office, which is in
charge of the project.
The opening next Fall Quar
ter will mark the end of the
year-and-a-half long period of
renovation. Formerly an under

graduate women's residence, the
Old Union was evacuated at the
beginning of Winter Quarter in
1966.
"Although construction started
last July, before work began the
building had to be de-activated,"
explained Swagert. In the six
months of preliminary work the
building was investigated by en
gineers and the kicthen dis
mantled.
The re-inforced concrete shell
of the building, erected in 1922
as a residence and student union,
will not be changed by the re
shaping. However, some of the
shrubbery has been removed
and the courtyard around the
fountain repaved for a "more
open effect."
Total expense of the project,
including furniture and land
scaping will be $1,040,000. Actual
construction costs are $700,000.
The space vacated on the
quad, Buildings 100 and 110, will
be shared by the departments of
philosophy and anthropology, i
