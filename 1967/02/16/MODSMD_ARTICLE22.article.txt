# SEEK VENGEANCE TONIGHT
## SU Boxers Up Tight For Cal Daily SPORTS 
### JOHN MERRILL 
For the team and for four
members of the Stanford box
ing squad, tonight's meet with
the University of California will
be an eagerly anticipated re
match.
Three weeks ago the Bears de
feated Stanford at Berkeley by
a score of 7-4. This included
three forfeits against Stanford.
This week Stanford will still
forfeit the 125 and 132 pound
classes, but Dave Hibbitts, in
jured at the time of the last
meet, will be ready for this tilt.
Hibbitts at 139
Hibbitts will be boxing either
Freeman Harris or Phil Nemir,
tjj|e son of the Cal boxing coach.
'£ln the 147 pound class Stan
ford's Bill Thomas will be
•natched against Jim Hoobler of
Hoobler lost to Stanford's

Jim Marlar in the last meet and
will drop down a class for this
one.
Barney Adler will be Stan
ford's pick against Fred Hite.
Adler had a rugged three round
draw against Nevada last week
end.
Marlar vs. Stewart
Jim Marlar, Stanford's first
man at 156, will box the Bears'
Terry Stewart. Stewart defeated
Barney Adler in the previous
meet.
The 165 pound bout will fea
ture John Price of Stanford and
Greg Monohan of Cal. Price
dropped a close decision to Mon
ohan the last time out and will
be ready for the rematch.
Tom Jenks, the defending lea
gue champion for Stanford, will
get a chance to erase the draw
he fought with Cal's Bill Ney
land. The fight was not one of

Jenks' best and he should regain
form this week.
Jenks Impressive Last Week
Jenks won an impressive vic
tory against Nevada last Satur
day in what was perhaps the
best match of his career.
The 180 pound bout is not yet
set, though Stanford's Mike
Palmer will box either Tracy
Cox or Web Lloyd of Cal. Palm
er was a victor over Lloyd in
the previous encounter.

Dave Oswald will seek to eli
minate the question over the
questionable draw he fought
three weeks ago with Cal's Ron
Dell'lmmagine. The match was
close all the way but many ring
siders thought the decision
should have gone to Oswald.
De Gooyer Injured
Missing from the Indian line
up this week will be undefeated
De Gooyer who was injured in an
automobile accident Sunday
night and will be out for an
undetermined length of time.
De Gooyer had an impressive
record of three wins, including
two by technical knockout.
The meet is scheduled to be
gin at 8:00 p.m. in Encina Gym
and fans are encouraged to come
early due to the crowded con
ditions that always prevail at
Encina.
