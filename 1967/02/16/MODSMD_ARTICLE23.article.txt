# Baseball Team Opens Saturday
## 
### PETE EAKLAND JOE HERNANDEZ 
Newly elected president of the
NCAA Baseball Coaches Associa
tion Dutch Fehring is looking
forward to the 1967 season with
optimism despite the loss of
some key personnel. The first
game is Saturday at 2 p.m. in
Sunken Diamond against the
Stanford Frosh.
Normally a baseball team can
ill afford to lose two Ail-Ameri
cans—its leading hitter and its
two top pitchers—but Stanford's
eight returning lettermen will
be bouyed up substantially by a
"best ever" Frosh team that
romped through a 27-1-2 record.
Frank Duffy, who sparkled at
the plate and afield as a sopho
more, heads the list of returnees
and was a unanimous all-CIBA
pick last year. Among the other
veterans, Mike Schomaker, who
has switched from outfield to
catcher, and second baseman
Dick Swan combine with Duffy
to give the Tribe an airtight
defense up the middle.
Front Runner
Coach Fehring expects the
Tribe to be among the front run
ners in the new AAWU Baseball
Conference despite a loss in
long ball potential. He points to
the team's defensive strength
and deep pitching staff. The lat
ter is especially important this
year as each conference team
must play two back to back

doubleheaders one weekend dur
ing the season.
Seven lettermen have departed
from the 1966 CIBA runner up
team which had an overall 26-
12-2 record. By graduation, Stan
ford lost two bona fide All-Ameri
cans in first baseman Pete Mid
dlekauff and catcher Jim Hibbs.
After a slow start, Hibbs came
on strong to bat .331 and lead
the team in home runs with 11.
Also missing will be pitchers
John Mason and Terry Docken
who accounted for more than
half of Stanford's wins.
Graduation was not the only
claimer of personnel. Hi Lewis,
last year's starting third base
man, and Steve Hovely the
team's most valuable player and
leading hitter both signed major
league contracts.
DU Combo
To team up with .308 hitter
Duffy on the double play will be
Swan who is in his third year as
a starter for Stanford. Round
ing out a strong infield is third
baseman Bob Boone and first
baseman Marty Erck. Sopho
more Mark Marquess who hit
.360 on last year's frosh team
is giving Erck a run for his
money.
Russ Tweet, Bob Parker, and
Mike Ammirato are three in
fielders from last year's frosh
team.
Rifle armed Schomaker should
be a more than adequate re

placement for Hibbs. Behind
him are two capable sophomores,
Bob Edie and Greg Buck, and
one junior, Larry Heath.
Losses and position changes
have made the outfield situation
unpredictable and only one let
terman, Bill Holt (.273), is play
ing. Up from the JV's are two
prospects, Jeff Rohlfing and Bill
Thomson. Bob Whalen, a trans
fer, is another outfielder.
Three sophomores are vying
for the outfield positions. They
are Jack Hodges, power hitter
Ron Shotts and hard working
Bob Gallagher. Hodges hit .374
on last year's frosh squad.
Top Notch Staff
The pitching staff promises to
be one of Stanford's best ever
in regard to quantity and quality,
as 11 hurlers are fighting for
places on the varsity. The two
returning lettermen are Frank
Klinger and Daro Quiring, who
was 3-0 last season.
The staff ace his sophomore
year, Quiring was bothered by
minor ailments last year and
never achieved his 1965 form.
But in pre-season scrimmages
this year he has shown excel
lent form. The only other pitch
er with varsity experience is left
hander Jim Blaschke, a hard
thrower who sometimes lacks
control.
From the Frosh come a trio of
pitchers who could all be front
liners. Don Rose, who has fine
control, landed the Most Valuable
Player Award for the Frosh by
virtue of his 0.692 earned run
average. If his arm, which is
sore now, comes around he will
be an asset to any aspirations
the Indians have for the college
world series in Omaha.
Sandy Vance, last year's Ama
teur Player of the Year, is
equally talented. He averaged
IVz strikeouts per inning in
cruising to a 9-0 record for last
year's Frosh. Rod Poteete who
was slowed by arm trouble last
year has looked fully recovered
and should see much action.
Tune-Up
Pete Hamm and Harvey Shank
combined to shut out Merritt
College, 11-0, Tuesday, in a JV
game. Each gave up two hits.
They struck out 13 of the foe.
Other pitchers making a bid
for varsity duty are Tony Kalas,
Tom Krause, and Scott Sonne.
Coach Fehring plans to use

a pitcher an inning Saturday so
as to give as many boys as pos
sible a chance to losscn up.
He also plans to substitute
freely with the other eight posi
tions so that both he and the
spectators can get a look at the
whole squad.
This is understandable since
whoever turns out to be Stan

ford's second and third stringers
could probably play first string
in any other college league in
the country.
Coach Ray Young's freshman
team will be the opposition Sat
urday. He has some pitchers with
good high school careers behind
them who might give the varsity
some trouble.
