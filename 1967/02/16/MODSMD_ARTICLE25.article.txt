# Indians Lead Stats Again; Set For Year's Top Meet
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers captured
7 of 12 first places to dominate
the PAC-8 rankings for the sev
enth straight week as they pre
pare for this week end's show
down meets. Three of the na
tion's top four teams, Stanford,
UCLA, and USC appear in En
cina pool to determine a favor
ite for the national title.
Greg Buckingham led the In
dians placing first in four events
and second in another. Bucking
ham is the national record hold
er in the 500 yd. freestyle.
However, Buckingham looks
forward to his toughest race of
the year this Friday when he
meets Mike Burton of UCLA,
national record holder in the
1650 free. They will swim a com
promise distance of 1000 yards.
Last week, Buckingham broke
Burton's NCAA 1000 record by
18 seconds.
Pete Siebert moved from sixth
to first place in the 200 butter
fly, but relinquished his first
place spot in the backstroke and
his second spot in the individual
medley to teammate Dick Roth,
as Roth rounds into his best
shape since the '64 Olympics.
