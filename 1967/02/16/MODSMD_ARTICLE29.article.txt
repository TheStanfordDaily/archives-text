## Wrestlers Fall To Beavers 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's wrestling team
lost its seventh dual meet of the
season Monday night to a tal
ented Oregon State University
24-9, but the Cards showed three
very important areas of pro
gress.
Captain Len Borchers and
John Suttle both beat Beaver
opponents who were undefeated
in dual meet competition this
year, and heavyweight Terry
Crenshaw upset last year's con
ference champion.
Crenshaw Outstanding
Crenshaw's victory made the
team loss seem a minor con
sideration to the small crowd in
Encina gym. He rallied from a
three point deficit to batter his
230 pound opponent, Mark Gar
tung, with two reversals and two
predicaments on Turk rides for
an 8-4 win.

Borchers at 152 pounds gained
his seventh dual win to remain
undefeated in all competition
this year. He faced Beaver sopho
more Lauren Johnson and was
hard pressed in a 2-1 win.
The first period was scoreless,
and Borchers reversed Johnson
on a beautiful stand up and duck
under with only nine seconds left
in the three minute second pe
riod.
Borchers then used ankle rides
and trips to control Johnson for
2:50 of the last period before
Johnson escaped for one point.
John Suttle, 145 pounds, gained
his third dual meet victory in a
row when he edged out Steve
Woods 5-3 with a five point re
verse and near fall in the last
period.
Stanford's chances of winning
the match were for all intents
and purposes obliterated at the

start of the match. John Tam
lost 14-4 to Ron Iwasaki, the
Cards forfeited the 130 pound
class, and Gerry Beaudoin was
pinned by 137 pounder Bob Haw
kins to put the Tribe at a 13-0
disadvantage, which proved to
be an unbeatable lead for last
year's conference champs.
Doug Gunesch was tied with
Jerry Chapin 2-2 at the end of
two periods, but Chapin con
trolled him during the final three
minutes for two points riding
time and a 4-2 win. Burt Ambler
fell prey to a second period
pinning effort by the Beaver's
Jeff Smith.
Bud Hits Best
Bud Hollingbery met OSU's
Jim Blackford, whose takedowns
and escape portrayed the Beav
er's best moves, and lost 6-1.
In three exhibition matches,
Stanford's frosh heavyweight

Ben Shaver lost 14-2, Van Ben
net, frosh 130 pounder, lost 9-2,
and Brian Smith lost 12-0.

The Stanford wrestlers jour
ney to Southern California this
weekend for three dual meets.
The Tribe faces the Bruins of
UCLA in Westwood Friday
night, then wrestles San Diego
State and Cal Poly at Pomona
in separate meets Saturday.
Stanford's wrestling team
lost its seventh dual meet of the
season Monday night to a tal
ented Oregon State University
24-9, but the Cards showed three
very important areas of pro
gress.
Captain Len Borchers and
John Suttle both beat Beaver
opponents who were undefeated
in dual meet competition this
year, and heavyweight Terry
Crenshaw upset last year's con
ference champion.
Crenshaw Outstanding
Crenshaw's victory made the
team loss seem a minor con
sideration to the small crowd in
Encina gym. He rallied from a
three point deficit to batter his
230 pound opponent, Mark Gar
tung, with two reversals and two
predicaments on Turk rides for
an 8-4 win.

Borchers at 152 pounds gained
his seventh dual win to remain
undefeated in all competition
this year. He faced Beaver sopho
more Lauren Johnson and was
hard pressed in a 2-1 win.
The first period was scoreless,
and Borchers reversed Johnson
on a beautiful stand up and duck
under with only nine seconds left
in the three minute second pe
riod.
Borchers then used ankle rides
and trips to control Johnson for
2:50 of the last period before
Johnson escaped for one point.
John Suttle, 145 pounds, gained
his third dual meet victory in a
row when he edged out Steve
Woods 5-3 with a five point re
verse and near fall in the last
period.
Stanford's chances of winning
the match were for all intents
and purposes obliterated at the

start of the match. John Tam
lost 14-4 to Ron Iwasaki, the
Cards forfeited the 130 pound
class, and Gerry Beaudoin was
pinned by 137 pounder Bob Haw
kins to put the Tribe at a 13-0
disadvantage, which proved to
be an unbeatable lead for last
year's conference champs.
Doug Gunesch was tied with
Jerry Chapin 2-2 at the end of
two periods, but Chapin con
trolled him during the final three
minutes for two points riding
time and a 4-2 win. Burt Ambler
fell prey to a second period
pinning effort by the Beaver's
Jeff Smith.
Bud Hits Best
Bud Hollingbery met OSU's
Jim Blackford, whose takedowns
and escape portrayed the Beav
er's best moves, and lost 6-1.
In three exhibition matches,
Stanford's frosh heavyweight

Ben Shaver lost 14-2, Van Ben
net, frosh 130 pounder, lost 9-2,
and Brian Smith lost 12-0.
