# New Coffee House Ready; Mem What? Opens Tonight
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
The quest for the coffee house ends
tonight.
Dubbed "Mem What?" in the eso
teric tradition of Stanford venacular,
the coffee house will make its long
awaited debut in Tresidder at 10 this
evening. Dean B. Davie Napier and
the New Look Singers will be fea
tured at the opening.
"Mem What?" will operate every
Thursday and Friday night from 10
to 1:30 a.m. on the ground floor of
the Union- It is closed off from the
main portion of the Tresidder din
ing area, and the entrance will be
through the garden patio on the Quad
side of the kitchen.
During coffee house hours the at
mosphere in the two small dining
rooms will be markedly different from
that of the cafeteria during the day,
explained coffee house committee
chairman Janet Cox. Low ceilings, dim
colored lighting, the proximity of the
garden patio, and artistic decorations
will help to creat a more intimate
setting.
Espresso, hot spiced cider, pastries
and donuts will be sold in addition
to regular coffee.
"The coffee house aims to provide
a much-needed setting for dialogue
between all members of the Stanford
community and their guests," Miss
Cox said. "Spontaneous, informal en
tertainment — poetry reading, short
dramatic presentations, music of all
kinds—will be encouraged on coffee
house nights."
Miss Cox added, "There will be no
formally organized program, but we
want students to feel free to come in
to participate in performance or just
conversation."

Tomorrow night the coffee house
will sponsor a musical evening with
guitars and other instruments. "Vir
tuosity is no prerequisite for per
formance," Miss Cox stated.
