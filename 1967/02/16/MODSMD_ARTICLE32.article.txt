# Dear Trustees...

### 
The Board of Trustees today will consider an
issue of primary importance to the student body:
the Committee of Fifteen's proposed revision of
open house hours.
The Committee's report is one of the strongest
official statements to date favoring the view that
students be given a greater voice in deciding
how to run their lives. If accepted, it will finally
constitute a rejection by the University of the
in loco parentis concept. The proposal suggest
ed by the Committee will allow students to de
cide among themselves, within certain limits,
what open house hours they will have to live
with. It will let each living group determine for
itself how the conflicting rights of various people
in that group can best be balanced. Particularly
in light of the fact that a large portion of the
student body is forced to live on campus, the
University is faced with the responsibility of
allowing students the right to conduct their own
affairs.
Of major significance also is the relationship of
the Committee of Fifteen's recommendation to
the concept of the "ideal residence university,"
a topic widely discussed in the last few weeks,
both in this column and in the inner recesses of
building number 10. If the University still be
lieves in the merits of a residence university —
again we emphasize that we do not intend this
to be interpreted as compulsory on-campus liv

ing — then it is faced with the responsibility for
providing the best possible living conditions.
The present restrictive regulations are antitheti
cal to this goal. When a dormitory is made into
a place of unnecessary restriction, its function
as a residence diminishes sharply.
It is no secret that open house hours are be
ing blatantly violated. This fact, however, in
dicates neither immaturity nor bad faith on
the part of the students. Instead, it is a good in
dication of the gap that presently exists be
tween the generation that makes the decisions
and the generation that must live by them. Most
students do not violate open house hours out of
spite or in deliberate protest against the pres
ent regulations. The existing rules are ignored
because no one — no student, no faculty mem
ber, and almost no administrator — takes them
seriously. Condemning students as immature
for their disobedience is not unlike con
demning the repeated violation of an unen
forced and arbitrary 10 mile per hour speed
limit on the Bayshore. Students today are more
mature than their elders would like to believe;
to postulate unquestioning obedience as the
overt expression of maturity is to deny one of
the goals of an education.
The Committee of Fifteen's recommendation
is a thorough and well considered proposal. We
urge its adoption by the Trustees.

ent regulations. The existing rules are ignored
because no one — no student, no faculty mem
ber, and almost no administrator — takes them
seriously. Condemning students as immature
for their disobedience is not unlike con
demning the repeated violation of an unen
forced and arbitrary 10 mile per hour speed
limit on the Bayshore. Students today are more
mature than their elders would like to believe;
to postulate unquestioning obedience as the
overt expression of maturity is to deny one of
the goals of an education.
The Committee of Fifteen's recommendation
is a thorough and well considered proposal. We
urge its adoption by the Trustees.
The Board of Trustees today will consider an
issue of primary importance to the student body:
the Committee of Fifteen's proposed revision of
open house hours.
The Committee's report is one of the strongest
official statements to date favoring the view that
students be given a greater voice in deciding
how to run their lives. If accepted, it will finally
constitute a rejection by the University of the
in loco parentis concept. The proposal suggest
ed by the Committee will allow students to de
cide among themselves, within certain limits,
what open house hours they will have to live
with. It will let each living group determine for
itself how the conflicting rights of various people
in that group can best be balanced. Particularly
in light of the fact that a large portion of the
student body is forced to live on campus, the
University is faced with the responsibility of
allowing students the right to conduct their own
affairs.
Of major significance also is the relationship of
the Committee of Fifteen's recommendation to
the concept of the "ideal residence university,"
a topic widely discussed in the last few weeks,
both in this column and in the inner recesses of
building number 10. If the University still be
lieves in the merits of a residence university —
again we emphasize that we do not intend this
to be interpreted as compulsory on-campus liv

ing — then it is faced with the responsibility for
providing the best possible living conditions.
The present restrictive regulations are antitheti
cal to this goal. When a dormitory is made into
a place of unnecessary restriction, its function
as a residence diminishes sharply.
It is no secret that open house hours are be
ing blatantly violated. This fact, however, in
dicates neither immaturity nor bad faith on
the part of the students. Instead, it is a good in
dication of the gap that presently exists be
tween the generation that makes the decisions
and the generation that must live by them. Most
students do not violate open house hours out of
spite or in deliberate protest against the pres
ent regulations. The existing rules are ignored
because no one — no student, no faculty mem
ber, and almost no administrator — takes them
seriously. Condemning students as immature
