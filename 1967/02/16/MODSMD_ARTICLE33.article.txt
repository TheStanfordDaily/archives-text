' Two remote and strange places
tfnd remote and strange connec
tion: Vietnam and Stanford Uni
versity. In the past month there
occurred a little lesson in trans
world communications, (a) A
Stanford student bought some
laughing gas. (b) He and some
friends consumed it, rendering
their voices unusual, (c) The
Stanford Daily reported events
Wand (b). (d) A large news
paper, also distributed without
charge, called the Pacific Stare
and Stripes (forever?) reprint
ed the story with the headline
"Laughing Gas is Latest 'Trip'
at Stanford." (e) Hun
dreds of thousands of troops
how know about Stanford.
Concurrently, bombs were
being dropped by American
planes, because, to quote our
President (the one in Washing
ton), "there is no other alterna
tive." Our President (the one in
Washington) was quoted by the
Army newspaper, in reference
to a new peace-in-space (outer
space) treaty, this is "an inspir
ing moment in the history of
the human race."
Normally we seek inspiration
at Stanford, peace in Vietnam,

and very little gas in outer
space.
Instead we are given peace in
outer-space, gas at Stanford,
and expiration at Vietnam.
It is reasonable to expect that
the University should not be
subject to the strangeness of
Washington and Vietnam, but
history shows that reason at
Stanford is no laughing matter;
in fact, it often matters not at
all.
Before we all start laughing
unreasonably, we ought to con
trast our history with our de
mands.
What are the outstanding de
mands of the modern student?
Perhaps among the more im
portant are the following: (a)
To be taken seriously; (b) To
participate fully in the conduct
and intentions of the University;
(c) To receive an education; (d)
to fashion a life which is rele
vant and meaningful.
(The Stars and Stripes Viet
nam Bureau reported on 29 Jan
uary 1967 that "an American li
brarian's desire for orderliness
saved his life when he found a
bomb in a space carved into a
Vietnamese English dictionary.)

Students make these demands
in the face of what they see as
an uncontrolled and deranged
world, a world where the Presi
dent (the one in Washington)
lies and libraries explode (if
they are not stoned by rioters
first).
Unfortunately, students make
these demands in the afternoon
and laugh-it-up in the evening,
sleeping through their morning
classes.
Happy days in an unhappy
world.
Students who want to be
taken seriously, ought to be seri
education ought to seek an edu
education tought to seek an edu
cation.
The Administration doesn't
criticize students of only flirt
ing with a book, of balking at
scholarship, of turning on, etc.
It doesn't, no it doesn't, not be
cause it is kind, but because it
doesn't care. (The Stanford
Computation Center reports that
the average GPA is 2.768894211-
307832+ which, of course, is sig
nificantly higher than last year.)
The library is safe at Stan
ford. Safe from bombs, rioters,
and students.
Laughing gas anyone?

Perhaps among the more im

To be taken seriously; (b) To
participate fully in the conduct
and intentions of the University;
(c) To receive an education; (d)
to fashion a life which is rele
vant and meaningful.

Students make these demands
in the face of what they see as
an uncontrolled and deranged
world, a world where the Presi
dent (the one in Washington)
lies and libraries explode (if
they are not stoned by rioters
first).
Unfortunately, students make
these demands in the afternoon
and laugh-it-up in the evening,
sleeping through their morning
classes.

The Administration doesn't
criticize students of only flirt

scholarship, of turning on, etc.
It doesn't, no it doesn't, not be
cause it is kind, but because it
doesn't care. (The Stanford
Computation Center reports that
the average GPA is 2.768894211-
307832+ which, of course, is sig

Normally we seek inspiration

Instead we are given peace in

It is reasonable to expect that
the University should not be
subject to the strangeness of
Washington and Vietnam, but
history shows that reason at
Stanford is no laughing matter;
in fact, it often matters not at
