## Greeks Wield Defensive Pens

Editor, The Daily:
It is too bad that the Intellec
tuals on this campus, who are
so piously concerned with the
Injustice of Rush, the Vice of
Fraternities, and Progressive
Educational Living, have effec
tively stifled any present chanc
es of intelligent improvement in
the fraternity system by mak
ing a cause of the whole affair.
Causes polarize and paralyse.
They present everything in
black and white, solidify public
sentiment, and force people to
champion one side or another.
Nothing is accomplished in this
manner. Champions promote
causes, not solutions. Nor can
compromise resolve this dilem
ma, for compromise between
violently opposed factions re
sults not in solutions, but only
in a higher degree of confusion
and ill-will.
Certainly the fraternity sys
tem has faults. Yet, nothing will
be resolved by offended bleating,
whether on the front page of
The Daily, in LASSU, or IFC.
Only harm can result from the
threatened investigation of Hell
Week by the Santa Clara County
District Attorney, just as only
harm could result from an in
vestigation of the "other side"
by the narcotics squad.
It is always worthwhile to
critically evaluate a given situa
tion, but I cannot see why fra
ternities should have to justify
their existence any more than
Stein or off-campus apartments.
It is inconsistent to argue that
selectivity is cause enough — or
have we forgotten that all of
Stanford society is based on this
same principle?
I doubt very seriously wheth
er the attackers of the frater
nity system have left us any op
portunity to improve it this
year, or even next year. We
must defend it. too vigorously to
allow ourselves the necessary
perspective. Fraternities have a
lot of potential, both realized
and unrealized. Given the oppor
tunity, they could certainly im
prove. Keep the pressure on, and
both attackers and defenders
will be doing themselves and the
University a disservice.

Editor, The Daily:
Once again the Stanford fra
ternity system has been hit,
though this time with the added
weight of extremely effective
timing. The extended period of
evaluation of the fraternities ap
peared to be on the wane, in fa
vor of more responsible, orderly,
and well-represented discussion.
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion's subcommittee on frater
nities is, in some areas, lacking
both good judgment and an ap
preciation of the most basic
tenets and characteristics of a
Stanford fraternity. To suggest
the investigation of the Hell
Week/Help Weeks by the Dis
trict Attorney of Santa Clara
County, and to cite the Bill of
Rights as the fraternities' sole
protection against this investiga
tion is childish over-reaction to
problems readily acknowledged
by most fraternity members at
Stanford.
A review board would find
that the majority of fraternity
members contribute as much if
not more to the Stanford com
munity than those male students
living in other situations. If a
list Ls desired, let it be submit
ted. In all probability it would
more than justify the academic
and extracurricular contribu
tions of Stanford fraternities as
significant and valuable.
However, if the review board
concerns itself with value judg
ments, as so many critics do,
there can be little of construc

tive value. Regardless of wheth
er or not such board would just
ify fraternities to its own satis
faction, it remains the student's
prerogative to join or not to
join.
In reply to one suggestion of
the subcommittee, one might
ask if any houses, in practice,
actually harbor racial or reli
gious restrictions.
The charge that the fraternity
is in practice opposed to educa
tion is largely unsubstantiated.
To suggest that the Stanford
fraternity destroys the self-dis
cipline of its members by grad
ual attrition is unrealistic.

This opportunity is all too often
absent in other living situations.
To attack the abstract word
"fraternity" renders the attack

that hundreds of Stanford stu

We have as much right to re

• The Simple Life
Editor, The Daily:
The articles which have re
cently appeared in The Daily
regarding housing have made me
both sad and angry. In the first
place, I do not appreciate neo
muckraking in what is supposed
to be an academic community. Is
not our task that of dispassion
ately assessing the topic under
consideration, of viewing it ob
jectively and reasonably?
What The Daily has been
spewing is the venom of dog
matism, spitefulness, and mali
ciousness. This viciousness
(especially regarding fraterni
ties) made me heatedly angry—
for a minute or two. But the final
emotion was one of sadness.
I ask simply, who is to say?
Who is to evaluate someone
else's way of living? (I assume
that it does not contradict the
basic tenets of a free society—
that is, that selection of mem
bers to a living group is not
founded upon bigotry.)
Suppose it is not entirely aca
demic. Are the joys of a sunset
walk along a beach academic? Is
the peace and comfort of na
ture's forests and mountains part
of an academic pursuit? Must
one's whole life be tunneled into
one small corner of the mind?
Suppose people enjoy going to
weekend parties. Why should
that offend you?
Why must people internalize
the censor's morality and, in
frustration, adopt his sickness:
I shall decide how you should
live; I shall decide how you
should believe; I shall decide
how you should act.
What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into
their belief patterns? If these
elements must constantly devise
final solutions, I wish they would

be qualified as such. I am tired
of such polemics masquerading
under the guise of supposed
journalistic or academic integrity
and objectivity. If there is some
thing worth saying, won't the
idea be strong enough to stand
alone?
Where are those who desire a
simple life, a child-like life, a
life full of wonder and search
ing, undogmatic, unideological,
unbound, unfettered? Is there
anyone left who remembers Hil
lel and Jesus: "Do unto others
as you would have done unto
yourself."
I am tired of being told I
must be either black or white.
I like gray. I am tired of being
told to choose between apples
and oranges. And I am sad to see
it happening here, to witness the
sickness of a crusader demand
ing that I believe in freedom
or die at his sword.

Editor, The Daily:
While the Report of the Hous

many questions unanswered, it
stands as a significant step to
ward realizing the full potential

• Coexistence
Editor, The Daily:
What say we abolish the
Double Standard? It is becom
ing increasingly hard to stom
ach the distorted propaganda
directed at fraternities in the
name of justice and individual
rights. In the minds of some
there seems to be little to dis
tinguish the system of "selective
living" from wife-beating or
genocide.
And yet the fraternity is no
more responsible than any other
living group for the apathy and
intellectual immaturity that sur
rounds us. What have Stern
Hall, the Eating Clubs, et al con
tributed that they should escape
the verbal mortar shells with
which fraternities are constantly
being bombarded? Instead of in
dicting one group for the short
comings of all, let's challenge
the whole community to do
something with all of its wasted
potential.
I fail to see that the frater
nity is undermining the founda
tions of the University. What I
do see is that the self-appointed

brotherhood of anti-fraternity
"crusaders" is using cries of
sabotage to justify its own pecu
liar brand of moral despotism.
What greater hypocrisy than to
denounce fraternities for intol
erance, and then presume to
deny 1200 men the right to live
as they choose?
They claim that fraternities
cannot "continue to exist with
goals totally different from thr
rest of the University commu
nity". Since when does the "rest
of the community" have a right
to dictate my goals? Hopefully,
our collective goal as members
of the University community is
the establishment of an atmo
sphere wherein each individual
can find fulfillment in his own
way.
I may choose to live in a fra
ternity, but this doesn't imply
that I let "the rest" of the fra
ternity dictate my goals; I may
likewise choose to be a member
of the University community,
but again, I dtfn't expect "the
rest" of that community to forct
its values on me. Do I not have
the right to pursue those goals
which I believe are fitting, so
long as I do not interfere with
another man's right to do like
wise?
Certainly, fraternities are in
need of re-evaluation. But let's
not allow criticism to degenerate
to the level of absurdity. And to
propose that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney inves
tigate the so-called fraternitj
"Hell Week" is absurd. It is
more "hell" to sit through one
session of LASSU than to en
dure the "annoyance" and "em
barrassments" of Hell Week —
and certainly no more "educa
tional". After all, who at this
University is not in need of some
kind of re-evaluation — and who
can presume to say so?
The way to effect a change in
fraternities at Stanford is not
to attempt to coerce them. Let's
have something more positively
constructive. How constructive
is an arbitrary review board thai,
holds the power of life arid
death in its hand? If fraternitie.'
are to grow up, they should be
doing so along with the rest of
the University. Let's do away
with the antagonism of the "two
camps" and try to establish at
least a modicum of meaningful
coexistence.

What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into
their belief patterns? If these
elements must constantly devise
final solutions, I wish they would

be qualified as such. I am tired
of such polemics masquerading
under the guise of supposed
journalistic or academic integrity
and objectivity. If there is some
thing worth saying, won't the
idea be strong enough to stand
alone?
Where are those who desire a
simple life, a child-like life, a
life full of wonder and search
ing, undogmatic, unideological,
unbound, unfettered? Is there
anyone left who remembers Hil
lel and Jesus: "Do unto others
as you would have done unto
yourself."
I am tired of being told I
must be either black or white.
I like gray. I am tired of being
told to choose between apples
and oranges. And I am sad to see
it happening here, to witness the
sickness of a crusader demand

What say we abolish the
Double Standard? It is becom

ach the distorted propaganda
directed at fraternities in the
name of justice and individual
rights. In the minds of some
there seems to be little to dis
tinguish the system of "selective
living" from wife-beating or
genocide.
And yet the fraternity is no
more responsible than any other
living group for the apathy and
intellectual immaturity that sur
rounds us. What have Stern
Hall, the Eating Clubs, et al con
tributed that they should escape
the verbal mortar shells with
which fraternities are constantly
being bombarded? Instead of in
dicting one group for the short
comings of all, let's challenge
the whole community to do
something with all of its wasted
potential.
I fail to see that the frater
nity is undermining the founda
tions of the University. What I
do see is that the self-appointed

brotherhood of anti-fraternity
"crusaders" is using cries of
sabotage to justify its own pecu
liar brand of moral despotism.
What greater hypocrisy than to
denounce fraternities for intol
erance, and then presume to
deny 1200 men the right to live
as they choose?
They claim that fraternities
cannot "continue to exist with
goals totally different from thr
rest of the University commu
nity". Since when does the "rest
of the community" have a right
to dictate my goals? Hopefully,
our collective goal as members
of the University community is
the establishment of an atmo
sphere wherein each individual
can find fulfillment in his own
way.
I may choose to live in a fra
ternity, but this doesn't imply
that I let "the rest" of the fra
ternity dictate my goals; I may
likewise choose to be a member
of the University community,
but again, I dtfn't expect "the
rest" of that community to forct
its values on me. Do I not have
the right to pursue those goals
which I believe are fitting, so
long as I do not interfere with
another man's right to do like
wise?
Certainly, fraternities are in
need of re-evaluation. But let's
not allow criticism to degenerate
to the level of absurdity. And to
propose that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney inves
tigate the so-called fraternitj
"Hell Week" is absurd. It is
more "hell" to sit through one
session of LASSU than to en
dure the "annoyance" and "em
barrassments" of Hell Week —
and certainly no more "educa
tional". After all, who at this
University is not in need of some
kind of re-evaluation — and who
can presume to say so?
The way to effect a change in
fraternities at Stanford is not
to attempt to coerce them. Let's
have something more positively

Editor, The Daily:
It is too bad that the Intellec

so piously concerned with the
Injustice of Rush, the Vice of
Fraternities, and Progressive
Educational Living, have effec
tively stifled any present chanc
es of intelligent improvement in
the fraternity system by mak
ing a cause of the whole affair.
Causes polarize and paralyse.
They present everything in
black and white, solidify public
sentiment, and force people to
champion one side or another.
Nothing is accomplished in this
manner. Champions promote
causes, not solutions. Nor can
compromise resolve this dilem
ma, for compromise between
violently opposed factions re
sults not in solutions, but only
in a higher degree of confusion
and ill-will.
Certainly the fraternity sys
tem has faults. Yet, nothing will
be resolved by offended bleating,
whether on the front page of
The Daily, in LASSU, or IFC.
Only harm can result from the
threatened investigation of Hell
Week by the Santa Clara County
District Attorney, just as only
harm could result from an in
vestigation of the "other side"
by the narcotics squad.
It is always worthwhile to
critically evaluate a given situa
tion, but I cannot see why fra
ternities should have to justify
their existence any more than
Stein or off-campus apartments.
It is inconsistent to argue that
selectivity is cause enough — or
have we forgotten that all of
Stanford society is based on this
same principle?
I doubt very seriously wheth
er the attackers of the frater
nity system have left us any op
portunity to improve it this
year, or even next year. We
must defend it. too vigorously to
allow ourselves the necessary
perspective. Fraternities have a
lot of potential, both realized
and unrealized. Given the oppor
tunity, they could certainly im
prove. Keep the pressure on, and
both attackers and defenders
will be doing themselves and the
University a disservice.

• Right To Live
Editor, The Daily:
Once again the Stanford fra
ternity system has been hit,
though this time with the added
weight of extremely effective
timing. The extended period of
evaluation of the fraternities ap
peared to be on the wane, in fa
vor of more responsible, orderly,
and well-represented discussion.
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion's subcommittee on frater
nities is, in some areas, lacking
both good judgment and an ap
preciation of the most basic
tenets and characteristics of a
Stanford fraternity. To suggest
the investigation of the Hell
Week/Help Weeks by the Dis
trict Attorney of Santa Clara
County, and to cite the Bill of
Rights as the fraternities' sole
protection against this investiga
tion is childish over-reaction to
problems readily acknowledged
by most fraternity members at
Stanford.
A review board would find
that the majority of fraternity
members contribute as much if
not more to the Stanford com
munity than those male students
living in other situations. If a
list Ls desired, let it be submit
ted. In all probability it would
more than justify the academic
and extracurricular contribu
tions of Stanford fraternities as
significant and valuable.
However, if the review board
concerns itself with value judg
ments, as so many critics do,
there can be little of construc

tive value. Regardless of wheth
er or not such board would just
ify fraternities to its own satis
faction, it remains the student's
prerogative to join or not to
join.
In reply to one suggestion of
the subcommittee, one might
ask if any houses, in practice,
actually harbor racial or reli
gious restrictions.
The charge that the fraternity
is in practice opposed to educa
tion is largely unsubstantiated.
To suggest that the Stanford
fraternity destroys the self-dis
cipline of its members by grad
ual attrition is unrealistic.
The Stanford fraternity sys
tem offers an opportunity to at

To attack the abstract word
"fraternity" renders the attack

that hundreds of Stanford stu

are satisfied with fraternity life.
We have as much right to re

Editor, The Daily:
The articles which have re
cently appeared in The Daily
regarding housing have made me
both sad and angry. In the first
place, I do not appreciate neo
muckraking in what is supposed
to be an academic community. Is
not our task that of dispassion
ately assessing the topic under
consideration, of viewing it ob
jectively and reasonably?
What The Daily has been
spewing is the venom of dog
matism, spitefulness, and mali
ciousness. This viciousness
(especially regarding fraterni
ties) made me heatedly angry—
for a minute or two. But the final
emotion was one of sadness.
I ask simply, who is to say?
Who is to evaluate someone
else's way of living? (I assume
that it does not contradict the
basic tenets of a free society—
that is, that selection of mem
bers to a living group is not
founded upon bigotry.)
Suppose it is not entirely aca
demic. Are the joys of a sunset
walk along a beach academic? Is
the peace and comfort of na
ture's forests and mountains part
of an academic pursuit? Must
one's whole life be tunneled into
one small corner of the mind?
Suppose people enjoy going to
weekend parties. Why should
that offend you?
Why must people internalize
the censor's morality and, in
frustration, adopt his sickness:
I shall decide how you should
live; I shall decide how you
should believe; I shall decide
how you should act.
What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into

Editor, The Daily:
The articles which have re
cently appeared in The Daily
regarding housing have made me
both sad and angry. In the first
place, I do not appreciate neo
muckraking in what is supposed
to be an academic community. Is
not our task that of dispassion
ately assessing the topic under
consideration, of viewing it ob
jectively and reasonably?
What The Daily has been
spewing is the venom of dog
matism, spitefulness, and mali
ciousness. This viciousness
(especially regarding fraterni
ties) made me heatedly angry—
for a minute or two. But the final
emotion was one of sadness.
I ask simply, who is to say?
Who is to evaluate someone
else's way of living? (I assume
that it does not contradict the
basic tenets of a free society—
that is, that selection of mem
bers to a living group is not
founded upon bigotry.)
Suppose it is not entirely aca
demic. Are the joys of a sunset
walk along a beach academic? Is
the peace and comfort of na
ture's forests and mountains part
of an academic pursuit? Must
one's whole life be tunneled into
one small corner of the mind?
Suppose people enjoy going to
weekend parties. Why should
that offend you?
Why must people internalize
the censor's morality and, in
frustration, adopt his sickness:
I shall decide how you should
live; I shall decide how you
should believe; I shall decide
how you should act.
What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into
their belief patterns? If these
elements must constantly devise
final solutions, I wish they would

be qualified as such. I am tired
of such polemics masquerading
under the guise of supposed
journalistic or academic integrity
and objectivity. If there is some
thing worth saying, won't the
idea be strong enough to stand
alone?
Where are those who desire a
simple life, a child-like life, a
life full of wonder and search
ing, undogmatic, unideological,
unbound, unfettered? Is there
anyone left who remembers Hil
lel and Jesus: "Do unto others
as you would have done unto
yourself."
I am tired of being told I
must be either black or white.
I like gray. I am tired of being
told to choose between apples
and oranges. And I am sad to see
it happening here, to witness the
sickness of a crusader demand
ing that I believe in freedom
or die at his sword.

• Coexistence
Editor, The Daily:
What say we abolish the
Double Standard? It is becom
ing increasingly hard to stom
ach the distorted propaganda
directed at fraternities in the
name of justice and individual
rights. In the minds of some
there seems to be little to dis
tinguish the system of "selective
living" from wife-beating or
genocide.
And yet the fraternity is no
more responsible than any other
living group for the apathy and
intellectual immaturity that sur
rounds us. What have Stern
Hall, the Eating Clubs, et al con
tributed that they should escape
the verbal mortar shells with
which fraternities are constantly
being bombarded? Instead of in
dicting one group for the short
comings of all, let's challenge
the whole community to do
something with all of its wasted
potential.
I fail to see that the frater
nity is undermining the founda
tions of the University. What I
do see is that the self-appointed

brotherhood of anti-fraternity
"crusaders" is using cries of
sabotage to justify its own pecu
liar brand of moral despotism.
What greater hypocrisy than to
denounce fraternities for intol
erance, and then presume to
deny 1200 men the right to live
as they choose?
They claim that fraternities
cannot "continue to exist with
goals totally different from thr
rest of the University commu
nity". Since when does the "rest
of the community" have a right
to dictate my goals? Hopefully,
our collective goal as members
of the University community is
the establishment of an atmo
sphere wherein each individual
can find fulfillment in his own
way.
I may choose to live in a fra
ternity, but this doesn't imply
that I let "the rest" of the fra
ternity dictate my goals; I may
likewise choose to be a member
of the University community,
but again, I dtfn't expect "the
rest" of that community to forct
its values on me. Do I not have
the right to pursue those goals
which I believe are fitting, so
long as I do not interfere with
another man's right to do like
wise?
Certainly, fraternities are in
need of re-evaluation. But let's
not allow criticism to degenerate
to the level of absurdity. And to
propose that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney inves
tigate the so-called fraternitj
"Hell Week" is absurd. It is
more "hell" to sit through one
session of LASSU than to en
dure the "annoyance" and "em
barrassments" of Hell Week —
and certainly no more "educa
tional". After all, who at this
University is not in need of some
kind of re-evaluation — and who
can presume to say so?
The way to effect a change in
fraternities at Stanford is not
to attempt to coerce them. Let's
have something more positively
constructive. How constructive
is an arbitrary review board thai,
holds the power of life arid
death in its hand? If fraternitie.'
are to grow up, they should be
doing so along with the rest of
the University. Let's do away
with the antagonism of the "two
camps" and try to establish at
least a modicum of meaningful
coexistence.

What say we abolish the
Double Standard? It is becom

ach the distorted propaganda
directed at fraternities in the
name of justice and individual
rights. In the minds of some
there seems to be little to dis
tinguish the system of "selective
living" from wife-beating or
genocide.
And yet the fraternity is no
more responsible than any other
living group for the apathy and
intellectual immaturity that sur
rounds us. What have Stern
Hall, the Eating Clubs, et al con
tributed that they should escape
the verbal mortar shells with
which fraternities are constantly
being bombarded? Instead of in
dicting one group for the short
comings of all, let's challenge
the whole community to do
something with all of its wasted
potential.
I fail to see that the frater
nity is undermining the founda
tions of the University. What I
do see is that the self-appointed

brotherhood of anti-fraternity
"crusaders" is using cries of
sabotage to justify its own pecu
liar brand of moral despotism.
What greater hypocrisy than to
denounce fraternities for intol
erance, and then presume to
deny 1200 men the right to live
as they choose?
They claim that fraternities
cannot "continue to exist with
goals totally different from thr
rest of the University commu
nity". Since when does the "rest
of the community" have a right
to dictate my goals? Hopefully,
our collective goal as members
of the University community is
the establishment of an atmo
sphere wherein each individual
can find fulfillment in his own
way.
I may choose to live in a fra
ternity, but this doesn't imply
that I let "the rest" of the fra
ternity dictate my goals; I may
likewise choose to be a member
of the University community,
but again, I dtfn't expect "the
rest" of that community to forct
its values on me. Do I not have
the right to pursue those goals
which I believe are fitting, so
long as I do not interfere with
another man's right to do like
wise?
Certainly, fraternities are in
need of re-evaluation. But let's
not allow criticism to degenerate
to the level of absurdity. And to
propose that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney inves
tigate the so-called fraternitj
"Hell Week" is absurd. It is
more "hell" to sit through one
session of LASSU than to en
dure the "annoyance" and "em
barrassments" of Hell Week —
and certainly no more "educa
tional". After all, who at this
University is not in need of some
kind of re-evaluation — and who
can presume to say so?
The way to effect a change in
fraternities at Stanford is not
to attempt to coerce them. Let's
have something more positively

Only harm can result from the
threatened investigation of Hell

harm could result from an in

It is always worthwhile to
critically evaluate a given situa

ternities should have to justify
their existence any more than
Stein or off-campus apartments.
It is inconsistent to argue that
selectivity is cause enough — or
have we forgotten that all of
Stanford society is based on this
same principle?
I doubt very seriously wheth
er the attackers of the frater
nity system have left us any op
portunity to improve it this
year, or even next year. We
must defend it. too vigorously to
allow ourselves the necessary
perspective. Fraternities have a

and unrealized. Given the oppor

both attackers and defenders

• Right To Live
Editor, The Daily:
Once again the Stanford fra
ternity system has been hit,
though this time with the added
weight of extremely effective
timing. The extended period of
evaluation of the fraternities ap
peared to be on the wane, in fa
vor of more responsible, orderly,
and well-represented discussion.
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion's subcommittee on frater
nities is, in some areas, lacking
both good judgment and an ap
preciation of the most basic
tenets and characteristics of a
Stanford fraternity. To suggest
the investigation of the Hell
Week/Help Weeks by the Dis
trict Attorney of Santa Clara
County, and to cite the Bill of
Rights as the fraternities' sole
protection against this investiga
tion is childish over-reaction to
problems readily acknowledged
by most fraternity members at
Stanford.
A review board would find
that the majority of fraternity
members contribute as much if
not more to the Stanford com
munity than those male students
living in other situations. If a
list Ls desired, let it be submit
ted. In all probability it would
more than justify the academic
and extracurricular contribu
tions of Stanford fraternities as
significant and valuable.
However, if the review board
concerns itself with value judg
ments, as so many critics do,
there can be little of construc

tive value. Regardless of wheth
er or not such board would just
ify fraternities to its own satis
faction, it remains the student's
prerogative to join or not to
join.
In reply to one suggestion of
the subcommittee, one might
ask if any houses, in practice,
actually harbor racial or reli
gious restrictions.
The charge that the fraternity
is in practice opposed to educa
tion is largely unsubstantiated.
To suggest that the Stanford
fraternity destroys the self-dis
cipline of its members by grad
ual attrition is unrealistic.
The Stanford fraternity sys
tem offers an opportunity to at

To attack the abstract word
"fraternity" renders the attack
meaningless. The fact remains
that hundreds of Stanford stu

are satisfied with fraternity life.
We have as much right to re

Editor, The Daily:
The articles which have re
cently appeared in The Daily
regarding housing have made me
both sad and angry. In the first
place, I do not appreciate neo
muckraking in what is supposed
to be an academic community. Is
not our task that of dispassion
ately assessing the topic under
consideration, of viewing it ob
jectively and reasonably?
What The Daily has been
spewing is the venom of dog
matism, spitefulness, and mali
ciousness. This viciousness
(especially regarding fraterni
ties) made me heatedly angry—
for a minute or two. But the final
emotion was one of sadness.
I ask simply, who is to say?
Who is to evaluate someone
else's way of living? (I assume
that it does not contradict the
basic tenets of a free society—
that is, that selection of mem
bers to a living group is not
founded upon bigotry.)
Suppose it is not entirely aca
demic. Are the joys of a sunset
walk along a beach academic? Is
the peace and comfort of na
ture's forests and mountains part
of an academic pursuit? Must
one's whole life be tunneled into
one small corner of the mind?
Suppose people enjoy going to
weekend parties. Why should
that offend you?
Why must people internalize
the censor's morality and, in
frustration, adopt his sickness:
I shall decide how you should
live; I shall decide how you
should believe; I shall decide
how you should act.
What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into
their belief patterns? If these
elements must constantly devise
final solutions, I wish they would

be qualified as such. I am tired
of such polemics masquerading

journalistic or academic integrity

Editor, The Daily:
The articles which have re
cently appeared in The Daily
regarding housing have made me
both sad and angry. In the first
place, I do not appreciate neo
muckraking in what is supposed
to be an academic community. Is
not our task that of dispassion
ately assessing the topic under
consideration, of viewing it ob
jectively and reasonably?
What The Daily has been
spewing is the venom of dog
matism, spitefulness, and mali
ciousness. This viciousness
(especially regarding fraterni
ties) made me heatedly angry—
for a minute or two. But the final
emotion was one of sadness.
I ask simply, who is to say?
Who is to evaluate someone
else's way of living? (I assume
that it does not contradict the
basic tenets of a free society—
that is, that selection of mem
bers to a living group is not
founded upon bigotry.)
Suppose it is not entirely aca
demic. Are the joys of a sunset
walk along a beach academic? Is
the peace and comfort of na
ture's forests and mountains part
of an academic pursuit? Must
one's whole life be tunneled into
one small corner of the mind?
Suppose people enjoy going to
weekend parties. Why should
that offend you?
Why must people internalize
the censor's morality and, in
frustration, adopt his sickness:
I shall decide how you should
live; I shall decide how you
should believe; I shall decide
how you should act.
What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into
their belief patterns? If these
elements must constantly devise
final solutions, I wish they would

be qualified as such. I am tired
of such polemics masquerading
under the guise of supposed
journalistic or academic integrity
and objectivity. If there is some
thing worth saying, won't the
idea be strong enough to stand
alone?
Where are those who desire a
simple life, a child-like life, a
life full of wonder and search
ing, undogmatic, unideological,
unbound, unfettered? Is there
anyone left who remembers Hil
lel and Jesus: "Do unto others
as you would have done unto
yourself."
I am tired of being told I
must be either black or white.
I like gray. I am tired of being
told to choose between apples
and oranges. And I am sad to see
it happening here, to witness the
sickness of a crusader demand
ing that I believe in freedom
or die at his sword.

• Coexistence
Editor, The Daily:
What say we abolish the
Double Standard? It is becom
ing increasingly hard to stom
ach the distorted propaganda
directed at fraternities in the
name of justice and individual
rights. In the minds of some
there seems to be little to dis
tinguish the system of "selective
living" from wife-beating or
genocide.
And yet the fraternity is no
more responsible than any other
living group for the apathy and
intellectual immaturity that sur
rounds us. What have Stern
Hall, the Eating Clubs, et al con
tributed that they should escape
the verbal mortar shells with
which fraternities are constantly
being bombarded? Instead of in
dicting one group for the short
comings of all, let's challenge
the whole community to do
something with all of its wasted
potential.
I fail to see that the frater
nity is undermining the founda
tions of the University. What I
do see is that the self-appointed

brotherhood of anti-fraternity
"crusaders" is using cries of
sabotage to justify its own pecu
liar brand of moral despotism.
What greater hypocrisy than to
denounce fraternities for intol
erance, and then presume to
deny 1200 men the right to live
as they choose?
They claim that fraternities
cannot "continue to exist with
goals totally different from thr
rest of the University commu
nity". Since when does the "rest
of the community" have a right
to dictate my goals? Hopefully,
our collective goal as members
of the University community is
the establishment of an atmo
sphere wherein each individual
can find fulfillment in his own
way.
I may choose to live in a fra
ternity, but this doesn't imply
that I let "the rest" of the fra
ternity dictate my goals; I may
likewise choose to be a member
of the University community,
but again, I dtfn't expect "the
rest" of that community to forct
its values on me. Do I not have
the right to pursue those goals
which I believe are fitting, so
long as I do not interfere with
another man's right to do like
wise?
Certainly, fraternities are in
need of re-evaluation. But let's
not allow criticism to degenerate
to the level of absurdity. And to
propose that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney inves
tigate the so-called fraternitj
"Hell Week" is absurd. It is
more "hell" to sit through one
session of LASSU than to en
dure the "annoyance" and "em
barrassments" of Hell Week —
and certainly no more "educa
tional". After all, who at this
University is not in need of some
kind of re-evaluation — and who
can presume to say so?
The way to effect a change in
fraternities at Stanford is not
to attempt to coerce them. Let's
have something more positively
constructive. How constructive
is an arbitrary review board thai,
holds the power of life arid
death in its hand? If fraternitie.'
are to grow up, they should be
doing so along with the rest of
the University. Let's do away
with the antagonism of the "two
camps" and try to establish at
least a modicum of meaningful
coexistence.

LOY MARTIN
Editor, The Daily:
It is too bad that the Intellec

so piously concerned with the
Injustice of Rush, the Vice of
Fraternities, and Progressive
Educational Living, have effec
tively stifled any present chanc
es of intelligent improvement in
the fraternity system by mak
ing a cause of the whole affair.
Causes polarize and paralyse.
They present everything in
black and white, solidify public
sentiment, and force people to
champion one side or another.
Nothing is accomplished in this
manner. Champions promote
causes, not solutions. Nor can
compromise resolve this dilem
ma, for compromise between
violently opposed factions re
sults not in solutions, but only
in a higher degree of confusion
and ill-will.
Certainly the fraternity sys
tem has faults. Yet, nothing will
be resolved by offended bleating,
whether on the front page of
The Daily, in LASSU, or IFC.
Only harm can result from the
threatened investigation of Hell

District Attorney, just as only
harm could result from an in

by the narcotics squad.
It is always worthwhile to
critically evaluate a given situa

their existence any more than

It is inconsistent to argue that
selectivity is cause enough — or

What say we abolish the
Double Standard? It is becom
ing increasingly hard to stom
ach the distorted propaganda
directed at fraternities in the
name of justice and individual
rights. In the minds of some
there seems to be little to dis
tinguish the system of "selective
living" from wife-beating or
genocide.
And yet the fraternity is no
more responsible than any other
living group for the apathy and
intellectual immaturity that sur
rounds us. What have Stern
Hall, the Eating Clubs, et al con
tributed that they should escape
the verbal mortar shells with
which fraternities are constantly
being bombarded? Instead of in
dicting one group for the short
comings of all, let's challenge
the whole community to do
something with all of its wasted
potential.
I fail to see that the frater
nity is undermining the founda
tions of the University. What I
do see is that the self-appointed

brotherhood of anti-fraternity
"crusaders" is using cries of
sabotage to justify its own pecu
liar brand of moral despotism.
What greater hypocrisy than to
denounce fraternities for intol
erance, and then presume to
deny 1200 men the right to live
as they choose?
They claim that fraternities
cannot "continue to exist with
goals totally different from thr
rest of the University commu
nity". Since when does the "rest
of the community" have a right
to dictate my goals? Hopefully,
our collective goal as members
of the University community is
the establishment of an atmo
sphere wherein each individual
can find fulfillment in his own
way.
I may choose to live in a fra
ternity, but this doesn't imply
that I let "the rest" of the fra
ternity dictate my goals; I may
likewise choose to be a member
of the University community,
but again, I dtfn't expect "the
rest" of that community to forct
its values on me. Do I not have
the right to pursue those goals
which I believe are fitting, so
long as I do not interfere with
another man's right to do like
wise?
Certainly, fraternities are in
need of re-evaluation. But let's
not allow criticism to degenerate
to the level of absurdity. And to
propose that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney inves
tigate the so-called fraternitj
"Hell Week" is absurd. It is
more "hell" to sit through one
session of LASSU than to en
dure the "annoyance" and "em
barrassments" of Hell Week —
and certainly no more "educa
tional". After all, who at this
University is not in need of some
kind of re-evaluation — and who
can presume to say so?
The way to effect a change in
fraternities at Stanford is not
to attempt to coerce them. Let's
have something more positively

• Right To Live
Editor, The Daily:
Once again the Stanford fra
ternity system has been hit,
though this time with the added
weight of extremely effective
timing. The extended period of
evaluation of the fraternities ap
peared to be on the wane, in fa
vor of more responsible, orderly,
and well-represented discussion.
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion's subcommittee on frater
nities is, in some areas, lacking
both good judgment and an ap
preciation of the most basic
tenets and characteristics of a
Stanford fraternity. To suggest
the investigation of the Hell
Week/Help Weeks by the Dis
trict Attorney of Santa Clara
County, and to cite the Bill of
Rights as the fraternities' sole
protection against this investiga
tion is childish over-reaction to
problems readily acknowledged
by most fraternity members at
Stanford.
A review board would find
that the majority of fraternity
members contribute as much if
not more to the Stanford com
munity than those male students
living in other situations. If a
list Ls desired, let it be submit
ted. In all probability it would
more than justify the academic
and extracurricular contribu
tions of Stanford fraternities as
significant and valuable.
However, if the review board
concerns itself with value judg
ments, as so many critics do,
there can be little of construc

tive value. Regardless of wheth
er or not such board would just
ify fraternities to its own satis
faction, it remains the student's
prerogative to join or not to
join.
In reply to one suggestion of
the subcommittee, one might
ask if any houses, in practice,
actually harbor racial or reli
gious restrictions.
The charge that the fraternity
is in practice opposed to educa
tion is largely unsubstantiated.
To suggest that the Stanford
fraternity destroys the self-dis
cipline of its members by grad
ual attrition is unrealistic.
The Stanford fraternity sys
tem offers an opportunity to at

This opportunity is all too often
absent in other living situations.
To attack the abstract word
"fraternity" renders the attack
meaningless. The fact remains
that hundreds of Stanford stu

are satisfied with fraternity life.
We have as much right to re

• The Simple Life
Editor, The Daily:
The articles which have re
cently appeared in The Daily
regarding housing have made me
both sad and angry. In the first
place, I do not appreciate neo
muckraking in what is supposed
to be an academic community. Is
not our task that of dispassion
ately assessing the topic under
consideration, of viewing it ob
jectively and reasonably?
What The Daily has been
spewing is the venom of dog
matism, spitefulness, and mali
ciousness. This viciousness
(especially regarding fraterni
ties) made me heatedly angry—
for a minute or two. But the final
emotion was one of sadness.
I ask simply, who is to say?
Who is to evaluate someone
else's way of living? (I assume
that it does not contradict the
basic tenets of a free society—
that is, that selection of mem
bers to a living group is not
founded upon bigotry.)
Suppose it is not entirely aca
demic. Are the joys of a sunset
walk along a beach academic? Is
the peace and comfort of na
ture's forests and mountains part
of an academic pursuit? Must
one's whole life be tunneled into
one small corner of the mind?
Suppose people enjoy going to
weekend parties. Why should
that offend you?
Why must people internalize
the censor's morality and, in
frustration, adopt his sickness:
I shall decide how you should
live; I shall decide how you
should believe; I shall decide
how you should act.
What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into
their belief patterns? If these
elements must constantly devise
final solutions, I wish they would

be qualified as such. I am tired
of such polemics masquerading
under the guise of supposed
journalistic or academic integrity
and objectivity. If there is some
thing worth saying, won't the
idea be strong enough to stand
alone?
Where are those who desire a
simple life, a child-like life, a
life full of wonder and search
ing, undogmatic, unideological,
unbound, unfettered? Is there
anyone left who remembers Hil
lel and Jesus: "Do unto others
as you would have done unto
yourself."
I am tired of being told I
must be either black or white.
I like gray. I am tired of being
told to choose between apples
and oranges. And I am sad to see
it happening here, to witness the
sickness of a crusader demand

er the attackers of the frater
nity system have left us any op
portunity to improve it this
year, or even next year. We
must defend it. too vigorously to
allow ourselves the necessary
perspective. Fraternities have a
lot of potential, both realized
and unrealized. Given the oppor
tunity, they could certainly im
prove. Keep the pressure on, and
both attackers and defenders
will be doing themselves and the
University a disservice.

• Right To Live
Editor, The Daily:
Once again the Stanford fra
ternity system has been hit,
though this time with the added
weight of extremely effective
timing. The extended period of
evaluation of the fraternities ap
peared to be on the wane, in fa
vor of more responsible, orderly,
and well-represented discussion.
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion's subcommittee on frater
nities is, in some areas, lacking
both good judgment and an ap
preciation of the most basic
tenets and characteristics of a
Stanford fraternity. To suggest
the investigation of the Hell
Week/Help Weeks by the Dis
trict Attorney of Santa Clara
County, and to cite the Bill of
Rights as the fraternities' sole
protection against this investiga
tion is childish over-reaction to
problems readily acknowledged
by most fraternity members at
Stanford.
A review board would find
that the majority of fraternity
members contribute as much if
not more to the Stanford com
munity than those male students
living in other situations. If a
list Ls desired, let it be submit
ted. In all probability it would
more than justify the academic
and extracurricular contribu
tions of Stanford fraternities as
significant and valuable.
However, if the review board
concerns itself with value judg
ments, as so many critics do,
there can be little of construc

tive value. Regardless of wheth
er or not such board would just
ify fraternities to its own satis
faction, it remains the student's
prerogative to join or not to
join.
In reply to one suggestion of
the subcommittee, one might
ask if any houses, in practice,
actually harbor racial or reli
gious restrictions.
The charge that the fraternity
is in practice opposed to educa
tion is largely unsubstantiated.
To suggest that the Stanford
fraternity destroys the self-dis
cipline of its members by grad
ual attrition is unrealistic.
The Stanford fraternity sys
tem offers an opportunity to at
tain an effective balance of aca
demic, extra-curricular and so
cial activities befitting a respon-

Editor's note: The Housing Report, including the section on
fraternities, was prepared by the Housing Commission, not The

was of sufficient public interest to warrant publication in its en

sible member of our society.
This opportunity is all too often
absent in other living situations.
To attack the abstract word
"fraternity" renders the attack
meaningless. The fact remains
that hundreds of Stanford stu
dents are fraternity members,
and the great majority of them
are satisfied with fraternity life.
We have as much right to re
tain our values of life and our
expression of those values as do
other elements of the Stanford
community, providing they are
not disruptive and inconsiderate
of our fellow students' rights,
dignity, and endeavors.

• The Simple Life
Editor, The Daily:
The articles which have re
cently appeared in The Daily
regarding housing have made me
both sad and angry. In the first
place, I do not appreciate neo
muckraking in what is supposed
to be an academic community. Is
not our task that of dispassion
ately assessing the topic under
consideration, of viewing it ob
jectively and reasonably?
What The Daily has been
spewing is the venom of dog
matism, spitefulness, and mali
ciousness. This viciousness
(especially regarding fraterni
ties) made me heatedly angry—
for a minute or two. But the final
emotion was one of sadness.
I ask simply, who is to say?
Who is to evaluate someone
else's way of living? (I assume
that it does not contradict the
basic tenets of a free society—
that is, that selection of mem
bers to a living group is not
founded upon bigotry.)
Suppose it is not entirely aca
demic. Are the joys of a sunset
walk along a beach academic? Is
the peace and comfort of na
ture's forests and mountains part
of an academic pursuit? Must
one's whole life be tunneled into
one small corner of the mind?
Suppose people enjoy going to
weekend parties. Why should
that offend you?
Why must people internalize
the censor's morality and, in
frustration, adopt his sickness:
I shall decide how you should
live; I shall decide how you
should believe; I shall decide
how you should act.
What a absurd hyprocisy for
the very people who vigorously
protest University interference
and control to turn around, as
sume a different mask, open a
different bag and take from it a

different sword which threatens
to destroy a way of living. What,
then, is the difference between
the malevolent administration
and the benevolent students?
I am reminded of the plight of
Dr. Zhivago. Why is a dogmatic
ideology necessary? Cannot a
person just live? Especially at a
university. Is not this supposed
to be a place whose huge doors
swing open to the curious, to the
searchers, to those who seek not
destruction but answers? (An
swers for them, not for me. I am
only one capable of finding my
answers.)
Why must The Daily or some
committee (how odious a word
that is becoming) bully me into
their belief patterns? If these
elements must constantly devise
final solutions, I wish they would

be qualified as such. I am tired
of such polemics masquerading
under the guise of supposed
journalistic or academic integrity
and objectivity. If there is some
thing worth saying, won't the
idea be strong enough to stand
alone?
Where are those who desire a
simple life, a child-like life, a
life full of wonder and search
ing, undogmatic, unideological,
unbound, unfettered? Is there
anyone left who remembers Hil
lel and Jesus: "Do unto others
as you would have done unto
yourself."
I am tired of being told I
must be either black or white.
I like gray. I am tired of being
told to choose between apples
and oranges. And I am sad to see
it happening here, to witness the
sickness of a crusader demand
ing that I believe in freedom
or die at his sword.

• Coexistence
Editor, The Daily:
What say we abolish the
Double Standard? It is becom
ing increasingly hard to stom
ach the distorted propaganda
directed at fraternities in the
name of justice and individual
rights. In the minds of some
there seems to be little to dis
tinguish the system of "selective
living" from wife-beating or
genocide.
And yet the fraternity is no
more responsible than any other
living group for the apathy and
intellectual immaturity that sur
rounds us. What have Stern
Hall, the Eating Clubs, et al con
tributed that they should escape
the verbal mortar shells with
which fraternities are constantly
being bombarded? Instead of in
dicting one group for the short
comings of all, let's challenge
the whole community to do
something with all of its wasted
potential.
I fail to see that the frater
nity is undermining the founda
tions of the University. What I
do see is that the self-appointed

brotherhood of anti-fraternity
"crusaders" is using cries of
sabotage to justify its own pecu
liar brand of moral despotism.
What greater hypocrisy than to
denounce fraternities for intol
erance, and then presume to
deny 1200 men the right to live
as they choose?
They claim that fraternities
cannot "continue to exist with
goals totally different from thr
rest of the University commu
nity". Since when does the "rest
of the community" have a right
to dictate my goals? Hopefully,
our collective goal as members
of the University community is
the establishment of an atmo
sphere wherein each individual
can find fulfillment in his own
way.
I may choose to live in a fra
ternity, but this doesn't imply
that I let "the rest" of the fra
ternity dictate my goals; I may
likewise choose to be a member
of the University community,
but again, I dtfn't expect "the
rest" of that community to forct
its values on me. Do I not have
the right to pursue those goals
which I believe are fitting, so
long as I do not interfere with
another man's right to do like
wise?
Certainly, fraternities are in
need of re-evaluation. But let's
not allow criticism to degenerate
to the level of absurdity. And to
propose that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney inves
tigate the so-called fraternitj
"Hell Week" is absurd. It is
more "hell" to sit through one
session of LASSU than to en
dure the "annoyance" and "em
barrassments" of Hell Week —
and certainly no more "educa
tional". After all, who at this
University is not in need of some
kind of re-evaluation — and who
can presume to say so?
The way to effect a change in
fraternities at Stanford is not
to attempt to coerce them. Let's
have something more positively
constructive. How constructive
is an arbitrary review board thai,
holds the power of life arid
death in its hand? If fraternitie.'
are to grow up, they should be
doing so along with the rest of
the University. Let's do away
with the antagonism of the "two
camps" and try to establish at
least a modicum of meaningful
coexistence.

• Bit Of Irony
Editor, The Daily:
The report of the fraternitj
subcommittee was great. After
paragraphs consisting almost,
totally of random quotations ex
tracted from obviously cursory
interviews, the author heartily
censures a rush system which
allows each member only "1.3
minutes" with each rushee ii'.
each open house. This paragon
of tortured prose was the most
hilarious bit of irony The Dail>
has printed in months.
