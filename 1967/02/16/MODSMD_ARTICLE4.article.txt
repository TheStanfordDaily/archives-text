# Alumni Denounce Lyman, Packer; Decry Sympathy Toward 'Activists'
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
Tne Winds of Freedom Foundation,
a group of conservative Stanford
alumni, has charged the backgrounds
of recently appointed Provost Richard
Lyman and Vice-Provost Herbert
Packer are damaging to Stanford and
its students.
In its "Bulletin Number Seven"
dated January, 1967, the Foundation
called the appointments by President
Sterling "so extraordinary as to call
for continuing scrutiny by the friends
of Stanford." Lyman, a historian, was
sharply criticized for signing a letter
urging the suspension of bombing of
North Vietnam and for advocating ad
mission of Communist China into the
United Nations. The Foundation de
nounced Packer, a law professor, for
his opposition to the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee and for sup
port of police review boards as well
as his "long time affiliation with the
American Civil Liberties Union."
Lack of Understanding
In a statement issued yesterday,
Robert Byers, Stanford Director of
News and Publications said: "The
underlying assumption that President
Sterling and the Trustees would ap
point anyone on the basis of his po
litical views instead of his profession
al competence shows a lack of under
standing of how a University oper
ates. Stanford's rise in academic sta
ture would not have been possible if
the University made appointments on
any basis except merit."
The Foundation Bulletin quoted
from an open letter to President John
son demanding him to stop the bomb
ing in North Vietnam. The letter is

signed by Lyman and other Univer
sity professors. Lyman also added his
name to an article which appeared in
the San Francisco Examiner entitled
"War with China? Recognize China"
and participated in the Vietnam Day
Teach-in in May, 1965. According to
the Bulletin, since "the two public
positions Dr. Lyman has taken are
contrary to the official policies of the
United States. The turmoil of protest
against government policy on the cam
pus could certainly be fanned by the
elevation of one so active in agitation
as Dr. Lyman. Is there really any
necessity for the Berkeley disruptions
to be repeated at Stanford?"
The alumni accuse the University of
sympathy for the Left in the appoint
ment of Packer. They claim that Pack
er was installed on the faculty be

cause a grant from the Fund for the
Republic offered $25,000 for a five
year study of the testimony of wit
nesses during hearings into Commu
nist infiltration of the Federal gov
ernment with the stipulation that
Packer head the study. Furthermore
they berate Stanford for turning down
similar gifts with ties offered by mem
bers of the right wing.
Lyle M. Nelson, University Rela
tions Director categorically denied any
such prejudice. Nelson said Professor
Packer was approached about joining
the Law School faculty two years be
fore the grant and there was no con
dition in the grant, either expressed
or implied, that Packer be hired to di
rect the study.
Contacted last night, Packer said,
"I leave it to my equals in the aca
demic community to judge my compe

tance to hold the position to which I
have been appointed."
Rewards to Activists
The Foundation went on to say the
"rewards in the form of administra
tive positions seem to have gone to
the political activists. That message
gets through to all members of the
Stanford faculty." According to the
"Bulletin". "The contrasts and qualifi
cations of the previous Provost and the
new leadership is so striking that any
alumnus could conclude that profound
changes in the course of Stanford are
predictable."
The alumni group has been ex
tremely critical of University policy
during the last two years. Morton
D'Evelyn, President of the Winds of
Freedom, was unavailable for com
ment.
