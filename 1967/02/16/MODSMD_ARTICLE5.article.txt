## 
### GAYLORD SHAW Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON â€” President John
son stepped directly yesterday into
the controversy over the Central Intel
ligence Agency's undercover payments
to the National Student Association.
He ordered a review of any govern
ment activities that might endanger
the integrity of U.S. educational
groups.
The President also told key officials
to draft a policy to guide government
agencies "in their relationship to the

international activities of American
education organizations."
NSA leaders declined to comment
on Johnson's order, which was an
nounced by Undersecretary of State
Nicholas Katzenbach.
The President's action came one
day after officials acknowledged the
CIA for more than a decade has sup
plied substantial funds to the NSA,
the nation's largest college student
group.
And it followed within hours of un

official reports that the government's
chief espionage agency had secretly
channeled funds to three other student
groups.
Review May Widen
Katzenbach's statement left open
the possibility the review would ex
tend also into government subsidies
of private organizations outside the
Turning specifically to educational
groups, the statement said "The Presi
dent believes strongly that the in
tegrity and independence of the ed
ucational community must be pre
served. He has directed a careful re
view of any government activities
that may endanger this integrity and
independence."
Johnson directed Katzenbach, CIA
Director Richard Helms, and Secre
tary of Welfare John W. Gardner "to
formulate a policy which will provide
necessary guidance for government
agencies in their relationship to the
international activities of American
educational organizations," said Kat
zenbach's statement, issued by State
Department Press Officer Robert J.
McCloskey.
Flee From Poland
In another development, an NSA
official said an American exchange
student was whisked out of Poland
just before the group's link with the
CIA came to light.
The student, Roger Pulver, 22, Cul
ver City, Calif., was attending the Uni
versity of Krakow when NSA cabled
him to attend an emergency meeting
in London at once, said Robert Cutner,
the NSA official.
"If they had learned we were backed
by the CIA they would have put Roger
in jail and thrown away the key,"
Cutner said.
A Washington newspaper, The Eve
ning Star, reported the CIA has sup
plied millions of dollars to three stu
dent organizations in addition to NSA-
It identified the three others as the
U.S. Youth Council, with headquarters
in New York; the World Assembly of
Youth in Brussels, Belgium; and the
International Student Conference in
Leiden, Netherlands.
McCloskey said he was unable to say
whether the President had ordered a
suspension of CIA aid to student
groups. He said he did not know of
any deadline for completion of the re
view.
Meanwhile, Rep. Robert W. Kasten
meier, D Wis., said top officers of the
NSA automatically received a 2A
occupational draft deferment. "It goes
with the job," he said.
An NSA spokesman denied the
charges, saying the group's top two
officers are classified IA. Gen. Lewis
B. Hershey, Selective Service System
Director, declined comment. But a
Selective Service spokesman said "six
of these men in NSA have their
classifications under appeal." He said
he did not have their names.
On Capitol Hill, Sen. Ralph Yar
borough, D-Tex., offered a bill to pro
vide financing for travel to interna
tional youth conferences by selected
students and called for an inquiry by
the Senate Education Subcommittee
into CIA operations he said may in
fluence the American educational pro
cess.
