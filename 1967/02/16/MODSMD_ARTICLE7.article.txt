# FRAT RUSH ANALYSIS
## 'Average' First-Night Turnout 
### 
Rush 1967 for fraternities officially
began last night with the first frater
nity open houses. On the whole, rush
chairmen reported that their crowds
were "about average" in size and that
freshmen seemed better informed and
much more curious than usual.
One fraternity spokesman reported
that freshmon "questioned and chal
lenged us quite a bit. They seemed a
great deal more concerned than ever
before."
A second mentioned that the crowd
at his house was "better but different"
from the usual. "The freshmen are
looking for houses that are changing,"
he said. "They are wary of the tradi
tional, old-fashioned type fraternity
and are more conscious of things like
hazing."
We were highly impressed with the
people who came," said a third. "They
wanted to know the whole story of
what we have to offer."
Housing Report
Most rush chairmen felt that the
Housing Commission report had little
influence on crowd size. "I wouldn't
say it created a favorable impression,"

reported one fraternity man, "but I
don't think it affected the freshmen
too much."
Another rush chairman mentioned
that "the freshmen had heard one
side of the story and wanted to see
the other."
Low Blow
Some reactions were more violent.
"We're in a complete utter bind at
the moment," one rush chairman em
phasized. "How can you invite a fresh
man to come up and see the hduse
when all he knows Is that there is
lurid torture going on? What the hell
can we do?"
"I hope the freshmen will take it
upon themselves to find out that fra
ternity men are not just beer-bellied
people that sit around and beat people
up.
"We feel we've been dealt a very
low blow," he concluded.
Reaction
A member of another fraternity re
ported that the crowd was "very good,
probably in reaction to the report."
He added that "it was a tremendous
coincidence that the report was pub
lished at the time it was."

Another callcd the publication date
"some sort of conspiracy."
Crowds ranged from 15 to almost
200 people. Compared with previous
years, most fraternities rated the
crowds from "about average" to "very
good."
A few fraternities wore visited by
fewer freshmen than they had ex
pected, but none seemed extremely
concerned. "There was greater con
tact prior to the open houses," one
member explained. "With meal ex
changes. freshmen don't have to hit
all the houses in two or three nights."
Cocktail Crowd
One fraternity member mentioned
that the crowd at his house had
dwindled to "cocktail size," contrary
to the large number of people in past
years. He evaluated the drop as a
"general suspicion of fraternities by
freshmen."
Most, however, preferred the word
"curious" to "suspicious." "They had
a very different attitude," one rush
chairman reported. "Probably the
housing report did create greater in
terest."

up.
"We feel we've been dealt a very
low blow," he concluded.
Reaction
A member of another fraternity re
ported that the crowd was "very good,
probably in reaction to the report."
He added that "it was a tremendous
coincidence that the report was pub
lished at the time it was."

Another callcd the publication date
"some sort of conspiracy."
Crowds ranged from 15 to almost
200 people. Compared with previous
years, most fraternities rated the
crowds from "about average" to "very
good."
A few fraternities wore visited by
fewer freshmen than they had ex
pected, but none seemed extremely
concerned. "There was greater con
tact prior to the open houses," one
member explained. "With meal ex
changes. freshmen don't have to hit
all the houses in two or three nights."
Cocktail Crowd
One fraternity member mentioned
that the crowd at his house had
dwindled to "cocktail size," contrary
to the large number of people in past
years. He evaluated the drop as a
"general suspicion of fraternities by
freshmen."
Most, however, preferred the word
"curious" to "suspicious." "They had
a very different attitude," one rush
chairman reported. "Probably the
housing report did create greater in
terest."
Rush 1967 for fraternities officially
began last night with the first frater
nity open houses. On the whole, rush
chairmen reported that their crowds
were "about average" in size and that
freshmen seemed better informed and
much more curious than usual.
One fraternity spokesman reported
that freshmon "questioned and chal
lenged us quite a bit. They seemed a
great deal more concerned than ever
before."
A second mentioned that the crowd
at his house was "better but different"
from the usual. "The freshmen are
looking for houses that are changing,"
he said. "They are wary of the tradi
tional, old-fashioned type fraternity
and are more conscious of things like
hazing."
We were highly impressed with the
people who came," said a third. "They
wanted to know the whole story of
what we have to offer."
Housing Report
Most rush chairmen felt that the
Housing Commission report had little
influence on crowd size. "I wouldn't
say it created a favorable impression,"

reported one fraternity man, "but I
don't think it affected the freshmen
too much."
Another rush chairman mentioned
that "the freshmen had heard one
side of the story and wanted to see
the other."
Low Blow
Some reactions were more violent.
"We're in a complete utter bind at
the moment," one rush chairman em
phasized. "How can you invite a fresh
man to come up and see the hduse
when all he knows Is that there is
lurid torture going on? What the hell
can we do?"
"I hope the freshmen will take it
upon themselves to find out that fra
ternity men are not just beer-bellied
people that sit around and beat people
up.
"We feel we've been dealt a very
low blow," he concluded.
