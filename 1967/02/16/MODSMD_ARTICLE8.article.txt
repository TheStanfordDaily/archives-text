# Reason Dominates In Curriculum Changes

### SUZETTE LEITH 
At the core of a Stanford education
are the almost 2,000 courses offered
each quarter.
No two quarters present identical of
ferings; each year, numerous courses
are added or subtracted from the cur
riculum.
Nearly all decisions to add courses
are made at the departmental level.
According to Humanities and Sciences
Dean Robert Sears, once a department
, has decided to offer a course, no fur
ther approval is necessary. "Depart
ments are quite autonomous in this
respect," he commented.
' Within the various departments,
Sears stated, "the key to initiating new
is the professor." The usual
procedure, he said, is for a professor
to present his idea to the department,
and "nine times out of ten, the depart
-1 ment will approve."
Suggestions
Economics Professor Lorie Tarshis
.• concurred that in his department, "un
less there is a real manpower con
, straint" a professor's suggestion is nor
mally approved by the department.
Political Science Professor Sidney
Verba stressed the flexibility available

to faculty members and termed the sit
uation a "healthy state of individual
anarchy."
Secondly, Sears continued, a new
course can be proposed by a depart
ment head, committee or faculty as a
whole. "Sometimes a department head
will 'locate a hole in the offering* and
suggest changes," commented Profes
sor Tarshis.
About two years ago, he explained,
departmental pressure stimulated a re
organization of the economics curricu
lum .Before the change, Economics 1,
5, 10, 111 and 120 had composed a
"core" program for majors; now 1, 5,
10, 105, 110 and 111 are required.
"The department felt that the core
program was not strong enough," Tar
shis explained. "There was pressure on
lecturers to repeat the essence of the
core at the start of their own courses."
Two new courses (105 and 110) were
added, and because the size of the fac
ulty had not increased, certain courses
such as one in international economics
and one in taxation were dropped, their
material largely incorporated into the
two new courses.
The third procedure for initiating a
course is by students, a method that

Sears termed "very possible in theory"
but one that is rarely used. If students
can find a professor willing to teach a
new course, he stressed, it can usually
be offered.
Students can get "almost anything
they want," he said, if they can find a
professor who thinks their idea is
"worthy of a Stanford education."
"It just takes some initiative," he em
phasized.
Sears pointed to one area of student
initiative — the undergraduate special
seminars, interdepartmental courses
often connected with living groups. The
procedure is for students to line up a
faculty member and present their re
quest to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. According to Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Education Rob
ert Hind, approval by CUE is "virtual
ly automatic."
The fourth procedure mentioned by
Sears is initiation by the Dean or a
committee of the Academic Council.
Again, all specific action is taken by
the faculties of individual departments.
"We rarely suggest specific courses
to be added," Sears mentioned. "The
main effort is to get departments to
offer new courses."

"It's a constant struggle," he said.
"The hardest thing to do is to get any
one to drop a course."
Reducing the number of courses Is
necessary, he explained, because "de
partments get overloaded, and profes
sors are often hyperbusy with prepar
ing lectures, student counseling, writ
ing, and research."
Courses are dropped as well as add
ed at the departmental level. Professor
Tarshis mentioned that economics
courses are usually dropped when the
person primarily responsible for them
leaves.
Also, he continued, the department's
views concerning what is an appropri
ate offering might change. Before
World War 11, for example, the Eco
nomics Department offered a "real con
centration in accounting."
A professor is rarely requested to
stop teaching a course if he desires to
continue, however. "Chances are his
interest makes what could be a mar
ginal course very desirable," Tarshis
commented.
According to Sears, new courses are
mainly stimulated by the development
of a new field, usually in the natural
sciences, or by a new interest a par

ticular professor has developed.
The Political Science 15 series, for
example, was initiated last year in or
der "to reflect a change in the disci
pline," stated Professor Verba, a found
er of the course.
Inadequate Titles
He added that professors were flex
ible in that they could restructure an
existing course as well as start a new
one. "Titles are often very inadequate
descriptions of what's in a course," he
said, and it is very easy for a professor
to offer something new within the
framework of an existing course.
Prerequisites are also determined by
the professors, although they might be
discussed in the departments if they
are important to a major sequence.
"This is a prerogative professors have
always had," Sears stated.
Course numbers, too, are assigned
by the various departments. Registrar
Harvey Hall noted that the University
sets up general guidelines in which 0-99
indicate courses primarily for fresh
men and sophomores, 100-199 for upper
classmen, and 200 and above for gradu
ate students. The department, then,
"looks for a number that's never been
used before," Sears explained.
