If you filled in the puzzle correctly, you've probably guessed we're in the business of guiding
vehicles. If it floats, crawls, flies or orbits, chances are we're at work on a guidance, navigation
or control system for it.
For instance, we're building the guidance/navigation system for Apollo and LM (Lunar Module);
we're working on SABRE, the new Self-Aligning Boost and Reentry system for missiles; on the
Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL); on the Titan 111-C Space Booster; and on avionics systems
for supersonic and subsonic aircraft of the future.
We're also working on the Ship's Self-Contained Navigation System (SSCNS) for the Navy; a
fire-control system for the new Main Battle Tank, a joint U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany
program; and advanced digital computer development for other military, space and commercial
applications.
You might like to know that we take your career growth seriously here at AC, too. Our Career
Acceleration Program includes "in-plant" instruction. There is also a Tuition Refund Plan
available for any college-level courses taken to advance your career.
If you're completing your B.S. or M S. degree in E.E., M E., Math or Physics, check into the excit
ing career opportunities at any of our three locations - Milwaukee, Boston, and Santa Barbara.
See your college placement officer or write: Mr. R.W. Schroeder, Dir. of Scientific & Professional
Employment, AC Electronics Division, Dept. 5753, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201.
Ph.D.s, please note: positions are available in all three AC locations, depending upon concen
tration of study and area of interest.

If you filled in the puzzle correctly, you've probably guessed we're in the business of guiding
vehicles. If it floats, crawls, flies or orbits, chances are we're at work on a guidance, navigation
or control system for it.
For instance, we're building the guidance/navigation system for Apollo and LM (Lunar Module);
we're working on SABRE, the new Self-Aligning Boost and Reentry system for missiles; on the
Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL); on the Titan 111-C Space Booster; and on avionics systems
for supersonic and subsonic aircraft of the future.
We're also working on the Ship's Self-Contained Navigation System (SSCNS) for the Navy; a
fire-control system for the new Main Battle Tank, a joint U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany
program; and advanced digital computer development for other military, space and commercial
applications.
You might like to know that we take your career growth seriously here at AC, too. Our Career
Acceleration Program includes "in-plant" instruction. There is also a Tuition Refund Plan
available for any college-level courses taken to advance your career.
