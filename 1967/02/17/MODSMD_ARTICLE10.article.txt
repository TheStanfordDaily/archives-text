# SF State Students Declare 'World War IV'
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
World War IV begins today, ASSU
President Dave Harris announced yes
terday.
Starting with a major skirmish in
San Francisco, the war will move in
successive weeks to such well-known
battlefields as Stanford and Berkeley.
Organized by the Experimental Col
lege, the Associated Students and the
War Resisters League at San Fran
cisco State College, "World War IV"
is a kind of happening centered
around a theme of war games. This
same group, under the direction of
Stuart Brand, organized the show

called "Whatever It is" at San Fran
cisco State last fall.
Bann<>d At Berkeley
The idea of the show is a series of
physical games employing the ener
gies and forces people would use in
war to "have fun rather than kill peo
ple," Harris stated.
As of now, the Berkeley adminis
tration has banned the show from
campus, and Stanford was contacted
too late to make arrangements for
this weekend, so the program this
weekend will probably take place all
three days at S.F. State.
Eventually, next week or later, the

program will appear at Stanford.
War Game*
Various "war games" will highlight
the show. One of these, "Earthball,"
involves a 6 foot pushball painted to
resemble a globe, for people who
would like to push the world around.
In another game, "Commie Mon
ster," papier-mache monsters are con
structed, with the painted-on face of
a favorite Commie and/or monster,
after which everyone gets together
with sticks to destroy the creature.
Thrffi Rands
In "Draft Board," the only way to
get out of a room is to convince the

people there that you are a conscien
tious objector. Other games include
the Flag Game, War College, and a
Heckling Workshop.
Three bands will be on the sceneâ€”
Wildower, the San Andreas Fault
Finders, and the Anonymous Artists
of America. There will also be a tape
of religious music and war sounds in
juxtaposition, entitled "War God."
"We've been in the middle of World
War 111 for a long time now," com
mented Stuart Brand, "and World
War 111 is a drag.
"We're declaring World War IV,"
he said, "as the War on War."
