It's the talk of the town. If
the word hasn't gotten out yet,
it will. It's there.
It's what's happening, man.
They have arrived and their
scene is a groove. A couple of
blocks from campus, on the sec
ond floor of a pizza joint.
The word, the scene is the IL
LEGITIMATE THEATRE at the
Tangent pizza joint.

Out of sight. Take the trip
. . . costs about a buck-fifty.
You'll laugh so hard that you'll
bust your bladder.
It's a gas ... the nitrous oxide
odor, I mean.
Illegitimate theatre is what the
Committee in S.F. tried to fake
their scene after. But the Illegit
Fit is so far our of control that
the Commit pit has to take up
arms with a used-up, dried
down. washed-out aerosal bom

bast of deodoronorisms. To wit.
I'm throwing you a tipper,
ducky Jackabye, it's there and
on the weekends and beor and

Man, like you're an iceburger,
with plenty of pickerel roelish.
Get it, burry fisket, roe — lish.
Ha, burry fisket eats a bug. To
wit. Only the part of you stick
ing out of the blimey deep is
your nasanal lip.
I couldn't, bugaboo, if I start
ed tomorrow and told you all
day today how much I enjoyed
the Illitimate Theatre last night,
give the Illigitimate is just dew.
It's fresh, like a frosty morn;
it's new, like the smell of aged
pumpernickel dough to the her
mit who h?s never smelled
pumpernickel dough at any time
in his whole dirty life; and it's
great, like the show at the Tan
gent called the Illigitimate
Theatre.
Like you're like friction in a
motion machine if you're not
there this cloudy eve.

ed tomorrow and told you all
day today how much I enjoyed
the Illitimate Theatre last night,
give the Illigitimate is just dew.
It's fresh, like a frosty morn;
it's new, like the smell of aged
pumpernickel dough to the her
mit who h?s never smelled
pumpernickel dough at any time
in his whole dirty life; and it's
great, like the show at the Tan
gent called the Illigitimate
Theatre.
Like you're like friction in a
motion machine if you're not
there this cloudy eve.
It's the talk of the town. If
the word hasn't gotten out yet,
it will. It's there.
It's what's happening, man.
They have arrived and their
scene is a groove. A couple of
blocks from campus, on the sec
ond floor of a pizza joint.
The word, the scene is the IL
LEGITIMATE THEATRE at the
Tangent pizza joint.

Out of sight. Take the trip
. . . costs about a buck-fifty.
You'll laugh so hard that you'll
bust your bladder.
It's a gas ... the nitrous oxide
odor, I mean.
Illegitimate theatre is what the
Committee in S.F. tried to fake
their scene after. But the Illegit
Fit is so far our of control that
the Commit pit has to take up
arms with a used-up, dried
down. washed-out aerosal bom

bast of deodoronorisms. To wit.
I'm throwing you a tipper,
ducky Jackabye, it's there and
on the weekends and beor and
insanity and the Illegit fit is
there. You're a drag, dollbuggy,
if you miss it.
Flame-throwers aside, wicky
biscuit, you are saying that this
Buffldilmat or Imillitimation or
whatever you were jobberwock
ing about is the ....
Man, like you're an iceburger,
with plenty of pickerel roelish.
Get it, burry fisket, roe — lish.
Ha, burry fisket eats a bug. To
wit. Only the part of you stick
ing out of the blimey deep is
your nasanal lip.
I couldn't, bugaboo, if I start
ed tomorrow and told you all
day today how much I enjoyed
the Illitimate Theatre last night,
give the Illigitimate is just dew.
