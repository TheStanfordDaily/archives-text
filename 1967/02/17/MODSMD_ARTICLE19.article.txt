THEATER
RAM'S Head's fine production of THE BOY FRIEND winds up
this weekend with performances tonight, tomorrow afternoon and
night. "The Boy Friend" is Sandy Wilson's light-hearted satire of
high society life in the Roaring Twenties.
THE COMMITTEE, a San Francisco comedy group, appears at
Dinkelspiel this afternoon. Their skits, improvisations and as
sorted wild comic routines have attracted rave reviews, though I
have been unable so far to persuade any of my raving reviewers
(see rest of page) to report on their antics.
MOVIES
Unionites would do well tonight to see YOJIMBA, a knock-down,
slice-em-up Eastern about an opportunistic samurai who hires him
self out to the highest bidder—and alternates allegiance according
ly—in a bloody small town battle. When the dust clears after the
final battle, there remains one survivor in a field of dead bodies, the
samurai, who complacently observes, "Now there'll be some peace
in this town." "Yojimba" is the third Akira Kurosawa movie to be
shown in the Tresidder Japanese Film Series (others, "The Seven
Samuri" and "Roshomon." It offers abundant evidence of the su
perb story-telling talents which assure Kurosawa his eminent, if
not fully heralded, position among contemporary directors.
I look upon myself as a reasonably warm-hearted and—the truth
be whispered—even a sentimental man, and yet for the warmest,
most sentimental part of me I fail to understand what it is in A
MAN AND A WOMAN which appears to stir the deepest wells of
sympathy in other moviegoers. The photography has a certain
lyrical touch, to be sure, and there is the pleasing melodiousness of
the music; but isn't the love-story, supposedly what this movie's all
about, rather weak and shallow? Love may do wondrous things,
but it seems to me that in this instance love failed to make a prince
out of a dull, insipid man, and failed to make a princess out of
a cool and moribund woman. Also, the life-for-life's-sake theme
seemed little more than simplicity-for-the-simple-minded. Perhaps
the movie lost me when the lovers agreed that if it came down to
a pinch they would rather save a stray cat than a Rembrandt. I
don't particuliarly like Rembrandt, but I like cats far less.
I just received a note telling me that I had been incorrect in re
porting that the STUTTGART CHAMBER ORCHESTRA concert
would be on Wednesday, February 22. Instead, it will be today, Feb
ruary 24. The offended party wrote further, "while others may criti
cize, I thank you for the error—it established a scuny of people to
the box office, and this will help us a great deal." Which was what
I had intended to do in the first place.
