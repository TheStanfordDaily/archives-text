# Guest-In-Residence To Speak On 'Identity'
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Dr. Rollow May, a New York
psychoanalyst and guidance coun
selor, will deliver a lecture at 4:15
p.m. today in Memorial Church on
"Myth and Identity: The Function of
Myth in Psychological Integration."
At 7:30 tonight he will participate in
an informal discussion group in
Madera Lounge.
Both of May's appearances are open
to the public and are sponsored as
part of the Wilbur Houses' Guest in
Residence Program.

Prior to receiving his Ph.D. from
Columbia University in 1949, May
served as a student counselor at Mich
igan State College and College of the
City of New York.
In addition to his current practice
as a psychoanalyst in New York, May
is serving as a supervisory and train
ing analyst at the William Alanson
White Institute of Psychiatry, Psy
chology and Psychoanalysis, Adjunct
Professor at New York University,
and Fellow of the National Council of
Religion in Higher Education.
May is the editor of a number of
books, among which are Existence: A
New Dimension in Psychiatry and
Psychology and Existential Psychol
ogy. He has just written a book en
titled Psychology and the Human Di
lemma and will publish another one
this spring entitled Love and Will.
John Brown, program director for
Wilbur's Guest in Residence Program,
feels that the lecture should be of
special interest to freshmen who are
taking Western Civ. "The discussion
group in Madera Lounge this eve
ning will offer a chance to ask Dr.
May questions about the lecture or
about psychology and theology in gen
eral," said Brown.
Additional guests in the Wilbur
series will include Norman Cousins,
Editor of the Saturday Review
who will be a guest in residence from
March sixth through the eighth.
