# 'Georgy Girl' Mushy Flick
## 
### 
Hey there, Georgy girl,/ Swin
ging down the street so fancy
free./ Nobody you meet could
ever see/The loneliness there,/
Inside you.
Hey there, Georgy girl,/ Why
do all the boys just pass you
by?/Could it be you just don't
try,/Or is it the clothes you
wear?/You're always window
shopping/But never stopping to
buy, /So shed those dowdy
feathers and fly,/A little bit.
Hey there, Georgy girl,/ Drea
ming of the someone you could
be./ Life is a reality,/ You can't
always run away /Don't be so
scared of changing/And rear
ranging yourself./ It's time for
jumping down from the self,/
A little bit.
Hey there, Georgy girl,/
There's another Georgy deep in
side. /Bring out all the love you
hide, / And oh what change
there'd be, / The world would
see,/A new Georgy gir1.—1966
