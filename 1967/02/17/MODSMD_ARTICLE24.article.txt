# HOST UCLA, NCAA CHAMP USC
## Swimmers Face Country's Best 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Stanford swimmers face the
stiffest of tests this weekend as
overpowered UCLA hits the En
cina Pool today at 3 p.m., and
defending NCAA champions
USC follow in the Bruins' wake
Saturday at 2 p.m.
At least 10 members of the
next Olympic team will come
from these three squads.
USC has run up a string of
80 straight dual meet wins, and
has hoarded the NCAA cham
pionship trophy at Troy for the
past four years. Swimming
World magazine picked the Tro
jans to win again in 19G7.
USC Dangerous
Stanford's impressive statisti
cal domination of the AAWU
will stand for little this week
end. USC's coach Peter Daland
always saves the USC "peak"
for late in the season, and has
left a surprised collegiate field
in wallowing second place more
than once.
UCLA edged the Indians in
the last relay in a dual meet
last year, but the Indians came
back to firmly beat the Bruins
in the NCAA's. UCLA's fresh
man team won the AAU indoor
nationals last spring.
Southern Cal has lost some of
Its biggest guns from last year's
NCAA champion squad. Roy
Saari, who holds 4 NCAA rec
ords and won 9 NCAA titles, has
graduated. Olympian Bill Craig,
NCAA 100 breaststroke record
holder, is gone, as well as 400
IM record holder Rich McGeagh
and Olympian Bob Bennett.
NCAA Champ Lends Troy
NCAA 200 breaststroke cham
pion Wayne Anderson returns
for USC with plenty of com
pany. John Danielson and Olym
pic swimmer Sandy Gilchrist
handle the distance chores, while
John Lambert and hot sopho
mores Russ Kidder and John
Havens are tearing up the AA
WU sprint rankings.

Dean Willeford, Mike Siebert,
Buddy Bates, and John Milam
are Trojan workhorses who can
swim in four or five places. All
placed well in the NCAA's last
season, though Saari's perfor
mances overshadowed their ef
forts.
JC transfer Bill Johnson and
backsti oker Greg We s c o 11

World Record Holders
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton is one of the big
gest reason's for the Bruins'
threat in 1967. Burton, who
holds the national record for
the 1650 (16:27) will race Stan
ford's Greg Buckingham in the
1000 free.
Buckingham holds the nation
al 500 free record of 4:41.1 and
set an NCAA record of 9:47.2
for the 1000 last week. Burton's
best is 9:57.9 so far. Burton also
rates as one of the country's
top 200 butterfiiers.
Zack Zom ranks second in the
nation in the 50 free (21.3) and
fifth in the 100 (47.3). Zorn will
sting the Indians in the sprints
and in the relays. John Keller,
who tied Stanford's Bill Meyer
for the AAWU 50 freestyle
crown last year, gives the Bruins
a potent 1-2 combination.
Webb Top Breastroker
Russ Webb leads the AAWU
in the 200 breastroke (2:15.2),
two tenths ahead of Stanford's
Bob Momsen.
Backstroker Mike Berger and
butterflier Stan Cole make the
UCLA front line a tough one to
break.
Berger, Webb, Cole, and Zom
have hit the AAWU's fastest 400
medley relay time so far, 3:37.9.
Stanford's best is 3:38.9.
Stanford heads, however, will
be hard to push underwater.
Greg Buckingham, world record
holder for 200 meters individual
medley, holds the fastest times
in the country for the 200, 500,

ford will have to find a way to
get past the Buck.
Roth Goes All Ways
Dick Roth, Olympic gold
medalist in the 400 meters IM,
leads the conference in the 200
backstroke, ranks second in the
200 IM, third in the 200 free,
and fourth in both the 500 and
1000.
Pete Siebert, whose late red
hot performances have thrown
uncomfortable parameters into
AAWU swimming, leads the con
ference with a 1:56.9 200 butter
fly. Siebert should go well below

2 minutes in both the 200 back
and 200 IM.
World butterfly record holder
Luis Nicolao can give the Cards
a medley relay victory if he
breaks the 50.0 barrier for the
fly leg.
Bob Momsen, NCAA silver
medalist in the 200 breast, will
have his hands full with Webb
and Anderson.
Olympic veteran Mike Wall
and Mark Parmely bolster the
Tribo in the middle distance and
distance freestyle.
Doug Miller ranks fourth in
the conference with a 2:00.1 200

UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton is one of the big
gest reason's for the Bruins'
threat in 1967. Burton, who
holds the national record for
the 1650 (16:27) will race Stan
ford's Greg Buckingham in the
1000 free.

set an NCAA record of 9:47.2
for the 1000 last week. Burton's
best is 9:57.9 so far. Burton also
rates as one of the country's
top 200 butterfiiers.
Zack Zom ranks second in the
nation in the 50 free (21.3) and
fifth in the 100 (47.3). Zorn will
sting the Indians in the sprints
and in the relays. John Keller,
who tied Stanford's Bill Meyer
for the AAWU 50 freestyle
crown last year, gives the Bruins
a potent 1-2 combination.
Webb Top Breastroker
