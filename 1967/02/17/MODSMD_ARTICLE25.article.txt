## Frats Ding Commission Report 
### 
The Dally:
I can resist no longer: I must
to the never-ending anti
■"•fraternity crusade upon which
Daily and Housing Com
''tjiission are embarked. I believe
Psrhe Daily has been more ob
jective than in past years in pre
senting both sides of various
[tissues, but I am getting tired
-waiting for fraternity men to
up or get themselves pub
lished — as the case may be.
"''Onions" to complacent frater
nity men who are allowing oth
ers to decide their future; "or
" chids" to men like Clay Miller
Oho are finally speaking out!
*T; On the one hand I read how
•-terribly anti-intellectual the fra
ternities are, how they provide
*-an "escape from education,"
' "Vvith "goals totally contrary to
those of the rest of the Univer
sity community," and "why
hasn't the Dean's office ever in
vestigated fraternity behavior?"
On the other hand, I read that
students want total freedom to
make individual and group de
cisions concerning their own aca
demic, social, and residential sit
uations —with little or no exter
nal direction or guidance. Why
not investigate off-campus and
dormitory behavior? Must I as
sume that the "unlawful" drink
ing, smoking, pill-taking, cohabi
tation, and general "RF'ing"
which may occur in those places
is pro-intellectual?
Aren't these off-campus or
dormitory residents ever engag
ing in anything other than "in
tellectual experiences"? Are
their goals always consistent
with the University community?
Let's have each dormitory, eating
club, and off-campus residence
"submit notarized affidavits ex
plaining their" behavior during
any social or "intellectual" ac
tivity!
Is a fraternity man who wants
to pay his tuition to drink beer
less intellectual than an off-cam
pus or dormitory resident who
makes that same choice? If in
dividual, free choice is so vital,
and I gather that it is, why
can't a group of students freely
choose to live together in a
fraternity house (or any other
place they can obtain) and freely
choose to use that residence as a
respite from the rigors of aca
demic life or as an extension
of the academic life, as they so
choose. Why must "education
experiences" be crammed down
their throat by a Commission if
they don't want them?
Concerning the "horrors" of
the selection system, I suggest
that Stanford students include
in their education the experience
of losing out to someone for ir
rational reasons. My wife and I
do not recall selecting one an
other for purely rational rea
sons, and it may be that others
interested in us as potential
mates did not have a "fair"
chance to be selected. We are
very happy to have selected each
other before a Commission de
cides that marriage mates must
be determined by a "draw" sys
tem for the sake of equality and
justice!
The problem, in my opinion,
is not the existence of frater
nities, but the lack of existence
of more fraternities and other
such living groups, where stu
dents might have a full range of
types* of living groups among
which to choose.
Bravo for the list of varying
kinds of living groups and situa
tions which the Housing Com
mission has recommended. But
please leave the present type of
fraternities on the list: there
seems to be a sizeable number
of Stanford men who freely
choose that type of living ex
perience—whether other individ
uals or groups agree with them
or not!

Editor, The Daily:
Much, I believe, of the cur
rent debate about fraternities is
distorted not in fact nor, per

haps, even in conclusion, but,
rather, in approach. Few ques
tion the immorality of hell week,
an intellectual vacuum, or the
limitations of selective rush
Ironically, however, those criti
cizing fraternities are in much
the same position as those who
would cast stones in glass
houses.
My recollections of Wilbur
can be summarized simply as
very unsatisfactory. "Culture"
was not spontaneous but im
posed, either by sponsors or
through formal programs. The
spectrum of thought which, in
deed, did exist was an ineffective
force because defensive intol
erance was the predominatnt at
titude. A diversity of friendship
was difficult because cliques
formed after the first quarter.
After my freshman year at
Wilbur I saw no reason why
these conditions would be any
different in Stern or Toyon and
the recent report seems to bear

me out. I refused to escape by
moving off campus. I ask you—
what alternatives exist? Dormi
tories have not changed and
off campus living can never
really be acceptable in a "com
munity of scholars."
Now I am in a fraternity, not
entirely by choice and not en
tirely without reservations. Al
though the fraternity leaves
much to be desired, it does offer
the most rewarding and honest
form of living on campus today.
Each quarter we arrange with a
professor to conduct an accred
ited class in our house and, in
variably, at most half of those
who want to take this class can.
Our symphony tickets are so
popular that we have had to set
up a "quota system." There is
genuine admiration for students
who excell scholastically. And,
most important, we do listen to
each other. We are influenced
and changed by impromptu, mid
night bull-sessions. Pretensions

to intellectuality are not nearly
so prevalent in fraternities as in
dormitories.
Until a suitable alternative to
fraternities can be provided and
until it can be established that
university residences, th e ni
sei ves, justify their existence, I
must continue to suggest that
fraternities are the most reward
ing form of campus living.

Editor, The Daily:
Having participated in an in
terview with members of the
Fraternity Subcommittee of the
ASSU Housing Commission, I
must register my disappoint
ment with its report. Hy house
(Theta Chi) has been incorrectly
characterized on a number of
points. A few of the more im

portant: the statement that
unanimous approval is required
for membership is inaccurate;
the report that our house presi
dent "refused to discuss certain
aspects of (our Hell Week pro
cedures" is simply not true (in
the interview, we detailed, event
by-event the entire 3 day pro
gram); the fact that we have a
house colloquium was omitted;
and under the heading of "sig
nificant change in Hell Weeks,"
our house was not mentioned
at all, despite the fact that we
submitted to the Subcommittee
a written statement of our new
program.

be determined by a "draw" sys

The problem, in my opinion,
is not the existence of frater

of more fraternities and other
such living groups, where stu

types* of living groups among

Bravo for the list of varying
kinds of living groups and situa

mission has recommended. But
please leave the present type of
fraternities on the list: there
seems to be a sizeable number
of Stanford men who freely
choose that type of living ex

or not!

Much, I believe, of the cur
rent debate about fraternities is
distorted not in fact nor, per

haps, even in conclusion, but,
rather, in approach. Few ques
tion the immorality of hell week,
an intellectual vacuum, or the
limitations of selective rush
Ironically, however, those criti
cizing fraternities are in much
the same position as those who
would cast stones in glass
houses.
My recollections of Wilbur
can be summarized simply as
very unsatisfactory. "Culture"
was not spontaneous but im
posed, either by sponsors or
through formal programs. The
spectrum of thought which, in
deed, did exist was an ineffective
force because defensive intol
erance was the predominatnt at
titude. A diversity of friendship
was difficult because cliques
formed after the first quarter.
After my freshman year at
Wilbur I saw no reason why
these conditions would be any
different in Stern or Toyon and
the recent report seems to bear

me out. I refused to escape by
moving off campus. I ask you—
what alternatives exist? Dormi
tories have not changed and
off campus living can never
really be acceptable in a "com
munity of scholars."
Now I am in a fraternity, not
entirely by choice and not en
tirely without reservations. Al
though the fraternity leaves
much to be desired, it does offer
the most rewarding and honest
form of living on campus today.
Each quarter we arrange with a
professor to conduct an accred
ited class in our house and, in
variably, at most half of those
who want to take this class can.
Our symphony tickets are so
popular that we have had to set
up a "quota system." There is
genuine admiration for students
who excell scholastically. And,
most important, we do listen to
each other. We are influenced
and changed by impromptu, mid
night bull-sessions. Pretensions

to intellectuality are not nearly
so prevalent in fraternities as in
dormitories.
Until a suitable alternative to
fraternities can be provided and
until it can be established that
university residences, th e ni
sei ves, justify their existence, I
must continue to suggest that
fraternities are the most reward
ing form of campus living.

must register my disappoint
ment with its report. Hy house
(Theta Chi) has been incorrectly
characterized on a number of
points. A few of the more im

portant: the statement that
unanimous approval is required
for membership is inaccurate;
the report that our house presi
dent "refused to discuss certain
aspects of (our Hell Week pro
cedures" is simply not true (in
the interview, we detailed, event
by-event the entire 3 day pro
gram); the fact that we have a

and under the heading of "sig
nificant change in Hell Weeks,"
our house was not mentioned
at all, despite the fact that we
submitted to the Subcommittee
a written statement of our new

sume that the "unlawful" drink

Aren't these off-campus or

Is a fraternity man who wants
to pay his tuition to drink beer
less intellectual than an off-cam

makes that same choice? If in
dividual, free choice is so vital,
and I gather that it is, why
can't a group of students freely
choose to live together in a
fraternity house (or any other
place they can obtain) and freely
choose to use that residence as a

they don't want them?
Concerning the "horrors" of
the selection system, I suggest
that Stanford students include
in their education the experience
of losing out to someone for ir
rational reasons. My wife and I
do not recall selecting one an

sons, and it may be that others
interested in us as potential

Having participated in an in
terview with members of the
Fraternity Subcommittee of the
ASSU Housing Commission, I
must register my disappoint
ment with its report. Hy house
(Theta Chi) has been incorrectly
characterized on a number of
points. A few of the more im

portant: the statement that
unanimous approval is required
for membership is inaccurate;
the report that our house presi
dent "refused to discuss certain
aspects of (our Hell Week pro
cedures" is simply not true (in
the interview, we detailed, event
by-event the entire 3 day pro
gram); the fact that we have a
house colloquium was omitted;
and under the heading of "sig
nificant change in Hell Weeks,"
our house was not mentioned
at all, despite the fact that we
submitted to the Subcommittee
a written statement of our new
program.

to the never-ending anti
■"•fraternity crusade upon which
Daily and Housing Com
''tjiission are embarked. I believe
Psrhe Daily has been more ob
jective than in past years in pre
senting both sides of various
[tissues, but I am getting tired
-waiting for fraternity men to
up or get themselves pub
lished — as the case may be.
"''Onions" to complacent frater
nity men who are allowing oth
ers to decide their future; "or
" chids" to men like Clay Miller
Oho are finally speaking out!
*T; On the one hand I read how
•-terribly anti-intellectual the fra
ternities are, how they provide
*-an "escape from education,"
' "Vvith "goals totally contrary to
those of the rest of the Univer
sity community," and "why
hasn't the Dean's office ever in
vestigated fraternity behavior?"
On the other hand, I read that
students want total freedom to
make individual and group de
cisions concerning their own aca
demic, social, and residential sit
uations —with little or no exter
nal direction or guidance. Why
not investigate off-campus and
dormitory behavior? Must I as
sume that the "unlawful" drink
ing, smoking, pill-taking, cohabi
tation, and general "RF'ing"
which may occur in those places
is pro-intellectual?
Aren't these off-campus or
dormitory residents ever engag
ing in anything other than "in
tellectual experiences"? Are
their goals always consistent
with the University community?
Let's have each dormitory, eating
club, and off-campus residence
"submit notarized affidavits ex
plaining their" behavior during
any social or "intellectual" ac
tivity!
Is a fraternity man who wants
to pay his tuition to drink beer
less intellectual than an off-cam
pus or dormitory resident who
makes that same choice? If in
dividual, free choice is so vital,
and I gather that it is, why
can't a group of students freely
choose to live together in a
fraternity house (or any other
place they can obtain) and freely
choose to use that residence as a
respite from the rigors of aca
demic life or as an extension
of the academic life, as they so
choose. Why must "education
experiences" be crammed down
their throat by a Commission if
they don't want them?
Concerning the "horrors" of
the selection system, I suggest
that Stanford students include
in their education the experience
of losing out to someone for ir
rational reasons. My wife and I
do not recall selecting one an
other for purely rational rea
sons, and it may be that others
interested in us as potential
mates did not have a "fair"
chance to be selected. We are
very happy to have selected each
other before a Commission de
cides that marriage mates must
be determined by a "draw" sys
tem for the sake of equality and
justice!
The problem, in my opinion,
is not the existence of frater
nities, but the lack of existence
of more fraternities and other
such living groups, where stu
dents might have a full range of
types* of living groups among
which to choose.
Bravo for the list of varying
kinds of living groups and situa
tions which the Housing Com
mission has recommended. But
please leave the present type of
fraternities on the list: there
seems to be a sizeable number
of Stanford men who freely
choose that type of living ex
perience—whether other individ
uals or groups agree with them
or not!

Much, I believe, of the cur
rent debate about fraternities is
distorted not in fact nor, per

haps, even in conclusion, but,
rather, in approach. Few ques
tion the immorality of hell week,
an intellectual vacuum, or the
limitations of selective rush
Ironically, however, those criti
cizing fraternities are in much
the same position as those who
would cast stones in glass
houses.
My recollections of Wilbur
can be summarized simply as
very unsatisfactory. "Culture"
was not spontaneous but im
posed, either by sponsors or
through formal programs. The
spectrum of thought which, in
deed, did exist was an ineffective
force because defensive intol
erance was the predominatnt at
titude. A diversity of friendship
was difficult because cliques
formed after the first quarter.
After my freshman year at
Wilbur I saw no reason why
these conditions would be any
different in Stern or Toyon and
the recent report seems to bear

me out. I refused to escape by
moving off campus. I ask you—
what alternatives exist? Dormi
tories have not changed and
off campus living can never
really be acceptable in a "com
munity of scholars."
Now I am in a fraternity, not
entirely by choice and not en
tirely without reservations. Al
though the fraternity leaves
much to be desired, it does offer
the most rewarding and honest
form of living on campus today.
Each quarter we arrange with a
professor to conduct an accred
ited class in our house and, in
variably, at most half of those
who want to take this class can.
Our symphony tickets are so
popular that we have had to set
up a "quota system." There is
genuine admiration for students
who excell scholastically. And,
most important, we do listen to
each other. We are influenced
and changed by impromptu, mid
night bull-sessions. Pretensions

to intellectuality are not nearly
so prevalent in fraternities as in
dormitories.
Until a suitable alternative to
fraternities can be provided and
until it can be established that
university residences, th e ni
sei ves, justify their existence, I
must continue to suggest that
fraternities are the most reward
ing form of campus living.

plaining their" behavior during
any social or "intellectual" ac
tivity!
Is a fraternity man who wants
to pay his tuition to drink beer
less intellectual than an off-cam
pus or dormitory resident who
makes that same choice? If in
dividual, free choice is so vital,
and I gather that it is, why
can't a group of students freely
choose to live together in a
fraternity house (or any other
place they can obtain) and freely
choose to use that residence as a
respite from the rigors of aca
demic life or as an extension
of the academic life, as they so
choose. Why must "education
experiences" be crammed down
their throat by a Commission if
they don't want them?
Concerning the "horrors" of
the selection system, I suggest
that Stanford students include
in their education the experience
of losing out to someone for ir
rational reasons. My wife and I
do not recall selecting one an
other for purely rational rea
sons, and it may be that others
interested in us as potential
mates did not have a "fair"
chance to be selected. We are
very happy to have selected each
other before a Commission de
cides that marriage mates must
be determined by a "draw" sys
tem for the sake of equality and
justice!
The problem, in my opinion,
is not the existence of frater
nities, but the lack of existence
of more fraternities and other
such living groups, where stu
dents might have a full range of
types* of living groups among
which to choose.
Bravo for the list of varying
kinds of living groups and situa
tions which the Housing Com
mission has recommended. But
please leave the present type of
fraternities on the list: there
seems to be a sizeable number
of Stanford men who freely
choose that type of living ex
perience—whether other individ
uals or groups agree with them
or not!

Much, I believe, of the cur
rent debate about fraternities is
distorted not in fact nor, per

haps, even in conclusion, but,
rather, in approach. Few ques
tion the immorality of hell week,
an intellectual vacuum, or the
limitations of selective rush
Ironically, however, those criti
cizing fraternities are in much
the same position as those who
would cast stones in glass
houses.
My recollections of Wilbur
can be summarized simply as
very unsatisfactory. "Culture"
was not spontaneous but im
posed, either by sponsors or
through formal programs. The
spectrum of thought which, in
deed, did exist was an ineffective
force because defensive intol
erance was the predominatnt at
titude. A diversity of friendship
was difficult because cliques
formed after the first quarter.
After my freshman year at
Wilbur I saw no reason why
these conditions would be any
different in Stern or Toyon and
the recent report seems to bear

me out. I refused to escape by
moving off campus. I ask you—
what alternatives exist? Dormi
tories have not changed and
off campus living can never
really be acceptable in a "com
munity of scholars."
Now I am in a fraternity, not
entirely by choice and not en
tirely without reservations. Al
though the fraternity leaves
much to be desired, it does offer
the most rewarding and honest
form of living on campus today.
Each quarter we arrange with a
professor to conduct an accred
ited class in our house and, in
variably, at most half of those
who want to take this class can.
Our symphony tickets are so
popular that we have had to set
up a "quota system." There is
genuine admiration for students
who excell scholastically. And,
most important, we do listen to
each other. We are influenced
and changed by impromptu, mid
night bull-sessions. Pretensions

to intellectuality are not nearly
so prevalent in fraternities as in
dormitories.
Until a suitable alternative to
fraternities can be provided and
until it can be established that
university residences, th e ni
sei ves, justify their existence, I
must continue to suggest that
fraternities are the most reward
ing form of campus living.

Having participated in an in
terview with members of the
Fraternity Subcommittee of the
ASSU Housing Commission, I
must register my disappoint
ment with its report. Hy house
(Theta Chi) has been incorrectly
characterized on a number of
points. A few of the more im

portant: the statement that
unanimous approval is required
for membership is inaccurate;
the report that our house presi
dent "refused to discuss certain
aspects of (our Hell Week pro
cedures" is simply not true (in
the interview, we detailed, event
by-event the entire 3 day pro
gram); the fact that we have a
house colloquium was omitted;
and under the heading of "sig
nificant change in Hell Weeks,"
our house was not mentioned
at all, despite the fact that we
submitted to the Subcommittee
a written statement of our new
program.
