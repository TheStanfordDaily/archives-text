ditor, The Dally:
As a member of the ASSU
ibcommittee on fraternities, I
*1 that, in all fairness, I should
'.Tact my name from the docu
ent published for the Housing
mmittee report, Fraternities
>ction.
Due to fact that I was no
fled by mail a day late of the
eeting at which the final form
' this document was presented,
*d was thus unable to attend
' read this document before it
published in The Dally, I
dw find certain contradictory
•atures to the stated goals of
le committee which I cannot
>ndone.
'Opposed to the attempted ob
ctivity of this committee, there
a prevalent negative attitude
wards fraternities, created in
>me areas by completely ignor
ig any mention or clarification
t the positive side. One such
ea. is tradition. The work tac
y implies that these tradi
ons are distinguishing lea
ses of fraternities.
The writers then proceed to
it, in light of their educational
?mands, some relatively foolish
aditions of parties, songs and
"house mouse." But it should
j' noted that the writers have
raided any definition of tradi
n here, and in a good number
E cases failed to define it for
lose they interviewed.
Another area, chosen at ran
>m from a wide selection, is
3 paragraph on National-Local
es. The only mention is of the
*ak ones or of their impor
aice in initiations. However, in
lis objective study, no one has
ated that there are strong
instructive bonds (SAE, Theta
elt) and that many Nationals
. d fundamental in financing
irt of the cost of moving into
new cluster (several $100,000).
In some areas, the reporting
grossly inadequate. The Phi
gs have changed from a 1-
ng to a 3-ding system, and
ere has been serious consid
ation to revert to a completely
jsitive system, during the time
' writing this document. The
(J house, given an infamous
•scription in this work, has
ade significant progress so as
• invalidate most of the derog

atory remarks within this work.
Perhaps the change was hap
pening too fast for the report
ers.
However, it should also be
pointed out that there is some
extremely good thought too. I
agree that the discriminatory
clauses of those mentioned fra
ternities do warrant serious and
immediate attention. The fact
that in a few fraternities poten
tially harmful hazing does exist
during "hell week" requires ac
tion, especially from the ma
jority of other innocent fra
ternities, not the Santa Clara
Sheriff's Department. As a last
example, the tacit recommenda
tion that fraternities continue ef
forts to increase educational op
portunity is of concern to this
university.
But, returning now to my
original point, the negativism
that does prevade these writ
ings has been libelous to all
fraternities. It has furthered the
misconception that no change is
taking place and the falsehood
that the inequities of one or two
houses are necessarily that of
all. The negative tone was not
unexpected by me, as the com
mittee was chaired by a pro
fessed anti-fraternity man and
carried several vehement mem
bers of a similar nature. If the
anti-fraternity people use po
litical power, as this document
will ultimately become, to force
toleration of their ideals, what
does it say for their toleration?
For these reasons, I retract
my name from this document.

• Bruised Report?
Editor, The Dally:
The investigatory commission
is an institution of potential
valuable service to a commu
nity; it often manifests, how
ever, a corruption of procedure
which negates the validity and
usefulness of its findings. That
fault is the practice, conscious
or unconscious, of formulating
the conclusion first and select
ing the facts to support the case
afterwards, rather than of hon
estly researching the problem
and deductively arriving at a
true evaluation.

We congratulate the majority
of the Housing Commission for
avoiding this pitfall and pre
senting an objective and valu
able report. The subcommittee
on fraternities is, however, a
serious exception.
As one of the original sources
of information to the committee,
we know the raw material with
which the committee was pro
vided. Comparing that material
to the information which the
committee chose to publish, we
are presented with the Inescap
able conclusion that the authors
of the report edited the data
which their interviewers com
piled to make it conform to their
own predispositions. Any evi
dence of change or progress
within fraternities was deleted
or editorially disparaged, thus
portraying an image of compla
cency and inertia which is dia
metrically the opposite of the
serious efforts being made by
most fraternity members to ef
fect change where it is called
for.
We were incredulous as to
how the report could be so ir
responsible until we discovered
the process which the committee
employed in its — loosely term
ed — "study". Never, for ex
ample, did anything approach
gether to discuss the raw data
or the finished report. Further
ing the full committee meet to
more, the final eighteen para
graphs, including all of the rec
ommendations, were largely the
work of one individual who
earlier was deposed as chairman
of the committee because of his
anti-fraternity bias. These para
graphs were never approved by
the members of the committee.
In the light of these question
able procedures and of the im
portance of the report to the
Stanford community, we feel
that a complete and impartial
review of the findings and pro
cedures of the fraternity sub
committee is in order, and we
urge The Daily to begin such an
investigation immediately.

In some areas, the reporting
grossly inadequate. The Phi

(J house, given an infamous

ade significant progress so as
• invalidate most of the derog

atory remarks within this work.
Perhaps the change was hap
pening too fast for the report
ers.
However, it should also be
pointed out that there is some
extremely good thought too. I
agree that the discriminatory
clauses of those mentioned fra
ternities do warrant serious and
immediate attention. The fact
that in a few fraternities poten
tially harmful hazing does exist
during "hell week" requires ac
tion, especially from the ma
jority of other innocent fra
ternities, not the Santa Clara

example, the tacit recommenda
tion that fraternities continue ef
forts to increase educational op
portunity is of concern to this
university.
But, returning now to my
original point, the negativism
that does prevade these writ
ings has been libelous to all
fraternities. It has furthered the
misconception that no change is
taking place and the falsehood
that the inequities of one or two
houses are necessarily that of
all. The negative tone was not
unexpected by me, as the com
mittee was chaired by a pro
fessed anti-fraternity man and
carried several vehement mem
bers of a similar nature. If the
anti-fraternity people use po
litical power, as this document

does it say for their toleration?
For these reasons, I retract

• Bruised Report?
Editor, The Dally:
The investigatory commission
is an institution of potential
valuable service to a commu
nity; it often manifests, how
ever, a corruption of procedure
which negates the validity and
usefulness of its findings. That
fault is the practice, conscious
or unconscious, of formulating
the conclusion first and select
ing the facts to support the case
afterwards, rather than of hon
estly researching the problem
and deductively arriving at a
true evaluation.

We congratulate the majority
of the Housing Commission for
avoiding this pitfall and pre
senting an objective and valu
able report. The subcommittee
on fraternities is, however, a
serious exception.
As one of the original sources
of information to the committee,
we know the raw material with
which the committee was pro
vided. Comparing that material
to the information which the
committee chose to publish, we
are presented with the Inescap
able conclusion that the authors
of the report edited the data
which their interviewers com
piled to make it conform to their
own predispositions. Any evi
dence of change or progress
within fraternities was deleted
or editorially disparaged, thus
portraying an image of compla
cency and inertia which is dia
metrically the opposite of the
serious efforts being made by
most fraternity members to ef
fect change where it is called
for.
We were incredulous as to
how the report could be so ir
responsible until we discovered
the process which the committee
employed in its — loosely term
ed — "study". Never, for ex
ample, did anything approach
gether to discuss the raw data
or the finished report. Further
ing the full committee meet to
more, the final eighteen para
graphs, including all of the rec
ommendations, were largely the
work of one individual who
earlier was deposed as chairman
of the committee because of his
anti-fraternity bias. These para
graphs were never approved by
the members of the committee.
In the light of these question
able procedures and of the im
portance of the report to the
Stanford community, we feel
that a complete and impartial
review of the findings and pro
cedures of the fraternity sub
committee is in order, and we
urge The Daily to begin such an
investigation immediately.

• Bruised Report?
Editor, The Dally:
The investigatory commission
is an institution of potential
valuable service to a commu
nity; it often manifests, how
ever, a corruption of procedure
which negates the validity and
usefulness of its findings. That
fault is the practice, conscious
or unconscious, of formulating
the conclusion first and select
ing the facts to support the case
afterwards, rather than of hon
estly researching the problem
and deductively arriving at a
true evaluation.

We congratulate the majority
of the Housing Commission for
avoiding this pitfall and pre
senting an objective and valu
able report. The subcommittee
on fraternities is, however, a
serious exception.
As one of the original sources
of information to the committee,
we know the raw material with
which the committee was pro
vided. Comparing that material
to the information which the
committee chose to publish, we
are presented with the Inescap
able conclusion that the authors
of the report edited the data
which their interviewers com
piled to make it conform to their
own predispositions. Any evi
dence of change or progress
within fraternities was deleted
or editorially disparaged, thus
portraying an image of compla
cency and inertia which is dia
metrically the opposite of the
serious efforts being made by
most fraternity members to ef
fect change where it is called
for.
We were incredulous as to
how the report could be so ir
responsible until we discovered
the process which the committee
employed in its — loosely term
ed — "study". Never, for ex
ample, did anything approach
gether to discuss the raw data
or the finished report. Further
ing the full committee meet to
more, the final eighteen para
graphs, including all of the rec
ommendations, were largely the
work of one individual who
earlier was deposed as chairman
of the committee because of his
anti-fraternity bias. These para
graphs were never approved by
the members of the committee.
In the light of these question
able procedures and of the im
portance of the report to the
Stanford community, we feel
that a complete and impartial
review of the findings and pro
cedures of the fraternity sub
committee is in order, and we
urge The Daily to begin such an
investigation immediately.

Another area, chosen at ran

3 paragraph on National-Local

ated that there are strong
instructive bonds (SAE, Theta

irt of the cost of moving into
new cluster (several $100,000).
In some areas, the reporting
grossly inadequate. The Phi

Perhaps the change was hap

However, it should also be
pointed out that there is some
extremely good thought too. I
agree that the discriminatory
clauses of those mentioned fra
ternities do warrant serious and
immediate attention. The fact
that in a few fraternities poten
tially harmful hazing does exist
during "hell week" requires ac
tion, especially from the ma
jority of other innocent fra
ternities, not the Santa Clara
Sheriff's Department. As a last
example, the tacit recommenda

forts to increase educational op
portunity is of concern to this
university.
But, returning now to my
original point, the negativism
that does prevade these writ
ings has been libelous to all
fraternities. It has furthered the
misconception that no change is
taking place and the falsehood
that the inequities of one or two
houses are necessarily that of
all. The negative tone was not
unexpected by me, as the com

carried several vehement mem

anti-fraternity people use po

employed in its — loosely term
ed — "study". Never, for ex
ample, did anything approach
gether to discuss the raw data
or the finished report. Further
ing the full committee meet to
more, the final eighteen para
graphs, including all of the rec
ommendations, were largely the
work of one individual who
earlier was deposed as chairman
of the committee because of his
anti-fraternity bias. These para
graphs were never approved by
the members of the committee.
In the light of these question
able procedures and of the im
portance of the report to the
Stanford community, we feel
that a complete and impartial
review of the findings and pro
cedures of the fraternity sub
committee is in order, and we
urge The Daily to begin such an
investigation immediately.
