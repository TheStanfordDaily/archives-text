The current controversy ovev fraternities has
obscured one issue of fundar lental importance:
that there are no other living groups on this
campus which approach fulfillment of the ideals
of a residence university, either. Much has been
said of the fraternities' failure to provide an
environment in which education can be merged
with the usual functions of a residence; what
needs to be emphasized also is that no other
living groups on campus—with the possible ex
ception of the Grove Project—presently do.
The Wilbur Experiment proposed by the
Housing Commission would be a bold step to
ward rectifying this situation at Stanford. The
experiment would provide for the integration
of freshmen and upperclassmen as well as for
coeducational housing in Wilbur Hall. In addi
tion, it suggests closer contact between students
and faculty, as well as expansion of the tutor
system.
The principal merit of the Wilbur Experiment
lies in its attempt to bridge the existing gap
between the social and the intellectual lives of
students. The Housing Commission has sug
gested in its report that the function of a uni
versity should be to provide an environment in
which individuals can "best pursue the process
of self-education."

Stanford, in calling itself a residence univer
sity, asserts that the educational environment
should extend to the student's living situation
and that "living and learning, social and intel
lectual life, should not be separate but to
gether." It has so far failed to apply this philos
ophy to its living groups.
We hope the University will not delay in
considering the Wilbur Experiment. If it must
be referred to the Packer Study of Education,
then it should be given high priority so that it
does not become lost among the 250 ques
tions to be answered during the next two years.
The rapidity with which the Grove Project
was created is an indication that sufficient in
terest can hasten the bureaucratic process in the
University. The Freshman Year Committee has
gone to considerable lengths to insure that the
proposal would be practical enough to be im
plemented in fall 1967.
Stanford must work toward providing a chal
lenging environment if it is to succeed in its
goal as a residence university. The concrete cell
blocks of Wilbur Hall will never provide a
climate in which students can be challenged
and stimulated, unless drastic changes are made.
We hope the University will share the students'
enthusiasm for this project and do its best to
implement it this fall.

then it should be given high priority so that it
does not become lost among the 250 ques
tions to be answered during the next two years.
The rapidity with which the Grove Project
was created is an indication that sufficient in
terest can hasten the bureaucratic process in the
University. The Freshman Year Committee has
gone to considerable lengths to insure that the
proposal would be practical enough to be im
plemented in fall 1967.
Stanford must work toward providing a chal
lenging environment if it is to succeed in its
goal as a residence university. The concrete cell
blocks of Wilbur Hall will never provide a
climate in which students can be challenged
and stimulated, unless drastic changes are made.
We hope the University will share the students'
enthusiasm for this project and do its best to
implement it this fall.
The current controversy ovev fraternities has
obscured one issue of fundar lental importance:
that there are no other living groups on this
campus which approach fulfillment of the ideals
of a residence university, either. Much has been
said of the fraternities' failure to provide an
environment in which education can be merged
with the usual functions of a residence; what
needs to be emphasized also is that no other
living groups on campus—with the possible ex
ception of the Grove Project—presently do.
The Wilbur Experiment proposed by the
Housing Commission would be a bold step to
ward rectifying this situation at Stanford. The
experiment would provide for the integration
of freshmen and upperclassmen as well as for
coeducational housing in Wilbur Hall. In addi
tion, it suggests closer contact between students
and faculty, as well as expansion of the tutor
system.
The principal merit of the Wilbur Experiment
lies in its attempt to bridge the existing gap
between the social and the intellectual lives of
students. The Housing Commission has sug
gested in its report that the function of a uni
versity should be to provide an environment in
which individuals can "best pursue the process
of self-education."

Stanford, in calling itself a residence univer
sity, asserts that the educational environment
should extend to the student's living situation
and that "living and learning, social and intel
lectual life, should not be separate but to
gether." It has so far failed to apply this philos
ophy to its living groups.
We hope the University will not delay in
considering the Wilbur Experiment. If it must
be referred to the Packer Study of Education,
then it should be given high priority so that it
does not become lost among the 250 ques
tions to be answered during the next two years.
