## Grad Defends Lyman Against Winds 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
As one of Dr. Richard Ly
man's graduate students, I
should like to comment on the
attack made on him and Dr.
Herbert Packer by the Winds
of Freedom Foundation in their
seventh bulletin. I should make
it clear that this is being done
without Dr. Lyman's knowledge,
and that, as a fellow traveller
of the Republican Party, I dis
agree with many of Dr. Lyman's
ideas on Vietnam and Red China,
the two areas in which the
Winds imply that his views
disqualify him as Provost of
Stanford. I say this not to estab
lish my ideological purity but
to show that I have political axes
to grind.
The Winds accuse Dr. Lyman
of not being "steeped in the
Stanford tradition" as was his
predecessor. It cannot be said
whether this is true or not be
cause the Winds never spell out
what that tradition is. The
phrase is an incantation which
apparently sets off a soothing
resonance in the heads of those
who use it, like a clapper strik
ing a bell, but is meaningless to
those of us outside their group.
The Winds fear that Dr. Ly
man could use his position to
fan "Berkeley disruptions" at
Stanford; after all, he was a
sponsor of the 1965 teach-in.
Now, I know that Dr. Lyman
did not become a sponsor of that
spectacle until he was sure that
all viewpoints would be repre
sented in it. Presumably the
Winds did not know this, for
they could hardly object to open
discussion of important issues.
(Could they?) Whether the Pro
vost of Stanford would have the
time to "agitate" is another
question; those who know Dr.
Lyman know his tremendous
conscientiousness.
The Winds fear most of all
that Drs. Lyman and Packer
will be able to make over Stan
ford in their own image of po
litical activism, as they "direct
present faculty and ... bring in
new talent."
In other words, they will re
ward their political sympathizers
and penalize those who disagree
with them. All I can say to that
is that the Winds are imposing
their own pattern of thinking
and behavior on men unlike
themselves, but whether or not
the Winds would make academic

appointment (to take one in
stance) depend on political puri
ty, to imply that Drs. Lyman
and Packer would, is, in my opi
nion, trembling on the edge of
libel.
These, of course, are all speci
fics. The gravaman of the Winds'
blow is that Drs. Lyman and
Packer were appointed not for
their ability but because of their
politics, a ridiculous charge al
ready denied by University of
ficials. (Where, for God's sake,
were the "activists" who pre
sumably engineered these ap
pointments? Did President Ster
ling secretly grow a beard last
year?) All I can conjecture is
that the Winds are so intellec
tually narcissistic that they can
not conceive of a man's being
able and also disagreeing with
them.
Dr. Lyman is, I believe, com
mitted to a concept of dissent
when responsible and construc
tive, a "tradition" far older than
Stanford's. But are the Winds
so committed? What are they
trying to do in this manifesto
of crudity, and to whom are they
appealing? If to the alumni, then
let them — if they can — make
their own dissent responsible and
open, and let them avoid the
guilt by association tarbrush.
The trouble with this sort of
attack is that it is difficult to
answer without resorting to the
Winds' own terms of discourse,
and out of sheer indignation at
such stupidity to accuse them of
self-righteous ignorance, rightist
astigmatism, and of being pick
led in their private concept of
a "Stanford Tradition" like to
mato in aspic. This I wish to
avoid; it would merely do a
disservice to Dr. Lyman.
But let us realize that the
nebulous shapelessness of such
attacks render them likely to be
accepted by certain true believ
ers, as proving that Dr. Lyman
is somehow not fit for his post
(after all, as the Winds point
out, he is not of a "famous Stan
ford family", or even an in
famous one); so that, like a fire
in a garbage dump, these accu
sations might go on smouldering
for some time. If they do, I am
sufficiently optimistic still to be
lieve that most of us will know
just exactly who it is who is
doing a disservice to this Uni
versity.

Editor, The Daily:
Re: Report of the ASSU Hous
ing Commission's Subcommittee
on Fraternities. The afternoon
of November 23, 1966, I spent a
couple of hours answering the
questions of a member of the
subcommittee on fraternities.
Upon reading Christopher Har
grove's timely article and the
ensuing text of the subcommit
tee's report, I was surprised to
find that the report omits any
information pertaining to Delta
Tau Delta and Zeta Psi frater
nities, "because of circum
stances beyond the subcommit
tee's control." Talking to the

subcommittee chairman, David
Calfee, I have been informed
that no information pertaining
to Delta Tau Delta was incorp
orated into the report because
the interview report was lost by
the subcommittee. Since I feel
that the subcommittee's report,
preoccupied with fraternity
prejudice and hell week, does
not reflect accurately on this
particularly fraternity, I will
gladly supply information per
taining to these subjects to any
one who cares to contact me.

Pres., Delta Tau Delta
