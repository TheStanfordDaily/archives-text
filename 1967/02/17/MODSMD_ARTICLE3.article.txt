# C15 To Study Packer Conflict
## 
### 
This week the Committee of 15 set
up a subcommittee to study the dis
agreement over Packer Committee
The two members of the
subcommittee are Philip Rhinelander
and Sara Syer.
The motion from Cl 5 reads: "That
in view of the differences of opinion
.vhich have developed about the se
lection of student participants in the
-study of education at Stanford, a sub
committee be appointed to explore
this cleavage with a view to finding
a solution acceptable to all constit
uencies."
According to Ralph Smith, secre
tary of Cl 5 the Committee's chief re
sponsibility is to keep channels of
communications open. The subcom
mittee will attempt to discover how
the present controversy can be solved,
and what Cls's role should be in such
a solution.
Rhinelander says that he hopes he
and Miss Syer can reach the "under
lying situation"' responsible for the
disagreement. Their goal is to "clarify
rather than intensify" the issues in
volved.
