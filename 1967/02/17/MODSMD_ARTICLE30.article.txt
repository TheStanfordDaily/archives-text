# Two Minutes of Haight
## 1967: Whither The American Dream? 
### Tim Haight 
German culture in the 1930's
had some pretty brilliant people.
In painting they had people like
Emile Nolde, whose colors and
fpeling rival anything the "psy
chedelic revolution" has present
ed.
Hermann Hesse lived and
wrote then. Now he's a minor
saint among some hippieish in
tellectuals. Films of the period,
from"The Cabinet of Dr. Cali
gari" to the "Blue Angel" are
widely known. Around and in
addition to these leaders, there
must have been a subculture
much like our own, with drugs
even.
Some complacent cat at Tres
sider during the LSD series told
the people that "Today's hippies
could be tomorrow's storm
troopers." He was almost cer
tainly wrong about the hippies,
but in terms of the mood of
America in general he was not
holding a totally dry finger to
the wind.
So many people today feel a
strong, deep malaise that a pow
erful leader could tap. His vio
lent followers might come from
the radical right, but who can
say that he would not have just
that little charismatic something
to keep enough of us silent
enough long enough?
The probability of this much
feared repitition of history com
ing to pass is increased when
we realize the appalling lack of
leadership from institutions in
our society that should lead.
Who are the leaders now?
Business puts out ads about
their corporate ideals that can
only be sad parodies of what the
same businesses are doing for
a living. The churches? It's got
ten to be a joke that when the
great number of church people
join your movement, you're no
longer where it's at.
It is the world of the credi
bility gap, the smear, the Bobby
Bakers and the Adam Clayton

Powells. It is the world of the |
Hubert Humphreys who look so
liberal and keep so quiet. And
it is so distant as to be frighten
ing, so tied-up in antiquated
myths about Communism as to
be ineffectual and stupifying.
The mass media are commer
cial, simple-minded, and too pre
occupied with gathering sensa
tional news about exciting peo
ple to dare articulate goals.
They also are handicapped by
the selective perception of the
American public (which in a
way is a good thing, given Hen
ry Luce). Suffice to say that the
media, beheld in their glory on
any occasion, are the message —
of despair.
The university has somehow
become more a place for intellec
tuals to pursue their careers
than a place to discuss truth,
find methods, and help the
world. There is no moral leader
ship here, amid the minds that
might be able to carry it off.
Some individuals inspire great
hope, but they are few, far be
tween, and controversial.
Professors hide behind the
claim that the university should
not be dragged into the arena
of present-day concerns. A de
tached view, an "inner city" is
needed to provide reason in an
irrational world. But the world
goes on, and while there is noth
ing to stop professors from
banding together as individuals
and forming some goals for
Americans, somehow they don't
bother.
They are too busy, or afraid,
or too tied up in their own
brand of wage-slavery and idea
slavery to do it. They are
amoral, apathetic, and slothful.
Please, professors, write angry
letters and show how wrong this
appraisal is! Tell us your profes
sion is relevant to the social is
sues now before us. Tell us what
kind of an America you want.
Perhaps next week, this space
will be crowded off the page by
the protestations of dedicated,
active men who have been
wronged by this accusation.
Hopefully so. If not, the only
group that seem to be left is us
— the tired new leftists, the
alienated hippies, the grinds who
sometime wonder whither we
grindest.
But what are we doing? The
activists are feeling sorry for
themselves; too many "weekend
hippies" are affecting that life
while keeping their grades up;
potentially good thinkers like
Harris and Forstenzer have been
cornered into carping about
Packer committees in an effort
to get an issue so bland that you
students will care.
Harris — if you're at school
this week and reading this, could
you call a meeting so that any
readers of this who wanted to
could meet each other and or
ganize some groups to articulate
and start to implement concrete
manifestations of that vague
American dream that is dormant
inside so many of us?
