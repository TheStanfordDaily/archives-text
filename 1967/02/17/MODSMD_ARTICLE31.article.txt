# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Student Subsidies: CIA Boner 
### Art Buchwald 
The news that the CIA had
been supplying undercover funds
to the National Student Associa
tion has caused another furor in
educational circles. The associa
tion, with 300 chapters on cam
puses throughout the country,
may have been compromised by
accepting money from the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency; yet it's
hard to believe that the CIA
would do anything illegal or im
moral to achieve its goals. I'm
sure the intelligence people have
a good cover story to explain
their infiltration of the student
organization, and when they pre
sent it we'll all be satisfied they
did nothing wrong.
As a matter of fact, there are
several cover stories explaining
ClA's involvement with the NSA
making the rounds at this very
moment, and, while it is impos
sible to separate fact from fic
tion, all of them make sense.
One is that while the NSA
was a cover for the CIA, the CIA
was, in reality, a cover for the
Ford Foundation. The Ford
Foundation has to dispense mil
lions and millions of dollars a
year, and sometimes it prefers to
do it without publicity. So it
gives the money to the CIA
which is always on the lookout
for worthy causes.

But the CIA is in a terrible
spot because if it denies it gave
funds to the National Staudent
Association to subvert it, then it
will have to admit it gave the
money at the request of the
Ford Foundation, and everyone
will start asking, "What the hell
is the Ford Foundation mess
ing around in education for?"
Another cover slory making
the rounds of Washington is
that the CIA has been terribly
worried about the educational
situation in California and would
like to do something to help the
colleges out during the present
crisis.
If the CIA gave the funds di
rectely to Gov. Reagan, other
states would demand similar
subsidies to get them through
financial crises. Therefore, the
CIA decided to use the National
Student Association as a means
of slipping the dough to Cali
fornia without anybody finding
out about it.
It has been no coincidence
that many students from Berke
ley have been seen leaving CIA
headquarters at Langley with
large satchels of cash When
questioned about the satchels, the
students always replied, "We're
going to use it to buy pot." But
everyone now knows the money

was going directly to the Board
of Regents to improve the Cali
fornia school system.
There is another story circu
lating that the CIA people had
no intention of supporting the
National Student Association.
They thought the initials NSA
stood for the National Security
Agency. When the CIA top dogs
discovered they were giving
money to the wrong organiza
tion, they had to cover up their
mistake by pretending they had
the National Student Association
in mind all the time.
Someone said the National
Student Association officers also
had made a grievous mistake,
because they thought the initials
CIA stood for the Committee for
Indigent Alumni. When the
board discovered its error, it was
too late to explain to its mem
bers where all the money was
coming from, so they decided not
to talk about it either.
The CIA has been reluctant
to discuss the matter, but I did
manage to corner a high official
in a restaurant who gave me the
best explanation for the whole
affair I've heard so far.
"Why did the CIA get in
volved with the National Student
Association?" I asked him.
"Because," he replied, "it was
there."

educational circles. The associa
tion, with 300 chapters on cam
puses throughout the country,
may have been compromised by
accepting money from the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency; yet it's
hard to believe that the CIA
would do anything illegal or im
moral to achieve its goals. I'm
sure the intelligence people have
a good cover story to explain
their infiltration of the student
organization, and when they pre
sent it we'll all be satisfied they
did nothing wrong.
As a matter of fact, there are
several cover stories explaining
ClA's involvement with the NSA
making the rounds at this very
moment, and, while it is impos
sible to separate fact from fic
tion, all of them make sense.
One is that while the NSA
was a cover for the CIA, the CIA
was, in reality, a cover for the
Ford Foundation. The Ford
Foundation has to dispense mil
lions and millions of dollars a
year, and sometimes it prefers to
do it without publicity. So it
gives the money to the CIA
which is always on the lookout
for worthy causes.

But the CIA is in a terrible
spot because if it denies it gave
funds to the National Staudent
Association to subvert it, then it
will have to admit it gave the
money at the request of the
Ford Foundation, and everyone
will start asking, "What the hell
is the Ford Foundation mess
ing around in education for?"
Another cover slory making
the rounds of Washington is
that the CIA has been terribly
worried about the educational
situation in California and would
like to do something to help the
colleges out during the present
crisis.
If the CIA gave the funds di
rectely to Gov. Reagan, other
states would demand similar
subsidies to get them through
financial crises. Therefore, the
CIA decided to use the National
Student Association as a means
of slipping the dough to Cali
fornia without anybody finding
out about it.
It has been no coincidence
that many students from Berke
ley have been seen leaving CIA
headquarters at Langley with
large satchels of cash When
questioned about the satchels, the
students always replied, "We're
going to use it to buy pot." But
everyone now knows the money

was going directly to the Board
of Regents to improve the Cali
fornia school system.
There is another story circu
lating that the CIA people had
no intention of supporting the
National Student Association.
They thought the initials NSA
stood for the National Security
Agency. When the CIA top dogs
discovered they were giving
money to the wrong organiza
tion, they had to cover up their
mistake by pretending they had
the National Student Association
in mind all the time.
Someone said the National
Student Association officers also
had made a grievous mistake,
because they thought the initials
CIA stood for the Committee for
Indigent Alumni. When the
board discovered its error, it was
too late to explain to its mem
bers where all the money was
coming from, so they decided not
to talk about it either.
The CIA has been reluctant
to discuss the matter, but I did
manage to corner a high official
in a restaurant who gave me the
best explanation for the whole
affair I've heard so far.
"Why did the CIA get in
volved with the National Student
Association?" I asked him.
"Because," he replied, "it was
there."
The news that the CIA had
been supplying undercover funds
to the National Student Associa
tion has caused another furor in
