# Cal Regents Delay Tuition Plan; Reagan Protests Board's Budget
## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA (AP) — The
Board of Regents of the University of
California voted yesterday to post
pone a decision on imposing tuition
at University of California campuses
until April.
The Regents, in seven hours of
wrangling fraught by charges of play
ing politics, voted 11-7 for a $264 mil
lion budget which Governor Reagan
says the state can't afford to pay.
Then the Regents turned around
and voted 16-3 for the University to
recruit faculty and admit students on
the basis of a $255 million budget.
"I don't know what people are go
ing to believe after we get through
with what we are doing here today,"
sighed Einar Mohn, Teamster Union
official and Board member. At one

point Reagan, a Republican, and As
sembly Speaker Jesse Unruh, a Dem
ocrat, squared off in a polite, but
barbed, duel of words over Unruh's
suggestion that they both leave the
room and get politics out of the arena.
Reagan won one concession. He
wants tuition imposed at the Univer
sity for the first time in its 99-year
history and he would like the Regents
to decide on it before the legislature
acts on the statewide budget at the
end of June. That way he can deter
mine if the $20 million he expects
from tuition in a year could figure in
budget plans.
After Reagan voiced opposition to
a proposal that the Regents put off
any decision on tuition until October,
the Regents voted 12-6 to bring up the

thorny issue at 2 p.m. April 20.
U iruh chided the Regents for not
votir g right now on tuition. He sug
geste \ those lined up on Reagan's
side k.iow they would lose and so just
keep dragging it out.
At one point Unruh delivered the
Board a "political science lecture." He
said the Regents in trying to nego
tiate with Reagan on the 1967-68 budg
et were making a mistake.
Unruh said the Regents should spell
out what they have to have —the legis
lature is the body of decision. He said
Reagan's contention that there Is not
enough money is the opinion of one
man.
Earlier Unruh, Reagan, and Super
intendent of Instruction Max Rafferty
clashed sharply over whether parti
san politics figured in moves to solve
the University's tuition and budget
problems.
The Regents agreed to use $19 mil
lion from their emergency contingen
cy funds to help finance the Univer
sity's current budget. The vote was
a victory for Gov. Ronald Reagan,
who demanded that the Regents use
their emergency funds to supplement
the state budget.
The only opposition to expenditure
of the Regents fund came from Re
gent Norton Simon. He said the ac
tion would cut vital programs which
normally are financed from the con
tingency fund.
In two hours of spirited debate
Wednesday, the regents heard:
Reagan declare he regrets the
"sound, fury and heat" generated by
his tuition and budget-cut proposals,
and asked, but "haven't we reached
something that higher education has
been heading for a long time?"
—The university's finance expert
say Reagan's proposed budget cuts
would bar admission of 9,200 students,
cut the faculty by 235 members and
lower educational standards.
—Chancellors of four of the univer
sity's nine campuses plead for an Im
mediate budget decision to avoid dis
aster in the recruiting of new faculty
members.
Chancellor John S. Galbraith of the
San Diego campus quipped:
"You don't have instant recruit
ment any more than you have instant
babies."

the University's tuition and budget
problems.
The Regents agreed to use $19 mil
lion from their emergency contingen
cy funds to help finance the Univer
sity's current budget. The vote was
a victory for Gov. Ronald Reagan,
who demanded that the Regents use
their emergency funds to supplement
the state budget.
The only opposition to expenditure
of the Regents fund came from Re
gent Norton Simon. He said the ac
tion would cut vital programs which
normally are financed from the con
tingency fund.
In two hours of spirited debate
Wednesday, the regents heard:
Reagan declare he regrets the
"sound, fury and heat" generated by
his tuition and budget-cut proposals,
and asked, but "haven't we reached
something that higher education has
been heading for a long time?"
—The university's finance expert
say Reagan's proposed budget cuts
would bar admission of 9,200 students,
cut the faculty by 235 members and
lower educational standards.
—Chancellors of four of the univer
sity's nine campuses plead for an Im
mediate budget decision to avoid dis
aster in the recruiting of new faculty
members.
Chancellor John S. Galbraith of the
San Diego campus quipped:
"You don't have instant recruit
ment any more than you have instant
babies."
SANTA BARBARA (AP) — The
Board of Regents of the University of
California voted yesterday to post
pone a decision on imposing tuition
at University of California campuses
until April.
The Regents, in seven hours of
wrangling fraught by charges of play
ing politics, voted 11-7 for a $264 mil
lion budget which Governor Reagan
says the state can't afford to pay.
Then the Regents turned around
and voted 16-3 for the University to
recruit faculty and admit students on
the basis of a $255 million budget.
"I don't know what people are go
ing to believe after we get through
with what we are doing here today,"
sighed Einar Mohn, Teamster Union
official and Board member. At one

point Reagan, a Republican, and As
sembly Speaker Jesse Unruh, a Dem
ocrat, squared off in a polite, but
barbed, duel of words over Unruh's
suggestion that they both leave the
room and get politics out of the arena.
Reagan won one concession. He
wants tuition imposed at the Univer
sity for the first time in its 99-year
history and he would like the Regents
to decide on it before the legislature
acts on the statewide budget at the
end of June. That way he can deter
mine if the $20 million he expects
from tuition in a year could figure in
budget plans.
After Reagan voiced opposition to
a proposal that the Regents put off
any decision on tuition until October,
the Regents voted 12-6 to bring up the

thorny issue at 2 p.m. April 20.
U iruh chided the Regents for not
votir g right now on tuition. He sug
geste \ those lined up on Reagan's
side k.iow they would lose and so just
keep dragging it out.
At one point Unruh delivered the
Board a "political science lecture." He
said the Regents in trying to nego
tiate with Reagan on the 1967-68 budg
et were making a mistake.
Unruh said the Regents should spell
out what they have to have —the legis
lature is the body of decision. He said
Reagan's contention that there Is not
enough money is the opinion of one
man.
Earlier Unruh, Reagan, and Super
intendent of Instruction Max Rafferty
clashed sharply over whether parti
san politics figured in moves to solve
the University's tuition and budget
problems.
