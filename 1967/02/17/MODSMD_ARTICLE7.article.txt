# LASSU Kills Fun Stan Change, Requires Judicial Council Report
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
Legislature last night voted down
the proposed by-laws change making
it a violation of the fundamental stan
dard for students to serve on Univer
sity committees unless they had been
appointed by students.
LASSU also voted to require Judi
cial Council to report monthly on all
cases heard, and a resolution was
passed referring the question of dis
crimination in University admissions
to the Committee of Fifteen on the
basis of race, creed, sex, residence, or
legacy.

The Judicial Council legislation pro
vides for semi-annual reports, as well
as interim monthly reports, to be pub
lically delivered to the Legislature.
Decisions previously have been re
ported to the Fundamental Standard
Committee.
The resolution stipulated that pub
lic trials be reported in full, and that
non-public trials be reported "in such
a way as to protect the identity of the
defendants."
The admissions bill, according to
sponsor Martin Gerry, "asks the Com
mittee of Fifteen to look at admis
sions policy, bring to light any dis

crimination involved, and discuss it."
"I don't know of any student who
knows the exact admissions policy
outside of generalizations and broad
and inconsistent rumors," Gerry
added. "But the fact is, the rumors
exist—very strongly."
"The University has zealously
guarded meetings of the committee
on admissions, and it's important that
this issue be brought out into the
open," he stated.
The fundamental standard change
was approved on a first reading last
week but was unfavorably reported
out of committee. Last night's action
upheld the committee report.
In further action, LASSU appropri
ated $706.15 to the lIR Foreign Pol
icy Institute for a conference to be
held soon.
An appropriation to the Dally for a
bi-weekly magazine and a proposed
change in the Publications Board
Standing Rules concerning Daily sal
aries and composition of the editorial
board were referred to the finance
committee.
