more entertainment.
At 7 a.m. the group will leave Cub
berley and march to the steps of Me
morial Auditorium where they will
wait to be admitted.
A large group of faculty members
are asking students to join them in a
silent protest during Humphrey's
speech. They ask that interested per
sons come early to Memorial Audi
torium, wear a white handkerchief or

armband to symbolize concern for
peace, and remain silent during the
entirety of the speech, without heck
ling or applauding.
About 150 top senior faculty in
Humanities and Sciences had signed
the protest by yesterday afternoon,
and more are expected, according to
Professor Lucio Ruotolo, one of the
original signers of the document
Also on the drafting committee were
Professors Robert McAfee Brown,
Hubert Marshall, Albert Guerard,
Mark Mancall, B. Davie Napier, David
Levin, Paul Wallin, and Michael No
vak.
"We represent what has tradi
tionally been the moderate element
of the faculty," stated Professor
Ruotolo. "We are trying to mobilize
a group to expand this representation
in the hopes of applying political pres
sure to the administration and com
municating our discontent with the
present policy in Vietnam."
He added that the movement was
partially precipitated by the experi
ences of Brown, Napier and Novak
with Secretary McNamara in Wash
ington.
Another group is planning to picket
the meeting beginning at 10 a.m.
There will be a meeting at 4 p.m. to
day at the Experiment to discuss the
details of the protest.
