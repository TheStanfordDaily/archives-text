I "We add our voice to those who protest a war in which civilian casualties are greater than military; in which
whole populations are deported against their will; in which the widespread use of napalm is killing and maim
ing women, children and the aged; in which the combatants are systematically destroying the crops and produc
tive capacity of a country they profess to liberate .... Our anguish is deepened by the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government and what we discover is actually taking place. We are told that the other side
gives no indication of desire to negotiate and we then discover that such indications have been given but that we
ihave responded either with rebuff or military escalation."
—From the manifesto by the CLERGYMEN'S MARCH ON WASHINGTON asking an end to bombing of the
North and talks with the NIF.
Because we, the undersigned faculty, fully agree with the above statement, we can- I
not, in good conscience, be silent during Vice President Humphrey's visit to Stanford. Time
and Time again we have heard what he has to say concerning the U.S. presence in Viet
Nam. We find this presence criminal, murderous, and intolerable; we feel that Mr. Hum
phrey's familiar rationalizations only compound the evil. Therefore, although we whole
heartedly support ALL forms of faculty and student protest against Mr. Humphrey, we
wish to encourage those students and faculty who feel as we do, to join in walking out of
Memorial Auditorium'
We fee!, given U.S. actions, that this is the most civilized—though hardly adequate
way to show Mr. Humphrey how totally opposed we are to our government's war.
