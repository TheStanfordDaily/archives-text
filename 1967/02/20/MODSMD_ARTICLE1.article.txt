# Ford Plan May Boost Enrollment Of Negroes
## 
### STEVE GRUBER (First In a series) 
Negro students make up about one per
cent of the undergraduates at Stanford. There
may be many more in the future if the Ford
Foundation sponsors a novel program in its
planning stages.
The program, as yet unnamed, will attempt
to prove that minority students who do not
meet Stanford's stiff entrance requirements
can compete effectively with students here.
One of the main reasons that the Ford
Foundation has approached Stanford with the
idea is the work of Dr. Bernadene V. Allen of
the Counseling and Testing Center and Alan
Grundmann of the Physics Department.
Dr. Allen, in a program at the College of
San Mateo, gave Negroes academic and fi
nancial assistance in order to create interest
in attending college and to raise their grades.
The program was a success, she said.
Grundmann was the head of a summer
program that allowed Mexican-American stu
dents to take classes here.

The prototype of the program the Ford
Foundation hopes to sponsor is the Educa
tional Opportunities Program (EOP) which
was conducted at Berkeley last quarter. Bill
Somersville, head of the EOP, took 130 mi
nority students and got them admitted to
Berkeley even though their high school grades
did not meet Berkeley's admission standards.
Somerville gave the students tutoring and
financial assistance. Although some of them
had D or F averages in high school and
several had not graduated, they successfully
competed with Berkeley freshmen.
The Ford Foundation will agree to sup
port the program only if a constortium of Bay
Area colleges is formed. The schools tenta
tively scheduled to participate are Berkeley,
San Francisco State, the College of San Mateo,
and Stanford. A meeting will be held today to
talk over the program from Stanford's point
of view.
There are at least five reasons why Stan
ford could benefit from the program, accord
ing to Dr. Allen:

• The civil rights movement is putting pres
sure on institutions of higher learning to ad
mit more Negroes.
• There will many more Negro leaders in
the future and Stanford should produce some
of them, Dr. Allen believes.
• Universities have realized that they have
been prejudicial in Negro admissions in the
past.
• Some Stanford administrators and profes
sors believe that minority students should be
given preferential treatment in education and
job placement in order to more quickly over
come problems of inequality.
• Negro students have something to con
tribute to the University by the mere fact of
their being there. "They teach whites more
about Negroes," Dr. Allen commented.
Changing the admission policy does not nec
essarily mean that students admitted under
a more lenient policy will not be able to
compete. According to a study conducted last
year by Dr. Allen, there is no correlation be
tween College Board scores and college grades

for Negro students.
"Stanford should disregard College Board
scores for Negro applicants," Dr. Allen said.
"If this was done, they would have more Negro
applicants to consider "
At present, College Board scores and high
school grades are the main determinants of
whether a student, white or Negro, will be
admitted to Stanford. "If Stanford wants to
compete for minority students, it must alter
its requirements," Dr. Allen said.
There are two reasons in favor of such a
change, she added:
1. There are not enough minority students
who meet Stanford's present requirements.
2. The easiest way to increase minority en
rollment is to have minority students "pass
the word" to other Negroes and Mexican-
Americans that they can get into Stanford.
"The more we have, the more we will get,"
Dr. Allen said. "The word is spread now that
Cal is the place to go for Negroes." She
added that the opposite is true for Stanford.
Dr. Allen said that the present Negro stu

dents here are competing at the same level
as the white students. "My study destroyed
three popularly held myths about Negroes at
Stanford," she said. "First, people think that
Negroes don't do as well at Stanford." They
graduate in the same percentage as the
whites, she explained.
Second, although many people think Ne
groes have to be tutored, they do not, she
said.
The third myth is that Negroes do not meet
the same admission requirements as other stu
dents. "However, they fall within the same
range on College Board scores and high school
grades as the rest of the students," she said.
Dr. Allen believes that the Negroes now at
tending Stanford have proven that they can
do the work, but she also believes that Ne
groes who do not meet the admission re
quirements can also compete, given enough
academic and financial assistance. Whether
she will get a chance to prove her ideas may
be decided today at the meeting on the Ford
Foundation proposal.
