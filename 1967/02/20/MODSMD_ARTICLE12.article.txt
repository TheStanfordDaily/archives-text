# Yale Sociology Professor Threatens Grading System
## 
### 
NEW HAVEN (CPS) â€” The
students in Professor Robert
Cook's sociology seminar at
Yale will all receive grades of
"satisfactory" this term, but
they aren't satisfied. Neither is
Cook.
Early in the semester Cook
had asked the class to vote on
whether or not they wanted
grades. The students voted not
to be graded, and asked Cook
to inform Yale registrar Grant
Robley of their decision.
Robley advised Cook that uni
versity regulations required a
numerical grade be given at the
end of the year-long seminar,
although grades of "satisfac
tory" or "unsatisfactory" could
be recorded at the end of the
first half of the course.
Following Robley's declara
tion, Cook's students voted to
give themselves numerical
grades of 100. This action led
the Yale Daily News, to edito
rialize:
"Because of their decision to
send in an absurd and unfair
batch of grades rather than no
grades at all, the meaningful
ness of an originally positive
gesture had turned sour."
The campus paper suggested
the seminar students were "sa
botaging both the Yale College
average and the integrity of
their own stand. Their move is
the ultimate example of having
their cake and eating it too."
Soon after this action, Cook
met with Yale College dean
George May to discuss the
school's entire grading system.
May recommended that Cook
take the matter before Yale's
Coure of Study committee,
which has control of the school's
grading system.
Following the meeting, Cook
announced his agreement to
turn in grades of "satisfactory"
for the first semester's work.
While May stated, "I think
we have reached an understand
ing," Cook commented, "I do
not intend to teach for a long
time under a system where I
cannot teach the way I want."
Cook mentioned several
changes he would suggest to
the Course of Study committee.
Included in the changes are "the
option of taking a certain num
ber of courses on a pass or fail
basis," the eliimnation of grades
in certain introductory courses,
and the organization of a spe
cial college within the univer
sity around "freer choices of
courses of study."

In the Midwest, meanwhile,
another professor has become
embroiled in the controversy
over grading, but for somewhat
different reasons.
State University of lowa anth
ropologist Donald Barnett is
withholding the grades of his
students so they cannot be made
available to Selective Service of
ficials.
Barnett is thereby liable to
have his pay stopped under lowa
regulations.
