## Brutal Film Faithful To Novel 
### Steve Lavine 
Last week when I wrote about
Greed I had forgotten what a
truly exceptional film it is. Rare
ly have I seen a more starkly
brutal film (the only comparable
one that comes to mind is Bu
nd's Los Olvidados).
One hardly realizes that the
present film is little more than
a remnant of the original. The
cutting is brilliant. The story
flows with remarkable facility.
The only serious flaw is the
inclusion of the hands grasping
the coins and later the woman.
When the pawnbroker is remov
ed these scenes become out of
place and appear to be imposed
symbolism (which is, of course,
exactly what they become).
Fidelty To Novel
Again it is necessary to em
phasize the extreme fidelity to
the novel. Each of the characters
is recognizable on first appear
ance. Indeed, if one must find
fault, it would have to be in ex
actly this fidelity to the novel.
The good is accepted with the
bad. the cinematic with uncine
matic- The amount of dialogue
in the novel that is carried over
is inordinately large and neces
sitates too many title frames.
The pianist, whoever he is, de

serves a great deal of praise. His
improvisation was excellent and
worked well to recreate what
must have been the original ef
fect of the film.
Super-Spy-Sex
Last Saturday night the Stan
ford Cricket Club sponsored a
showing of Father Brown — De
tective starring Alec Guinness.
The advertising was unfortu
nately poor and the 6 p.m. show
ing played to an almost empty
auditorium. It was a thoroughly
enjoyable film, so much so that
I was prompted to pick up a
volume of the Chesterton stories
to reread them.
It is unfortunate that the
United States market will no
longer support films like Father
Brown. The film was infinitely
better than the newer super-spy
sex extravaganzas.
Citizen Kane
Citizen Kane (Orson Welles,
1941) which is the Cubberley
film this week is one of the
masterpieces of the American
cinema. The film caused a great
uproar when it first appeared be
cause of its experimental na
ture — wide-angle photography,
strange shadowy lighting, an
active camera, and the novel nar

rative technique.
What with the passage of time
and distancing of the story the
film now does not appear quite
as good as it must have original
ly. It is still striking but much
of the camera work now seems

extraneous. The obvious experi
mentation is still fascinating.
The music (provided by Bernard
Herrman) is perfectly coordinat
ed with the film and still could
serve as a model for film
makers.

active camera, and the novel nar

rative technique.
What with the passage of time
and distancing of the story the
film now does not appear quite
as good as it must have original
ly. It is still striking but much
of the camera work now seems

extraneous. The obvious experi
mentation is still fascinating.
The music (provided by Bernard
Herrman) is perfectly coordinat
ed with the film and still could
serve as a model for film
makers.
Last week when I wrote about
Greed I had forgotten what a
truly exceptional film it is. Rare
ly have I seen a more starkly
brutal film (the only comparable
one that comes to mind is Bu
nd's Los Olvidados).
One hardly realizes that the
present film is little more than
a remnant of the original. The
cutting is brilliant. The story
flows with remarkable facility.
The only serious flaw is the
inclusion of the hands grasping
the coins and later the woman.
When the pawnbroker is remov
ed these scenes become out of
place and appear to be imposed
symbolism (which is, of course,
exactly what they become).
Fidelty To Novel
Again it is necessary to em
phasize the extreme fidelity to
the novel. Each of the characters
is recognizable on first appear
ance. Indeed, if one must find
fault, it would have to be in ex
actly this fidelity to the novel.
The good is accepted with the
bad. the cinematic with uncine
matic- The amount of dialogue
in the novel that is carried over
is inordinately large and neces
sitates too many title frames.
The pianist, whoever he is, de

serves a great deal of praise. His
improvisation was excellent and
worked well to recreate what
must have been the original ef
fect of the film.
Super-Spy-Sex
Last Saturday night the Stan
ford Cricket Club sponsored a
showing of Father Brown — De
tective starring Alec Guinness.
The advertising was unfortu
nately poor and the 6 p.m. show
ing played to an almost empty
auditorium. It was a thoroughly
enjoyable film, so much so that
I was prompted to pick up a
volume of the Chesterton stories
to reread them.
It is unfortunate that the
United States market will no
longer support films like Father
Brown. The film was infinitely
better than the newer super-spy
sex extravaganzas.
Citizen Kane
Citizen Kane (Orson Welles,
1941) which is the Cubberley
film this week is one of the
masterpieces of the American
cinema. The film caused a great
uproar when it first appeared be
cause of its experimental na
ture — wide-angle photography,
strange shadowy lighting, an
active camera, and the novel nar

rative technique.
What with the passage of time
and distancing of the story the
film now does not appear quite
as good as it must have original
ly. It is still striking but much
