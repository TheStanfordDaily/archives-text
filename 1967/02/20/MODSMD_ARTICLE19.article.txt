# Local Comic Opera Lauded
## 
### 
By JOHN ACHTERKIRCHEN
I applaud the West Bay Opera
Company's production of The
Elixir of Love as one of good
quality and sheer enjoyment.
It was a combination of profes
sional talent and the "local
show" (Henry Holt, director, in
troduced the opera last weekend
with affection and concern; after
all, it was 'his show'). The set
ting for the English adaptation
is an Italian village in the
1750'5.
The first act opens in the court
yard of a prosperous eighteenth
century farm where the peas
ants are resting from their work
in the fields. One of them, Ne
morino, gazes longingly at
Adina, the wealthy young own
er of the farm; her attention is
concentrated on a book, the
story of Tristan and the love
potion which turned his beloved
Isolde's indifference into eternal
love.
Unresponsive To A Helmet
Nemorino's expression of his
love for Adina is answered with
the advice to forget her and

rush to the deathbed of his rich
uncle. She tells him her "love
and affections are not stable;
they change like the weather."
Nemorinc refuses to yield—"My
love is like a river, forever flow
ing, always gaining force."
A detachment enters, led by
Belcore, sergeant of the village
garrison. He does not hestitate
to boast of his conquests of
women—"l have never met a
girl unresponsive to a helmet."
His position has great appeal to
her; the scene closes with the de
tachment's exit and Adina's
yearning for Belcore.
Scene two opens, again, with
the villagers gathered in the
courtyard, on this occasion to
welcome the itinerant physician.
Dr. Dulcamara is a fast talking
quack who cries his wares ef
fectively. Nemorino, must im
pressed by Adina's story of Tri
tan's love potion, asks if the
doctor can sell him a bottle.
Dulcamara vows Nemorino to
secrecy, pulls out a flask of
cheap vermouth and accepts in
payment Nemoiino's last half
dollar.
Wedding Feast
Meanwhile, Adina is piqued by
Belcore's apparent indifference,
welcomes him and, learning that
his company is to be moved to
other quarters, promises to mar
ry him at once. Nemorino's con
fidence is bolstered after a
couple of drinks; hoping that
the elixir will eventually work,
he implores her to wait. Adina,
ignoring Nemorino, invites the
crowd to her wedding.
In the second act we shift to
an inn where the wedding feast
has been prepared. Dr. Dul
camara entertains the peasantry
with a barcarolle in which Adina
joints him. The bride and groom
leave with a notary to sign the
contract of marriage while Dul
camara stuffs himself ("I en
joyed your meal to the full
est."). Nemorino begs the doctor
for a second bottle of the potion,
but is refused; he has no money
left.
Belcore returns — Adina has
postponed the marriage until
nightfall—and suggests to Ne
morino that he enlist in the
army for an advance payment as
an inducement. He signs away
his independence for the cost of
more of the potion.
Let's Be Friends
The final scene opens again at
Adina's farm. Nemorino is un
aware that his uncle has died,
leaving him a considerable for
tune; he has fresh confidence
with the acquisition of his sec
ond bottle. The peasants now
think he is attractive, and when
Adrin learns from Dulcamara
that he has sold his freedom to
win her love, her opinion of
him becomes favorable. She tells
him with a tear that she is
ready to accept his love, and
love him. She has brought off his
recruiting papers; both joyously
sign a marriage contract.

Belcore's blase response to
Adina's disavowal ("This is one
battle you've lost; let's be
friends now") is too much to
bear, and almost incomprehensi
ble. I must remind myself that
The Elixir of Love is a comic
opera—there are plenty of girls
waiting to marry Belcore. Dul
camara announces that Ne
morino is the richest man in the
village; the magic potion has
brought not only love, but
wealth. The peasants surround
the doctor, demanding more sam
ples for themselves; he floats
away, as he came, in his bal
loon
Convincing Characters
The four main characters were
convincing, for the most part, in
that their respective roles were
played with feeling. Belcore
(Sture Davidsson) is the one ex
ception. He was timid; the effect
of this was disaster.
Nemorino's (Thomas Caperel
lo) fragmentary gestures, espe
cially in the first act, served to

emphasize the simple peasant
role. His affirmation of his love
for Adina, the "In her dark eye"
aria, was a display of passion in
the finest form.
Doctor Dulcamara (Robert
Madsen) was absolutely delight
ful, almost the main
attention, easily superb. He had
the verbal ability of Meredith
Wilson's Professor Hill (The Mu
sic Man) and the appearance
and manner of Joseph Fielding's
Squire Western (Tom Jones).
The choreography was as sim
ple as Nemorino, but also coaifce.
The costumes were beautiful—
bright, elaborate and not gaudy.
I have difficulty rating this
production as a first rate one;
but I have none assessing the
satisfaction gained from its en
tertainment value. The Elixir of
Love is not time wasted! I en
courage, I heartily recommend
your consideration of the West
Bay Opera's next production:
Verdi's La Travi&ta—May 12, 13,
and 14.
