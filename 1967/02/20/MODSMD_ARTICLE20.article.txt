i After trailing by as much as
points in the first half, the
s Stanford Indians rallied to de
feat second-place Washington
[State University 71-70 in over
time Saturday night.
| The night before the Cards
| fell to the University of Wash
ington 85-82 in another close bat
tle.
I Art Harris scored the winning
[bucket against the Cougars
[alter he received a half
[ court pass from Gary Peters
meyer, who was triple teamed
jat half court with the score 69-
i6B and 35 seconds remaining in
the overtime period.
A No-Doubt Dunk
Petersmeyer stopped his drib
ble and lofted a long arching

pass to Harris under the basket.
Harris paused, looked around,
and after seeing that no one was
within 20 feet, he dunked the
ball with a fervor and absolute
ness that put the Pavilion spec
tators into delirious joy.
The tally put the Indians
ahead to stay, but it did not
mean the end of excitement for
the night. WSU's Lenny Allen
came back with a 15 foot jump
shot with 23 seconds remaining
to put the Cougars back within
one point.
Dramatic Climax
The hectic action continued
when with 10 seconds left, Stan
ford's Don Griffin was fouled.
With a chance to put the Cards
out of reach with his one and
one free throw, Griffin missed
his first try.
The Cougars got the rebound

and scrambled desperately to
sink the winning basket. But
Don Griffin blocked Jim Mc-
Kean's shot with two seconds
remaining. The ball bounced off
the backboard, and Harris dra
matically blasted it with a dou
bled fist into the crowd at mid
court as the buzzer sounded.
Easy Win?
The Indians looked as if they
were going to win the game
easily in the second half. Down
by 5 points at half time, they
charged back and took a com
manding nine point lead with
7:30 remaining.
Stanford then went to a ball
control game and scored only
two points the rest of the half.
Washington State tied the score
67-67 with two minutes to play,
and from then on it was a case
of both teams trying to stall for
the last shot. Neither team
scored and the game went into
overtime.
All five Stanford starters
scored in double figures, and
only one other Card, Dave Dru
liner, saw action. Harris led the
Tribe with 17 points, followed by
Griffin with 16, and Rich Baker
with 15.
Mai McElwain, starting in
place of the injured Howard
Hassen, scored 13 points, and
Petersmeyer added 10.

After Stanford had taken a
short-lived lead, Washington,
led by 6-10 center Gordy Harris
and 5-10 guard rick Slettledahl,
raced to a 23-13 advantage half
way through the first period.
The Indians roared back as
Art Harris put on a spectacular
display of layups and jumpers
to score four straight baskets.
Washington's lead widened to
eight points again, but Harris
led another Stanford rally as he
scored two baskets and assisted
Gary Petersmeyer in scoring on
a fast break with three seconds
left. The spree left the half-time
scjore at 40-39, Washington.
Washington dicln't wait to get
started in the second half, as it
scored three times before Stan
ford did.
The two teams exchanged bas
kets for about ten minutes with
Don Griffin and Mai McElwain

carrying the Cards and flashy
forward Dave Carr leading the
Huskies. Then the Indians made
their third charge of the game.
With Griffin hitting on two
jumpers and a follow shot and
McElwain scoring two jumpers,
Stanford cut the lead from ten
to four points in three minutes,
but could not steal the win.
The deciding factor in the
game was the Huskies foul
shooting. Both teams sank 32
field goals, but the Huskies put
in three more free throws. Also,
the Huskies grabbed nine more
rebounds than the Cards, three
coming off their own missed
foul shots and being turned Into
baskets.
Don Griffin was the big scorer
with 23 points. Other 20 point
efforts included 22 for Gordy
Harris, 21 for Art Harris and
Dave Carr, and 20 for Mai Mc-
Elwain.
