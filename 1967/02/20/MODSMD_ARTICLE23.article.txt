Stanford swimmers routed
fifth-ranked UCLA last Friday,
81-23, then fought NCAA cham
pion USC to a 52-52 deadlock the
next day. Greg Buckingham
smashed Roy Saari's NCAA 500
freestyle record and seven other
pool records fell to highlight the
battle of the nation's swimming
giants.
Buckingham won five individ
ual events in the two meets. He
shut down UCLA's world rec
ord holder (1500 meters) in the
1000 freestyle by half a pool, and
followed his 9:49,2 1000 with an
NCAA record 4:42.5 500.
Buck Wins Three
Buckingham started off
against USC with a 10:07.3 1000,
which would have been an
NCAA record 3 weeks ago.
Barely five minutes out of the
1000, he swam a 1:57.1 200 in
dividual medley, .4 second off
the NCAA record. Buckingham
topped off the meet with a 4:49.9
500 victory.
The Southern Cal meet was
tight all the way, as the lead
changed hands twice. Stanford's
medley relay started the meet
with a pool record 3:34.0, a sec
ond ahead of USC. Bill Kee led
off with a 55.4 backstroke, and
Bob Momsen swam his fastest
ever 100 breaststroke, 1:00.9.
Momsen Grabs Lead
Momsen gave the Cards the
lead, and Luis Nicolao's 505
butterfly quarter lengthened It.
Captain Jim Laney brought it
home with a 47.2, his fastest this
season.
Buckingham won the 1000, but
the real race was for second
place between Stanford's Mike
Walls and USC's Steve Daniel
sen. Wall's 10:12.6, fifth fastest
in the nation, was a second shy
of Danielsen.

USC then scored an upset In
the 200 freestyle that opened the
door for the tie. Bill Johnson
won for USC in 1:45.6, and Tro
jan Dean Willeford touched out
Dick Roth for second place by
.1 second at 1:46.4.
One-Two For USC
The Trojans grabbed the first
two places in the 50 freestyle.
Don Havens won in 21.8 and
John Lambert touched out Stan
ford's Bill Meyer at 22.2 for
second place.
USC's two 1-2 sweeps gave the
Trojans the lead, but the In
dians snatched it back with a
1-2 in the 200 IM. Buckingham
won in 1:57.1, and Pete Siebert
hit his best ever, 1:59.3, second
fastest in the country.
John Parker's 239.0 points in
the diving could not catch USC's
Rick McDermott with 263.0.
Nicolao ran away with the
200 butterfly in 1:56.5. Doug
Miller hit 1:59.6, .3 short of
USC's Mike Siebert in second
place.
Trailing by five points going
into the 100, USC swept the first
two places to take a two point
lead. Havens won in 48.2, and
Russ Kidder beat Stanford's
[Morgan Manning on a split
judges decision at 48.4.
Roth, Siebert Sweep
Dick Roth and Pete Siebert
brought the see-saw back to
Stanford's side with a 1-2 power
sweep of the 200 backstroke.
Roth won in 2:01.2, Siebert .hit
2:01.3, 2 seconds ahead of USC's
Greg Westcott.
Buckingham won the 500 eas
ily, but Danielsen and Wille
ford picked up the next two
places, leaving the score 47-41
going into the breaststroke.
Bob Momsen left no doubt
from the minute he took off on
the 200 breast. A body length

ahead at the 100, he churned to
a 2:13.2 pool and varsity rec
ord. Momsen's 2:14.8 placed
second in the NCAA's last year
behind USC's Wayne Anderson.
USC's Paul Jeffers took sec
ond behind Momsen in 2:15.0,
and Anderson picked up third
in 2:17.4, just ahead of Charlie
Burbach who put in his best
time ever, 2:18.0.
Clinch Tie, But...
Momsen's breaststroke victory
left the score 5245. Stanford
needed the freestyle relay to

win, but SC could tie with a
relay victory.
Nicolao led off in 47.8, Man
ning hit 47.9, and Roth swam a
47.4 to give Laney a slight edge
on the anchor leg. However,
Haven's 46.2 anchor leg for
USC overtook Laney's 47.6, and
USC salvaged the tie with a
3:09.8 pool record relay. Stanford
was 3:10.8.
The tie saved the Trojans win
streak of 81 dual meets.
After any close contest, the
"ifs" fly wild. Stanford missed
places in the 50, 100, and 200
freestyle by a tenth of a second.
The Stanford-USC meet was
unique in the past decade of
American collegiate swimming.
Never had the first and second
ranked teams met each other in
a dual meet. Before, it was al
ways USC and Indiana, or Mich
igan and Yaleâ€”all half a con

tinent apart until the NCAA
championships.
Blast Bruins Out Of Pool
UCLA looked nearly as tough
as USC on paper, but Stanford
tore that paper into shreds.
Stanford took all but one first
place and let the Bruins score
only 4 second places.
Stanford started off the 81-23
romp by blasting UCLA's touted
medley relay. In the 1000, Buck
ingham's wake had already sub
sided when UCLA's Burton, na
tional 1650 free record holder,

made it to the finish.
Roth and Parmely took 1-2 in
the 200. UCLA then gambled by
taking the nation's second fast
est 50 sprinter, Zack Zorn, out
of the 50 to save him for the
free relay. Bill Meyer called the
bluff and won it in 22.2. Jeff
Hammett took third for the In
dians.
Cards Score 8 Sweeps
Stanford swept the next three
events, the 200 IM, diving, and
200 fly, to rack up a 51-10 lead.
UCLA's only salvation from
total humiliation came as Zorn
swam a pool record 47.2 to win
the 100 free. Parmely got sec
ond in the 100, however, to
clinch the meet with 4 events
left.
Roth and Siebert swept the
backstroke, Roth's 1:59.6 good
for a pool record.
Buckingham then took off on
