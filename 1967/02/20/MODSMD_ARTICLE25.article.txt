1:48 5 for his leadoff 200, then
held a 58.0 pace for the next 3
100's. Buckingham sits on top
of the nation in the 200, 500,

Wall's Fastest 500
Mike Wall gave Burton an
uncomfortably close shave in
the 500. Wall's 4:53.8, his best
by 7 seconds this year, bodes
well for the NCAA's.
Momsen burned Bruin Russ
Webb in the breaststroke with a
red hot final 50 yards for 2:14.3.
Stanford won the freestyle re
lay in 3:12.6 Nicolao led off
against Zorn, and had time to
turn around and watch the
Bruin finish his face.
The hard swim against UCLA
may have hurt the Indians for
the following day's crucial meet
against Southern Cal. USC's
first team rested on Friday.
Hurt NCAA Chances?
Asked whether he thought the
disappointment of a tie would
hurt Stanford's chances in the
NCAA's, Gaughran replied, "No,
not at all In many ways it may
have helped us, especially get
ting used to performing under
the kind of pressure there was
today."
A 1 Schoenfleld, editor of Swim
ming World who picked USC to
win the NCAA's before the sea

Stanford and USC meet again
in the AAWU's two weeks from
now. Both squads will swim
hard right through the confer
ence meet, saving the peak for
the NCAA's March 23-25. UCLA,
though certainly not out of the
conference picture, has been
rather effectively punched out of
focus.

his 4:42.5 record 500. Buck hit
1:48 5 for his leadoff 200, then
held a 58.0 pace for the next 3
100's. Buckingham sits on top
of the nation in the 200, 500,
1000 freestyle and 200 IM.
Wall's Fastest 500
Mike Wall gave Burton an
uncomfortably close shave in
the 500. Wall's 4:53.8, his best
by 7 seconds this year, bodes
well for the NCAA's.
Momsen burned Bruin Russ
Webb in the breaststroke with a
red hot final 50 yards for 2:14.3.
Stanford won the freestyle re
lay in 3:12.6 Nicolao led off
against Zorn, and had time to
turn around and watch the
Bruin finish his face.
The hard swim against UCLA
may have hurt the Indians for
the following day's crucial meet
against Southern Cal. USC's
first team rested on Friday.
Hurt NCAA Chances?
Asked whether he thought the
disappointment of a tie would
hurt Stanford's chances in the
NCAA's, Gaughran replied, "No,
not at all In many ways it may
have helped us, especially get
ting used to performing under
the kind of pressure there was
today."
A 1 Schoenfleld, editor of Swim
ming World who picked USC to
win the NCAA's before the sea
son, now gives the nod to Stan
ford.
Stanford and USC meet again
in the AAWU's two weeks from
now. Both squads will swim
hard right through the confer
ence meet, saving the peak for
the NCAA's March 23-25. UCLA,
though certainly not out of the
conference picture, has been
rather effectively punched out of
focus.
