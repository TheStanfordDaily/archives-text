# A 						Call To Arms
## 
### 
Hubert H. Humphrey, Vice President of the
United States, is coining to Stanford today. He
will attempt to outline the Administration's
point of view on issues of special interest, in
particular American involvement in Vietnam.
But the Vice President is perhaps also interested
in obtaining the academic community's reaction
to present policies and in establishing a mean
ingful exchange of ideas between them and him
self.
Today's audience will have two principal
channels through which it can express its views:
students and faculty may ask questions of the
Vice President and they can also participate in
the protest.
Two different protests have been outlined
for this morning's conference. A large group of
faculty members have asked students to join
them in a silent protest during Humphrey's
appearance. They will neither heckle nor ap
plaud and will wear white armbands as a
symbol of their "concern for peace." Another
group, in addition, is encouraging all faculty
and students opposed to the U.S. presence in
Vietnam to walk out of Memorial Auditorium.
It is important that those opposed to the Ad
ministration's policies express their position
by participating in the protest this morning.
The Vice President should not be at Stanford
solely to present a point of view that has prob
ably been heard many times before. Communi

cation must be a two-way street and the aca
demic community should use the channels avail
able to voice its discontent. The silent protest
being promoted by the "moderates" will pro
vide an opportunity for an effective expression
of opposition to United States involvement in
Vietnam. It will continue to allow for a dialogue
between Humphrey and the community, but
will make the position of a large part of the
audience absolutely clear.
The walk-out protest, on the other hand, sym
bolizes a feeling among many groups that there
is no hope for rational communication and that
one no longer can resolve the conflict in
opinions through discussion. The proponent of
the walk-out assume, probably correctly, that
the Vice President will not say anything dras
tically new this morning, but fail to see that
continuation of the dialogue and reiteration of
the opposing point of view may ultimately have
a positive effect. The notion that there is no
longer hope for discussion is a disquieting
indicator that the intransigence which has so
far characterized only one side of the conflict
is now spreading to the other.
We encourage all students and faculty op
posed to the resumed bombings in North Viet
nam to express their concern by participating in
the silent protest. If successful, it will be effec
tive, but will not eliminate the opportunity for
more discussion.

one no longer can resolve the conflict in
opinions through discussion. The proponent of
the walk-out assume, probably correctly, that
the Vice President will not say anything dras
tically new this morning, but fail to see that
continuation of the dialogue and reiteration of
the opposing point of view may ultimately have
a positive effect. The notion that there is no
longer hope for discussion is a disquieting
indicator that the intransigence which has so
far characterized only one side of the conflict
is now spreading to the other.
We encourage all students and faculty op
posed to the resumed bombings in North Viet
nam to express their concern by participating in
the silent protest. If successful, it will be effec
tive, but will not eliminate the opportunity for
more discussion.
Hubert H. Humphrey, Vice President of the
United States, is coining to Stanford today. He
will attempt to outline the Administration's
point of view on issues of special interest, in
particular American involvement in Vietnam.
But the Vice President is perhaps also interested
in obtaining the academic community's reaction
to present policies and in establishing a mean
ingful exchange of ideas between them and him
self.
Today's audience will have two principal
channels through which it can express its views:
students and faculty may ask questions of the
Vice President and they can also participate in
the protest.
Two different protests have been outlined
for this morning's conference. A large group of
faculty members have asked students to join
them in a silent protest during Humphrey's
appearance. They will neither heckle nor ap
plaud and will wear white armbands as a
symbol of their "concern for peace." Another
group, in addition, is encouraging all faculty
and students opposed to the U.S. presence in
Vietnam to walk out of Memorial Auditorium.
It is important that those opposed to the Ad
ministration's policies express their position
by participating in the protest this morning.
The Vice President should not be at Stanford
solely to present a point of view that has prob
ably been heard many times before. Communi

cation must be a two-way street and the aca
demic community should use the channels avail
able to voice its discontent. The silent protest
being promoted by the "moderates" will pro
vide an opportunity for an effective expression
of opposition to United States involvement in
Vietnam. It will continue to allow for a dialogue
between Humphrey and the community, but
will make the position of a large part of the
audience absolutely clear.
The walk-out protest, on the other hand, sym
bolizes a feeling among many groups that there
is no hope for rational communication and that
one no longer can resolve the conflict in
opinions through discussion. The proponent of
the walk-out assume, probably correctly, that
the Vice President will not say anything dras
tically new this morning, but fail to see that
