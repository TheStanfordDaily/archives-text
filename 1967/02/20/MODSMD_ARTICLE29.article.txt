# Stanford Gets The Axe
## 
### 
George Washington's Birthday arrived early
this year at Stanford. Or at least this is probably
the most charitable explanation for last week's
tree trimming escapade by University garden
en
Neither cheery tree nor hatchet was in
volved, but there was a certain degree of un
abashed honesty when one University official
t&lled the excessive pruning of the trees, which
line the street on the Row, the work of "pro
fessionals."
Spring and early summer have always been
the most scenic times to view the campus. How
ever it will take quite a few springs to restore
verdure to the baren limbs which now add only
a revolting sense of morbidity to the older part
of the campus.
The light pruning, necessary to eliminate the
danger of dead branches falling on windy
days, might have been carried out with a bit
less gusto. Armed with power saws, the efficient

University gardeners left hardly a branch less
than six inches in diameter.
Beyond aesthetic considerations is the prac
tical fact that the trees shaded many of the
older houses from the hot afternoon sun. None
of the Row houses enjoy the stone construction
which insulates Quad buildings, and notably
administrator's offices, on warm summer and
spring days.
If the University gardeners were simply look
ing for things to do, they might have tinned
their attention to the area behind Memorial
Church. The oleander bushes and few decora
tive flower patches do little to prevent the
area from becoming a dust bowl in the summer
and a mud puddle in the winter.
The Stanford campus has long been lecog
nized as one the most beautiful in the country
for its rolling hills, spacious setting, and abun
dant greenery. We trust that the University
gardeners will keep this fact in mind the next
time they wield their power saws.
