## The 						Socrates of Southern California 
### Bob Fishman 
Southern California has final
ly found its Socrates.
His name is James W. New
man, and for $480 he will teach
you to understand yourself.
Among the benefits of self
understanding, Mr. New
man lists increased income,
more satisfying marriages, no
more smoking, and lower golf
scores.
His technique is to assemble
a group of young executives and
their wives in an exclusive hotel
for a four-day "PACE seminar."
"The most rewarding four
days of my life . . ~" said one
satisfied customer quoted in the
Los Angeles limes (February
12, 1967). "I doubled my income
within a year," said another.
No Intellectual
Mr. Newman is no cloistered
intellectual. "He didn't wait
around for a college degree," as
the Times reporter delicately
phrased it.
Nonetheless, he claims to em
ploy "widely accepted psychiat
ric principles—with novel meth
ods— for sound mental health,
packaged in the symbols of the
marketplace and the electronic
computer age."
Ah-ha! Revelations
Mr. Newman is known as a
spellbinding lecturer. (Perhaps
the one-martini-a-day limit he
suggests to his students adds
to his effectiveness.) He tries
to use "constructive imagina
tion" to lead his pupils to "ah
ha! revelations."
In the Times article, Mr. New
man relates an example ol his
techniques. He had been trying
to describe how increas&d self
esteem precedes increased ef
fectiveness.
"But," a young housewife ob
jected, "if I don't like others
better than I like myself, aren't
I being selfish?"

"How would you have liked
your husband," Newman replied,
"to have proposed to you in
this way: Honey, the reason I
want to marry you is not be
cause I'll derive any pleasure
from it—but I want to give YOU
pleasure.'"
The article continues: "She
mulled it a moment. Then her

eyes lit up with the 'ah-ha!' look
of sudden insight. She'd gotten
the point"
At another meeting, the young
executives were asked to imagine
that they were on their way to
a million dollar deal when a
freight train "boxes them in traf
fic." What should they do? The
response Newman liked best was

to abandon the car and crawl
over the freight.
As one might have guessed,
Mr. Newman caters to a "highly
motivated, goal-oriented" person
whose goal is increased profit.
His seminars don't encourage
much discussion about ends.
In his own terms, however,
Mr. Newman has been quite a

success. A door-to-door peddler
before he moved to Los Angeles
from Webster Groves, Missouri,
he now owns a bookstore and a
summer camp in addition to his
seminars.
He already runs one seminar
just for teenagers. Perhaps, one
day, there will be a seminar for
college students as well.
