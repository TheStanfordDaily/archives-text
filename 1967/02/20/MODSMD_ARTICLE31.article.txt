## Towards A Representative LASSU 
### Fritz Schaefer 
LASSU has at least 65 vacan
cies. Any one of these vacancies
(which range from Lagunita to
the Grove Project to the Law
School) could be filled by any
person in one of the unrepre
sented constituencies who has
enough interest in Stanford stu
dent government to have 15 of
his friends sign a petition for
him. And yet there is no sign
whatsoever that these positions
will be filled.
Of the 100 people who do oc
cupy seats in LASSU, the num
ber who were actually elected—
I mean the ones who had to
stand up and tell their constitu
ents what they stood for in or
der to win more votes than an
opponent — appears to be a
small fraction of 100. At least
20 LASSU members obtained
their positions by the sole virtue
of having 15 friends sign their
petitions. Many — exact figures
aren't kept — of the other
LASSU "representatives" were
reported as "elected" by their
dorm, eating club, etc., but In
reality obtained positions sim

ply because they were the only
members of their groups with
any desire to become members
of LASSU.
With these facts in mind is it
any wonder that LASSU asks
"How high?" when Dave Harris
and Tom Forstenzer order
"Jump." The Harris group
doesn't control the Legislature
because it represents students
—it controls LASSU because
Stanford's responsible students
have shirked their duty to pro
vide this university with repre
sentative student government.
Under the above conditions,
the concept of representative
student government at Stanford
is absolutely meaningless.
LASSU does not represent the
"student constituency."
It has been said that LASSU
has always been this way — a
pawn to whatever special inter
est group can muster enough
warm bodies to manhandle it.
But I would like to propose a
change that could drastically al
ter this situation. In the spirit
of true hypocrisy I will intro

duce this constitutional change
in th'i Legislature.
LASSU is presently suposed
to have one representative for
every 75 students. With an eye
to the fact that 70 "representa
tives" make it to a LASSU meet
ing on a good Thursday night,
I will propose that LASSU have
one representative for every 200
students.
Under this system, the scar
city of LASSU seats and their
greatly 'increased importance
would bring about elections —
the lifeblood of any representa
tive government. We as students
would actually choose our repre
sentatives. The mere prospect
of this revolutionary change
staggers my imagination.
The IFC would elect its 6 rep
resentatives as a body. The Eat
ing Clubs and Row Houses
would likewise act as individual
constituencies.
In addition the graduate stu
dent constituencies would be
changed. At present the 1613
graduate students in the Hu
manities and Sciences are sup

posed to elect their representa
tives as a body. Beyond the fact
that such elections have never
occurred, this is clearly ridicu
lous wher\ one considers the
amount of Interplay between the
Speech and Drama Department
and the Computer Science De
partment. Although the details
will have to be worked out
among the departments in
volved, one of the new constitu
encies might combine the Polit
ical Science and History Depart
ments. Similarly — as opposed
to the present system which
lumps together all 3433 grad en
gineers — Electrical, Civil, and
Aeronautical Engineers would
each have their own departmen
tal representative (s).
This efficient body of about 60
honest-to-goodness student rep
resentatives could bring to bear
the excellence and diversity of
the Stanford student community
to the problems which face
Stanford students. Isn't it about
time that we had a REPRE
SENTATIVE student govern
ment?

cies. Any one of these vacancies
(which range from Lagunita to
the Grove Project to the Law
School) could be filled by any
person in one of the unrepre
sented constituencies who has
enough interest in Stanford stu
dent government to have 15 of
his friends sign a petition for
him. And yet there is no sign
whatsoever that these positions
will be filled.
Of the 100 people who do oc
cupy seats in LASSU, the num
ber who were actually elected—
I mean the ones who had to
stand up and tell their constitu
ents what they stood for in or
der to win more votes than an
opponent — appears to be a
small fraction of 100. At least
20 LASSU members obtained
their positions by the sole virtue
of having 15 friends sign their
petitions. Many — exact figures
aren't kept — of the other
LASSU "representatives" were
reported as "elected" by their
dorm, eating club, etc., but In
reality obtained positions sim

ply because they were the only
members of their groups with
any desire to become members
of LASSU.
With these facts in mind is it
any wonder that LASSU asks
"How high?" when Dave Harris
and Tom Forstenzer order
"Jump." The Harris group
doesn't control the Legislature
because it represents students
—it controls LASSU because
Stanford's responsible students
have shirked their duty to pro
vide this university with repre
sentative student government.
Under the above conditions,
the concept of representative
student government at Stanford
is absolutely meaningless.
LASSU does not represent the
"student constituency."
It has been said that LASSU
has always been this way — a
pawn to whatever special inter
est group can muster enough
warm bodies to manhandle it.
But I would like to propose a
change that could drastically al
ter this situation. In the spirit
of true hypocrisy I will intro

duce this constitutional change
in th'i Legislature.
LASSU is presently suposed
to have one representative for
every 75 students. With an eye
to the fact that 70 "representa
tives" make it to a LASSU meet
ing on a good Thursday night,
I will propose that LASSU have
one representative for every 200
students.
Under this system, the scar
city of LASSU seats and their
greatly 'increased importance
would bring about elections —
the lifeblood of any representa
tive government. We as students
would actually choose our repre
sentatives. The mere prospect
of this revolutionary change
staggers my imagination.
The IFC would elect its 6 rep
resentatives as a body. The Eat
ing Clubs and Row Houses
would likewise act as individual
constituencies.
In addition the graduate stu
dent constituencies would be
changed. At present the 1613
graduate students in the Hu
manities and Sciences are sup

posed to elect their representa
tives as a body. Beyond the fact
that such elections have never
occurred, this is clearly ridicu
lous wher\ one considers the
amount of Interplay between the
Speech and Drama Department
and the Computer Science De
partment. Although the details
will have to be worked out
among the departments in
volved, one of the new constitu
encies might combine the Polit
ical Science and History Depart
ments. Similarly — as opposed
to the present system which
lumps together all 3433 grad en
gineers — Electrical, Civil, and
Aeronautical Engineers would
each have their own departmen
tal representative (s).
This efficient body of about 60
honest-to-goodness student rep
resentatives could bring to bear
the excellence and diversity of
the Stanford student community
to the problems which face
Stanford students. Isn't it about
time that we had a REPRE
SENTATIVE student govern
ment?
LASSU has at least 65 vacan
