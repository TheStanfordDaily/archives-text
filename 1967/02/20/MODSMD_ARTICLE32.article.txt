## Commission Members Charge Bias In Report Conclusions 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to bring to light
some facts about the workings
of the Fraternity Sub-committee
of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion. The basic information for
the report was gathered by in
terview. Due in part to the lack
of perseverance of the three in
terview teams, myself included,
this information was not avail
able until early in January.
Messrs. Calfee and Kugelmass
then undertook to write a draft
report. At a meeting of the com
mittee on February sth, Mr. Ku
gelmass gave an oral summary
of the report and we were
asked to approve it. Unfortu
nately a written copy of the re
port was unavailable. When sev
eral members of the committee
expressed reservations we were
told by Mr. Jacobi that a print
ing deadline precluded a full
scale review and it was a case
of either submitting the report
we had or submitting no report
at all.
It was finally decided that a
rough draft could be made
available for inspection later
that night and committee mem*
bers could approve it on an in
dividual basis. After reading the
report, several of us found it
contained minor inaccuracies and
misinterpretations and there
fore one member of each inter
view team met Monday and com
piled a list of suggested revi
sions. The majority of these
were accepted by Mr. Calfee and
we felt that the report was
ready for publication. At that
time, a majority of the commit
tee concurred in the report.
On Wednesday, Mr. Kugel
mass submitted an additional
three pages which comprise the
section, "Some Conclusions and
Proposals," as it appeared in

The Dally of February 15th.
When I read them, I felt that
they were unacceptable for two
reasons: 1) some of the conclu
sions and proposals, specifically
C and D and the observations
on rush, did not follow from the
information we had gathered;
and 2) the language of this sec
tion was intemperate and un
necessarily antagonistic and as
such detracted from the report
as a whole.
For these reasons I submitted
an alternate draft and explicitly
tolds Messrs. Calfee and Jacobi
that if the report appeared with
Mr. Kugelmass's conclusions in
his language, I did not approve
and did not want my name at
tached to the report unless my
objections were indicated in
some manner.
On Sunday the 11th, Mr. Cal
fee informed me that he had
turned both drafts over to Mr.
Jacobi. I heard nothing further
until I saw my name and the
report (with essentially Mr. Ku
gelmass's conclusions) in yes
terday's Daily.
These events lead me to sev
eral conclusions:
a) The main body of the sub
committee's report properly re
flects the view of the committee
and while it may contain inad
vertant inaccuracies, taken as a
whole it is an honest albeit crit
ical look at some aspects of
Stanford fraternities.
b) The final section repre
sents the views of some mem
bers of the committee but which
ones and how many is very
much an open question.
c) Either Mr. Jacobi or Mr.
Calfee or both were irresponsi
ble in their use of people's
names when they knew that in
two cases they had not read the
report and that in my own I had

specifically denied them the
right to use my name.
For these reasons, I ask that
Messrs. Calfee and Jacobi sub
mit the signatures of all mem
bers of the sub committee, with
an indication of their approval
or disapproval of the report, to
the Legislature. Until this is
done, neither the Legislature not
the university community can
accept this report and Messrs.
Calfee and Jacobi stand open to
the charge of jobbery.

• Disappointment
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the ASSU
Housing Commission's Fraterni
ty Sub-Committee — but one
who could not be present at the
final meeting of that body — I
was surprised and saddened by
the form in which the final re
port of the Sub-committee ap
peared.
I i.ad thought the report
would be complete; it was not;
I had thought it would be ob
jective: it was not; I had
thought it would give the Stan
ford community some perspec
tive on changes occurring in
fraternities: It did not. Most im
portantly, I had hoped it would
be a vehicle for deepening and
broadening the flow of creative
ideas and actions we have wit
nessed from some of the houses
in recent months, whereas the
only thing to be expected now is
reaction.
I do not agree with the idea
of selective living, and for that
reason dissociated myself from
my former fraternity three
months ago. Neither do I agree
with selective reporting and vir
tual coercion, and for that rea
son dissociate myself from the
Fraternity Sub-Committee re
port at this time.

• Militancy
Editor, The Daily:
The hostile reception planned
for Vice-President Humphrey
underscores a disturbing nega
tivism among those whose self
proclaimed virtue is a positive
approach to international prob
lems. An understandable dis
agreement with this aotmtiys
policy in Vietnam has become
the basis for an all-out assault
on an Admin'stration which is
seeking an expansion of foreign
aid and ratification of an impor
tant US-Soviet consular treaty
by the Senate, an Administra
tion which has promoted direct
air service between New York
and Moscow and which at the
present time is earnestly trying
to build bridges to Eastern Eu
rope and prevent an anti-missile
development race between the
two superpowers.
All of these — and there are
many more- -are worthy liberal
objectives. In the long run they
may be more fateful than Viet
nam itself. The liberally ori
ented at Stanford must main
tain some sense of proportion if
they are to contribute to efforts
such as these. Lyndon Johnson,
whatever his faults, is no Barry
Gold water. Much of his pro
gram at home and abroad mer
its support, especially in the
face of strong conservative op
position. Doctrinal militancy can
only prove self-defeating in the
end, as we have begun to see al
ready in California.

• Walk-Out
Editor, The Daily:
The Walk-Out at this morn
ing's Vice Presidential panel
discussion was planned by an
open meeting of some 80-90 stu
dents and faculty members. The
group appeared to be a reason
able cross section of those op
posed to the war In Vietnam
and, after lengthy discussion,
only 3 or 4 people dissented
from the final decision.
The Walk-Out will be quiet
and dignified and will come at
a natural break in the program
when the discussion is open to
questions from the floor (assum
ing that the format is not
changed).
This is a non-disruptive ges
ture by the academic commu
nity symbolizing our awareness
that no real dialogue is possible
and that Humphrey's position
on the war is intolerable. Please
join us if you oppose the war.

• LASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Before Mr. Schaefer writes
any more about LASSU's "in
crowd tyranny" (Monday's
Daily), he might consider some
of his own "distortions of reali
ty."
I'm not in-with the-crowd-el
ther, Mr. Schaefer, but I do not
believe that Speaker Tom Fors
tenzer is the evil man you make
him out to be. He may be auto

cratic, sarcastic, 111-tempered and
sneaky—but he's not, I think,
dishonest. More perhaps than
the rest of us, he calls the shots
as he sees them.
Forstenzer would be the first
to admit, I believe, that he has
not taken his role as speaker
passively; he's more than a mod
erator of discussion. By his own
admission, he has written much
of this year's legislation, and
"with the consent ol the body,"
has actively supported them in
debate. Some members have
even admitted to attending ses
sions just to watch him per
form.
But isn't his dominance of the
Legislature more the fault of
the rest of us than it is his? Un
less we come to the Legislature
with proposals of our own, what
can we possibly expect to do
but listen to his? If Forstenzer
hadn't generated a few issues
himself, he might well have
found himself with no group to
preside over.
I agree with you, Mr. Schae
fer, that the Legislature is
functioning badly—l think Tom
Forstenzer would too. It seems
to me, however, that the prob
lem is more structural than per
sonal. And the structural ques
tion involves not only LASSU,
but student government in gen
eral.
Student government at Stan
ford serves two basic purposes:
It provides benefits to students
on its own initiative and author
ity, and it seeks to represent
"student opinion" to decision
making groups of faculty and
administrators. In the first area,
student government could func
tion very effectively—and has in
the past. Regrettably, Mr. Har
ris has brought little leadership
or inspiration to this area.
Both Mr. Harris and Mr. Fors
tenzer have, however, devoted
considerable effort to serving
the second purpose. They've
concerned themselves all year
with how student government,
as an Institution, can participate
In University decision making.
They've looked upon students as
a constituency having Interests
and opinions essentially differ
ent from faculty or administra
tion. Such a constituency, they
argue, is properly represented
on University committees
through the elected student gov
emment. Thus, they demand
that LASSU select or approve
the student members of the
Packer committee.
This concept of negotiation be
tween representatives of three
constituencies fits Imperfectly
with that of a student legisla
ture, at least as it now exists
at Stanford. Too large to nego
tiate issues directly, LASSU has
been forced to delegate the rep
resentative function to the five
student members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen. In operation,
this has reduced the Legisla
ture's role to that of hearing
reports from the students who
actually participated in the ne
gotiations. The problem has
been complicated this year by
the fact that Mr. Harris and the
four people he appointed to the
Committee all seem to report
the same thing.
The Legislature, of itself,
can't do a damn thing. Over and
over again this year, the Legis
lature has had to decide between
dropping an issue or referring
it to the mass of students in
the form of a demonstration,
rally, or referendum. But by its
own legislation, it can't force
anybody to do anything. Last
week's rather pathetic proposal
to make student participation on
the Packer committee a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard is an indication of the Leg
islature's interest in getting
some power of its own.
This year has shown that ex
pressions of massive student
support are not available at the
call of Dave Harris or the Legis
lature. The concept of student,
faculty, and administration con
stituencies doesn't seem to be
adequately explaining the way
that opinion divides on this
campus. Members of the Stan
ford community seem to be
evaluating issues independently,
without reference to their role
as student, teacher, or adminis
trator.
And thus we have a Legisla
ture frustrated by its impotence,
where unhappy student leaders
air there views before people
who agree with them in the first
place. Other students, in dis
agreement or in apathy, choose
to do more important things on
a Thursday night. Perhaps they
see no point in expressing their
opinions before a body that
can't enforce the decisions it
makes.
So the status quo, Mr. Schae
fer, is not exactly the fault of
Tom Forstenzer. I suggest you
take the present situation as
given and address yourself to
the question of what role, if
any, a student legislature can
serve at Stanford if it has no
power to enforce its decisions
on the students. Perhaps one
how best to integrate LASSU
into the decision making struc
ture of the faculty and adminis
tration.
