# Chaparral Overworks Playboy Philosophy
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
Writing reviews is necessarily an
individual thing, and reviews of hu
mor magazines especially so.
Nevertheless, it can be safely said
that the new edition of the Stanford
Chaparral — The Legalize Spiritual
Discovery and Pornography Issue —
las elements that will satisfy several
conceptions of what a college humor
magazine should be.
If you feel, for example, that one
should be a quasi Playboy, lacking
he class and polished writing of orig
inal, then the Chaparral will suit you
fine.
New Approach
Many years ago the Chaparral went
off on the tangent of featuring a girl
jn the center of the magazine, so the
increase of one girl to three in this
dition is not surprising.
Also featured, however, are an "in
terview" with an LSD user, "The Hip
pies" ABZ's," and the latest install
ment of "Powerpie;" all direct if fee
ble imitations of features in the par
ent magazine.
Playboy is a popular magazine, and
~ot coincidentally the Chaparral's
first parody of it, IMayboy I, was the
most successful Chappie ever. The
,'haparral staff seems to have decided
on the basis of that success and that
of T>ayboy II that the Stanford cam
pus really wants the Playboy format.
Unfortunately, they are beating a dead

horse. Layboy I was reasonably
bright, clever, and original. In addi
tion, hasty University officials banned
it, insuring its immortal fame. Lay
boy II was none of these things; its
success was due to an intelligent pro
motional campaign and the reputa
tion of its predecessor. Further ef
forts along the Playboy line seem des
tined to be even less successful, if
this edition can be taken as an exam
ple.
OfT-Color Jokra
If you road college humor maga
zines for their suggestive and slight
ly off-color jokes, you will find the
new Chaparral will be very much to
your liking. It contains as well a puz
zling fascination and an inordinate
enjoyment in using the word "pie" to
refer to girls.
The Chaparral has long held the
mistaken notion that saying some
thing dirty is saying something fun
ny, and this tendency has unfortu
nately not been checked.
But for those of you, however few,
who feel that a college humor maga
zine should be genuinely funny, then
don't buy the Chaparral; it is not. If
you feel a college humor magazine
should contain a few mature and so
phisticated stories that are not per
vaded by a junior high school snick
ering about sex, then save your 50
cents, because the Chaparral doesn't
and maybe never will.
