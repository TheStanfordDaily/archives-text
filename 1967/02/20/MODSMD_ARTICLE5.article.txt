# Organizers Discuss Protest With Sterling
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Managing: Editor 
Seven of the faculty members orga
nizing the silent protest against Vice
President Humphrey met Friday with
University President Wallace Sterling.
According to those present at the
meeting, Sterling made no effort to
persuade any of them to change his
plans for the protest, although he did
say he was against the idea of a walk
out.
Sterling reportedly told the group
that he did not feel he could take any
position himself because his position
would be interpreted as an official Uni
versity policy statement. He did say,
however, that he supported their right
to protest, and in fact had supported It
at the Board of Trustees meeting in
San Francisco the day before.
At the start of the meeting, which
was held at Sterling's request and in
his office, the President handed a copy
of the University policy on demon
strations to each of the seven. At this
point, they say, he apparently was not

sure what form of protests they were
planning.
The University policy states that
demonstrations may not be held in
side University building and may not
"interfere with classes (or) sched
uled meetings."
Some of those involved in planning
the walkout have said that those
among the seven who went into the
meeting sympathetic to the idea of
a walkout felt obliged afterward to
support only the silent protest. Those
present denied the charge.
Sterling was out of town yesterday
and could not be reached for com
ment.
The seven at the meeting were Rob
ert MacAfee Brown, Professor of Re
ligion; Charles Drekemier, Professor
of Political Science; Albert Guerard,
Professor of English; Mark Mancall,
Assistant Professor of History; Hu
bert Marshall, Professor of Political
Science; B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Chapel and Professor of Religion;
and Lucio Ruotolo, Associate Profes
sor of English.
