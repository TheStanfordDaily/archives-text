# Protest Plans Completed For HHH Speech Today
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
Silence and a walkout have emerged
as the primary tactics of protest ac
companying Vice President Hubert
Humphrey's appearance in Memorial
Auditorium this morning.
The program will begin at 11:30.
Humphrey will not present a pre
pared statement; instead, a panel will
question him for about 25 minutes
and will then read written questions
from the floor. Question cards will be
distributed at the door and collected
shortly before the program starts.
Claiming that Humphrey has "un
equivocally endorsed" the administra
tion policy in Vietnam, faculty mem

bers and students have organized pro
tests to his appearance.
Over two hundred faculty mem
bers, 90 per cent of them assistant,
associate, or full professors, have
signed a statement urging the Stan
ford community to wear white arm
bands and "remain silent throughout
the meeting, without heckling or ap
plauding."
Director of University Relations
Lyle M. Nelson last night denied re
ports that persons wearing armbands
would be refused admission to the
auditorium. "No such decision has
been made or will be made," he said.
Second Tactic
A second strategy which has devel
oped is to walkout in the middle of
the meeting. Faculty and student sup
porters of this plan have issued a
number of statements and last night
held a teach-in in Cubberley.
The faculty group proposing silence
as a protest first met last Wednesday
noon to determine "the type of re
sponse an academic community
should make to indicate disavowal of
administration policy," according to
Religion Professor Robert MacAfee
Brown, a supporter of the plan.
The group, Brown said, did not feel
action such as a boycott would be
responsible. Action such as the rough
treatment of Goldberg and MacNa
mara at Harvard, he added would also
be inappropriate.
"But we needed some sign of our
disassociation with the administra
tion position," Brown stressed, "to in
dicate the profound disquiet that we
feel."
"Silence," he continued, was agreed
to be the "most dramatic way" to ex
press this feeling.
Hitting: Home
"Humphrey can handle hecklers
beautifully," Brown stated. "We want
to do nothing to give him the indica
tion that he has hit home."
History Professor Mark Mancall
had seen the silent treatment in prac
tice in Helsinki against Nikita Khru
shchev and said that it had been very
effective.
English Professor Lucio Ruotolo,
one of the organizers of the silent

protest, stated that he expects about
10C0 of the audience to be silent.
The walkout idea was originated at
another meeting of both students and
faculty members held last Wednesday
to discuss strategy for protest. The
proposal that developed was to listen
to the first half of the program, the
questions by panelists, and to leave
the auditorium when questions from
the audience were raised. "That Is the
posed to be involved in some way or
another," explained Barry Greenberg,
"It might be old and familiar, but
a supporter of this idea. The group
plans to hold a public meeting out
side of the auditorium for those who
walk out.
Greenberg has estimated that about
200 people will walk out.
First In
Admittance to Mem Aud will be on
a "first-come, first-serve" basis, and
identifications will be checked. Due to
the small size of the auditorium, only
students, faculty, and administration
will be admitted.
In a memo addressed to "all mem
bers of the instructional staff,"
trar Harvey Hall urged that faculty
"plan classwork in such a way that
students who choose to attend this
event can make up work which they
miss."
Chuck Bell, president of Political
Union, the sponsor of Humphrey's
visit, reported that the Vice President
was contacted in November. Contrary
to ideas that "he was thrust upon
Stanford," Bell stated, "we have been
actively trying to get him."
"Humphrey should be judged on
what he has to say rather than pre
judged on the basis of his position as
a member of the administration," Bell
stated.
In opposition to the planned pro
test, the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans have written the Vice
President welcoming him to Stanford
and expressing gratitude for the op
portunity to hear and ask questions
of him. They have firmly dissociated
themselves from all protesting and
dissenting elements of the University
community.

number of statements and last night
held a teach-in in Cubberley.
The faculty group proposing silence
as a protest first met last Wednesday
noon to determine "the type of re
sponse an academic community
should make to indicate disavowal of
administration policy," according to
Religion Professor Robert MacAfee
Brown, a supporter of the plan.
The group, Brown said, did not feel
action such as a boycott would be
responsible. Action such as the rough
treatment of Goldberg and MacNa
mara at Harvard, he added would also
be inappropriate.
"But we needed some sign of our
disassociation with the administra
tion position," Brown stressed, "to in
dicate the profound disquiet that we
feel."
"Silence," he continued, was agreed
to be the "most dramatic way" to ex
press this feeling.
Hitting: Home
"Humphrey can handle hecklers
beautifully," Brown stated. "We want
to do nothing to give him the indica
tion that he has hit home."
History Professor Mark Mancall
had seen the silent treatment in prac
tice in Helsinki against Nikita Khru
shchev and said that it had been very
effective.
English Professor Lucio Ruotolo,
one of the organizers of the silent

protest, stated that he expects about
10C0 of the audience to be silent.
The walkout idea was originated at
another meeting of both students and
faculty members held last Wednesday
to discuss strategy for protest. The
proposal that developed was to listen
to the first half of the program, the
questions by panelists, and to leave
the auditorium when questions from
the audience were raised. "That Is the
posed to be involved in some way or
another," explained Barry Greenberg,
"It might be old and familiar, but
a supporter of this idea. The group
plans to hold a public meeting out
side of the auditorium for those who
walk out.
Greenberg has estimated that about
200 people will walk out.
First In
Admittance to Mem Aud will be on
a "first-come, first-serve" basis, and
identifications will be checked. Due to
the small size of the auditorium, only
students, faculty, and administration
will be admitted.
In a memo addressed to "all mem
bers of the instructional staff,"
trar Harvey Hall urged that faculty
"plan classwork in such a way that
students who choose to attend this
event can make up work which they
miss."
Chuck Bell, president of Political
Union, the sponsor of Humphrey's
visit, reported that the Vice President
was contacted in November. Contrary
to ideas that "he was thrust upon
Stanford," Bell stated, "we have been
actively trying to get him."
"Humphrey should be judged on
what he has to say rather than pre
judged on the basis of his position as
a member of the administration," Bell
stated.
In opposition to the planned pro
test, the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans have written the Vice
President welcoming him to Stanford
and expressing gratitude for the op
portunity to hear and ask questions
of him. They have firmly dissociated
themselves from all protesting and
dissenting elements of the University
community.
Silence and a walkout have emerged
as the primary tactics of protest ac
companying Vice President Hubert
Humphrey's appearance in Memorial
Auditorium this morning.
The program will begin at 11:30.
Humphrey will not present a pre
pared statement; instead, a panel will
question him for about 25 minutes
and will then read written questions
from the floor. Question cards will be
distributed at the door and collected
shortly before the program starts.
Claiming that Humphrey has "un
equivocally endorsed" the administra
tion policy in Vietnam, faculty mem

bers and students have organized pro
tests to his appearance.
Over two hundred faculty mem
bers, 90 per cent of them assistant,
associate, or full professors, have
signed a statement urging the Stan
ford community to wear white arm
bands and "remain silent throughout
the meeting, without heckling or ap
plauding."
Director of University Relations
Lyle M. Nelson last night denied re
ports that persons wearing armbands
would be refused admission to the
auditorium. "No such decision has
been made or will be made," he said.

10C0 of the audience to be silent.
The walkout idea was originated at
another meeting of both students and
faculty members held last Wednesday
to discuss strategy for protest. The
proposal that developed was to listen
to the first half of the program, the
questions by panelists, and to leave
the auditorium when questions from
the audience were raised. "That Is the
posed to be involved in some way or
another," explained Barry Greenberg,
"It might be old and familiar, but
a supporter of this idea. The group
plans to hold a public meeting out
side of the auditorium for those who
walk out.
Greenberg has estimated that about
200 people will walk out.
First In
Admittance to Mem Aud will be on
a "first-come, first-serve" basis, and
identifications will be checked. Due to
the small size of the auditorium, only
students, faculty, and administration
will be admitted.
In a memo addressed to "all mem
bers of the instructional staff,"
trar Harvey Hall urged that faculty
"plan classwork in such a way that
students who choose to attend this
event can make up work which they
miss."
Chuck Bell, president of Political
Union, the sponsor of Humphrey's
visit, reported that the Vice President
was contacted in November. Contrary
to ideas that "he was thrust upon
Stanford," Bell stated, "we have been
actively trying to get him."
"Humphrey should be judged on
what he has to say rather than pre
judged on the basis of his position as
a member of the administration," Bell
stated.
In opposition to the planned pro
test, the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans have written the Vice
President welcoming him to Stanford
and expressing gratitude for the op
portunity to hear and ask questions
of him. They have firmly dissociated
themselves from all protesting and
dissenting elements of the University
community.
Silence and a walkout have emerged
as the primary tactics of protest ac
companying Vice President Hubert
Humphrey's appearance in Memorial
Auditorium this morning.
The program will begin at 11:30.
Humphrey will not present a pre
pared statement; instead, a panel will
question him for about 25 minutes
and will then read written questions
from the floor. Question cards will be
distributed at the door and collected
shortly before the program starts.
Claiming that Humphrey has "un
equivocally endorsed" the administra
tion policy in Vietnam, faculty mem

bers and students have organized pro
tests to his appearance.
Over two hundred faculty mem
bers, 90 per cent of them assistant,
associate, or full professors, have
signed a statement urging the Stan
ford community to wear white arm
bands and "remain silent throughout
the meeting, without heckling or ap
plauding."
Director of University Relations
Lyle M. Nelson last night denied re
ports that persons wearing armbands
would be refused admission to the
auditorium. "No such decision has
been made or will be made," he said.
Second Tactic
A second strategy which has devel
oped is to walkout in the middle of
the meeting. Faculty and student sup
porters of this plan have issued a
number of statements and last night
held a teach-in in Cubberley.
The faculty group proposing silence
as a protest first met last Wednesday
noon to determine "the type of re
sponse an academic community
should make to indicate disavowal of
administration policy," according to
Religion Professor Robert MacAfee
Brown, a supporter of the plan.
The group, Brown said, did not feel
action such as a boycott would be
responsible. Action such as the rough
treatment of Goldberg and MacNa
mara at Harvard, he added would also
be inappropriate.
"But we needed some sign of our
disassociation with the administra
tion position," Brown stressed, "to in
dicate the profound disquiet that we
feel."
"Silence," he continued, was agreed
to be the "most dramatic way" to ex
press this feeling.
Hitting: Home
"Humphrey can handle hecklers
beautifully," Brown stated. "We want
to do nothing to give him the indica
tion that he has hit home."
History Professor Mark Mancall
had seen the silent treatment in prac
tice in Helsinki against Nikita Khru
shchev and said that it had been very
effective.
English Professor Lucio Ruotolo,
one of the organizers of the silent

protest, stated that he expects about
10C0 of the audience to be silent.
