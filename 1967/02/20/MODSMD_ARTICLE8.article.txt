# Austria Move May Be Postponed
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Chances are good that the Austria
campus will be relocated in the Vien
na "Staudenhaus" next September.
However Bob Hamrdla, assistant to
the director of overseas campuses,
pointed out a slight possibility exists
that the transition will be postponed
until September, 1968. The reason for
this uncertainty is negotiations with
the Panhans are still unfinished.
"We feel obligated to inform the
Stanford community of the current
situation for it is bound to have some
effect on student decisions to apply to
Stanford • in • Austria," Hamrdla ex

plained. "The odds are probably 9 to 1
that Austria V will be located in Vien
na, but we cannot be absolutely sure
until administrative matters are com
pleted."

Details of the long-rumored Vienna
campus were released last week. The
new campus will be situated in a pri
vately run "studenthaus" (home for
students) in the Ringstrasse area of
old Vienna. The top floor of the sev
eral-storied building will be occupied
by Austrian and foreign students who
do not eat on the premises but will
be sharing library facilities with
Stanford students and holding occa

sional evening seminars in the class
rooms.
According to Hamrdla, Stanford is
fortunate that the building requires
little remodeling. The accomodations
are modern, and the kitchen is large
enough to serve the 80 students plus
factulty and administrators. He ex
plained the living quarters approxi
mate those at the French campus in
Tours.
When asked about the proposed
move's effect on the group leaving for
Semmering in March, Hamrdla re
plied, "Austria IV has shown excep
tionally high morale. Their hostel last
month was one of the best we've ever
had. They have known about the move

for some time, and to my knowledge
nobody has dropped from the group
for that reason."

Hamrdla said that efforts have in
creased at the present campus to fa
cilitate access to Vienna. Every Fri
day a bus will transport students who
wish to travel to the Austrian capital
and return that evening. In addition,
tickets to a wider range of cultural
events will be made available to stu
dents.
"Efforts are being made at all the
campuses, not only Austria, to offer
a greater variety of optional cultural
opportunities — such as three-day
field trips," stated Hamrdla.

Details of the long-rumored Vienna
campus were released last week. The
new campus will be situated in a pri
vately run "studenthaus" (home for
students) in the Ringstrasse area of
old Vienna. The top floor of the sev
eral-storied building will be occupied
by Austrian and foreign students who
do not eat on the premises but will
be sharing library facilities with
Stanford students and holding occa

sional evening seminars in the class
rooms.
According to Hamrdla, Stanford is
fortunate that the building requires
little remodeling. The accomodations
are modern, and the kitchen is large
enough to serve the 80 students plus
factulty and administrators. He ex
plained the living quarters approxi
mate those at the French campus in
Tours.
When asked about the proposed
move's effect on the group leaving for
Semmering in March, Hamrdla re
plied, "Austria IV has shown excep
tionally high morale. Their hostel last
month was one of the best we've ever
had. They have known about the move

for some time, and to my knowledge
nobody has dropped from the group
for that reason."

Hamrdla said that efforts have in
creased at the present campus to fa
cilitate access to Vienna. Every Fri
day a bus will transport students who
wish to travel to the Austrian capital
and return that evening. In addition,
tickets to a wider range of cultural
events will be made available to stu
dents.
"Efforts are being made at all the
campuses, not only Austria, to offer
a greater variety of optional cultural
opportunities — such as three-day
field trips," stated Hamrdla.
Chances are good that the Austria
campus will be relocated in the Vien
na "Staudenhaus" next September.
However Bob Hamrdla, assistant to
the director of overseas campuses,
pointed out a slight possibility exists
that the transition will be postponed
until September, 1968. The reason for
this uncertainty is negotiations with
the Panhans are still unfinished.
"We feel obligated to inform the
Stanford community of the current
situation for it is bound to have some
effect on student decisions to apply to
Stanford • in • Austria," Hamrdla ex

plained. "The odds are probably 9 to 1
that Austria V will be located in Vien
na, but we cannot be absolutely sure
until administrative matters are com
pleted."
