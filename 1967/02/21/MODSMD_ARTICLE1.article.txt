## HHH Stands By President's Policy 
### PAT McMAHON Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily 
"If we persevere and persist, a sig
nificant change will be brought about
within a year," said Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey in a campus
speech sporadically disturbed by pro
tests.
Answering questions on Vietnam
and other current issues, the Vice
President reaffirmed Administration
policies but remarked that there have
been "disagreements" within Presi
dent Johnson's cabinet. He admitted
that he himself had '"spoken up" to
LB J.
Humphrey said that the elections
in the spring and summer of this
year would reaffirm the stand of the
South Vietnamese government and
Hanoi would know"the ball game is
over."
First Protest: Silence
Protest was first visible before the
beginning of Humhprey's speech

when over 1000 of the 1700 present
refused to acknowledge his presence
by standing, and maintained a silent
protest.
After Humphrey concluded his in
troductory remarks, about 60 students
and faculty in the balcony area walk
ed out. Later as Humphrey specu
lated that the Kennedy administra
tion would be pursuing the some poli
cies as the present one, another 200
people left the auditorium. He told
the audience, "This is the real smart
crowd. They have all the information
they need."
After the forum was over, several
hundred students and faculty waited
for Humphrey's reparture around the
exits of the Auditorium. He appeared
at a window for a moment and the
crowd ran to the window shouting
"shame, shame on you, Hubert Hum
phrey, for killing babies."
Protective Esoort
A team of secret service men and

Santa Clara County Police joined
arms and escorted him to his waiting
limousine. Students trying to block
the Vice President's path were un
successful, shouting continually
"shame."
In a statement made yesterday af
ternoon President Sterling said,
"I am pleased that the convoca
tion at which the Vice President
spoke was orderly and consistent with
the tradition of free expression in a
university community.
"It is unfortunate that, as the Vice
President's car left the campus fol
lowing the meeting, a group of stu
dents and non-students who had
gathered outside during his talk at
tempted unsuccessfully to impede his
departure.
"Stanford regrets this incident and
offers its apology to the Vice Presi
dent for any inconvenience or em
barrassment that it may have caused
him."

Addressing himself to the "now
generation," Humphrey began the
program with a short talk on the
Great Society and the role of students
in the world today.
People who have the opportunity to
improve the situation of the world's
poverty-stricken, "could not and will
not pause." He pointed out that there
are those in government who do
pause, that "this is not the pause
that refreshes, but the pause the re
trenches."
He urged that there should be
"change, more than for the purpose
of change."
In the open forum, the Vice Presi
dent answered questions first from
a panel of students and faculty; then
the panel asked some audience-sug
gested and randomly selected ques
tions.
Goldwaterisin
A variety of questions ranging from
the recent CIA - NSA controversy to
the credibility gap were presented.
Speaking on Vietnam and contrast
ing President Johnson's policy to that
advocated by Barry Goldwater, Hum
phrey said, "President Johnson is a
'man of restraint.' He seeks to apply
power to a limited objective."
Humphrey articulated the differ
ences between the two men as a "mat
ter of degree, restx-aint, and general
policy."
He also spoke of recent attempts at
peace feelers by Soviet Premier Alexei
Kosygin. When he met with Humph
rey about one year ago, the Vice Pres
ident recalled, Kosygin told him that
he (Kosygin) had no influence in
Hanoi.
The Vice President cited the recent
meeting between Kosygin and Prime
Minister Harold Wilson in London
and pointed out that their combined
plea to Hanoi brought no response.
Speaking to a question suggesting
that the Vice President had rejected
his liberal principles in supporting
the Administration policy, Humphrey
denied such an implication.
"Failure is not synonymous with
liberalism," the Vice President said,
"too often intellectualism is confused
with negativism, liberalism with pro
test."
Humphrey added that he was pleas
ed that the ClA's financial dealings
with the National Student Association
(NSA) were disclosed.
"Out of this," he said, "I hope will
come an agreement to keep the CIA
out of student affairs."
"These are sad times," he continued,
and spoke of his various efforts to find
funds for the NSA. "I helped NSA
get private funds from private citi
zens, and private sources."
He also noted that in the event of
a Sino-Soviet war, which he deplored
as he said he deplored the thought of
any way, would "dry up at once" any
war in Vietnam, and cited the civil
war in Turkey during the late 1940's-
The Vice President was also asked
what the reason for the enchantment
with Kennedy by the academic com
munity as contrasted with the disillu
sionment with Johnson's administra
tion was caused by.
He replied, "I have never found
out."

tests.
Answering questions on Vietnam
and other current issues, the Vice
President reaffirmed Administration
policies but remarked that there have
been "disagreements" within Presi
dent Johnson's cabinet. He admitted
that he himself had '"spoken up" to
LB J.
Humphrey said that the elections
in the spring and summer of this
year would reaffirm the stand of the
South Vietnamese government and
Hanoi would know"the ball game is
over."
First Protest: Silence
Protest was first visible before the
beginning of Humhprey's speech

when over 1000 of the 1700 present
refused to acknowledge his presence
by standing, and maintained a silent
protest.
After Humphrey concluded his in
troductory remarks, about 60 students
and faculty in the balcony area walk
ed out. Later as Humphrey specu
lated that the Kennedy administra
tion would be pursuing the some poli
cies as the present one, another 200
people left the auditorium. He told
the audience, "This is the real smart
crowd. They have all the information
they need."
After the forum was over, several
hundred students and faculty waited
for Humphrey's reparture around the
exits of the Auditorium. He appeared
at a window for a moment and the
crowd ran to the window shouting
"shame, shame on you, Hubert Hum
phrey, for killing babies."
Protective Esoort
A team of secret service men and

Santa Clara County Police joined
arms and escorted him to his waiting
limousine. Students trying to block
the Vice President's path were un
successful, shouting continually
"shame."
In a statement made yesterday af
ternoon President Sterling said,
"I am pleased that the convoca
tion at which the Vice President
spoke was orderly and consistent with
the tradition of free expression in a
university community.
"It is unfortunate that, as the Vice
President's car left the campus fol
lowing the meeting, a group of stu
dents and non-students who had
gathered outside during his talk at
tempted unsuccessfully to impede his
departure.
"Stanford regrets this incident and
offers its apology to the Vice Presi
dent for any inconvenience or em
barrassment that it may have caused
him."

Addressing himself to the "now
generation," Humphrey began the
program with a short talk on the
Great Society and the role of students
in the world today.
People who have the opportunity to
improve the situation of the world's
poverty-stricken, "could not and will
not pause." He pointed out that there
are those in government who do
pause, that "this is not the pause
that refreshes, but the pause the re
trenches."
He urged that there should be
"change, more than for the purpose
of change."
In the open forum, the Vice Presi
dent answered questions first from
a panel of students and faculty; then
the panel asked some audience-sug
gested and randomly selected ques
tions.
Goldwaterisin
A variety of questions ranging from
the recent CIA - NSA controversy to
the credibility gap were presented.
Speaking on Vietnam and contrast
ing President Johnson's policy to that
advocated by Barry Goldwater, Hum
phrey said, "President Johnson is a
'man of restraint.' He seeks to apply
power to a limited objective."
Humphrey articulated the differ
ences between the two men as a "mat
ter of degree, restx-aint, and general
policy."
He also spoke of recent attempts at
peace feelers by Soviet Premier Alexei
Kosygin. When he met with Humph
rey about one year ago, the Vice Pres
ident recalled, Kosygin told him that
he (Kosygin) had no influence in
Hanoi.
The Vice President cited the recent
meeting between Kosygin and Prime
Minister Harold Wilson in London
and pointed out that their combined
plea to Hanoi brought no response.
Speaking to a question suggesting
that the Vice President had rejected
his liberal principles in supporting
the Administration policy, Humphrey
denied such an implication.
"Failure is not synonymous with
liberalism," the Vice President said,
"too often intellectualism is confused
with negativism, liberalism with pro
test."
Humphrey added that he was pleas
ed that the ClA's financial dealings
with the National Student Association
(NSA) were disclosed.
"Out of this," he said, "I hope will
come an agreement to keep the CIA
out of student affairs."
"These are sad times," he continued,
and spoke of his various efforts to find
funds for the NSA. "I helped NSA
get private funds from private citi
zens, and private sources."
He also noted that in the event of
a Sino-Soviet war, which he deplored
as he said he deplored the thought of
any way, would "dry up at once" any
war in Vietnam, and cited the civil
war in Turkey during the late 1940's-
The Vice President was also asked
what the reason for the enchantment
with Kennedy by the academic com
munity as contrasted with the disillu
sionment with Johnson's administra
tion was caused by.
He replied, "I have never found
out."
"If we persevere and persist, a sig
nificant change will be brought about
within a year," said Vice President

tests.

LB J.
Humphrey said that the elections
in the spring and summer of this
year would reaffirm the stand of the
South Vietnamese government and
Hanoi would know"the ball game is
over."
First Protest: Silence
Protest was first visible before the
beginning of Humhprey's speech

when over 1000 of the 1700 present
refused to acknowledge his presence
by standing, and maintained a silent
protest.
After Humphrey concluded his in
troductory remarks, about 60 students
and faculty in the balcony area walk
ed out. Later as Humphrey specu
lated that the Kennedy administra
tion would be pursuing the some poli
cies as the present one, another 200
people left the auditorium. He told
the audience, "This is the real smart
crowd. They have all the information
they need."
After the forum was over, several
hundred students and faculty waited
for Humphrey's reparture around the
exits of the Auditorium. He appeared
at a window for a moment and the
crowd ran to the window shouting
"shame, shame on you, Hubert Hum
phrey, for killing babies."
Protective Esoort
A team of secret service men and

Santa Clara County Police joined
arms and escorted him to his waiting
limousine. Students trying to block
the Vice President's path were un
successful, shouting continually
"shame."
In a statement made yesterday af
ternoon President Sterling said,
"I am pleased that the convoca
tion at which the Vice President
spoke was orderly and consistent with
the tradition of free expression in a
university community.
"It is unfortunate that, as the Vice
President's car left the campus fol
lowing the meeting, a group of stu
dents and non-students who had
gathered outside during his talk at
tempted unsuccessfully to impede his
departure.
"Stanford regrets this incident and
offers its apology to the Vice Presi
dent for any inconvenience or em
barrassment that it may have caused
him."

Addressing himself to the "now
generation," Humphrey began the
program with a short talk on the
Great Society and the role of students
in the world today.
People who have the opportunity to
improve the situation of the world's
poverty-stricken, "could not and will
not pause." He pointed out that there
are those in government who do
pause, that "this is not the pause
that refreshes, but the pause the re
trenches."
He urged that there should be
"change, more than for the purpose
of change."
In the open forum, the Vice Presi
dent answered questions first from
a panel of students and faculty; then
the panel asked some audience-sug
gested and randomly selected ques
tions.
Goldwaterisin
A variety of questions ranging from
the recent CIA - NSA controversy to
the credibility gap were presented.
Speaking on Vietnam and contrast
ing President Johnson's policy to that
advocated by Barry Goldwater, Hum
phrey said, "President Johnson is a
'man of restraint.' He seeks to apply
power to a limited objective."
Humphrey articulated the differ
ences between the two men as a "mat
ter of degree, restx-aint, and general
policy."
He also spoke of recent attempts at
peace feelers by Soviet Premier Alexei
Kosygin. When he met with Humph
rey about one year ago, the Vice Pres
ident recalled, Kosygin told him that
he (Kosygin) had no influence in
Hanoi.
The Vice President cited the recent
meeting between Kosygin and Prime
Minister Harold Wilson in London
and pointed out that their combined
plea to Hanoi brought no response.
Speaking to a question suggesting
that the Vice President had rejected
his liberal principles in supporting
the Administration policy, Humphrey
denied such an implication.
"Failure is not synonymous with
liberalism," the Vice President said,
"too often intellectualism is confused
with negativism, liberalism with pro
test."
Humphrey added that he was pleas
ed that the ClA's financial dealings
with the National Student Association
(NSA) were disclosed.
"Out of this," he said, "I hope will
come an agreement to keep the CIA
out of student affairs."
"These are sad times," he continued,
and spoke of his various efforts to find
funds for the NSA. "I helped NSA
get private funds from private citi
zens, and private sources."
He also noted that in the event of
a Sino-Soviet war, which he deplored
as he said he deplored the thought of
any way, would "dry up at once" any
war in Vietnam, and cited the civil
war in Turkey during the late 1940's-
The Vice President was also asked
what the reason for the enchantment
with Kennedy by the academic com
munity as contrasted with the disillu
sionment with Johnson's administra
tion was caused by.
He replied, "I have never found
out."
"If we persevere and persist, a sig
nificant change will be brought about
within a year," said Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey in a campus
speech sporadically disturbed by pro
tests.
Answering questions on Vietnam
and other current issues, the Vice
President reaffirmed Administration
policies but remarked that there have
been "disagreements" within Presi
dent Johnson's cabinet. He admitted
that he himself had '"spoken up" to
LB J.
