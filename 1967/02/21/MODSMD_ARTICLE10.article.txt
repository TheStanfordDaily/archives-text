# Pass-Fail On Trial Across U.S.

San Jose State College, Co
lumbia University in New York,
and Goueher College in Mary
land may have little else in
common, but the three schools
are the same in one respect.
They are representative of a
growing number of diverse col
leges and universities through
out the country which are ex

perimenting with a "pass-fail"
grading system.
While more and more institu
tions are offering "pass-fail" as
an option, others have initiated
discussions of grading changes
in faculty or student commit
tees.
The faculty of the college at
Columbia University voted in
December to join Princeton,
Pennsylvania, and Brown in the
Ivy League by offering students
the option of taking one pass
fail course each term. Other
large universities which have al
ready approved similar systems
include California Institute of
Technology, Stanford, and the
University of California at Ber
keley.
Even Small Campuses
Smaller colleges, ranging
from Bennington, Mount Holy
oke, and Queens College among
the Eastern schools, to Pomona
and San Jose State College in
the West, have initiated pass
fail systems.

Most colleges limit the option
to upperclassmen, who are
usually allowed to take only
one pass-fail course per term
outside the students' major field.
A few colleges do not count
courses taken on a pass-fail ba
sis toward graduation require
ments.
At Columbia, students may
take their first course in a major
field in pass-fail "to let them
get a taste" of their major, ac
cording to John W. Alexander,
associate dean for student af
fairs.
Means Less Strain
Cal Tech instituted the sys
tem for somewhat special rea
sons — to help new students
adjust to the special technical
curriculum with less competitive
strain. Grades are pass-fail in all
freshman courses — a required
set consisting of math, physics,
chemistry, English and history.
The dean of freshmen at Cal
Tech, Foster Strong, said the
program has succeeded in re

ducing dropouts and encourag
ing "self-motivation" rather
than grade-grubbing.
Of the few schools which have
offered pass-fail long enough to
gauge its effects, Princeton and
Brown have both found that it
is moderately successful in
tempting students to try new
fields.
Covers All Fields
A survey last spring at Brown
showed that courses chosen cov
ered a wide range of fields, with
no single department attracting
more than ten per cent of the
total. English was the most pop
ular field, math and science the
least popular among the stu
dents who opted for pass-fail
courses.
Other colleges have tried even
more extensive solutions. New
College in Sarasota, Fla., grades
all students in all courses with
the pass-fail system.
