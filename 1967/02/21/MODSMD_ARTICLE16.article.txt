# Faculty Group 'Puzzled' Over Admission To Humphrey Talk
## 
### Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily By BOB DAVIS 
Several Stanford faculty mem
bers expressed "deep puzzle
ment" yesterday over the failure
of a large number of people to
gain entrance to Memorial Au
ditorium to hear Vice President
Hubert Humphrey speak. The
auditorium front doors were
opened to the campus public at
10:30 a.m.
University organizers of the
Humphrey visit insisted that no
passes to the speech had been
given to numbers of either pro
or anti-Vietnam groups and that
no unauthorized persons entered
through the side doors.
Only 800
"I was certain that I would
get into the auditorium," Pro
fessor Michael Novak of the Re
ligion Department explained.
Novak estimated that there
were "no more than 800 people"
in front of him on the stairs
leading to the doors.
"I finally went around to the
side," Novak said. "I was told I
needed a pass to enter either
side door."
Professor Larry Friedlander
of the English Department re
marked that he arrived at about
10:00 p.m. "We were standing
10-15 feet from the bottom step
on the sidewalk. We had moved
only up to the bottom step by
11:30.
"I don't see how more than

500-600 people could have been
admitted," Friedlander added.
87 Passes
Donald T. Carlson, Associate
Director of University Relations,
said that a total of only 87 peo
ple were given university pass
es. These included certain facul
ty members, members of the
Vice President's party, several
foreign visitors, and seven mem
bers of the faculty committee
which sought to organize a si
lent protest.
The total also included 39
guests of the Political Union.
Press
Ted Anstedt, who organized
the student police for the speech,
insisted that no unauthorized
persons came through the side
doors. "The edges of the crowd
at the front doors probably
moved up the stairs faster than
the center part of the crowd at
the foot of the stairs," Anstedt
said.
Leaflets
Professor Lucio Ruotolo of the
English Department was distrib
uting leaflets in the lobby of the
auditorium along with the oth
er members of the faculty com
mittee which organized a silent
protest.
"It certainly did not seem as
if 1500 people entered through
the front doors," Ruotolo re
marked. He estimated that ap
proximately 1500 leaflets were
printed and that "perhaps 800

were distributed."
. Dean B. Davie Napier, wh t
was also distributing leaflets, re
marked that the "front row:
were occupied by strong sup
porters of Humphrey."

500-600 people could have been
admitted," Friedlander added.
