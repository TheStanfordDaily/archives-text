# Ketchum Directs Off-Campus Group
## 
### DICK BUNCH 
"A person who is going to
become a philosopher must be
immune to public opinion,"
reads a fragment from the phi
losopher Archilaius. This is also
the motto of a student intellec
tual community off campus, led
by Jon Ketchum, a Stanford
grad student.
Here, 13 male students live in
a rambling, two-story house,
pay the same room and board

as on campus, and foster serious
discussions on such topics as
reality, knowledge, and educa
tion.
Philosophy Seminars
Ketchum, 35, set up the living
group in 1959 after coming to
Stanford from Harvard (A.8.,
M.A.) where he studied mu
sicology. After graduation, he
decided to work for his Ph. D.
in philosophy and German psy
chology.

Seminars are conducted at
Ketchum's once a week on dif
ferent philosophers. Lately, he
has been lecturing on Hegel's
phenomenology. Last year his
seminar on Plato was given in
both English and Greek.
With regard to his goals for
the house, Ketchum says that he
wants to "study philosophy as a
discipline," and to concentrate
on its history. He asks such
questions as "Who am I?" and

"What am I going to do?", en
couraging students in other
fields to ask, "What are the gen
eral implications of my disci
pline?"
Intellectual Orientation
Ketchum realizes these goals
are often hard to achieve be
cause an "intellectual orienta
tion causes some social aliena
tion." According to Ketchum, it
took about four years before

the barriers to spontaneous in
tellecutal discussion fell.
Philosophy a la carte, or what
Ketchum calls the "dining table
method" of group discussion is
encouraged over the huge,
round dinner table. Meals are
served family style, and the
participants discuss almost any
thing.
Conducting a tour of the
house, Ketchum pointed out the
library, which contains volumes
in Greek, German, and Latin
and provides a study place for
the students.
Criticisms
When asked of his family,
Ketchum thought, grinned, and
offered, "They think I'm mad."
Despite all this, there are
criticisms of Ketchum's com
munity. Jan Jacobi, a senior his
tory major, lived there a few
years ago. He regards the resi
dents at Ketchum's as "people
bound together by a philosophi
cal and spiritual commitment"
whose purpose is to "study a
discipline with its philosophy in
mind." The problem at Ketch
um's, he says, is that living
there is horribly intense," em
phasizing "rugged intellectual
ism."
