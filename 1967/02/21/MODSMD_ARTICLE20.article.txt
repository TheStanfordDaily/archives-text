# Rollo Cites 'Quest For Myth'
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
"We live in a world of myth*
lessness. What we have in the
United States today is a myth
that we don't need a myth to
live by."
Dr. Rollo May, in his lecture
in Memorial Church last Fri
day afternoon, pointed out that
because of this mythlessness,
"We must have the courage to
live in an age in which the quest
for myth will be all important"
Pointing out that myth offers
"the means of coming to terms
with what is irrational in life,"
Dr. May listed some of the
myths which the United States
has held in the past.
Horatio Alger
"There was the Horatio Alger
myth, the myth of hard work
and ultimate recognition." When
Arthur Miller wrote the play
"Death of a Salesman" in 1949,
he "wrote the myth of the death
of the myth of Horatio Alger."
"The myth of the frontier is
one of the most powerful myths
in America. There was reas
surance in myths. . . . Loneli
ness had a meaning then. Now
it doesn't."
"Now we believe that to be
alone is to be a failure. This
loneliness is essentially that we
don't have ties to the meaning
of life."
i"The disintegration of myths
and symbols today" has had its
affect on the United States.
Identity
"The problem of identity be
sets us all, especially college
students. And a prevalent feel
ing among college students to
day is 'I went to college and
don't know who I am!"
Dr. May feels that there has
been a dual emphasis in West
ern society on ways of living.
"The first is the use of myths
as guides to the values of our
life. The second is the develop
ment of the discursive language
of math and science. Western
man since 1700 has concen
trated on the latter."
"Myths can also be destruc
tive, as Hitler's were," Dr. May
added. "Our problem in this
country was that we didn't
realize the power of myth. When
the demonic and the myth tri
umph, we have a myth that is
sooner or later self-defeating."
Ceremonies
In conjunction with the break
down in ceremonies, Dr. May
stated that he feels, "That no
matter how much talk you have
about secular marriages, peo
ple still need the ceremonies of
birth, adolescence, marriage,
and death "
In speaking of his own work
as a New York psychoanalyst,
Dr. May stated that, "Patients

come to me because they are
mythless. They want a new
myth, a myth I call the myth of
the empirical man."
"The problem in psychoanaly
sis today is that it has become a
part of the disease it is sup
posed to cure. It has played into
the myth that we don't need a
myth to live."
Therapeutic Effect
To demonstrate the "thera
peutic effect of myths," Dr. May
turned to the ancient Greek
myths, such as the myth of

Orestes. "It is the drama of a
son growing up. Growing up
means growing away, and this
means guilt, a guilt which can
be confronted, transcended, and
forgiven."
Dr. May believes that one can
follow this trend down through
history. "The tragedies of our
day reveal that our life has no
meaning."
Communication
Inherent in this tragedy is
"the impossibility of communi
cation which is part of all the

popular plays on Broadway."
Part of this communication
struggle is "the struggle with
the meaning of love."
In searching for a solution
in the problem of myth and
identity, Dr. May concluded that,
"The one thing we will not
settle with is the severing of
our human bonds."
