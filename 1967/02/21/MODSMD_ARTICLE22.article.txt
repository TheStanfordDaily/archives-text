# VISTA Provides Learning Experience
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Jackson Clark Is a
former Stanford Student who left
last year to join Volunteers in Ser
vice to Ameriea (VISTA) last spring
after completing' his freshman year.
The following is the text of a letter
he sent to his former faeulty resident
in Junipero House, Mr. Norman Fier-
Ing, explaining his views on VISTA
and his training.
First, I'll try to describe VISTA and
my training program as I see it. My
training group is composed of sixty
people, half male, half female. They
range in age from 18 to 80. Perhaps
45 are of college age—either recent
grads of, formerly enrolled in, or
ready to enter college. The remainder
are senior citizens, sixty or over.
Immediately I wondered where the
representatives of that intermediate
age group were—the group most in
volved in creating and continuing
"the American way of life." Obvious
ly, most are too busy achieving, be
coming, or securing but I rather ex
pected an individual or two, or a
married couple, that had dropped
everything and joined VISTA just for
the hell of it.
In terms of individuals' intellectual
viewpoints or philosophies, the group
is hard to classify. The elderly people,
as expected, have very unrealistic and
imaginative views, without exception.
The younger group, perhaps because
of the nature of VISTA and its re
sulting attractions, tend to the liberal
side. But less than a third appear ei
ther willing or capable to ask the big
questions and face situations realis
tically.
Training Procedure
My program, The Jane Addams
Training Center, (Chicago) has the
reputation of being one of VISTA's
finest training sessions. Over-all I
have been impressed. After spending
the first two days of training in a
hotel listening to lectures, the trainees
were split into groups of two to four
and scattered throughout the city to
permanent field assignments. Trainees
live, as much as possible, in the pov
erty areas where they work. Each
trainee works with and under the
supervision of a public or private
agency involved in serving a poverty
area. Trainees spend four days a week
for discussions and lectures. The
training assignments are varied —
community organizing, legal aid,
community centers, recreation, street
gangs, senior citizens, welfare, etc.—
and are considered the most impor
tant aspects of our training.
Expansion on Ideals
Thus far, VISTA in theory has been
acceptable if somewhat vague. I was
quite pessimistic about the politick
ing and game-playing which I antici
pated, but VISTA's approach has been
both honest and pragmatic.
Early in training one lecture at
tempted to deal with poverty and
VISTA realistically. The War on Pov
erty was defined as nothing more
than the forceful imposition of mid

dle-class values upon minorities. Now,
this sort of talk came as a surprise to
those who'd arrived with "brother
hood," "helping my unfortunate coun
trymen," "a better life for the poor"
in their minds and nothing else. Of
course, I was enthusiastic about this
turn of events. High ideals are great
—I always seem to get tangled up in
them myself—but there's got to be
more to it than that.
Unfortunately, further talk about
the basic premises of the War on
Poverty have not developed. The sub
ject is open, but no one wants to ad
dress it. Thought seems to have been
transferred to the best ways of im
plementing the War on Poverty,
rather than discussing the whole sys
tem. Obviously, it's difficult for an
organization to both question itself
and operate effectively at the same
time. In retrospect, I suppose I should
be surprised VISTA is as loose and
free-wheeling as it is.
No Solution To Poverty
VISTA has done an excellent job
of demonstrating that, though the
problem of poverty becomes increas
ingly well-defined, no one has yet
found a really effective way of elimi
nating the problem. Everyone has a
different theory, a different approach.
My own thoughts are mixed.
On the one hand, I see the impor
tance and the necessity of VISTA's
personal, normally one-to-one work.
Peoples' needs must be heeded. But
on the other hand, I recognize that
it is the American system as it now
exists, with all its institutions and
values, which creates and continues
poverty. Only large-scale action, on
political, social, and economic levels,
can ever begin to diminish poverty.
Presently, VISTA's real value lies
in its effect on VISTA workers them
selves. The experience is an incredible
awakening and a shattering of values
for most. What could be better? If
every middle class youth in the coun
try spent a year in VISTA the prob
lem would be solved. Obviously, I feel
VISTA is a tremendous experience—
not necessarily in terms of the work
one does, but rather as a learning and
living situation for the VISTA volun
teer.
In VISTA I've talked to politicians,
lawyers, doctors, ministers, move
ment leaders, gang members, commu
nity organizers, and every variety of
person that exists in a slum. I've
never felt so involved or attached to
a city. I know who runs this city and
how. I know the story behind the
newspaper article, the story that
never gets printed, and the event be
fore it happens. I hear what the
mayor's going to say, what he means,
what the truth is, and why he's say
ing it. I hear about the gangfight be
fore it happens. I know about the
murder and riot on the West Side
that doesn't make the papers. It's
strange, but I'm getting a real feeling
for this city. And it's a dirty, ugly,
decayed, corrupted city.

I should have realized before the
dream-world city people always see
because they never venture off the
well-lit downtown streets. It's fright
ening, but it's there. And the fact that
few people know or want to admit
it's there, makes it even more fright
ening.
So, I appreciate the incredible
things I've learned in VISTA, and I
appreciate VISTA as being a rare
chance to learn. VISTA opens doors
and provides opportunities that just
wouldn't be accessible otherwise.
As for my actual field work, I am
pacified but not ecstatic. I began my
work in a community center. My part
ner and I were to help this agency
serve 20,000 Negroes packed into sur
rounding public housing, high-rise
prisons. Of the 5,000 families, over
80 per cent have no fathers. Some 60
per cent of the mothers are on wel
fare. Many families are third-genera
tion residents of the same apartment,
having lived in the high-rises since
they were built twenty years ago.
The buildings are stark and ugly,
about eight in number, each twenty
stories high. There is no grass or
lawns, asphalt covers everything.
And, as everywhere in Chicago, a
layer of shattered glass covers the
asphalt.
The people have no feeling of com
munity, no hope of ever leaving the
present situation. Girls become preg
nant early and often, condemned to a
life of bare subsistence living. Boys,
growing up in fatherless homes, are
emasculated, shiftless, inferior to
women. They marry only to find them
selves unable to face their families
when they cannot find jobs to support
them. They leave, at least allowing

the mother to go on welfare. Kids
growing up join gangs for security
and identity. Gangs' roam the neigh
borhood and the buildings, making
it a hellish place for residents and in
truders alike.
Involvement
VISTA stresses involvement with
the community and personal contact,
but our agency allowed us to do very
little. We were doing nothing but sit
ting around the center all day, mak
ing an occasional contact with a kid
in the center, a hid who needs the
least help. Then, in a week's time, my
partner and I were jumped and beat
en twice, once in front of the agency
in broad daylight This upset the cen
ter, and VISTA was already upset at
our work, so after three weeks on the
job (half our training period) we
were transferred.
My new assig nment has proven
much better. I am again working with
a community sendees agency, but in
a much different: setting. Formerly,
the center had buen quite large and
one of, literally, a hundred various
public and private agencies going
blindly and ineffectively and unce
operatively about their jobs. My new
center is quite small and is relatively
alone in a fairly large pocket of ab
ject poverty. This agency has been
primarily a day school for retarded
children, and I have done some work
with retarded kids.
But the new director of the agency,
and the four VILSTA trainees there,
are all interested in community or
ganizing. Therefore, for the past two
weeks I've been involved in working
with people in the community. We
have been concentrating on one
apartment build .ng, trying to orga

nize a tenants council which can force
repairs and improvement from the
landlord. Progress is slow of course,
but the response from people is much
better than expected. Naturally, now
that things have just begun to move,
the training sesion is almost over.
Rambling*
More ramblings—l live in a large
basement room of a large old home
on Chicago's Northwest side. I share
the room with three other VISTAs
and an old pool table. My roommates
are great fellows, especially my part
ner, Tom, from New Jersey. One of
the other roommates, Mark, from
Boston, will go with me on our per
manent assignment (more on this).
They are all college grads, and I
learn a great deal from them — they
think I'm "okay" for an 18-year old.
VISTA has a now policy of assign
ing volunteers to the same geogra
phical area in which they train. Thus,
we were told to expect Midwestern
placements. Everyone either wanted
to go West or East, so this point was
not a favorite. When the final assign
ments were made last Sunday, 17 of
the 19 cities assigned were in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. One was
in the middle of Pennsylvania and
the last was Wilmington, Delaware.
Naturally, I ended up in Delaware. I
was happy beyond belief. The loca
tion of my assignment is good, my
four fellow-workers are all top-notch,
and our work sounds exciting—grass
roots community organizing. Commu
nity organization seems, at the mo
ment, to be VISTA's most valuable
work. The job appears to be exactly
what I wanted. I fly to Del. on Dec. 6
to begin the full year of service.

not a favorite. When the final assign
ments were made last Sunday, 17 of
the 19 cities assigned were in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. One was
in the middle of Pennsylvania and
the last was Wilmington, Delaware.
Naturally, I ended up in Delaware. I
was happy beyond belief. The loca
tion of my assignment is good, my
four fellow-workers are all top-notch,
and our work sounds exciting—grass

work. The job appears to be exactly
what I wanted. I fly to Del. on Dec. 6
to begin the full year of service.

Editor's Note: Jackson Clark Is a
former Stanford Student who left
last year to join Volunteers in Ser
vice to Ameriea (VISTA) last spring
after completing' his freshman year.
The following is the text of a letter
he sent to his former faeulty resident
in Junipero House, Mr. Norman Fier-
Ing, explaining his views on VISTA
and his training.
First, I'll try to describe VISTA and
my training program as I see it. My
training group is composed of sixty
people, half male, half female. They
range in age from 18 to 80. Perhaps
45 are of college age—either recent
grads of, formerly enrolled in, or
ready to enter college. The remainder
are senior citizens, sixty or over.
Immediately I wondered where the
representatives of that intermediate
age group were—the group most in
volved in creating and continuing
"the American way of life." Obvious
ly, most are too busy achieving, be
coming, or securing but I rather ex
pected an individual or two, or a
married couple, that had dropped
everything and joined VISTA just for
the hell of it.
In terms of individuals' intellectual
viewpoints or philosophies, the group
is hard to classify. The elderly people,
as expected, have very unrealistic and
imaginative views, without exception.
The younger group, perhaps because
of the nature of VISTA and its re
sulting attractions, tend to the liberal
side. But less than a third appear ei
ther willing or capable to ask the big
questions and face situations realis
tically.
Training Procedure
My program, The Jane Addams
Training Center, (Chicago) has the
reputation of being one of VISTA's
finest training sessions. Over-all I
have been impressed. After spending
the first two days of training in a
hotel listening to lectures, the trainees
were split into groups of two to four
and scattered throughout the city to
permanent field assignments. Trainees
live, as much as possible, in the pov
erty areas where they work. Each
trainee works with and under the
supervision of a public or private
agency involved in serving a poverty
area. Trainees spend four days a week
for discussions and lectures. The
training assignments are varied —
community organizing, legal aid,
community centers, recreation, street
gangs, senior citizens, welfare, etc.—
and are considered the most impor
tant aspects of our training.
Expansion on Ideals
Thus far, VISTA in theory has been
acceptable if somewhat vague. I was
quite pessimistic about the politick
ing and game-playing which I antici
pated, but VISTA's approach has been
both honest and pragmatic.
Early in training one lecture at
tempted to deal with poverty and
VISTA realistically. The War on Pov
erty was defined as nothing more
than the forceful imposition of mid

dle-class values upon minorities. Now,
this sort of talk came as a surprise to
those who'd arrived with "brother
hood," "helping my unfortunate coun
trymen," "a better life for the poor"
in their minds and nothing else. Of
course, I was enthusiastic about this
turn of events. High ideals are great
—I always seem to get tangled up in
them myself—but there's got to be
more to it than that.
Unfortunately, further talk about
the basic premises of the War on
Poverty have not developed. The sub
ject is open, but no one wants to ad
dress it. Thought seems to have been
transferred to the best ways of im
plementing the War on Poverty,
rather than discussing the whole sys
tem. Obviously, it's difficult for an
organization to both question itself
and operate effectively at the same
time. In retrospect, I suppose I should
be surprised VISTA is as loose and
free-wheeling as it is.
No Solution To Poverty
VISTA has done an excellent job
of demonstrating that, though the
problem of poverty becomes increas
ingly well-defined, no one has yet
found a really effective way of elimi
nating the problem. Everyone has a
different theory, a different approach.
My own thoughts are mixed.
On the one hand, I see the impor
tance and the necessity of VISTA's
personal, normally one-to-one work.
Peoples' needs must be heeded. But
on the other hand, I recognize that
it is the American system as it now
exists, with all its institutions and
values, which creates and continues
poverty. Only large-scale action, on
political, social, and economic levels,
can ever begin to diminish poverty.
Presently, VISTA's real value lies
in its effect on VISTA workers them
selves. The experience is an incredible
awakening and a shattering of values
for most. What could be better? If
every middle class youth in the coun
try spent a year in VISTA the prob
lem would be solved. Obviously, I feel
VISTA is a tremendous experience—
not necessarily in terms of the work
one does, but rather as a learning and
living situation for the VISTA volun
teer.
In VISTA I've talked to politicians,
lawyers, doctors, ministers, move
ment leaders, gang members, commu
nity organizers, and every variety of
person that exists in a slum. I've
never felt so involved or attached to
a city. I know who runs this city and
how. I know the story behind the
newspaper article, the story that
never gets printed, and the event be
fore it happens. I hear what the
mayor's going to say, what he means,
what the truth is, and why he's say
ing it. I hear about the gangfight be
fore it happens. I know about the
murder and riot on the West Side
that doesn't make the papers. It's
strange, but I'm getting a real feeling
for this city. And it's a dirty, ugly,
decayed, corrupted city.

I should have realized before the
dream-world city people always see
because they never venture off the
well-lit downtown streets. It's fright
ening, but it's there. And the fact that
few people know or want to admit
it's there, makes it even more fright
ening.
So, I appreciate the incredible
things I've learned in VISTA, and I
appreciate VISTA as being a rare
chance to learn. VISTA opens doors
and provides opportunities that just
wouldn't be accessible otherwise.
As for my actual field work, I am
pacified but not ecstatic. I began my
work in a community center. My part
ner and I were to help this agency
serve 20,000 Negroes packed into sur
rounding public housing, high-rise
prisons. Of the 5,000 families, over
80 per cent have no fathers. Some 60
per cent of the mothers are on wel
fare. Many families are third-genera
tion residents of the same apartment,
having lived in the high-rises since
they were built twenty years ago.
The buildings are stark and ugly,
about eight in number, each twenty
stories high. There is no grass or
lawns, asphalt covers everything.
And, as everywhere in Chicago, a
layer of shattered glass covers the
asphalt.
The people have no feeling of com
munity, no hope of ever leaving the
present situation. Girls become preg
nant early and often, condemned to a
life of bare subsistence living. Boys,
growing up in fatherless homes, are
emasculated, shiftless, inferior to
women. They marry only to find them
selves unable to face their families
when they cannot find jobs to support
them. They leave, at least allowing

the mother to go on welfare. Kids
growing up join gangs for security
and identity. Gangs' roam the neigh
borhood and the buildings, making
it a hellish place for residents and in
truders alike.
Involvement
VISTA stresses involvement with
the community and personal contact,
but our agency allowed us to do very
little. We were doing nothing but sit
ting around the center all day, mak
ing an occasional contact with a kid
in the center, a hid who needs the
least help. Then, in a week's time, my
partner and I were jumped and beat
en twice, once in front of the agency
in broad daylight This upset the cen
ter, and VISTA was already upset at
our work, so after three weeks on the
job (half our training period) we
were transferred.
My new assig nment has proven
much better. I am again working with
a community sendees agency, but in
a much different: setting. Formerly,
the center had buen quite large and
one of, literally, a hundred various
public and private agencies going
blindly and ineffectively and unce
operatively about their jobs. My new
center is quite small and is relatively
alone in a fairly large pocket of ab
ject poverty. This agency has been
primarily a day school for retarded
children, and I have done some work
with retarded kids.
But the new director of the agency,
and the four VILSTA trainees there,
are all interested in community or
ganizing. Therefore, for the past two
weeks I've been involved in working
with people in the community. We
have been concentrating on one
apartment build .ng, trying to orga

nize a tenants council which can force
repairs and improvement from the
landlord. Progress is slow of course,
but the response from people is much
better than expected. Naturally, now
that things have just begun to move,
the training sesion is almost over.
Rambling*
More ramblings—l live in a large
basement room of a large old home
on Chicago's Northwest side. I share
the room with three other VISTAs
and an old pool table. My roommates
are great fellows, especially my part
ner, Tom, from New Jersey. One of
the other roommates, Mark, from
Boston, will go with me on our per
manent assignment (more on this).
They are all college grads, and I
learn a great deal from them — they
think I'm "okay" for an 18-year old.
VISTA has a now policy of assign
ing volunteers to the same geogra
phical area in which they train. Thus,
we were told to expect Midwestern
placements. Everyone either wanted
to go West or East, so this point was
not a favorite. When the final assign
ments were made last Sunday, 17 of
the 19 cities assigned were in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. One was
in the middle of Pennsylvania and
the last was Wilmington, Delaware.
Naturally, I ended up in Delaware. I

basement room of a large old home
on Chicago's Northwest side. I share
the room with three other VISTAs
and an old pool table. My roommates
are great fellows, especially my part
ner, Tom, from New Jersey. One of
the other roommates, Mark, from
Boston, will go with me on our per
manent assignment (more on this).
They are all college grads, and I
learn a great deal from them — they
think I'm "okay" for an 18-year old.
VISTA has a now policy of assign
ing volunteers to the same geogra
phical area in which they train. Thus,
we were told to expect Midwestern
placements. Everyone either wanted
to go West or East, so this point was
not a favorite. When the final assign
ments were made last Sunday, 17 of
the 19 cities assigned were in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. One was
in the middle of Pennsylvania and
the last was Wilmington, Delaware.
Naturally, I ended up in Delaware. I
was happy beyond belief. The loca
tion of my assignment is good, my
four fellow-workers are all top-notch,
and our work sounds exciting—grass
roots community organizing. Commu
nity organization seems, at the mo
ment, to be VISTA's most valuable
work. The job appears to be exactly
what I wanted. I fly to Del. on Dec. 6
to begin the full year of service.

Editor's Note: Jackson Clark Is a
former Stanford Student who left
last year to join Volunteers in Ser
vice to Ameriea (VISTA) last spring
after completing' his freshman year.
The following is the text of a letter
he sent to his former faeulty resident
in Junipero House, Mr. Norman Fier-
Ing, explaining his views on VISTA
and his training.
First, I'll try to describe VISTA and
my training program as I see it. My
training group is composed of sixty
people, half male, half female. They
range in age from 18 to 80. Perhaps
45 are of college age—either recent
grads of, formerly enrolled in, or
ready to enter college. The remainder
are senior citizens, sixty or over.
Immediately I wondered where the
representatives of that intermediate
age group were—the group most in
volved in creating and continuing
"the American way of life." Obvious
ly, most are too busy achieving, be
coming, or securing but I rather ex
pected an individual or two, or a
married couple, that had dropped
everything and joined VISTA just for
the hell of it.
In terms of individuals' intellectual
viewpoints or philosophies, the group
is hard to classify. The elderly people,
as expected, have very unrealistic and
imaginative views, without exception.
The younger group, perhaps because
of the nature of VISTA and its re
sulting attractions, tend to the liberal
side. But less than a third appear ei
ther willing or capable to ask the big
questions and face situations realis
tically.
Training Procedure
My program, The Jane Addams
Training Center, (Chicago) has the
reputation of being one of VISTA's
finest training sessions. Over-all I
have been impressed. After spending
the first two days of training in a
hotel listening to lectures, the trainees
were split into groups of two to four
and scattered throughout the city to
permanent field assignments. Trainees
live, as much as possible, in the pov
erty areas where they work. Each
trainee works with and under the
supervision of a public or private
agency involved in serving a poverty
area. Trainees spend four days a week
for discussions and lectures. The
training assignments are varied —
community organizing, legal aid,
community centers, recreation, street
gangs, senior citizens, welfare, etc.—
and are considered the most impor
tant aspects of our training.
Expansion on Ideals
Thus far, VISTA in theory has been
acceptable if somewhat vague. I was
quite pessimistic about the politick
ing and game-playing which I antici
pated, but VISTA's approach has been
both honest and pragmatic.
Early in training one lecture at
tempted to deal with poverty and
VISTA realistically. The War on Pov
erty was defined as nothing more
than the forceful imposition of mid

dle-class values upon minorities. Now,
this sort of talk came as a surprise to
those who'd arrived with "brother
hood," "helping my unfortunate coun
trymen," "a better life for the poor"
in their minds and nothing else. Of
course, I was enthusiastic about this
turn of events. High ideals are great
—I always seem to get tangled up in
them myself—but there's got to be
more to it than that.
Unfortunately, further talk about
the basic premises of the War on
Poverty have not developed. The sub
ject is open, but no one wants to ad
dress it. Thought seems to have been
transferred to the best ways of im
plementing the War on Poverty,
rather than discussing the whole sys
tem. Obviously, it's difficult for an
organization to both question itself
and operate effectively at the same
time. In retrospect, I suppose I should
be surprised VISTA is as loose and
free-wheeling as it is.
No Solution To Poverty
VISTA has done an excellent job
of demonstrating that, though the
problem of poverty becomes increas
ingly well-defined, no one has yet
found a really effective way of elimi
nating the problem. Everyone has a
different theory, a different approach.
My own thoughts are mixed.
On the one hand, I see the impor
tance and the necessity of VISTA's
personal, normally one-to-one work.
Peoples' needs must be heeded. But
on the other hand, I recognize that
it is the American system as it now
exists, with all its institutions and
values, which creates and continues
poverty. Only large-scale action, on
political, social, and economic levels,
can ever begin to diminish poverty.
Presently, VISTA's real value lies
in its effect on VISTA workers them
selves. The experience is an incredible
awakening and a shattering of values
for most. What could be better? If
every middle class youth in the coun
try spent a year in VISTA the prob
lem would be solved. Obviously, I feel
VISTA is a tremendous experience—
not necessarily in terms of the work
one does, but rather as a learning and
living situation for the VISTA volun
teer.
In VISTA I've talked to politicians,
lawyers, doctors, ministers, move
ment leaders, gang members, commu
nity organizers, and every variety of
person that exists in a slum. I've
never felt so involved or attached to
a city. I know who runs this city and
how. I know the story behind the
newspaper article, the story that
never gets printed, and the event be
fore it happens. I hear what the
mayor's going to say, what he means,
what the truth is, and why he's say
ing it. I hear about the gangfight be
fore it happens. I know about the
murder and riot on the West Side
that doesn't make the papers. It's
strange, but I'm getting a real feeling
for this city. And it's a dirty, ugly,
decayed, corrupted city.

I should have realized before the
dream-world city people always see
because they never venture off the
well-lit downtown streets. It's fright
ening, but it's there. And the fact that
few people know or want to admit
it's there, makes it even more fright
ening.
So, I appreciate the incredible
things I've learned in VISTA, and I
appreciate VISTA as being a rare
chance to learn. VISTA opens doors
and provides opportunities that just
wouldn't be accessible otherwise.
As for my actual field work, I am
pacified but not ecstatic. I began my
work in a community center. My part
ner and I were to help this agency
serve 20,000 Negroes packed into sur
rounding public housing, high-rise
prisons. Of the 5,000 families, over
80 per cent have no fathers. Some 60
per cent of the mothers are on wel
fare. Many families are third-genera
tion residents of the same apartment,
having lived in the high-rises since
they were built twenty years ago.
The buildings are stark and ugly,
about eight in number, each twenty
stories high. There is no grass or
lawns, asphalt covers everything.
And, as everywhere in Chicago, a
layer of shattered glass covers the
asphalt.
The people have no feeling of com
munity, no hope of ever leaving the
present situation. Girls become preg
nant early and often, condemned to a
life of bare subsistence living. Boys,
growing up in fatherless homes, are
emasculated, shiftless, inferior to
women. They marry only to find them
selves unable to face their families
when they cannot find jobs to support
them. They leave, at least allowing

the mother to go on welfare. Kids
growing up join gangs for security
and identity. Gangs' roam the neigh
borhood and the buildings, making
it a hellish place for residents and in
truders alike.
Involvement
VISTA stresses involvement with
the community and personal contact,
but our agency allowed us to do very
little. We were doing nothing but sit
ting around the center all day, mak
ing an occasional contact with a kid
in the center, a hid who needs the
least help. Then, in a week's time, my
partner and I were jumped and beat
en twice, once in front of the agency
in broad daylight This upset the cen
ter, and VISTA was already upset at
our work, so after three weeks on the
job (half our training period) we
were transferred.
My new assig nment has proven
much better. I am again working with
a community sendees agency, but in
a much different: setting. Formerly,
the center had buen quite large and
one of, literally, a hundred various
public and private agencies going
blindly and ineffectively and unce
operatively about their jobs. My new
center is quite small and is relatively
alone in a fairly large pocket of ab
ject poverty. This agency has been
primarily a day school for retarded
children, and I have done some work
with retarded kids.
But the new director of the agency,
and the four VILSTA trainees there,
are all interested in community or
ganizing. Therefore, for the past two
weeks I've been involved in working
with people in the community. We
have been concentrating on one
apartment build .ng, trying to orga

nize a tenants council which can force
repairs and improvement from the
landlord. Progress is slow of course,
but the response from people is much
better than expected. Naturally, now
that things have just begun to move,
the training sesion is almost over.

primarily a day school for retarded
children, and I have done some work
with retarded kids.
But the new director of the agency,
and the four VILSTA trainees there,
are all interested in community or
ganizing. Therefore, for the past two
weeks I've been involved in working
with people in the community. We
have been concentrating on one
apartment build .ng, trying to orga

nize a tenants council which can force
repairs and improvement from the
landlord. Progress is slow of course,
but the response from people is much
better than expected. Naturally, now
that things have just begun to move,
the training sesion is almost over.
Rambling*
More ramblings—l live in a large
basement room of a large old home
on Chicago's Northwest side. I share
the room with three other VISTAs
and an old pool table. My roommates
are great fellows, especially my part
ner, Tom, from New Jersey. One of
the other roommates, Mark, from
Boston, will go with me on our per
manent assignment (more on this).
They are all college grads, and I
learn a great deal from them — they
think I'm "okay" for an 18-year old.
VISTA has a now policy of assign
ing volunteers to the same geogra
phical area in which they train. Thus,
we were told to expect Midwestern
placements. Everyone either wanted
to go West or East, so this point was
not a favorite. When the final assign
ments were made last Sunday, 17 of
the 19 cities assigned were in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. One was
in the middle of Pennsylvania and
the last was Wilmington, Delaware.
Naturally, I ended up in Delaware. I
was happy beyond belief. The loca
tion of my assignment is good, my
four fellow-workers are all top-notch,
and our work sounds exciting—grass
roots community organizing. Commu
nity organization seems, at the mo
ment, to be VISTA's most valuable
work. The job appears to be exactly
what I wanted. I fly to Del. on Dec. 6
to begin the full year of service.

Editor's Note: Jackson Clark Is a
former Stanford Student who left
last year to join Volunteers in Ser
vice to Ameriea (VISTA) last spring
after completing' his freshman year.
The following is the text of a letter
he sent to his former faeulty resident
in Junipero House, Mr. Norman Fier-
Ing, explaining his views on VISTA
and his training.
First, I'll try to describe VISTA and
my training program as I see it. My
training group is composed of sixty
people, half male, half female. They
range in age from 18 to 80. Perhaps
45 are of college age—either recent
grads of, formerly enrolled in, or
ready to enter college. The remainder
are senior citizens, sixty or over.
Immediately I wondered where the
representatives of that intermediate
age group were—the group most in
volved in creating and continuing
"the American way of life." Obvious
ly, most are too busy achieving, be
coming, or securing but I rather ex
pected an individual or two, or a
married couple, that had dropped
everything and joined VISTA just for
the hell of it.
In terms of individuals' intellectual
viewpoints or philosophies, the group
is hard to classify. The elderly people,
as expected, have very unrealistic and
imaginative views, without exception.
The younger group, perhaps because
of the nature of VISTA and its re
sulting attractions, tend to the liberal
side. But less than a third appear ei
ther willing or capable to ask the big
questions and face situations realis
tically.
Training Procedure
My program, The Jane Addams
Training Center, (Chicago) has the
reputation of being one of VISTA's
finest training sessions. Over-all I
have been impressed. After spending
the first two days of training in a
hotel listening to lectures, the trainees
were split into groups of two to four
and scattered throughout the city to
permanent field assignments. Trainees
live, as much as possible, in the pov
erty areas where they work. Each
trainee works with and under the
supervision of a public or private
agency involved in serving a poverty
area. Trainees spend four days a week
for discussions and lectures. The
training assignments are varied —
community organizing, legal aid,
community centers, recreation, street
gangs, senior citizens, welfare, etc.—
and are considered the most impor
tant aspects of our training.
Expansion on Ideals
Thus far, VISTA in theory has been
acceptable if somewhat vague. I was
quite pessimistic about the politick
ing and game-playing which I antici
pated, but VISTA's approach has been
both honest and pragmatic.
Early in training one lecture at
tempted to deal with poverty and
VISTA realistically. The War on Pov
erty was defined as nothing more
than the forceful imposition of mid

dle-class values upon minorities. Now,
this sort of talk came as a surprise to
those who'd arrived with "brother
hood," "helping my unfortunate coun
trymen," "a better life for the poor"
in their minds and nothing else. Of
course, I was enthusiastic about this
turn of events. High ideals are great
—I always seem to get tangled up in
them myself—but there's got to be
more to it than that.
Unfortunately, further talk about
the basic premises of the War on
Poverty have not developed. The sub
ject is open, but no one wants to ad
dress it. Thought seems to have been
transferred to the best ways of im
plementing the War on Poverty,
rather than discussing the whole sys
tem. Obviously, it's difficult for an
organization to both question itself
and operate effectively at the same
time. In retrospect, I suppose I should
be surprised VISTA is as loose and
free-wheeling as it is.
No Solution To Poverty
VISTA has done an excellent job
of demonstrating that, though the
problem of poverty becomes increas
ingly well-defined, no one has yet
found a really effective way of elimi
nating the problem. Everyone has a
different theory, a different approach.
My own thoughts are mixed.
On the one hand, I see the impor
tance and the necessity of VISTA's
personal, normally one-to-one work.
Peoples' needs must be heeded. But
on the other hand, I recognize that
it is the American system as it now
exists, with all its institutions and
values, which creates and continues
poverty. Only large-scale action, on
political, social, and economic levels,
can ever begin to diminish poverty.
Presently, VISTA's real value lies
in its effect on VISTA workers them
selves. The experience is an incredible
awakening and a shattering of values
for most. What could be better? If
every middle class youth in the coun
try spent a year in VISTA the prob
lem would be solved. Obviously, I feel
VISTA is a tremendous experience—
not necessarily in terms of the work
one does, but rather as a learning and
living situation for the VISTA volun
teer.
In VISTA I've talked to politicians,
lawyers, doctors, ministers, move
ment leaders, gang members, commu
nity organizers, and every variety of
person that exists in a slum. I've
never felt so involved or attached to
a city. I know who runs this city and
how. I know the story behind the
newspaper article, the story that
never gets printed, and the event be
fore it happens. I hear what the
mayor's going to say, what he means,
what the truth is, and why he's say
ing it. I hear about the gangfight be
fore it happens. I know about the
murder and riot on the West Side
that doesn't make the papers. It's
strange, but I'm getting a real feeling
for this city. And it's a dirty, ugly,
decayed, corrupted city.

I should have realized before the
dream-world city people always see
because they never venture off the
well-lit downtown streets. It's fright
ening, but it's there. And the fact that
few people know or want to admit
it's there, makes it even more fright
ening.
So, I appreciate the incredible
things I've learned in VISTA, and I
appreciate VISTA as being a rare
chance to learn. VISTA opens doors
and provides opportunities that just
wouldn't be accessible otherwise.
As for my actual field work, I am
pacified but not ecstatic. I began my
work in a community center. My part
ner and I were to help this agency
serve 20,000 Negroes packed into sur
rounding public housing, high-rise
prisons. Of the 5,000 families, over
80 per cent have no fathers. Some 60
per cent of the mothers are on wel
fare. Many families are third-genera
tion residents of the same apartment,
having lived in the high-rises since
they were built twenty years ago.
The buildings are stark and ugly,
about eight in number, each twenty
stories high. There is no grass or
lawns, asphalt covers everything.
And, as everywhere in Chicago, a
layer of shattered glass covers the
asphalt.
The people have no feeling of com
munity, no hope of ever leaving the
present situation. Girls become preg
nant early and often, condemned to a
life of bare subsistence living. Boys,
growing up in fatherless homes, are
emasculated, shiftless, inferior to
women. They marry only to find them
selves unable to face their families
when they cannot find jobs to support
them. They leave, at least allowing

the mother to go on welfare. Kids
growing up join gangs for security
and identity. Gangs' roam the neigh
borhood and the buildings, making
it a hellish place for residents and in
truders alike.
Involvement
VISTA stresses involvement with
the community and personal contact,
but our agency allowed us to do very
little. We were doing nothing but sit
ting around the center all day, mak
ing an occasional contact with a kid
in the center, a hid who needs the
least help. Then, in a week's time, my
partner and I were jumped and beat
en twice, once in front of the agency
in broad daylight This upset the cen
ter, and VISTA was already upset at
our work, so after three weeks on the
job (half our training period) we
were transferred.
My new assig nment has proven
much better. I am again working with
a community sendees agency, but in
a much different: setting. Formerly,
the center had buen quite large and
one of, literally, a hundred various
public and private agencies going
blindly and ineffectively and unce
operatively about their jobs. My new
center is quite small and is relatively
alone in a fairly large pocket of ab
ject poverty. This agency has been
primarily a day school for retarded
children, and I have done some work
with retarded kids.
But the new director of the agency,
and the four VILSTA trainees there,

least help. Then, in a week's time, my
partner and I were jumped and beat
en twice, once in front of the agency
in broad daylight This upset the cen
ter, and VISTA was already upset at
our work, so after three weeks on the
job (half our training period) we
were transferred.
My new assig nment has proven
much better. I am again working with
a community sendees agency, but in
a much different: setting. Formerly,
the center had buen quite large and
one of, literally, a hundred various
public and private agencies going
blindly and ineffectively and unce
operatively about their jobs. My new
center is quite small and is relatively
alone in a fairly large pocket of ab
ject poverty. This agency has been
primarily a day school for retarded
children, and I have done some work
with retarded kids.
But the new director of the agency,
and the four VILSTA trainees there,
are all interested in community or
ganizing. Therefore, for the past two
weeks I've been involved in working
with people in the community. We
have been concentrating on one
apartment build .ng, trying to orga

nize a tenants council which can force
repairs and improvement from the
landlord. Progress is slow of course,
but the response from people is much
better than expected. Naturally, now
that things have just begun to move,
the training sesion is almost over.
Rambling*
More ramblings—l live in a large
basement room of a large old home
on Chicago's Northwest side. I share
the room with three other VISTAs
and an old pool table. My roommates
are great fellows, especially my part
ner, Tom, from New Jersey. One of
the other roommates, Mark, from
Boston, will go with me on our per
manent assignment (more on this).
They are all college grads, and I
learn a great deal from them — they
think I'm "okay" for an 18-year old.
VISTA has a now policy of assign
ing volunteers to the same geogra
phical area in which they train. Thus,
we were told to expect Midwestern
placements. Everyone either wanted
to go West or East, so this point was
not a favorite. When the final assign
ments were made last Sunday, 17 of
the 19 cities assigned were in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. One was
in the middle of Pennsylvania and
the last was Wilmington, Delaware.
Naturally, I ended up in Delaware. I
was happy beyond belief. The loca
tion of my assignment is good, my
four fellow-workers are all top-notch,
and our work sounds exciting—grass
roots community organizing. Commu
nity organization seems, at the mo
ment, to be VISTA's most valuable
work. The job appears to be exactly
what I wanted. I fly to Del. on Dec. 6
to begin the full year of service.

Editor's Note: Jackson Clark Is a
former Stanford Student who left
last year to join Volunteers in Ser
vice to Ameriea (VISTA) last spring
after completing' his freshman year.
The following is the text of a letter
he sent to his former faeulty resident
in Junipero House, Mr. Norman Fier-
Ing, explaining his views on VISTA
and his training.
First, I'll try to describe VISTA and
my training program as I see it. My
training group is composed of sixty
people, half male, half female. They
range in age from 18 to 80. Perhaps
45 are of college age—either recent
grads of, formerly enrolled in, or
ready to enter college. The remainder
are senior citizens, sixty or over.
Immediately I wondered where the
representatives of that intermediate
age group were—the group most in
volved in creating and continuing
"the American way of life." Obvious
ly, most are too busy achieving, be
coming, or securing but I rather ex
pected an individual or two, or a
married couple, that had dropped
everything and joined VISTA just for
the hell of it.
In terms of individuals' intellectual
viewpoints or philosophies, the group
is hard to classify. The elderly people,
as expected, have very unrealistic and
imaginative views, without exception.
The younger group, perhaps because
of the nature of VISTA and its re
sulting attractions, tend to the liberal
side. But less than a third appear ei
ther willing or capable to ask the big
questions and face situations realis
tically.
Training Procedure
My program, The Jane Addams
Training Center, (Chicago) has the
reputation of being one of VISTA's
finest training sessions. Over-all I
have been impressed. After spending
the first two days of training in a
hotel listening to lectures, the trainees
were split into groups of two to four
and scattered throughout the city to
permanent field assignments. Trainees
live, as much as possible, in the pov
erty areas where they work. Each
trainee works with and under the
supervision of a public or private
agency involved in serving a poverty
area. Trainees spend four days a week
for discussions and lectures. The
training assignments are varied —
community organizing, legal aid,
community centers, recreation, street
gangs, senior citizens, welfare, etc.—
and are considered the most impor
tant aspects of our training.
Expansion on Ideals
Thus far, VISTA in theory has been
acceptable if somewhat vague. I was
quite pessimistic about the politick
ing and game-playing which I antici
pated, but VISTA's approach has been
both honest and pragmatic.
Early in training one lecture at
tempted to deal with poverty and
VISTA realistically. The War on Pov
erty was defined as nothing more
than the forceful imposition of mid

dle-class values upon minorities. Now,
this sort of talk came as a surprise to
those who'd arrived with "brother
hood," "helping my unfortunate coun
trymen," "a better life for the poor"
in their minds and nothing else. Of
course, I was enthusiastic about this
turn of events. High ideals are great
—I always seem to get tangled up in
them myself—but there's got to be
more to it than that.
Unfortunately, further talk about
the basic premises of the War on
Poverty have not developed. The sub
ject is open, but no one wants to ad
dress it. Thought seems to have been
transferred to the best ways of im
plementing the War on Poverty,
rather than discussing the whole sys
tem. Obviously, it's difficult for an
organization to both question itself
and operate effectively at the same
time. In retrospect, I suppose I should
be surprised VISTA is as loose and
free-wheeling as it is.
No Solution To Poverty
VISTA has done an excellent job
of demonstrating that, though the
problem of poverty becomes increas
ingly well-defined, no one has yet
found a really effective way of elimi
nating the problem. Everyone has a
different theory, a different approach.
My own thoughts are mixed.
On the one hand, I see the impor
tance and the necessity of VISTA's
personal, normally one-to-one work.
Peoples' needs must be heeded. But
on the other hand, I recognize that
it is the American system as it now
exists, with all its institutions and
values, which creates and continues
poverty. Only large-scale action, on
political, social, and economic levels,
can ever begin to diminish poverty.
Presently, VISTA's real value lies
in its effect on VISTA workers them
selves. The experience is an incredible
awakening and a shattering of values
for most. What could be better? If
every middle class youth in the coun
try spent a year in VISTA the prob
lem would be solved. Obviously, I feel
VISTA is a tremendous experience—
not necessarily in terms of the work
one does, but rather as a learning and
living situation for the VISTA volun
teer.
In VISTA I've talked to politicians,
lawyers, doctors, ministers, move
ment leaders, gang members, commu
nity organizers, and every variety of
person that exists in a slum. I've
never felt so involved or attached to
a city. I know who runs this city and
how. I know the story behind the
newspaper article, the story that
never gets printed, and the event be
fore it happens. I hear what the
mayor's going to say, what he means,
what the truth is, and why he's say
ing it. I hear about the gangfight be
fore it happens. I know about the
murder and riot on the West Side
that doesn't make the papers. It's
strange, but I'm getting a real feeling
for this city. And it's a dirty, ugly,
decayed, corrupted city.

I should have realized before the
dream-world city people always see
because they never venture off the
well-lit downtown streets. It's fright
ening, but it's there. And the fact that
few people know or want to admit
it's there, makes it even more fright
ening.
So, I appreciate the incredible
things I've learned in VISTA, and I
appreciate VISTA as being a rare
chance to learn. VISTA opens doors
and provides opportunities that just
wouldn't be accessible otherwise.
As for my actual field work, I am
pacified but not ecstatic. I began my
work in a community center. My part
ner and I were to help this agency
serve 20,000 Negroes packed into sur
rounding public housing, high-rise
prisons. Of the 5,000 families, over
80 per cent have no fathers. Some 60
per cent of the mothers are on wel
fare. Many families are third-genera
tion residents of the same apartment,
having lived in the high-rises since
they were built twenty years ago.
The buildings are stark and ugly,
about eight in number, each twenty
stories high. There is no grass or
lawns, asphalt covers everything.
And, as everywhere in Chicago, a
layer of shattered glass covers the
asphalt.
The people have no feeling of com
munity, no hope of ever leaving the
present situation. Girls become preg
nant early and often, condemned to a
life of bare subsistence living. Boys,
growing up in fatherless homes, are
emasculated, shiftless, inferior to
women. They marry only to find them
selves unable to face their families
when they cannot find jobs to support
them. They leave, at least allowing

the mother to go on welfare. Kids
growing up join gangs for security
and identity. Gangs' roam the neigh
borhood and the buildings, making
it a hellish place for residents and in
truders alike.
Involvement
VISTA stresses involvement with
the community and personal contact,
but our agency allowed us to do very
little. We were doing nothing but sit
ting around the center all day, mak
ing an occasional contact with a kid
in the center, a hid who needs the
least help. Then, in a week's time, my
partner and I were jumped and beat
en twice, once in front of the agency
in broad daylight This upset the cen
ter, and VISTA was already upset at

growing up in fatherless homes, are
emasculated, shiftless, inferior to
women. They marry only to find them
selves unable to face their families
when they cannot find jobs to support
them. They leave, at least allowing

the mother to go on welfare. Kids
growing up join gangs for security
and identity. Gangs' roam the neigh
borhood and the buildings, making
it a hellish place for residents and in
truders alike.
Involvement
VISTA stresses involvement with
the community and personal contact,
but our agency allowed us to do very
little. We were doing nothing but sit
ting around the center all day, mak
ing an occasional contact with a kid
in the center, a hid who needs the
least help. Then, in a week's time, my
partner and I were jumped and beat
en twice, once in front of the agency
in broad daylight This upset the cen
ter, and VISTA was already upset at
our work, so after three weeks on the
job (half our training period) we
were transferred.
My new assig nment has proven
much better. I am again working with
a community sendees agency, but in
a much different: setting. Formerly,
the center had buen quite large and
one of, literally, a hundred various
public and private agencies going
blindly and ineffectively and unce
operatively about their jobs. My new
center is quite small and is relatively
alone in a fairly large pocket of ab
ject poverty. This agency has been
primarily a day school for retarded
children, and I have done some work
with retarded kids.
But the new director of the agency,
and the four VILSTA trainees there,
are all interested in community or
ganizing. Therefore, for the past two
weeks I've been involved in working
with people in the community. We
have been concentrating on one
apartment build .ng, trying to orga

nize a tenants council which can force
repairs and improvement from the
landlord. Progress is slow of course,
but the response from people is much
better than expected. Naturally, now
that things have just begun to move,
the training sesion is almost over.
Rambling*
More ramblings—l live in a large
basement room of a large old home
on Chicago's Northwest side. I share
the room with three other VISTAs
and an old pool table. My roommates
are great fellows, especially my part
ner, Tom, from New Jersey. One of
the other roommates, Mark, from
Boston, will go with me on our per
manent assignment (more on this).
They are all college grads, and I
learn a great deal from them — they
think I'm "okay" for an 18-year old.
VISTA has a now policy of assign
ing volunteers to the same geogra
phical area in which they train. Thus,
we were told to expect Midwestern
placements. Everyone either wanted
to go West or East, so this point was
not a favorite. When the final assign
ments were made last Sunday, 17 of
the 19 cities assigned were in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri. One was
in the middle of Pennsylvania and
the last was Wilmington, Delaware.
Naturally, I ended up in Delaware. I
was happy beyond belief. The loca
tion of my assignment is good, my
four fellow-workers are all top-notch,
and our work sounds exciting—grass
roots community organizing. Commu
nity organization seems, at the mo
ment, to be VISTA's most valuable
work. The job appears to be exactly
what I wanted. I fly to Del. on Dec. 6
to begin the full year of service.

Editor's Note: Jackson Clark Is a
former Stanford Student who left
last year to join Volunteers in Ser
vice to Ameriea (VISTA) last spring
after completing' his freshman year.
The following is the text of a letter
he sent to his former faeulty resident
in Junipero House, Mr. Norman Fier-
Ing, explaining his views on VISTA
and his training.
First, I'll try to describe VISTA and
my training program as I see it. My
training group is composed of sixty
people, half male, half female. They
range in age from 18 to 80. Perhaps
45 are of college age—either recent
grads of, formerly enrolled in, or
ready to enter college. The remainder
are senior citizens, sixty or over.
Immediately I wondered where the
representatives of that intermediate
age group were—the group most in
volved in creating and continuing
"the American way of life." Obvious
ly, most are too busy achieving, be
coming, or securing but I rather ex
pected an individual or two, or a
married couple, that had dropped
everything and joined VISTA just for
the hell of it.
In terms of individuals' intellectual
viewpoints or philosophies, the group
is hard to classify. The elderly people,
as expected, have very unrealistic and
imaginative views, without exception.
The younger group, perhaps because
of the nature of VISTA and its re
sulting attractions, tend to the liberal
side. But less than a third appear ei
ther willing or capable to ask the big
questions and face situations realis
tically.
Training Procedure
My program, The Jane Addams
Training Center, (Chicago) has the
reputation of being one of VISTA's
finest training sessions. Over-all I
have been impressed. After spending
the first two days of training in a
hotel listening to lectures, the trainees
were split into groups of two to four
and scattered throughout the city to
permanent field assignments. Trainees
live, as much as possible, in the pov
erty areas where they work. Each
trainee works with and under the
supervision of a public or private
agency involved in serving a poverty
area. Trainees spend four days a week
for discussions and lectures. The
training assignments are varied —
community organizing, legal aid,
community centers, recreation, street
gangs, senior citizens, welfare, etc.—
and are considered the most impor
tant aspects of our training.
Expansion on Ideals
Thus far, VISTA in theory has been
acceptable if somewhat vague. I was
quite pessimistic about the politick
ing and game-playing which I antici
pated, but VISTA's approach has been
both honest and pragmatic.
Early in training one lecture at
tempted to deal with poverty and
VISTA realistically. The War on Pov
erty was defined as nothing more
than the forceful imposition of mid

dle-class values upon minorities. Now,
this sort of talk came as a surprise to
those who'd arrived with "brother
hood," "helping my unfortunate coun
trymen," "a better life for the poor"
in their minds and nothing else. Of
course, I was enthusiastic about this
turn of events. High ideals are great
—I always seem to get tangled up in
them myself—but there's got to be
more to it than that.
Unfortunately, further talk about
the basic premises of the War on
Poverty have not developed. The sub
ject is open, but no one wants to ad
dress it. Thought seems to have been
transferred to the best ways of im
plementing the War on Poverty,
rather than discussing the whole sys
tem. Obviously, it's difficult for an
organization to both question itself
and operate effectively at the same
time. In retrospect, I suppose I should
be surprised VISTA is as loose and
free-wheeling as it is.
No Solution To Poverty
VISTA has done an excellent job
of demonstrating that, though the
problem of poverty becomes increas
ingly well-defined, no one has yet
found a really effective way of elimi
nating the problem. Everyone has a
different theory, a different approach.
My own thoughts are mixed.
On the one hand, I see the impor
tance and the necessity of VISTA's
personal, normally one-to-one work.
Peoples' needs must be heeded. But
on the other hand, I recognize that
it is the American system as it now
exists, with all its institutions and
values, which creates and continues
poverty. Only large-scale action, on
political, social, and economic levels,
can ever begin to diminish poverty.
Presently, VISTA's real value lies
in its effect on VISTA workers them
selves. The experience is an incredible
awakening and a shattering of values
for most. What could be better? If
every middle class youth in the coun
try spent a year in VISTA the prob
lem would be solved. Obviously, I feel
VISTA is a tremendous experience—
not necessarily in terms of the work
one does, but rather as a learning and
living situation for the VISTA volun
teer.
In VISTA I've talked to politicians,
lawyers, doctors, ministers, move
ment leaders, gang members, commu
nity organizers, and every variety of
person that exists in a slum. I've
never felt so involved or attached to
a city. I know who runs this city and
how. I know the story behind the
newspaper article, the story that
never gets printed, and the event be
fore it happens. I hear what the
mayor's going to say, what he means,
what the truth is, and why he's say
ing it. I hear about the gangfight be
fore it happens. I know about the
murder and riot on the West Side
that doesn't make the papers. It's
strange, but I'm getting a real feeling
for this city. And it's a dirty, ugly,
decayed, corrupted city.

I should have realized before the
dream-world city people always see
because they never venture off the
well-lit downtown streets. It's fright
ening, but it's there. And the fact that
few people know or want to admit
it's there, makes it even more fright
ening.
So, I appreciate the incredible
things I've learned in VISTA, and I
appreciate VISTA as being a rare
chance to learn. VISTA opens doors
and provides opportunities that just
wouldn't be accessible otherwise.
As for my actual field work, I am
pacified but not ecstatic. I began my
work in a community center. My part
ner and I were to help this agency
serve 20,000 Negroes packed into sur
rounding public housing, high-rise
prisons. Of the 5,000 families, over
80 per cent have no fathers. Some 60
per cent of the mothers are on wel
fare. Many families are third-genera
tion residents of the same apartment,
having lived in the high-rises since
they were built twenty years ago.
The buildings are stark and ugly,
about eight in number, each twenty
stories high. There is no grass or
lawns, asphalt covers everything.
And, as everywhere in Chicago, a
layer of shattered glass covers the
asphalt.
The people have no feeling of com
munity, no hope of ever leaving the
present situation. Girls become preg
nant early and often, condemned to a
life of bare subsistence living. Boys,
growing up in fatherless homes, are
emasculated, shiftless, inferior to
women. They marry only to find them
selves unable to face their families
when they cannot find jobs to support
them. They leave, at least allowing

the mother to go on welfare. Kids
growing up join gangs for security
and identity. Gangs' roam the neigh
borhood and the buildings, making
it a hellish place for residents and in
truders alike.
