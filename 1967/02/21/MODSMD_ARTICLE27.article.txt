### JOHN MERRILL

Thursday night as the Indians
dropped a 7-3 meet decision to
the hard-punching Bears.
The Indians had lost to Cal
previously 7-4 in a meet that
had included three forfeits to
Cal. Coming off last week's 1/i

eagerly.
"I was surprised by our loss
of form over last week," com
mented Stanford coach Ray

?luded two forfeits against
Stanford in the lightest classes.
"Cal Very Tough"
"California really had a fine
group of boxers, though some
of the matches were very close
decisions."
Victims of decisions were
Stanford boxers Dave Hibbitts,
Barney Adler, John Price, and
Mike Palmer.

The Hibbitts and Adler match
es were close for the first two
rounds with neither boxer get
ting the edge. In each case the
third round gave the nod to Phil
Nemir and Jim Hite of the
Bears.
Price in Rugged Set-to
Though giving away height
and reach to his Cal opponent
Greg Monahan, John Price
fought well for the three rounds,
only to lose the decision in one
of the tightest matches of the
evening.
Mike Palmer lost perhaps the
most rugged bout of the card, a
swinging three-rounder to Tracy
Cox.
Captain Marlar
Stanford's top man at 156,
Jim Marlar did not box, winning
a forfeit. Marlar was elected
Captain of the team last week,
in voting conducted among team
members.
In the 147 pound class, Stan
ford's Bill Thomas ran into a
flurry of punches from Jim
Hoobler. Referee Vera Bybee

stopped the bout in the first
round, though Thomas was
never down.
Winners for Stanford were
172 pound Tom Jenks and
heavyweight Dave Oswald, both
winners on decisions.
Jenks Wins at 172
In a well boxed but slow three
rounder, Jenks used both right
and left hand leads to keep the
taller Bill Neyland at bay.
Stanford's first heavyweight,
Eric De Gooyer was injured

prior to the meet and did not
see action.
Dave Oswald, undefeated this
year as is De Gooyer, boxed
Ron Dell 'Immaggine of Cal.
"Ox" on the Move
The popular "Oz" chased his
opponent throughout the match,
cornering him at times with
one-two combinations.
Oswald emerged from the
fray with a unanimous decision
and plaudits from Coach Lun
ny. "Dave is coming along very

fast, we've got two very fine
heavies right now."
With the record standing at
2-2, the boxing team will box
next in the Naval Collegiate
meet at Moffett Field on Feb
ruary 28.
Lunny appraised the team's
chances in the meet as very
good. The meet will be on an
individual entry basis and three
of the squad, Jenks, De Gooyer,
and Oswald have not been de
feated this year.
