# Crowd A Problem For Secret Service
## Yelling Students Jam Street, Slow Humphrey's Exit 
### NICK SELBY Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily 
Everything in Vice-President Hubert
Humphrey's visit to the Stanford cam
pus yesterday went smoothly until he
tried to leave.
At that time, the Secret Service and
Highway Patrol guards had to form a
phalanx to move Mr. Humphrey
through the crowds to his car.
The circumstances of the exit were
surprising because at one time Mr.
Humphrey stood before an open win
dow shaking hands without a guard in
sight.
Unguarded
After concluding his speech, Mr.
Humphrey stood before the podium
shaking hands and answering ques
tion from a small group of students.
He then retired to a small room in
the rear of Memorial Auditorium
where he chatted with several people
for about five minutes. Meanwhile, a
huge crowd of demonstrators and per
sons waiting to see the Vice-President
had gathered directly behind the Aud
itorium and spilled onto Memorial
Way.
The crowd did not notice the Vice-
President, but several students and
this reporter, while watching the
crowd, noticed Humphrey through an
open window.
They shook hands and talked with
him until a girl approaching yelling
"Murderer" and "Why don't you stop
killing children in Vietnam?" There
was no one between Mr. Humphrey
and crowd.
Crowd Closes In
The girl's voice carried to the crowd
and the people surged up to the win
dow chanting "Shame, shame." The
Vice-President quickly left the room.
The crowd hurried toward the Busi
ness School side of the auditorium and
the cries of "Shame, Shame" grew
more intense as over two thousand
people jammed in front of the ex
pected exit.
But the Vice-President was ushered
out the other side of the auditorium.
When the cries reached the other side
of the building, the crowd raced to
ward Galvez Street,
Both Humphrey supporters and de
tractors were in the crowd. Some
members of the crowd chanted
"shame, shame," as Humphrey walk
ed to his car, surrounded by police.
The crowd did not, however, seem
to impede Humphrey's progress. He
moved across the field directly to the
curb.
Two students carried a large ban
ner reading "Get Out of Vietnam."
Several students also carried smaller
posters encouraging the United States
to "Win in Vietnam."
A large number of people were
shouting at Humphrey and his sup
porters were returning the shouts.
The phalanx of guards then raced
to the Vice-President's limousine and
the bobby-sticked-patrolmen formed a
wall between the crowd and the car,
which quickly left via Galvez and
Serra streets.
The patrol division fell into order
and marched away toward Palo Alto,
followed by shouts, of "Out, out."
