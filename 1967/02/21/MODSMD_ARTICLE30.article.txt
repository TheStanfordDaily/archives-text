# Gymnasts Divide Two Meets
## 
### GREG PSALTIS 
Stanford's gymnasts split a
pair of meets last weekend by
defeating Santa Barbara 150.45
to 146.10 and losing to UCLA
180.35 to 119.25.
Friday in the UCSB meet the
Indians had the services of all
around man Jim Petersen in
four events. It was doubtful as
to whether or not he would per
form due to an injury sustained
in practice.
Tramp Score Up
Petersen won the free exer
cise with junior Rich Guess cap
turing second place. Captain
John Rinderknecht took first in
the side horse with a 7.25 score,
his best of the year.
Bill Fisher won the trampo

line with a fine 8.35 score and
was followed by Rich Guess'
second place 8.05 effort. The
Cards rolled up 22.4 points alto
gether in the trampoline, thus
going over the 20 point mark
for the first time this season.
Guess led all competitors in
the long horse with a 9.15 mark.
The Indians also took first and
second in the parallel bars as
John Marks won it with 8.15
and Rinderknecht followed with
8.0.
Marks also won the rings with
an 8.55 score and Petersen man
aged second with 8.0.
Guess Leads Scoring
Rich Guess was the high point
man in the meet as he scored
31.3 points in four events. Pe
tersen also worked four events
and totaled 29.5.
UCLA's Bruins were just too
much for Stanford as they ran
away with the meet. The Bruins
have a solid team that is defi
nitely in contention for the
AAWU championship.
Stanford was crippled by two
injuries. Petersen's wrist both

ered him enough so that he
couldn't compete that night and
sophomore Jim Snyder didn't
even make the trip due to a bad
back.
Spots Open
As a result, three spots were
left open due to the lack of
men. Had they been filled, the
Indians would have been able to
add another 20 points or so to
their team score.
John Marks provided the lone
bright spot for Stanford Satur
day night as he got second in
the parallel bars with 8.05 and
third in the rings with 8.35.
Next week the Cards face San
Jose State and then San Fran
cisco State the week after that.
They will be forced to win one
of the meets to come out with
a winning season, as their rec
ord presently stands at 54.
Both teams have been scoring
around 155-160 this season, so
Stanford will stand a good
chance of winning either, de
pending on whether or not Pe
tersen and Snyder return to full
action.
