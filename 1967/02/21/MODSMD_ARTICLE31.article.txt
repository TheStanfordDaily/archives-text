# Fraternity Rebuttal To Housing Comm Report
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following
article was written by Richard
W. Edmonds, who has been ath
letic chairman, alumni chair
man, new house coordinator,
pledge trainer and is currently
president of Delta Kappa Epsl
lon. He graduated fall quarter
In Electrical Engineering and
is now studying for his M.S. In
Industrial Engineering.)
Dave Harris once said that he
knew no one as liberal as him
self; and one result of his be
licfs is that ho has been ineffec
tive as a practical politician. But
as one who often has reacted vio
lently to Harris' radical ideas, I
cannot help but recognize that
Mr. Harris has awakened an
apathetic university. The inter
play of ideas that has resulted is
exciting; never have so many
constructive ideas flowed so
freely. Students now have great
er social responsibility; they r„re
more concerned with their role
in the University and the Uni
versity's role in their education.
The Housing Commission Re
port is a welcomed addition to
this exchange, for the role of a
residence university has never
been concisely formulated.
To that end, the section of the
Report entitled The Philosophy
of the Residence University is
a magnificent statement of the
goals to which, I believe, almost
every Stanford student is com
mitted. There is no doubt that
education is the disciplining of
the mind, the exposure to a va
riety of thoughts and experi
ences, the challenging and re
challenging of ideas and beliefs.
As the Report says, social and
intellectual lives should not be
separated; moreover, in reality
they cannot be separated.
I should like you in particular
to take note of the following ex
cerpt from The Philosophy: "The
optimum situation for encour
aging such confrontation seems
to be a group characterized by
frequent contact, similar con
cerns, divergent opinions and at
titudes, and a sense of commu
nity. Tliis last is difficult to de
fine, but might be described as
the difference between being
among friends or among strang
ers. Its basis is an emphasis on
the dignity and worth of each
individual and on cooperation
rather than competition." Fra
ternity men recognize that this
is merely another very articu
late statement of what they have
repeatedly described as the ideal
situation.
But just because this is what
the fraternities want to be does
not mean that they should not
be criticized, for as the Com
mission points out, all of Stan
ford falls far short of the ideal,
and fraternities must be includ
ed. The fraternities cannot and
must not consider themselves
above criticism because they are
part of the system. But con
versely, because they are the
strongest part of the system
does not mean that they should
arouse the bitterest attacks.
On the other side, Stanford
fraternities need not react de
fensively to the bitter criticism.
Despite shortcomings, Stanford
has the most progressive fra
ternity system in the country.

Four years ago the IFC consid
ered any outside rulings con
cerning rush as interference.
But because of much discus
sion the last few years, and be
cause of the thinking which
Harris has provoked, IFC now
is concerned with the freshman
viewpoint towards rush.
Through Larry Benningson's
leadership and guidance the IFC
and the Ad Hoc Rush Commit
tee built a rush proposal which
greatly reduces the superficiali
ties of rush. But more important
is the fact that fraternity men
are excited about the rush pro
posal. Interference is now called
consultation, compromise is now
called agreement.
As to the philosophy of rush
itself, I should like to quote
(Sect. E, par. 1) of the Report
of the Freshman Year commit
tee (pg. D column 3). "No house
needs to represent a cross-sec
tion of the student body. When
too great diversity exists in a
living group, cohesiveness is lost
and fragmentation take the
form of breaking up into small
sub-groups between which little
communication exists, there
fore, some communality, especi
ally by interests, is desirable."
This section then continues to
suggest free selection, and it
warns against stagnation. These
three paragraphs then, have the
fraternity system in a nut shell.
Stanford's fraternity system
does not stagnate, and it can
not stagnate because of the con
structive criticism which the
community provides- Thus the
question is whether rush pro
vides free selection.
It must be recognized that no
system provides free selection.
Laurie Harrison says in the Re
port of the Women's Subcom
mittee, "Diversity within indivi
dual living groups, necessary
for the optimal educational at
mosphere, exists to a greater
degree in women's residences ...
than in men's residences, as a di
rect result of the draw system."
She assumes that diversity is
achieved through throwing peo
ple together without choice, but
as the Freshman Report notes,
fragmentation results when a
group has no common basis.
There are several ways to a -
chieve a common basis; one al
ternative is the fraternity sys
tem.
The anti-fraternity group says
that the selective system of
fraternity rush is cruel. But
selection is part of life. Never
theless, the rush selection is not
even as strict as many believe.
Despite statements to the con
trary, Stanford's fraternities
are very diversive. There is not
a freshman at Stanford who can
not find and be selected by at
least one house to which he can
be an integral member. More
over, much of the hurt in the
past has been lack of communi
cation. But now that 1) the fra
ternities are trying to make
themselves more available and
2) because Larry Bennigson and
Joe Higgins are providing the
freshman with more informa
tion and guidance, it appears if
many of rushes drawbacks have
been tempered. Moreover,
through the interplay of the

IFC, the Ad Hoc Rush Commit
tee, and future criticism, rush
will continue to approach the
ideal
As to selection itself, I should
hope that the anti-group would
be encouraged by the example
of the Lambda Nu positive vote
system. As a point of informa
tion the reason for the frater
nities; resentment towards "in
terference" in this area is that
most houses use a positive vote
system in reality even If, in
name, it is still called a ding
system. Fraternities are anx
ious to get the best men possible
(not the most*, and the pres
sures against thoughtless ding
ing are tremendous (particular
-ly if the rushee is well liked by
a number of the members).
What the "anti-group" also for
gets is that fraternity men are
aware of social responsibility,
and very rarely reject a rushee
who would be an asset to the
community as a whole, as op
posed to just the particular
house.
At this point, it must be em
phasized that the various im
provements in rush which have
taken place in the last few years
are only modifications. The fun
damental truth remains that
selectivity is basic to the frater
nity system. Without it, the fra
ternity ceases to exist, and be
comes simply a group of people
who live the same place. They
might or might not develop a
commitment towards their
group, thus facilitating the sort
of meaningful communication
which is so important to the edu
cative process; the point is that
the machinery for making this
a probability and not a possi
bility has been eliminated.
Let us now turn to the func
tions of the living group itself
Again the Freshman Report
shows a good deal of insight
when it says,"The program for
each residence would decide it
self what input to organize as
a stimulus for the desired en
richment of the quality of living
that contributes to the total edu
cation of the individual and of
the group's students, faculty
ideas, and the unending list of
resources of a university com
munity are ail potential and
powerful inputs." Moreover,
"The outside stimulus and help
will not best be provided by
authority figures who tell people
what to do, or beat off the anti
intellectual bullies. The best as
surance that free exchange and
sharing of experience will be
found in the atmosphere of the
living group and in the charact
er of its leadership. And this is

the whole crux of the matter.
The anti-fraternity people as
sume that the atmosphere and
leadership of the fraternity is
anti-intellectual. This is not so.
I have already mentioned how
IFC has demonstrated its con
cern for the whole community,
and as to the practical reality of
day to day life in a fraternity,
my previous reference to the
fragmentation inherent in any
dormitory situation is highly
relevant. Put in its simplest
terms fraternity brothers are
each other's friends. They are
also Stanford students and in
telligent young men. They are
both capable of meaningful
communication within their
group, and in a way, unable to
avoid it. And as the Freshman
Report points out, meaningful
exchange is not by definition
discussion of strictly academic
subjects.
In other Stanford residence
situations the friendship that
exists is usually skin-deep or
subdivided into cliques, or both;
meaningful communication is
often inhibited because undeni
ably the exchange of ideas be
tween people who dislike each
other is difficult, if not impos
sible, to achieve.
Much of the Report's criticism
is directed at initiation. In order
to demonstrate clearly how ini
tiation is actually a very edu
cational experience, I shall draw
upon my own experience as a
Deke, as it is the only house
I am qualified to speak about.
There was a time when the
Deke initiation did not conform
to the hazing laws. However, so
cial responsibility became a
greater concern for the Dekes
when six years ago they made
a few important changes in
their initiation. Changes were
slow and small until this past
fall. Our goal this fall was to
eliminate such pointless tasks
as pushups, sitting against the
wall, etc., and replace these with
constructive jobs such as house
repairs, football practice, and
addressing envelopes to alumni.
It is our intent through out to
have the pledge reflect enough
to recognize that he is not the

peer of an older, more exper
ienced, active. Each year the
freshmen class is more intelli
gent than the previous years'
but also more arrogant. As
members of the administration
point out, this lack of humility
causes troubles because there
has been no tempering of ex
perience. Meaningful and re
warding participation in the
university experience, and in
deed, in life itself, is to a large
degree dependent on the posses
sion of at least some small mea
sure of this quality.
This is what we build in our
pledges; and this goal is shared
by most fraternities. Some peo
ple call this breaking a person
down and rebuilding him. That
is not what we do. We temper

the enthusiasm and arrogance
with a little responsible humili
ty. Unlike many of the Report's
ideals which have not been
realized, this is a reality.
Sadly, criticism of the initia
tion practices of the Stanford
fraternities was based upon half
truth and untruth coupled with
a misunderstanding of the Stan
ford brand of initiation. In our
own house, the "fun and games"
referred to in the Report is ex
actly that for all concerned.
Next quarter we will be the
fourth fraternity to hold a semi
nar in our house. The decision
to do this was made last quarter
with our faculty associate, Prof.
Bavelas (the Fraternity Report
was incorrect in that we not
