# Hillel To Host Actor T. Bikel
## 
### 
Theodore Bickel, known pri
marily as a character actor, will
be present at the Hillel Coffee
Hour on Wednesday, 3-5 p.m., to
chat informally with students
on "Jewish Identity on Cam
pus."
He speaks not as an actor
but as a man vitally interested
in the rights of others, saying
"The world concerns me very
much. I want to leave my mark
on it. People should be able to
remember you after the theater
seats are cold."
Since studying at the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art is
London, Bikel has developed
varied skills until he now quali
fies as a singer, composer, musi
cian, author, lecturer, photo
grapher, linguist, satirist, world
traveller, and political buff. He
spends many weeks each year
appearing at folk concerts in
the U.S. and abroad.
