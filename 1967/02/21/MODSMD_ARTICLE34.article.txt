## Co-Chairmen Refute Commission Critics 
### 
In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together
to create this alternative. Then,
and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Lament
Editor, The Daily:
Hubert Humphrey's showing
yesterday proved for me that our
government is run by a passel
of zanies and that this particular
one is indeed without "sense or
dignity," as Mencken would say.
Yet as full of anti-war venom and
as dissatisfied with the "liberal"
administration of Johnson-Hum
phrey as I am, I nevertheless de
cry the patent illiberalism of
those protestors who walked out
of yesterday's forum. For once
Humphrey's liberalism did not
fail him when, after your heady
departure, he called you, and I
do not quote, slaves of dogma.
Stanford's true reactionaries
of the walk-out tactic, you played
his hand for him beautifully. He
could have asked for no more.
You spoiled the subtlest most
jarring protest we could ever
hope for. Were you deaf to the
overtones of ridicule, the rising
tide of laughter that mounted
with each idiotic gesture, each
platitude of inanity? Oh, to have
had that wave break, to have
splashed laughter upon him and
to leave him without a word. But,
I thank you for him, you gave
him a speech.

• Shame!
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, feel the
procedure for admitting students
to hear the Vice President speak
was arbitrary and fraudulent.
After roughly 400 students, at
the most, were admitted, the
doors were closed.
On the information of ushers
at the side doors, the auditorium
was "full."
According to The Daily, admis
sion was open to faculty admin
istration and students ONLY.
Who was there ahead of us? Cer
tainly not faculty members, who
stood in line with students.
We speak for many people who
had to stand in a motionless line
for well over an hour, missing
classes, etc., when they had every
reason to believe that there
would be a fair admission policy.
We are ashamed of Stanford.

• Not Berkeley
Editor, The Daily:
The student walkout was not
very massive, but, as the Vice-
President candidly remarked,
this isn't Berkeley. The silent
vigil of the Faculty, on the other
hand, was a huge success, for
nobody heard them. The Orator
and his audience of trained seals
carried the day as expected, the
black limousine slipped away,
and normal life resumed. De
spite rumors that Humphrey
had sidestepped some questions,
most students ignored the rally
afterwards. No doubt they had
to study to make for time lost
In Sunday's teach-in. For the
educational process must ro on
somehow, even if this isn't Ber
keley. DAVID McNEIL

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

• Theta What?
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding some of the inac
curacies of the Subcommittee
report on Fraternity housing: if
it's not Theta Chi, and it's not
Theta Xi, then who is it? Might
I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter
and editor's comment, Daily,
Feb. 17) actually apply to Tau
Kappa Epsilon.
Top that one.

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-
Ebbing.
Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts
a steak dinner for shaving Dave
Harris's head, there are likely
to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil
ler for offering to share his per
fume with all of us. It was a
display of generosity of which
all fraternity men can be proud.

• Parallel?
Editor, The Daily:
The same faults inherent in
the fraternity system have be on
corrected by businesses and edu
cational groups as evidenced in
the following headlines:
IMB abolishes selective ap
pointment and recruitment prac
tices.
Stanford abolishes selective ad
mission and institutes draw sys
tem.
President Johnson has called
for an immediate investigation
into "National Library Week" if
not by each local librarian, then
by the Attorney General.
Report from Harvard Academ
ic Office: "Kennedy is a good
man, not academic enough."
Catholics abolish one-week
Confirmation period; it tends to
unify the group.
The President's report asks
that a review board be estab
lished which would decide with
in the next three years whether
each state should be allowed to
remain in the Union. The deci
sion shall be based upon "per
formance."

• Sick
Editor, The Daily:
The Graduate School of Busi
ness is a beautiful building. Any
thing that costs $5.5 million
should be beautiful. But the peo
ple inside it are sick and diseased
—and that makes them ugly.
They are also dangerous, be

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci
sion Making Theory, Price
Theory, and all that other dog
gerel. They're always poring
through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland
Stanford.
Watch out, America. They're
all around us. The Graduate
School of Business should be
quarantined—or, if necessary,
destroyed—before it's too late.

• Critique
Editor. The Daily:
As fall president of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, I was interviewed by
Chuck Katz and Stan Shore for
the fraternity subcommittee of
the A.S.S.U. Housing Commis
sion. The thoroughness and ob
jectivity of approximately 100
standardized questions was im
pressive. After one and a half
hours, we were satisfied that
adequate, accurate information
had been obtained.
Reading the text of the report
in the Daily of February 15, I
was amazed to find that of the
four times the Phi Kap house
was mentioned specifically, only
one was a result of the commit
tee interview. Two of the other
three are not in harmony with
our general practices and ma
jority opinion. The third was In
adequately presented.
It is difficult to believe, con
sidering the committee's pro
fessed educational goals, that its
final presentation is a construc
tive evaluation. Though specific
ally concerned about distortion
of a particular house, the above
discrepancies cause me to ques
tion if "report" is not a mis
nomer for "critique."

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.

Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the

the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled

To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu

Instead of hurling epithets at

If he feels that these members

should make arrangements for

To criticize constructively in

usually easier and more produc

So, in conclusion, may I sug

With the approach of frater

Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

• Critique
Editor. The Daily:
As fall president of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, I was interviewed by
Chuck Katz and Stan Shore for
the fraternity subcommittee of
the A.S.S.U. Housing Commis
sion. The thoroughness and ob
jectivity of approximately 100
standardized questions was im
pressive. After one and a half
hours, we were satisfied that
adequate, accurate information
had been obtained.
Reading the text of the report
in the Daily of February 15, I
was amazed to find that of the
four times the Phi Kap house
was mentioned specifically, only
one was a result of the commit
tee interview. Two of the other
three are not in harmony with
our general practices and ma
jority opinion. The third was In
adequately presented.
It is difficult to believe, con
sidering the committee's pro
fessed educational goals, that its
final presentation is a construc
tive evaluation. Though specific
ally concerned about distortion
of a particular house, the above
discrepancies cause me to ques
tion if "report" is not a mis
nomer for "critique."

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.
GREG KOWAL
Phi Delta Theta
In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together
to create this alternative. Then,
and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci

through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland
Stanford.
Watch out, America. They're
all around us. The Graduate
School of Business should be
quarantined—or, if necessary,
destroyed—before it's too late.

As fall president of Phi Kap

It is difficult to believe, con

As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus

In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together
to create this alternative. Then,
and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Lament
Editor, The Daily:
Hubert Humphrey's showing
yesterday proved for me that our
government is run by a passel
of zanies and that this particular
one is indeed without "sense or
dignity," as Mencken would say.
Yet as full of anti-war venom and
as dissatisfied with the "liberal"
administration of Johnson-Hum
phrey as I am, I nevertheless de
cry the patent illiberalism of
those protestors who walked out
of yesterday's forum. For once
Humphrey's liberalism did not
fail him when, after your heady
departure, he called you, and I
do not quote, slaves of dogma.
Stanford's true reactionaries
of the walk-out tactic, you played
his hand for him beautifully. He
could have asked for no more.
You spoiled the subtlest most
jarring protest we could ever
hope for. Were you deaf to the
overtones of ridicule, the rising
tide of laughter that mounted
with each idiotic gesture, each
platitude of inanity? Oh, to have
had that wave break, to have
splashed laughter upon him and
to leave him without a word. But,
I thank you for him, you gave
him a speech.

• Shame!
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, feel the
procedure for admitting students
to hear the Vice President speak
was arbitrary and fraudulent.
After roughly 400 students, at
the most, were admitted, the
doors were closed.
On the information of ushers
at the side doors, the auditorium
was "full."
According to The Daily, admis
sion was open to faculty admin
istration and students ONLY.
Who was there ahead of us? Cer
tainly not faculty members, who
stood in line with students.
We speak for many people who
had to stand in a motionless line
for well over an hour, missing
classes, etc., when they had every
reason to believe that there
would be a fair admission policy.
We are ashamed of Stanford.

• Not Berkeley
Editor, The Daily:
The student walkout was not
very massive, but, as the Vice-
President candidly remarked,
this isn't Berkeley. The silent
vigil of the Faculty, on the other
hand, was a huge success, for
nobody heard them. The Orator
and his audience of trained seals
carried the day as expected, the
black limousine slipped away,
and normal life resumed. De
spite rumors that Humphrey
had sidestepped some questions,
most students ignored the rally
afterwards. No doubt they had
to study to make for time lost

educational process must ro on
somehow, even if this isn't Ber

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

• Theta What?

Regarding some of the inac
curacies of the Subcommittee
report on Fraternity housing: if
it's not Theta Chi, and it's not
Theta Xi, then who is it? Might
I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter
and editor's comment, Daily,
Feb. 17) actually apply to Tau

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-
Ebbing.
Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts
a steak dinner for shaving Dave
Harris's head, there are likely
to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil
ler for offering to share his per
fume with all of us. It was a
display of generosity of which
all fraternity men can be proud.

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-
Ebbing.
Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts
a steak dinner for shaving Dave
Harris's head, there are likely
to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil
ler for offering to share his per
fume with all of us. It was a
display of generosity of which
all fraternity men can be proud.

• Sick
Editor, The Daily:
The Graduate School of Busi

thing that costs $5.5 million
should be beautiful. But the peo
ple inside it are sick and diseased
—and that makes them ugly.
They are also dangerous, be

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci
sion Making Theory, Price
Theory, and all that other dog
gerel. They're always poring
through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland
Stanford.
Watch out, America. They're
all around us. The Graduate
School of Business should be
quarantined—or, if necessary,
destroyed—before it's too late.

• Critique
Editor. The Daily:
As fall president of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, I was interviewed by
Chuck Katz and Stan Shore for
the fraternity subcommittee of
the A.S.S.U. Housing Commis
sion. The thoroughness and ob
jectivity of approximately 100
standardized questions was im
pressive. After one and a half
hours, we were satisfied that
adequate, accurate information
had been obtained.
Reading the text of the report
in the Daily of February 15, I
was amazed to find that of the
four times the Phi Kap house
was mentioned specifically, only
one was a result of the commit
tee interview. Two of the other
three are not in harmony with
our general practices and ma
jority opinion. The third was In
adequately presented.
It is difficult to believe, con
sidering the committee's pro
fessed educational goals, that its
final presentation is a construc
tive evaluation. Though specific
ally concerned about distortion
of a particular house, the above
discrepancies cause me to ques
tion if "report" is not a mis
nomer for "critique."

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.
GREG KOWAL
Phi Delta Theta
In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver

objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These

stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to

port.

In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together
to create this alternative. Then,
and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Lament
Editor, The Daily:
Hubert Humphrey's showing
yesterday proved for me that our
government is run by a passel
of zanies and that this particular
one is indeed without "sense or
dignity," as Mencken would say.
Yet as full of anti-war venom and
as dissatisfied with the "liberal"
administration of Johnson-Hum
phrey as I am, I nevertheless de
cry the patent illiberalism of
those protestors who walked out
of yesterday's forum. For once
Humphrey's liberalism did not
fail him when, after your heady
departure, he called you, and I
do not quote, slaves of dogma.
Stanford's true reactionaries
of the walk-out tactic, you played
his hand for him beautifully. He
could have asked for no more.
You spoiled the subtlest most
jarring protest we could ever
hope for. Were you deaf to the
overtones of ridicule, the rising
tide of laughter that mounted
with each idiotic gesture, each
platitude of inanity? Oh, to have
had that wave break, to have
splashed laughter upon him and
to leave him without a word. But,
I thank you for him, you gave
him a speech.

• Shame!
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, feel the
procedure for admitting students
to hear the Vice President speak
was arbitrary and fraudulent.
After roughly 400 students, at
the most, were admitted, the
doors were closed.
On the information of ushers
at the side doors, the auditorium
was "full."
According to The Daily, admis
sion was open to faculty admin
istration and students ONLY.
Who was there ahead of us? Cer
tainly not faculty members, who
stood in line with students.
We speak for many people who
had to stand in a motionless line
for well over an hour, missing
classes, etc., when they had every
reason to believe that there
would be a fair admission policy.
We are ashamed of Stanford.

• Not Berkeley
Editor, The Daily:
The student walkout was not
very massive, but, as the Vice-
President candidly remarked,
this isn't Berkeley. The silent
vigil of the Faculty, on the other
hand, was a huge success, for
nobody heard them. The Orator
and his audience of trained seals
carried the day as expected, the
black limousine slipped away,
and normal life resumed. De
spite rumors that Humphrey
had sidestepped some questions,
most students ignored the rally
afterwards. No doubt they had
to study to make for time lost
In Sunday's teach-in. For the
educational process must ro on
somehow, even if this isn't Ber

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

Regarding some of the inac

report on Fraternity housing: if

I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom

ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de

tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together

and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

Regarding some of the inac

report on Fraternity housing: if
it's not Theta Chi, and it's not
Theta Xi, then who is it? Might
I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter
and editor's comment, Daily,
Feb. 17) actually apply to Tau

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-
Ebbing.
Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts
a steak dinner for shaving Dave
Harris's head, there are likely
to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil
ler for offering to share his per
fume with all of us. It was a
display of generosity of which
all fraternity men can be proud.

• Sick
Editor, The Daily:
The Graduate School of Busi

thing that costs $5.5 million
should be beautiful. But the peo
ple inside it are sick and diseased
—and that makes them ugly.
They are also dangerous, be

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci
sion Making Theory, Price
Theory, and all that other dog
gerel. They're always poring
through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland
Stanford.
Watch out, America. They're
all around us. The Graduate

quarantined—or, if necessary,
destroyed—before it's too late.

• Critique
Editor. The Daily:
As fall president of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, I was interviewed by
Chuck Katz and Stan Shore for
the fraternity subcommittee of
the A.S.S.U. Housing Commis
sion. The thoroughness and ob
jectivity of approximately 100
standardized questions was im
pressive. After one and a half
hours, we were satisfied that
adequate, accurate information
had been obtained.
Reading the text of the report
in the Daily of February 15, I
was amazed to find that of the
four times the Phi Kap house
was mentioned specifically, only
one was a result of the commit
tee interview. Two of the other
three are not in harmony with
our general practices and ma
jority opinion. The third was In
adequately presented.
It is difficult to believe, con
sidering the committee's pro
fessed educational goals, that its
final presentation is a construc
tive evaluation. Though specific
ally concerned about distortion
of a particular house, the above
discrepancies cause me to ques
tion if "report" is not a mis
nomer for "critique."

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.
GREG KOWAL

In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'

what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater

once more, the anti-social, anti

the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed

viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary

It is difficult to believe, con

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.
GREG KOWAL

In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together
to create this alternative. Then,
and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Lament
Editor, The Daily:
Hubert Humphrey's showing
yesterday proved for me that our
government is run by a passel
of zanies and that this particular
one is indeed without "sense or
dignity," as Mencken would say.
Yet as full of anti-war venom and
as dissatisfied with the "liberal"
administration of Johnson-Hum
phrey as I am, I nevertheless de
cry the patent illiberalism of
those protestors who walked out
of yesterday's forum. For once
Humphrey's liberalism did not
fail him when, after your heady
departure, he called you, and I
do not quote, slaves of dogma.
Stanford's true reactionaries
of the walk-out tactic, you played
his hand for him beautifully. He
could have asked for no more.
You spoiled the subtlest most
jarring protest we could ever
hope for. Were you deaf to the
overtones of ridicule, the rising
tide of laughter that mounted
with each idiotic gesture, each
platitude of inanity? Oh, to have
had that wave break, to have
splashed laughter upon him and
to leave him without a word. But,
I thank you for him, you gave
him a speech.

Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, feel the
procedure for admitting students
to hear the Vice President speak
was arbitrary and fraudulent.
After roughly 400 students, at
the most, were admitted, the
doors were closed.
On the information of ushers
at the side doors, the auditorium
was "full."
According to The Daily, admis
sion was open to faculty admin
istration and students ONLY.
Who was there ahead of us? Cer
tainly not faculty members, who
stood in line with students.
We speak for many people who
had to stand in a motionless line
for well over an hour, missing
classes, etc., when they had every
reason to believe that there
would be a fair admission policy.
We are ashamed of Stanford.

and his audience of trained seals
carried the day as expected, the

Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to

In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together
to create this alternative. Then,
and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Lament
Editor, The Daily:
Hubert Humphrey's showing
yesterday proved for me that our
government is run by a passel
of zanies and that this particular
one is indeed without "sense or
dignity," as Mencken would say.
Yet as full of anti-war venom and
as dissatisfied with the "liberal"
administration of Johnson-Hum
phrey as I am, I nevertheless de
cry the patent illiberalism of
those protestors who walked out
of yesterday's forum. For once
Humphrey's liberalism did not
fail him when, after your heady
departure, he called you, and I
do not quote, slaves of dogma.
Stanford's true reactionaries
of the walk-out tactic, you played
his hand for him beautifully. He
could have asked for no more.
You spoiled the subtlest most
jarring protest we could ever
hope for. Were you deaf to the
overtones of ridicule, the rising
tide of laughter that mounted
with each idiotic gesture, each
platitude of inanity? Oh, to have
had that wave break, to have
splashed laughter upon him and
to leave him without a word. But,
I thank you for him, you gave
him a speech.

• Shame!
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, feel the
procedure for admitting students
to hear the Vice President speak
was arbitrary and fraudulent.
After roughly 400 students, at
the most, were admitted, the
doors were closed.
On the information of ushers
at the side doors, the auditorium
was "full."
According to The Daily, admis
sion was open to faculty admin
istration and students ONLY.
Who was there ahead of us? Cer
tainly not faculty members, who
stood in line with students.
We speak for many people who
had to stand in a motionless line
for well over an hour, missing
classes, etc., when they had every
reason to believe that there
would be a fair admission policy.
We are ashamed of Stanford.

• Not Berkeley
Editor, The Daily:
The student walkout was not
very massive, but, as the Vice-
President candidly remarked,
this isn't Berkeley. The silent
vigil of the Faculty, on the other
hand, was a huge success, for
nobody heard them. The Orator
and his audience of trained seals
carried the day as expected, the
black limousine slipped away,
and normal life resumed. De
spite rumors that Humphrey
had sidestepped some questions,
most students ignored the rally
afterwards. No doubt they had
to study to make for time lost

educational process must ro on
somehow, even if this isn't Ber

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

• Theta What?

Regarding some of the inac
curacies of the Subcommittee
report on Fraternity housing: if
it's not Theta Chi, and it's not
Theta Xi, then who is it? Might
I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter
and editor's comment, Daily,
Feb. 17) actually apply to Tau

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-
Ebbing.
Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts
a steak dinner for shaving Dave
Harris's head, there are likely
to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil
ler for offering to share his per
fume with all of us. It was a
display of generosity of which
all fraternity men can be proud.

Editor, The Daily:
The Graduate School of Busi

thing that costs $5.5 million
should be beautiful. But the peo
ple inside it are sick and diseased
—and that makes them ugly.
They are also dangerous, be

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci
sion Making Theory, Price

gerel. They're always poring
through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland

Watch out, America. They're

Editor, The Daily:
Hubert Humphrey's showing
yesterday proved for me that our

one is indeed without "sense or

Yet as full of anti-war venom and
as dissatisfied with the "liberal"

cry the patent illiberalism of
those protestors who walked out
of yesterday's forum. For once
Humphrey's liberalism did not
fail him when, after your heady

do not quote, slaves of dogma.
Stanford's true reactionaries
of the walk-out tactic, you played
his hand for him beautifully. He
could have asked for no more.
You spoiled the subtlest most
jarring protest we could ever
hope for. Were you deaf to the
overtones of ridicule, the rising
tide of laughter that mounted
with each idiotic gesture, each
platitude of inanity? Oh, to have
had that wave break, to have

I thank you for him, you gave

After roughly 400 students, at

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand

what should be an active con

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater

once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a

Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts

to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil

The Graduate School of Busi

thing that costs $5.5 million
should be beautiful. But the peo
ple inside it are sick and diseased
—and that makes them ugly.
They are also dangerous, be

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci
sion Making Theory, Price
Theory, and all that other dog
gerel. They're always poring
through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland
Stanford.
Watch out, America. They're
all around us. The Graduate
School of Business should be
quarantined—or, if necessary,
destroyed—before it's too late.

• Critique
Editor. The Daily:
As fall president of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, I was interviewed by
Chuck Katz and Stan Shore for
the fraternity subcommittee of
the A.S.S.U. Housing Commis
sion. The thoroughness and ob
jectivity of approximately 100
standardized questions was im
pressive. After one and a half
hours, we were satisfied that
adequate, accurate information
had been obtained.
Reading the text of the report
in the Daily of February 15, I
was amazed to find that of the
four times the Phi Kap house
was mentioned specifically, only
one was a result of the commit
tee interview. Two of the other
three are not in harmony with
our general practices and ma
jority opinion. The third was In
adequately presented.
It is difficult to believe, con
sidering the committee's pro
fessed educational goals, that its
final presentation is a construc
tive evaluation. Though specific
ally concerned about distortion
of a particular house, the above
discrepancies cause me to ques
tion if "report" is not a mis
nomer for "critique."

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.
GREG KOWAL
Phi Delta Theta
In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The

As a member of a fraternity

deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu

whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe

Happily for some, they are al

and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a

Notable achievements of this

Long range objectives no

In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters
in The Dally on the Fraternity
issue, have missed the point
here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new
alternative in residential educa

tion at Stanford. The Grove
House has been a first step on
a journey that may well be
longer than a thousand miles.
The Wilbur Experiment can be
a productive and exciting fur
ther step. So let us join together
to create this alternative. Then,
and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Lament
Editor, The Daily:
Hubert Humphrey's showing
yesterday proved for me that our
government is run by a passel
of zanies and that this particular
one is indeed without "sense or
dignity," as Mencken would say.
Yet as full of anti-war venom and
as dissatisfied with the "liberal"
administration of Johnson-Hum
phrey as I am, I nevertheless de
cry the patent illiberalism of
those protestors who walked out
of yesterday's forum. For once
Humphrey's liberalism did not
fail him when, after your heady
departure, he called you, and I
do not quote, slaves of dogma.
Stanford's true reactionaries
of the walk-out tactic, you played
his hand for him beautifully. He
could have asked for no more.
You spoiled the subtlest most
jarring protest we could ever
hope for. Were you deaf to the
overtones of ridicule, the rising
tide of laughter that mounted
with each idiotic gesture, each
platitude of inanity? Oh, to have
had that wave break, to have
splashed laughter upon him and
to leave him without a word. But,
I thank you for him, you gave
him a speech.

• Shame!
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, feel the
procedure for admitting students
to hear the Vice President speak
was arbitrary and fraudulent.
After roughly 400 students, at
the most, were admitted, the
doors were closed.
On the information of ushers
at the side doors, the auditorium
was "full."
According to The Daily, admis
sion was open to faculty admin
istration and students ONLY.
Who was there ahead of us? Cer
tainly not faculty members, who
stood in line with students.
We speak for many people who
had to stand in a motionless line
for well over an hour, missing
classes, etc., when they had every
reason to believe that there
would be a fair admission policy.
We are ashamed of Stanford.

• Not Berkeley
Editor, The Daily:
The student walkout was not
very massive, but, as the Vice-
President candidly remarked,
this isn't Berkeley. The silent
vigil of the Faculty, on the other
hand, was a huge success, for
nobody heard them. The Orator
and his audience of trained seals
carried the day as expected, the
black limousine slipped away,
and normal life resumed. De
spite rumors that Humphrey
had sidestepped some questions,
most students ignored the rally
afterwards. No doubt they had
to study to make for time lost

educational process must ro on
somehow, even if this isn't Ber

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

• Theta What?
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding some of the inac
curacies of the Subcommittee
report on Fraternity housing: if
it's not Theta Chi, and it's not
Theta Xi, then who is it? Might
I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter
and editor's comment, Daily,
Feb. 17) actually apply to Tau

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-

Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts

to be fraternities at Stanford.

received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal
fee asked Joel Kugelmass (be
cause of his ability to write
clearly and concisely) to write
this section. After Mr. Kugel
mass had done this, Mr. Calfee
showed the conclusions to as
many sub-committee members
as possible (given the stringent
time deadline that we were all
working particularly
those subcommittee members
who had objections to the origi
nal draft. (Mr. Smith, Mr. Pugh,
and Mr. Hakken had all raised
questions about certain parts of
the first draft. They drew up
changes and corrections which
were then inserted almost ver
batim.) Mr. Smith raised several
objections to the conclusions and
then wrote a three page set of
his own conclusions. These
pages were, however, very simi
lar to the original draft, and for
stylistic reasons rather than rea
sons of content we decided to
include the original draft of the
conclusions in a slightly altered
form. There is nothing in the
conclusions that is not based on
the preceding pages of the re
port.
There is one matter of pro
cedure that has produced unfor
tunate consequences. The names
listed after each sub-committee
report were listed largely as
acknowledgement for work per
formed for the committee. In no
case other than the fraternity
sub-committee report did the
problem arise of a specific mem
ber of a sub-committee who ob
jected to the final report. Hence,
once the fraternity sub-commit
tee report was accepted by a
majority of that committee, the
other names (even those of
members who had not been able
to see the final report: Mr. Car
peneti, who was at a debate
tournament at Harvard, Mr.
Katz who is overseas, Mr. Mor
rison who did not come to Mr.
Calfee's room on Sunday eve
ning, and Mr. Lucero, (who is
presumably still in the library)
were listed as acknowledgement
for services given to the Hous
ing Commission.
Once again we regret that the
community has not understood
the context within which the
fraternity sub-committee inves
tigated the fraternity system.
Even Mr. Pugh and Mr. Car
peneti. whose criticisms have
risen the petty polemic that has
characterized most of the letters

here. We do not deny that some
elements in fraternites are work
ing for change and reform, but
it is our feeling that this is a
virtually fruitless endeavor. The
system will never be sufficiently
changed from within to render
it of educational value to the
University. The change will
come only when we as students,
join together to create a new

tion at Stanford. The Grove

The Wilbur Experiment can be

and only then will the fraternity
controversy fade into the back
ground where it belongs.

• Passive?
Editor. The Dally:
I rofer to Mr. Harris' polemic
on the Packer Committee.
Instead of expounding the
platitudes of protest, laced with
the four letter words that
the modern excuse for muddled
thought, I suggest that it is
timo that the President of the
Student Body stopped to con
sider the means bv which some
of his ideas might be imple
mented; though in doin? this
I would urge him to realize that
a vocal minority does not al
ways represent a majority opin
ion.
To say that he cannot change
the University by himself Is to
morelv state the obvious, and
this state of affairs will continue
unless he can show some execu
tive ability, and provide a small
measure of positive leadership.
Instead of hurling epithets at
the students who have been se
lected to serve on the Packer
Committee, I hope that he will
now join me by leading the gen
eral rejoicing that Stanford is
fortunate enough to have such
talented people, willing to make
the undoubted sacrifices neces
sary to ensure that the educa
tion offered to future genera
tions of students will be the
best that can be devised, and
implemented, at this time.
If he feels that these members
of the Committee are not fully
conversant with the differing
views on Education that prevail
within the Student Body, then he
should make arrangements for
meetings to be held so that these
various ideas may be exchanged
and developed; this would be a
more constructive endeavour
than organizing a negative pro
test against their selection and
acceptance to serve.
To criticize constructively in
volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

Regarding some of the inac

report on Fraternity housing: if
it's not Theta Chi, and it's not
Theta Xi, then who is it? Might
I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter
and editor's comment, Daily,
Feb. 17) actually apply to Tau

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-
Ebbing.
Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts
a steak dinner for shaving Dave
Harris's head, there are likely
to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil
ler for offering to share his per
fume with all of us. It was a
display of generosity of which
all fraternity men can be proud.

• Sick
Editor, The Daily:
The Graduate School of Busi

thing that costs $5.5 million
should be beautiful. But the peo
ple inside it are sick and diseased
—and that makes them ugly.
They are also dangerous, be

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci
sion Making Theory, Price
Theory, and all that other dog
gerel. They're always poring
through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland
Stanford.
Watch out, America. They're
all around us. The Graduate
School of Business should be
quarantined—or, if necessary,
destroyed—before it's too late.

• Critique
Editor. The Daily:
As fall president of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, I was interviewed by
Chuck Katz and Stan Shore for
the fraternity subcommittee of
the A.S.S.U. Housing Commis
sion. The thoroughness and ob
jectivity of approximately 100
standardized questions was im
pressive. After one and a half
hours, we were satisfied that
adequate, accurate information
had been obtained.
Reading the text of the report
in the Daily of February 15, I
was amazed to find that of the
four times the Phi Kap house
was mentioned specifically, only
one was a result of the commit
tee interview. Two of the other
three are not in harmony with
our general practices and ma
jority opinion. The third was In
adequately presented.
It is difficult to believe, con
sidering the committee's pro
fessed educational goals, that its
final presentation is a construc
tive evaluation. Though specific
ally concerned about distortion
of a particular house, the above
discrepancies cause me to ques
tion if "report" is not a mis
nomer for "critique."

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.
GREG KOWAL
Phi Delta Theta
In prefacing a reply to the
many inaccurate charges
brought against the report of
the fraternity sub-committee, our
first reaction is one of dismay
that this issue has overshad
owed the more important work
of other sub-committees of
the Housing Commission, in
particular that of the freshman
year sub-committee. The Dally
editorial on Friday made this
point. The work of the fraterni
ty sub-committee was important
and continues to stand on its
own merits; however, the Hous
ing Commission has taken a dif
ferent path than others in the
past who have criticized the
residence system at Stanford—
for we have posited an alterna
tive to the present system. We
place the highest priority on the
Wilbur Experiment and we feel
the present controversy over
fraternities and the inner work
ings of the fraternity subcom
mittee to be totally separate
from this proposal.
We would first make a gen
eral comment on the many re
plies charging that the fraterni
ty sub-committee report was
"biased" or "negative" in orien
tation against the fraternity sys
tem. If the fraternity men who
so hastily responded to the re
port had bothered to read the
first section of the Commission
report, they would have under
stood this "bias" or "negative"
approach. The entire Housing
Commission study was conduct
ed with a single question in
mind: does the Residence Sys
tem fulfill the obligation to
carry education from the class
room, the lecture hall, and the
library, to the residence hall?
(And education here is, of
course, defined very broadly—
as it was in the section on "The
Philosophy of the Residence
University".) From, this point of
view, and we felt it the most
important criterion from which
to judge Stanford's residence
system (after all, this is a uni
versity and not a country club),
we found very few positive
points in the fraternity system.
In fact we truly felt that more
than any other living group sys
tem presently existing at Stan
ford, the fraternities were re
sponsible for the dichotomy be
tween classroom work and stud
ies, and social or personal life.
The fraternity was seen as a
refuge from intellectual endeav
or. Further, the selective sys
tem employed by fraternities in
choosing membership seemed
antithetical to the very process
of education — a process depen
dent upon meeting and being
challenged by as broad a selec
tion of people as possible. To
live in a fraternity was seen as
an extremely limiting experi
ence from the point of view of
education. The fraternity selects
its new members on an exceed
ingly superficial basis: whether
or not the prospective pledge

conforms to the modes of
thought and behavior of the par
ticular house (euphemistically
phrased, "what the pledge can
contribute to the house"). We
felt this to be in total opposi
tion to the educational aims of
the University. For this reason
the sub-committee report may
seem predominantly negative—
but again this was because we
found little that was positive in
the fraternity system, and that
those elements in each house
that might be working for
change or reform are being
stifled by a hard core of fra
ternity men who wish to retain
the idea that their house should
be a "refuge" from the academ
ic community, in short who wish
to perpetuate the senseless divi
sion between what one learns in
the lecture hall or seminar room
and how one leads one's person
al life. But we are not so much
launching a broadside attack on
the fraternity system, as we are
criticizing the entire residence
system at Stanford.
There are several questions
about the work of the fraternity
sub-committee to which we must
reply. The first are the irrespon
sible charges of Mr. Lucero and
Mr. Smith. Healthy controversy
is the very life of the democrat
ic process, but distortion of facts
perverts that process and cannot
be tolerated.
Mr. Lucero charges that he
received the postcard informing
him of the final meeting of the
sub-committee a day late, and
that he never had a chance to
read the report before it was
published in the Daily. Both of
those statements are untrue. Mr.
Calfee mailed the postcards an
nouncing a Sunday meeting the
previous Friday, and all the
other sub-committee members
received the notice on Saturday.
Eleven members attended the
Sunday meeting and those who
did not attend informed us as to
the reasons why they could not.
We submit that it was negli
gence on Mr. Lucero's part that
leads him to charge he received
the notification a day late. At the
Sunday meeting Mr. Calfee stat
ed that the draft report would
be available for all sub-commit
tee members to examine that
night from 9:00 P.M. to 2:00
A.M. When we called Mr. Lu
cero to advise him of this we
were informed that he was
studying in the library. We
asked that the message concern
ing the sub-committee report be
relayed to him, but as he did
not come to Mr. Calfee's room
to examine and revise the re
port, we assumed he was no
longer interested in the work of
the sub-committee.
Mr. Smith's charges relate to
the section entitled "Some Con
clusions and Proposals." After
Mr. Calfee had submitted the fi
nal draft of the report to us, as
editors, we felt that the report
stated factual evidence but

failed to mention any specific
conclusions. Therefore, Mr. Cal

volves more than just protest, it
implies the suggestion of a vi
able alternative, and, by way of
example, to go round a wall is
usually easier and more produc
tive than going through it.
So, in conclusion, may I sug
gest that being a "Students'
Representative" is not necessari
ly a better occupation than be
ing an "Administration Errand
Boy", both are passive roles in
what should be an active con
tribution to the corporate life of
the University.

• Theta What?
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding some of the inac
curacies of the Subcommittee
report on Fraternity housing: if
it's not Theta Chi, and it's not
Theta Xi, then who is it? Might
I suggest that the committee
take a little more time and care
in its evaluations? Of course,
this would require the extra
burden of going into the various
fraternities instead of standing
outside their front doors and
throwing barbs. But it might be
worth it.
Perhaps some of the points
in question (Bill Stone's letter
and editor's comment, Daily,
Feb. 17) actually apply to Tau
Kappa Epsilon.
Top that one.

• Paranoia
Editor, The Daily:
With the approach of frater
nity rush this year has come,
once more, the anti-social, anti
entertainment rush. As always,
the cry has been raised that
the fraternal community at
Stanford stands as perhaps the
most heinous harrier to enlight
enment and knowledge ever to
confront humanity.
This alarm would seem, at
first glance, to be somewhat
exaggerated. By the University's
own admission, there is much
more to the college experience
than studying, and a condemna
tion of the fraternity system
because "no house reported ed
ucational or academic tradi
tions" expose' a rather narrow
viewpoint.
Stanford University abounds
with academic and intellectual

organizations capable of accom
modating all those who wish to
make use of their facilities. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, pur
port only to be selectively deter
mined living groups, capable of
providing the individual with a
social environment of his own
choosing and social opportuni
ties of which he may make as
much or as little use as he de
sires. There is no necessary
dichotomy between "entertain
ment and education."
Let us not, then, confuse a
commendable zeal for intellec
tual endeavor with a desire for
asceticism to which not every
one subscribes.

• Fun In The Sun
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled by the viclous
ness of Clay Miller's column in
Tuesday's Daily, though basical
ly his reaction was not surpris
ing. Fraternities have good
grounds for fearing the attacks
of ... I think he called them
"meddlesome cranks," among
other things less pleasant.
But if Mr. Miller would ex
amine the excellent article in
The Daily on the fraternity sub
committee report to the Hous
ing Commission, which ap
peared the same day as his col
umn, he might be amused to
find that a majority of that sub
committee were fraternity mem
bers.
Mr. Miller's accusations of
paranoia display distinct lean
ings toward paranoia. But let
us not ponder too deeply the
psychological implications of all
our acts. We do not want in
this case to unduly embarrass
the fraternities whose paddling,
or "hacking," of pledges during
Hell Week would surely have
raised the eyebrows of Krafft-
Ebbing.
Clay Miller and his fraternity
friends should find comfort,
however, with the thought that
as long as there are alumni
around who will give the Delts
a steak dinner for shaving Dave
Harris's head, there are likely
to be fraternities at Stanford.
Finally, may I thank Mr. Mil
ler for offering to share his per
fume with all of us. It was a
display of generosity of which
all fraternity men can be proud.

• Parallel?
Editor, The Daily:
The same faults inherent in
the fraternity system have be on
corrected by businesses and edu
cational groups as evidenced in
the following headlines:
IMB abolishes selective ap
pointment and recruitment prac
tices.
Stanford abolishes selective ad
mission and institutes draw sys
tem.
President Johnson has called
for an immediate investigation
into "National Library Week" if
not by each local librarian, then
by the Attorney General.
Report from Harvard Academ
ic Office: "Kennedy is a good
man, not academic enough."
Catholics abolish one-week
Confirmation period; it tends to
unify the group.
The President's report asks
that a review board be estab
lished which would decide with
in the next three years whether
each state should be allowed to
remain in the Union. The deci
sion shall be based upon "per
formance."

• Sick
Editor, The Daily:
The Graduate School of Busi
ness is a beautiful building. Any
thing that costs $5.5 million
should be beautiful. But the peo
ple inside it are sick and diseased
—and that makes them ugly.
They are also dangerous, be

cause they do not have any idea
what business is all about—and
they won't, no matter how many
years they spend studying Deci
sion Making Theory, Price
Theory, and all that other dog
gerel. They're always poring
through their thick books trying
to find more justifications for sit
ting on their calloused hind ends
in reclining chairs with their feet
propped on their desks. Babbitts!
It's sick, sick, sick, SICK. If
the present trend continues, we
are going to have a business
world full of managers, but no
salesman. We're going to have
more products than Mankind has
ever dreamed of—and on one to
sell them, no one to keep the
economy moving. Picture it, un
told millions of managers shout
ing orders—and no one to carry
them out. Sickness. Business was
not sick in the days of Gould,
Rockefeller, and our boy Leland
Stanford.
Watch out, America. They're
all around us. The Graduate
School of Business should be
quarantined—or, if necessary,
destroyed—before it's too late.

• Critique
Editor. The Daily:
As fall president of Phi Kap
pa Sigma, I was interviewed by
Chuck Katz and Stan Shore for
the fraternity subcommittee of
the A.S.S.U. Housing Commis
sion. The thoroughness and ob
jectivity of approximately 100
standardized questions was im
pressive. After one and a half
hours, we were satisfied that
adequate, accurate information
had been obtained.
Reading the text of the report
in the Daily of February 15, I
was amazed to find that of the
four times the Phi Kap house
was mentioned specifically, only
one was a result of the commit
tee interview. Two of the other
three are not in harmony with
our general practices and ma
jority opinion. The third was In
adequately presented.
It is difficult to believe, con
sidering the committee's pro
fessed educational goals, that its
final presentation is a construc
tive evaluation. Though specific
ally concerned about distortion
of a particular house, the above
discrepancies cause me to ques
tion if "report" is not a mis
nomer for "critique."

• No Spirit
Editor, The Dally:
As a member of a fraternity
at Stanford University, I feel
deeply discouraged and humili
ated by the recent publicity
about our fraternity system. It
seems to me, however, that this
is just a byproduct of a larger
movement whose desire is to
change Stanford into a commu
nity of 10,000 individuals, each
whose autonomy is pre-eminent
to the point of zero social cohe
sion between students.
Happily for some, they are al
ready well on their way. Past
achievements include: the dis
banding of sororities, the prac
tical elimination of school spirit,
and the annual isolation of one
thousand freshman boys into a
social purgatory they call Wil
bur.
Notable achievements of this
year include booing the cheer
leaders and the elimination of a
homecoming queen.
Long range objectives no
doubt include banning collegiate
athletics, the Stanford band, and
any other group which dares
show this internal solidarity;
fraternities included. When this
day comes, the blue, brown, gray
and black army can march to
the Farm each day with little
fear of being affronted by a
friendly smile from an unsus
pecting freshman, or by a pris
oner of that "institutionalized
paranoia" they call a fraternity.
Hopefully, I won't be here to
witness it.
