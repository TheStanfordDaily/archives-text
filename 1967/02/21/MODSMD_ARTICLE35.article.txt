## 4 Tragedy Of Entombed Spirit 
### Paul Rupert 
Yesterday, Hubert Humphrey
came to campus amid the de
bate between those who favored
walking out and the faculty peo
ple who reminded the commu
nity of the courtesy it owed a
high official. In the auditorium
we heard the Honorable Hubert
H. Humphrey tell us that Pope
John was one of the "now peo
ple", that John Kennedy ("Pres
ident Ken—the late beloved
President Kennedy") would be
doing the same thing that Presi
dent Johnson is doing, and that
he Mr. Humphrey was, is, and
always will be a bona-fide lib
eral. Upon his remarks about
the academic community many
people walked out. While many
had planned such a move, I—
among others—left ready to cry,
unable to sit through any more
of that speech.
The charge that will be lev
elled was that those people
failed to afford the vice-presi
dent proper courtesy. Courtesy
is defined in Webster's as "gen
eral allowance despite facts"
and it is, as we all know a Chris
tian virtue and a cornerstone of
the democratic way. It could,

however, in light of the way Mr.
Humphrey played pimp (Web
ster's: someone who caters to or
exploits the weakness of others)
with the minds of his audience,
be considered a gross hypocrisy
to sit in the audience and en
dure the contemptuous delivery
of a man who was asked ques
tions and failed to give any di
rect answer. To a member of
the community who has thus
far obeyed the command of
courtesy in asking questions
(and little else) of the United
States'•,policy in Vietnam, to
walk out was an honest answer,
born of frustration and anger at
the insipid betrayal we were ex
pected to sit through.
Over the weekend I had read
a book by Karl Jaspers called
The Question of German Guilt
which was an assessment of the
political and moral responsibili
ty of the German citizenry
which allowed, or perhaps suf
fered, the rise of the Nazi state.
I was afraid, when asked to
write a speech for the post-
Humphrey rally, to exploit the
comparison with our dilemma
today, which suggested itself.

After some thought, I dared a
comparison of the failure of the
German resistance to endure, of
the intellectual elite to speak
out with maximum effectiveness,
and of the citizenry and power
groups at large to hesitate In
applying their power and con
sciences to the soon obvious
atrocities of the regime. The
central contention was that one
must in fact sharpen his con
sciousness, conscience, and will
to resist if he is to call himself
a citizen in general, and an in
tellectual in particular.
My concluding paragraph was
as follows:
"I wish to mention the story
which Jaspers tells of the Ger
man immigrant in New York,
who quite paradoxically has a
picture of Hitler on his wall.
The reason is simply that he
could not endure the voluntary
exile without the constant re
minder of the horror that had
befallen his nation. If you or I
were to go to Canada, to go to
jail, or to launch an attack
against a single point, what
would we choose? Should we
picture a person, an administra

tion, the Pentagon, the whole
nation? What is it we are fight
ing? Perhaps it is only after we
have asked ourselves that ques
tion and in some way answered
it to our satisfaction that we
can act most effectively. In
many ways our task is more
complex and our danger far
subtler: certainly we do not live
i"n fear of our lives but only in
constant and increasing danger
of immoral and irresponsible
resignation."
On leaving I became aware of
the fact that I could now under
stand someone leaving the
United States, and living as an
emmigrant in Toronto with a
picture of the Honorable H. H.
Humphrey over his bed.
I would end with three state
ments from Jaspers.
"To do one's duty to the fa
therland means to commit one's
whole person to the highest de
mands made on us by the best
of our ancestors, not by the
idols of a false tradition . .
"The morally guilty are those
who are capable of penance, the
ones who knew, or could know,
and yet walked in ways which
self-analysis reveals to them as
culpable error — whether con
veniently closing their eyes to
events, or permitting themselves
to be intoxicated, seduced or
bought with personal advan
tages, or obeying from fear . . ."
"A professor speaks: 'We are
the Fronde within the party. We
dare frank discussion. We
achieve spiritual realizations.
We shall slowly turn all of it
back into the old German spiri
tuality.'—Answer: 'You are de
ceiving yourselves. Allowed a
fool's freedom, on condition of
instant obedience, you shut up
and give in. Your fight is a mi
rage, desired by the leaders.
You only help to entomb the
German spirit.' "
Perhaps, as Anouilh says, in
the face of a pure tragedy, the
trapped has no alternative but
to shout.

and it is, as we all know a Chris
tian virtue and a cornerstone of
the democratic way. It could,

however, in light of the way Mr.
Humphrey played pimp (Web
ster's: someone who caters to or
exploits the weakness of others)
with the minds of his audience,
be considered a gross hypocrisy
to sit in the audience and en
dure the contemptuous delivery
of a man who was asked ques
tions and failed to give any di
rect answer. To a member of
the community who has thus
far obeyed the command of
courtesy in asking questions
(and little else) of the United
States'•,policy in Vietnam, to
walk out was an honest answer,
born of frustration and anger at
the insipid betrayal we were ex
pected to sit through.
Over the weekend I had read
a book by Karl Jaspers called
The Question of German Guilt
which was an assessment of the
political and moral responsibili
ty of the German citizenry
which allowed, or perhaps suf
fered, the rise of the Nazi state.
I was afraid, when asked to
write a speech for the post-
Humphrey rally, to exploit the
comparison with our dilemma
today, which suggested itself.

After some thought, I dared a
comparison of the failure of the
German resistance to endure, of
the intellectual elite to speak
out with maximum effectiveness,
and of the citizenry and power
groups at large to hesitate In
applying their power and con
sciences to the soon obvious
atrocities of the regime. The
central contention was that one
must in fact sharpen his con
sciousness, conscience, and will
to resist if he is to call himself
a citizen in general, and an in
tellectual in particular.
My concluding paragraph was
as follows:
"I wish to mention the story
which Jaspers tells of the Ger
man immigrant in New York,
who quite paradoxically has a
picture of Hitler on his wall.
The reason is simply that he
could not endure the voluntary
exile without the constant re
minder of the horror that had
befallen his nation. If you or I
were to go to Canada, to go to
jail, or to launch an attack
against a single point, what
would we choose? Should we
picture a person, an administra

tion, the Pentagon, the whole
nation? What is it we are fight
ing? Perhaps it is only after we
have asked ourselves that ques
tion and in some way answered
it to our satisfaction that we
can act most effectively. In
many ways our task is more
complex and our danger far
subtler: certainly we do not live
i"n fear of our lives but only in
constant and increasing danger
of immoral and irresponsible
resignation."
On leaving I became aware of
the fact that I could now under
stand someone leaving the
United States, and living as an
emmigrant in Toronto with a
picture of the Honorable H. H.
Humphrey over his bed.
I would end with three state
ments from Jaspers.
"To do one's duty to the fa
therland means to commit one's
whole person to the highest de
mands made on us by the best
of our ancestors, not by the
idols of a false tradition . .
"The morally guilty are those
who are capable of penance, the
ones who knew, or could know,
and yet walked in ways which
self-analysis reveals to them as
culpable error — whether con
veniently closing their eyes to
events, or permitting themselves
to be intoxicated, seduced or
bought with personal advan
tages, or obeying from fear . . ."
"A professor speaks: 'We are
the Fronde within the party. We
dare frank discussion. We
achieve spiritual realizations.
We shall slowly turn all of it
back into the old German spiri
tuality.'—Answer: 'You are de
ceiving yourselves. Allowed a
fool's freedom, on condition of
instant obedience, you shut up
and give in. Your fight is a mi
rage, desired by the leaders.
You only help to entomb the
German spirit.' "
Perhaps, as Anouilh says, in
the face of a pure tragedy, the
trapped has no alternative but
to shout.
Yesterday, Hubert Humphrey
came to campus amid the de
bate between those who favored
walking out and the faculty peo
ple who reminded the commu
nity of the courtesy it owed a
high official. In the auditorium
we heard the Honorable Hubert
H. Humphrey tell us that Pope
John was one of the "now peo
ple", that John Kennedy ("Pres
ident Ken—the late beloved
President Kennedy") would be
doing the same thing that Presi
dent Johnson is doing, and that
he Mr. Humphrey was, is, and
always will be a bona-fide lib
eral. Upon his remarks about
the academic community many
people walked out. While many
had planned such a move, I—
among others—left ready to cry,
unable to sit through any more
of that speech.
The charge that will be lev
elled was that those people
failed to afford the vice-presi
dent proper courtesy. Courtesy

fered, the rise of the Nazi state.
I was afraid, when asked to
write a speech for the post-
Humphrey rally, to exploit the
comparison with our dilemma
today, which suggested itself.

After some thought, I dared a
comparison of the failure of the
German resistance to endure, of
the intellectual elite to speak
out with maximum effectiveness,
and of the citizenry and power
groups at large to hesitate In
applying their power and con
sciences to the soon obvious
atrocities of the regime. The
central contention was that one
must in fact sharpen his con
sciousness, conscience, and will
to resist if he is to call himself
a citizen in general, and an in
tellectual in particular.
My concluding paragraph was
as follows:
"I wish to mention the story
which Jaspers tells of the Ger
man immigrant in New York,
who quite paradoxically has a
picture of Hitler on his wall.
The reason is simply that he
could not endure the voluntary
exile without the constant re
minder of the horror that had
befallen his nation. If you or I
were to go to Canada, to go to
jail, or to launch an attack
against a single point, what
would we choose? Should we
picture a person, an administra

tion, the Pentagon, the whole
nation? What is it we are fight
ing? Perhaps it is only after we
have asked ourselves that ques
tion and in some way answered
it to our satisfaction that we
can act most effectively. In
many ways our task is more
complex and our danger far
subtler: certainly we do not live
i"n fear of our lives but only in
constant and increasing danger
of immoral and irresponsible
resignation."
On leaving I became aware of
the fact that I could now under
stand someone leaving the
United States, and living as an
emmigrant in Toronto with a
picture of the Honorable H. H.
Humphrey over his bed.
I would end with three state
ments from Jaspers.
"To do one's duty to the fa
therland means to commit one's
whole person to the highest de
mands made on us by the best
of our ancestors, not by the
idols of a false tradition . .
"The morally guilty are those
who are capable of penance, the
ones who knew, or could know,
and yet walked in ways which
self-analysis reveals to them as
culpable error — whether con
veniently closing their eyes to
events, or permitting themselves
to be intoxicated, seduced or
bought with personal advan
tages, or obeying from fear . . ."
"A professor speaks: 'We are
the Fronde within the party. We
dare frank discussion. We
achieve spiritual realizations.
We shall slowly turn all of it
back into the old German spiri
tuality.'—Answer: 'You are de
ceiving yourselves. Allowed a
fool's freedom, on condition of
instant obedience, you shut up
and give in. Your fight is a mi
rage, desired by the leaders.
You only help to entomb the
German spirit.' "
Perhaps, as Anouilh says, in
the face of a pure tragedy, the
trapped has no alternative but
to shout.
Yesterday, Hubert Humphrey
came to campus amid the de
bate between those who favored
walking out and the faculty peo
ple who reminded the commu
nity of the courtesy it owed a
high official. In the auditorium
we heard the Honorable Hubert
H. Humphrey tell us that Pope
John was one of the "now peo
ple", that John Kennedy ("Pres
ident Ken—the late beloved
President Kennedy") would be
doing the same thing that Presi
dent Johnson is doing, and that
he Mr. Humphrey was, is, and
always will be a bona-fide lib
eral. Upon his remarks about
the academic community many
people walked out. While many
had planned such a move, I—
among others—left ready to cry,
unable to sit through any more
of that speech.
The charge that will be lev
elled was that those people
failed to afford the vice-presi
dent proper courtesy. Courtesy
is defined in Webster's as "gen
eral allowance despite facts"
and it is, as we all know a Chris
tian virtue and a cornerstone of
the democratic way. It could,

however, in light of the way Mr.
Humphrey played pimp (Web
ster's: someone who caters to or
exploits the weakness of others)
with the minds of his audience,
be considered a gross hypocrisy
to sit in the audience and en
dure the contemptuous delivery
of a man who was asked ques
tions and failed to give any di
rect answer. To a member of
the community who has thus
far obeyed the command of
courtesy in asking questions
(and little else) of the United
States'•,policy in Vietnam, to
walk out was an honest answer,
born of frustration and anger at
the insipid betrayal we were ex
pected to sit through.
Over the weekend I had read
a book by Karl Jaspers called
The Question of German Guilt
which was an assessment of the
political and moral responsibili
ty of the German citizenry
which allowed, or perhaps suf
fered, the rise of the Nazi state.
