# Chaos Reigns In Secret Service Over Humphrey Security Measures
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily 
"The Vice-President has left? . . .
You mean we were just a decoy? . . .
Why you lousy . . Just goes to show
even a Secret Service agent is human.
With all the security in the world
surrounding Hubert Humphrey yes
terday, the Secret Service and the po
lice couldn't stop people from being
people, including themselves.
Just at the moment of greatest con
fusion about where and when Hum
phrey would leave Memorial Audito
rium, a teenage girl emerged from
the crowd and walked up to one of
the exits without being questioned or
stopped. She approached a harried
Secret Service agent and asked, "Do
you think I could get an autograph?"
He just looked at her in disbelief.
Security Organization
The day had begun, however, on a
more organized and efficient note.

Sound crews pulled up to Memorial
Auditorium a little after 7 a.m. and
were soon followed by early newsmen
and Secret Service agents. By 9 o'clock
the auditorium was full of police and
agents. Their job was to secure the
building and keep it that way.
The Vice-President arrived at 10:30
and met for 40 minutes with people
from the Food Research Institute. Af
ter this he talked with panel members
for a few minutes and then sat down
to read his statement.
Humphrey then walked on stage
and for the next hour talked and an
swered questions. It was during this
time that the Secret Service and the
police really moved into action.
Exit Problems
They observed that large crowds
were beginning to form around the
exits and they faced the problem of
how to get the Vice-President out of
the building with least risk. For the
following hour they rushed from exit
to exit checking the situation and get
ting more worried with each trip.
Humphrey concluded his talk and
all but agents and police were asked
to leave the building. A few minutes
later a completely unauthorized per
son walked through the police lines,
through the agents, and went about
his business in an office. When asked
how he could let him in, one police
man responded, "What harm can a
guy in a turtle neck and sun glasses
do?"
After great confusion, when maybe
two people knew where the Vice-
President was headed (and he wasn't
one of them) the Service finally got
him out and into his car.
Some in the crowds saw him leave,
but many did not. As one agent in the
decoy said disgustedly, "They were as
stupid as we were."

all but agents and police were asked
to leave the building. A few minutes
later a completely unauthorized per
son walked through the police lines,
through the agents, and went about
his business in an office. When asked
how he could let him in, one police
man responded, "What harm can a
guy in a turtle neck and sun glasses
do?"
After great confusion, when maybe
two people knew where the Vice-
President was headed (and he wasn't
one of them) the Service finally got
him out and into his car.
Some in the crowds saw him leave,
but many did not. As one agent in the
decoy said disgustedly, "They were as
stupid as we were."
"The Vice-President has left? . . .
You mean we were just a decoy? . . .
Why you lousy . . Just goes to show
even a Secret Service agent is human.
With all the security in the world
surrounding Hubert Humphrey yes
terday, the Secret Service and the po
lice couldn't stop people from being
people, including themselves.
Just at the moment of greatest con
fusion about where and when Hum
phrey would leave Memorial Audito
rium, a teenage girl emerged from
the crowd and walked up to one of
the exits without being questioned or
stopped. She approached a harried
Secret Service agent and asked, "Do
you think I could get an autograph?"
He just looked at her in disbelief.
Security Organization
The day had begun, however, on a
more organized and efficient note.

Sound crews pulled up to Memorial
Auditorium a little after 7 a.m. and
were soon followed by early newsmen
and Secret Service agents. By 9 o'clock
the auditorium was full of police and
agents. Their job was to secure the
building and keep it that way.
The Vice-President arrived at 10:30
and met for 40 minutes with people
from the Food Research Institute. Af
ter this he talked with panel members
for a few minutes and then sat down
to read his statement.
Humphrey then walked on stage
and for the next hour talked and an
swered questions. It was during this
time that the Secret Service and the
police really moved into action.
Exit Problems
They observed that large crowds
were beginning to form around the
exits and they faced the problem of
how to get the Vice-President out of
the building with least risk. For the
following hour they rushed from exit
to exit checking the situation and get
ting more worried with each trip.
Humphrey concluded his talk and
all but agents and police were asked
to leave the building. A few minutes
