# Housing Report Due For Scrutiny; Frats Dissent, Deans 'Impressed'
## 
### 
The report of the ASSU Housing
Commission, made public last week,
will this week appear before several
campus committees which presum
ably will discuss the proposals it con
tained concerning fraternities, Stern
Hall and women's housing.
So far it has evoked no apparent
action from any quarter, except for
numerous letters to The Daily.
Dean of Students Joel Smith indi
cated he and Provost Richard Lyman
"will be meeting with the full com
mission as promptly as possible."
Smith added that he was "very im
pressed indeed' with the report.
Assistant Dean of Students John
Hanson told The Daily the Interfra
ternity Board, composed of students
and faculty, will be meeting this week
and he expects it will ask the Housing
Commission for full specific details
on reported rush and hell week acti
vities.
IFC Awaits Investigation
The head of the Interfraternity
Council, Drennon Jones, said his
group will be taking no action until
The IFC investigating committee
committee is released. This commit
tee was formed last October and, ac
cording to Jones, has been interview
ing six to eight men in every house
for an average of two hours each.
Jones said the committee was start
ing from a slightly different premise
than the ASSU subcommittee. "Their
definition of education excluded fra
ternities," he said.
The contents of the IFC report will
not be released in part until the re
port is fully completed in about a
week and a half, according to Jones.
It is expected that the entire work,
including the individual interviews,
will be published.
The IFC investigating committee
is composed entirely of active frater
nity members. The finished report will
be made available to the Dean's office
and ASSU.
Frat Reaction Critic al
The fraternity subcommittee report
has stirred up considerable reaction
from many fraternities, mostly criti
cal of the report, which in turn had

been quite critical of many frater
nities.
Martin Gerry of the Judicial Coun
cil said that his group had no specific
incidents or charges on which to act,
concerning the charges against fra
ternities contained in the Commission
report. Therefore, he said, he foresees
no immediate action against any fra
ternities by the Judicial Council.
ASSU President David Harris told
The Daily, "My worries are that it'll
be referred to the Packer Committee

so that it's work will be duplicated.
They'll just come out with another
report. There's no point in that."
> A proposal to make the ASSU
Housing Commission a permanent
body will be brought up at LASSU's
next meeting, according to Speaker
Tom Forstenzer. He also said LASSU
will probably vote on resolutions urg
ing the University administration to
adopt the commission's programs and
suggestions for changes in under
graduate housing.

The contents of the IFC report will
not be released in part until the re
port is fully completed in about a
week and a half, according to Jones.
It is expected that the entire work,
including the individual interviews,
will be published.
The IFC investigating committee
is composed entirely of active frater

be made available to the Dean's office
and ASSU.
Frat Reaction Critic al
The fraternity subcommittee report
has stirred up considerable reaction
from many fraternities, mostly criti
cal of the report, which in turn had

been quite critical of many frater
nities.
Martin Gerry of the Judicial Coun
cil said that his group had no specific
incidents or charges on which to act,
concerning the charges against fra
ternities contained in the Commission
report. Therefore, he said, he foresees
no immediate action against any fra
ternities by the Judicial Council.
ASSU President David Harris told
The Daily, "My worries are that it'll
be referred to the Packer Committee

so that it's work will be duplicated.
They'll just come out with another
report. There's no point in that."
> A proposal to make the ASSU
Housing Commission a permanent
body will be brought up at LASSU's
next meeting, according to Speaker
Tom Forstenzer. He also said LASSU
will probably vote on resolutions urg
ing the University administration to
adopt the commission's programs and
suggestions for changes in under
graduate housing.
The report of the ASSU Housing
Commission, made public last week,
will this week appear before several
campus committees which presum
ably will discuss the proposals it con
tained concerning fraternities, Stern
Hall and women's housing.
So far it has evoked no apparent
action from any quarter, except for
numerous letters to The Daily.
Dean of Students Joel Smith indi
cated he and Provost Richard Lyman
"will be meeting with the full com
mission as promptly as possible."
Smith added that he was "very im
pressed indeed' with the report.
Assistant Dean of Students John
Hanson told The Daily the Interfra
ternity Board, composed of students
and faculty, will be meeting this week
and he expects it will ask the Housing
Commission for full specific details
on reported rush and hell week acti
vities.
IFC Awaits Investigation
The head of the Interfraternity
Council, Drennon Jones, said his
group will be taking no action until
The IFC investigating committee
committee is released. This commit
tee was formed last October and, ac
cording to Jones, has been interview
ing six to eight men in every house
for an average of two hours each.
Jones said the committee was start
ing from a slightly different premise
than the ASSU subcommittee. "Their
definition of education excluded fra
