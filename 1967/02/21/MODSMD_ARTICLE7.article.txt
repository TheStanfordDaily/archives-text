Faculty members opposing the war
registered disappointment at the "in
effectiveness" of yesterday's protest
during the Vice President Hubert Hum
phrey's appearance. But they also ex
pressed hope that members of the
Stanford community would continue
to express concern over the war.
Contacted late yesterday, Dean of
the Chapel B. Davie Napier, Prof.
Michael Novak, Prof. Robert McAfee
Brown and Prof. Lucio P. Ruotolo
commented on yesterday's protest.
Novak called the protest "ecumeni
cal" since there was an effort on the
part of organizers of both the walk-out
and the silent protest to encourage par
ticipation from persons with a broad
range of reasons for objection to the
war.
New Broader Spectrum
Ruotolo commented that the protest
exemplified a "greater effort to unify"
elements of concern. He said that some
people were reluctant to express their
opposition to the war for fear of being
associated with particular individuals
also opposing the war. But he indicated
that the opposition now covers a broad
er spectrum than recognized by Hum
phrey and other government officials.
All of these faculty members felt
the Vice President avoided the real
substance of the questions asked and
misinterpreted the applause and ap

parent support of the audience. They
also discredited Humphrey's statement
that he believed most members of the
academic community to support the
administration's policies.
"How could he give a prepared talk
to a student group and not mention
Vietnam?" said Prof. Brown in regard
to Humphery's opening remarks. "He
failed to come to grips with the sit
uation ... his statement showed a tre
mendous lack of awareness and mis
reading of the situation."
Truth, Not Politeness
Novak said that the willingness of
the silent protestors to listen was in
part a show of respect for the office
of the Vice President. But he added
that "in the name of that office" the
protestors were also criticizing a per
son "not worthy of the office."
Novak added that despite the in
effectiveness of the protestors, he
hoped Humphrey's "performance"
would work to "revulse moderates and
persons who have not yet declared
their stand on the war."
Admitting that neither protest tac
tic had been very effective, Novak said
that Humphrey "manipulated" the po
liteness showed him. "But what we
need is truth, not politeness," he said.
Calls For Further Action
Dean Napier said the Vice President
Impressed him as a man "as tightly
formed, as unfluid ... as a man can be.

I had the impression that he was
most immoral when he was talking
loudest about morality."
Brown called upon faculty and stu
dents to follow their protests by "flood
ing Humphrey's desk" with letters.

Novak added that several faculty mem
bers will be working together during
the next: few weeks to organize semi
nars and spread involvement of con
cern over the war to include those out
side the Stanford community.
