# Teach-in Attacks Humphrey
## 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
Eyelids quivered and shoulders
droopod, but spirited speakers
and hot coffee kept a small group
of protesting students awake
during the night-long vigil pre
ceding Vice• President Hum
hrey's appearance at Stanford.
"I wonder where Stanford stu
dents are?" asked Barry Green
berg, distressed with the number
of participants which dwindled
from 150 to fifteen as the hour
grew late.
The Experiment director
claimed that the academic com
munity in its letter requesting no
protest beyond remaining silent
during Humphrey's address felt
that any other action "wouldn't
be dignified." "It would be dig
nified, though, they feel, to sit
on our hands," he said.
Commenting on the obsession
with image, Greenberg said. "We
are always thinking about how
we look to someone else. We
don't realize how affected we are
by Madison Avenue."
Death-Like Image
Speaking directly to the stu
dents present, Greenberg said
that "If we care- -and I wonder
how many of us do—this over
whelming concern with image is
ridiculous. In this dreary, walk
ing-death atmosphere, like I
think Stanford is, we can't count
on isolated action; we have to be
living examples of what we be
lieve in.
"I don't think many are willing
to make the commitment. It is

very hard for Americans to ac
cept the notion that we are living
in a totalitarian society."
"My understanding of dignity,"
Greenberg said, "isn't one like
that of the faculty. They believe
in a false sense of tolerance. My
approach is in feeling fed-up, in
feeling something in my chest
and feeling my hands sweating.
I feel this not out of fear, but out
of life and concern."
"I will walk out with a sense of
freedom, dignity, and courage,
not hatred of Hubert Hum
phrey," he concluded .
Humane Pictures
Before Green bergs' speech, Mrs.
Felix Greene, wife of the noted
critic of American policy in
Southeast Asia, showed slides of
the couples' trip to North Viet
nam Mrs. Greene's commentary
focused mainly on the people:
children, the elderly, young men
drilling in a Hanoi park on a Sun
day afternoon.
Student spokesman Ira Arlook
agreed with Greenberg's com
ments, stating that "I refuse to
tolerate government representa
tives who use every opportunity
to defend that (totalitarian) so
ciety. We must live the alterna
tives we suggest. This involves
risks, but we must have a will
ingness to act and accept respon
sibility."
Several panels discussed
aspects of the Vietnam war such
as the question of morality, bio
chemical and chemical warfare,
and historical factors.

Hal Draper, a free-lance writer
and professed socialist, stressed
that "if the United States gets a
little more "humanitarian,' we
will have bases all around Viet
nam and Thailand.
"Leave them alone; permit
them to control and create their
own government. After all, self
determination is a democratic
right of the people."
Another panelist, Barton Bern
stein, Stanford Professor of His
tory, emphasized that "Rusk is
fighting a war not against North
Vietnam, but against China. He
is preparing bases there for the
next event."
Touching upon the theory of
American economic imperialism
as the cause of the present con
flict, Bernstein said that "dollar
imperialism is one feature. The
real problem is not that we re
gard the people as malevolent,
but as victims of an ideology
which defines communism is
Asia in a way which constitutes
iradicable evil."
Slashes At HHH
Robert Avakiam, an employee
of Ramparts magazine, cried out
that "the people owe no service
to Hubert Humphrey, who's no
better than a murderer."
Another student leader, Ana
tole Anton, gave a resume of
Humphrey's background and po
litical practices, claiming that
Humphrey is an advocate of cold
war liberalism, "the liberal's im
perialism." "Even Lenin would
find it hard to disagree with Hub

ert Humphrey."
Referring to a passage from
Humphrey's book, The Cause
Ls Mankind! in which he states
that, "the less developed coun
tries are potentially vast mar
kets for American goods and
services," Anton said that Hum
phrey believes that "whatever
is good for American business
is good for mankind."
Anton claimed that much of
Humphrey's activities in civil
rights were directed at getting
the "Afro-American vote."
Military Extremes
Charles Drekmeier, Professor
of Political Science, spoke on "a
mood of desperation" which he
said results from"the use of
military power in international
politics. This has created a read
iness to take extreme action."
Suggesting that entire indus
tries in America are "falling
into technical disrepair" as a re
sult of the weapon build-up,
Drekmeier cited the facts that
direct spending on overkill
amounts to 110 billion dollars
each year and that the United
States are currently spending
2*A billion dollars per month on
the war.
After Drekmeier concluded his
speech at approximately 2 a.m.
the remaining students moved
from Cubberley Auditorium to
the Experiment building to wait
until morning. ASSU President
David Harris joined the group
in a discussion of issues rele
vant to those of the vigil.
