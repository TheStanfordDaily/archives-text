# Harris Resigns Presidency
## Collins Will Assume ASSU Helm 
### CHRIS HARTE

David Harris has resigned.
The surprise announcement was
made Tuesday afternoon in an open
letter to the student body in which he
said "I feel my contribution in the
context of the presidency has been
made."
Michael Collins, elected vice presi
dent last spring when Harris and he
won by a wide margin in the largest
student election turnout ever, auto
matically becomes student body presi
dent.
Collins had left for a vacation yes
terday and was unavailable for com

ment, but apparently had been noti
fied of the resignation before he left.
'I've Said it'
In an interview after he had writ
ten the letter, Harris gave his rea
sons for resigning. "All the motiva
tion for me being student body presi
dent, all the things I had hoped to
say, I've said, I've said a number
of times, and I don't think I can add
to them anymore."
"Anyone in public office," he con
tinued, running a hand through his
hair, "has got to constantly keep in
mind a sense of what he's doing. I
had a sense of what I've been doing,
and it's been done."

Harris emphasized that this was
"simply a realization on my part of
where I fit in the pattern of chang
ing Stanford—there's no renunciation
of anything I believe in."
Far from being a renunciation, the
resignation letter challenges Stan
ford: "A response to the questions
I have raised over the length of my
term remains in the hands of the
community," Harris wrote.
Education Spokesman
The questions he raised, and raised
persistently, were about every aspect
of education. "My contribution," as
Harris states it, "has basically been

to say things to the community that
up to this point the community was
afraid to say to itself- I was just a
spokesman for a basic way of seeing
the University that I felt had to be
articulated if there was going to be
any healthy notion of education."
But the time had come for a
change, he decided. "This afternoon
as I was sitting at home it just all
came to me, that it was utterly ridic
ulous to continue in this office, that
one should only do something as long
as one has something to do in it."
"I can't be an executive, I can't be
an administrator," he continued. "I'm
not putting those positions down, be
cause I think that now somebody is
going to have to be able to organize
something at Stanford that will pro
duce a change. But I'm not the orga
nizer for that."
The resignation seemingly came as
a surprise to everyone. While Harris
had spoken occasionally last quarter
of resigning at the beginning of win
ter, there had been no indication in
recent weeks that he would not stay
in office throughout the year.

terday and was unavailable for com

ment, but apparently had been noti
fied of the resignation before he left.
'I've Said it'
In an interview after he had writ
ten the letter, Harris gave his rea
sons for resigning. "All the motiva
tion for me being student body presi
dent, all the things I had hoped to
say, I've said, I've said a number
of times, and I don't think I can add
to them anymore."
"Anyone in public office," he con
tinued, running a hand through his
hair, "has got to constantly keep in
mind a sense of what he's doing. I
had a sense of what I've been doing,
and it's been done."

Harris emphasized that this was
"simply a realization on my part of
where I fit in the pattern of chang
ing Stanford—there's no renunciation
of anything I believe in."
Far from being a renunciation, the
resignation letter challenges Stan
ford: "A response to the questions
I have raised over the length of my
term remains in the hands of the
community," Harris wrote.

The questions he raised, and raised
persistently, were about every aspect
of education. "My contribution," as
Harris states it, "has basically been

to say things to the community that
up to this point the community was
afraid to say to itself- I was just a
spokesman for a basic way of seeing
the University that I felt had to be
articulated if there was going to be
any healthy notion of education."
But the time had come for a
change, he decided. "This afternoon
as I was sitting at home it just all
came to me, that it was utterly ridic
ulous to continue in this office, that
one should only do something as long
as one has something to do in it."
"I can't be an executive, I can't be
an administrator," he continued. "I'm
not putting those positions down, be
cause I think that now somebody is
going to have to be able to organize
something at Stanford that will pro
duce a change. But I'm not the orga
nizer for that."
The resignation seemingly came as
a surprise to everyone. While Harris
had spoken occasionally last quarter
of resigning at the beginning of win
ter, there had been no indication in
recent weeks that he would not stay
in office throughout the year.
