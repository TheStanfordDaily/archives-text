# Neighbors Complain
## Road Causes Dispute 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
Stanford plans to develop a
j new residential area for faculty
* members on Frenchman's Hill,
| and residents of nearby Collge
. Terrace are quite displeased.
. C. W. Gillard, a spokesman
â–  for the residents of Amherst
[ Street, told The Dally that he
feels the University is acting in
an "unneighborly manner."
The dispute primarily concerns
* the location of a planned rerout
ing of Stanford Avenue. As the
* University's plan now stands, the

new road would run within
about 30 feet of some of the
yards of Amherst residents.
These people contend that the
close proximity of the proposed
road will create safety hazards
in addition to disrupting the
neighborhood's tranquility.
Besides being upset about the
new road, Amherst residents
feel that the University failed to
give them due consideration. Ac
cording to Mr. Gillard, Univer
sity planners promised to keep
him informed of their decisions,

but later presented the Amherst
residents with a finished plan,
which had already been ap
proved by the County Board of
Supervisors.
In response to a letter of com
plaint from one of the Amherst
residents, Dr. Robert Walker,
who serves as Chairman of the
Committee on Faculty Housing,
said that careful attention had
been given to the interests of the
neighboring community. Dr.
Walker cited several specific rea
sons for the planned location of
the new road.
The Amherst residents argue
that there is a better alternative
route, and are campaigning to
make the University change its
plan. Dr. Walker has stated, how
ever, that any major change in
the University's present plan
would result in a significant in
crease in cost.
The Amherst residents are
seeking "redress of their griev
ances" by taking their case to
the Palo Alto City Council. The
City Council legally has no juris
diction over Stanford land, but
since Palo Alto owns many of
the roads surrounding Stanford,
it does have bargaining power
with the University.
Uncertain as to the outcome
of this particular dispute, Mr.
Gillard told The Daily that he
sees it as a manifestation of a
larger problem, the problem of
community relations with a big,
growing University.
