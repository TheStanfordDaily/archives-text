"Mem What? Mem wow!"
summarized Mrs. Leonard Rat
ner, wife of the Stanford music
professor.
Tonight Stanford's new cof
fee house, located in the small
partioned dining rooms at the
rear of Tresidder's main floor,
begins its second week of opera
tions.
Capacity crowds jammed
"Mem What?" both Thursday
and Friday evenings last week.
Many who had been skeptical
about whether the coffee house
could create an atmosphere dif
fering from the Union cafeteria
were pleasantly surprised.
The decor, lighting, and low
wood ceiling transformed the
rooms into a Rathskeller-like
area. On Friday night tables and
musicians drifted out onto the
.adjoining patio, another asset to
the coffee house surroundings.
'Bubbles'
A steady stream of volunteer
entertainers provided back
ground music. Thursday night
teatured group singing led by
Dean Napier at the piano, fol
lowed by jazz pianist Ossy Nel
son, accompanied by drummer
Paul Fink, and later Mike
Hughes playing his twelve-string
guitar. One of the highlights of
the evening was Dean and Mrs.
Napier's rendition of "Bubbles"
and "Fools Rush In."
Friday night guitar and banjo
groups performed in sporadic
succession. This weekend the
Midnight Mafia may present
several bits and improvisations.
Phil Taubman, program co
chairman, said "New performers,

poetry readers and actors will
be welcome at any time."
According to coffee house
manager Janet Cox, the "Mem
What?" crew received numerous
requests to open additional
nights. She explained that this
would be possible if more staff
and entertainers could be re
cruited.
A cold beverage will be added
to the current menu which now
spiced cider, donuts, and past
ries. The coffee house is open
