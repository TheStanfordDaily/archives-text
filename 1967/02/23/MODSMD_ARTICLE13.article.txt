# U. Of Chicago Says No Lists For Draft
## 
### 
(AP) â€”The President of the
University of Chicago said yes
terday the university no longer
will provide the Selective Ser
vice system with a class rank
list of male students.
George W. Beadle, the presi
dent, said the decision to modify
the university's policy on rank
ing followed extensive discus
sion by the Council of the Fac
ulty Senate.
The decision also followed
heated agitation by students op
posed to the university's co
operation with the Selective Ser
vice system. Last May, student
demonstrators tied up the uni
versity's administration building
for several days in a massive
protest sit-in.
Beadle said that under the
new policy class rank lists will
continue to be compiled for the
entire student body, male and fe
male, and a student's class and
academic transcript will be re
leased only at the student's re
quest.
In the past such rankings have

been used in determining stu
dent draft deferments. Beadle
said the university's new policy
marks a reduction in the uni
versity's cooperation with the Se
lective Service system.
