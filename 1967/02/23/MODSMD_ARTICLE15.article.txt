# US Takes Twisting Course
## 
### 
In Vietnam today, as in Cuba
and the Dominican Republic
earlier, U.S. strategy has fol
lowed a twisting course "to the
point of armed force as the key
instrument of policy," writes a
prominent political analyst in
residence at Stanford.
In a copyrighted article pub
lished by Commentary magazine,
Theodore Draper explains what
he perceives as a "pattern" link
ing these three arenas of Ameri
can military involvement.
The historian-journalist states:
"We have, in truth, resorted to
power because our politics have
failed Since no politician can
afford to admit this, we must
pretend that we are resorting to
power in order to make our pol
itics succeed."
Draper, author of two widely
acclaimed books on revolution
ary Cuba and "Castroism" and a

persistent critic of the 1965 U.S.
intervention in the Dominican
Republic, is a research fellow at
the University's Hoover Institu
tion on War, Revolution, and
Peace.
"I am not, by any means,"
Draper cautions, "trying to be
little the importance of power in
the conduct of foreign policy."
Rather, he feels that this coun
try has "gone so far that we are

flaunting our power dangerous
ly."
By contrast to the Vietnam
conflict and the Caribbean inter
ventions, writes the Hoover In
stitution researcher, the U.S.
resignedly decided to "cut our
losses" in Indonesia in 1965 just
before the surprising anti-com
munist coup and"the only credit
we can take for our good for
tune is that we did nothing to
spoil it.
