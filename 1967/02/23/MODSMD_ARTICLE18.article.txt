# General Studies Ensure Balance
## 
### ROBERT A. WALKER 
Director of General Studies
The question posed as the starting
point for this article is a potential
booby trap. It assumes that we know,
or have agreed upon, what constitutes
a good "broad general education."
Ideas about this are always in flux at
a first-class university, as they are at
Stanford today.
On the other hand, every good uni
versity accepts the obligation to edu
cate its students beyond the limits of
a specialized discipline. It has become
increasingly obvious that the affairs
of the world are too complex to leave
in the hands of specialistsâ€”or, as one
sage put it, in the hands of men "who
are experts in one field and dogmat
ists in all others."
The function of general education
is to prepare students to cope intel
ligently with the problems they will
encounter as persons and as citizens.
But in an age of unprecedented in
crease in knowledge, particularly in
science and technology, the pressures
for allocating more of the under
graduate span to professional and spe
cialized training are real and growing
stronger. The vocational concerns of
many students, especially among the
men, create a sense of urgency about
getting on with major subjects and
laying the groundwork for graduate
school.
The University's problem, then, be
comes one of seeing to it that the final
undergraduate product is a relatively
balanced one despite the pressures.
This is the function of the area re
quirements in Stanford's General
Studies Program.
Guarantee Exposure
How well are we succeeding? Per
fection being reserved for another
world, I am sure that we can do bet
ter. We could also do a lot worse. The
General Studies requirements guaran
tee exposure to some work in each
of the three basic fields of knowledge.
More specifically, they require the
student to venture into the two fields
outside his area of specialization. But
flexibility and self-direction have been
the goals from that point on. Beyond
Freshman English and Western Civ,
no one has to study any one subject- -
unless he omitted exposing himself to
biology while in high school.
He has a wide choice of courses iti
the humanities; he has a selection of
any two out of seven disciplines in the
social sciences. His choices among the
physical sciences cover the range of
the field. We try to assist the selec
tion process with a General Studies
Program Bulletin which provides
course descriptions far more complete
than the usual college catalog.
It may be argued that the General
Studies courses could be improved.
We agree. The Committee on General
Studies has given this repeated atten
tion, through periodic review of the
several areas by subcommittees of
competent persons in the field.
Approval Necessary
It may be argued that greater free
dom of course planning should be per
mitted. Perhaps. But then the relevant
standards must still be spelled out
and a determination made as to who
will approve the individual plans. This
threatens to take us off into a com
mentary on the advising system, but
my space allocation forbids. The ques
tion is whether or not such a system,
almost certainly requiring the ap
proval of a study plan by one faculty
member, might not often mean less
rather than more individual freedom
for the student.
Then why not ditch the require
ments and go back to the free elective
system which President Eliot launched
at Harvard many years ago? Because,
as Harvard and every other univer

sity has discovered, the uneducated
person lacks the basis for making in
telligent choices. Harsh words are
these in our era of faculty-student
equality, but the fact remains that
an experienced faculty is better
equipped to supply the guide lines
(requirements) and determine the
content of general education than are
the individual students.
Students' Stake
And before the "Dear Editor" pro
tests innundate The Dally, let me
hasten to add that I recognize fully
that students have a big stake in the
quality of their education, that they
have highly useful opinions on the
subject, and that they should be con
sulted constantly. I merely point out
that the need for requirements is real
and that faculty determination of con
tent is essential.
All of this, obviously, is in the con
text of constant change and innova
tion. Many are the changes at Stan
ford since 1956, not the least of them
the fact that over half of our students
now get an important part of their
general education at overseas cam
puses and meet the requirements
there in courses adapted to the set
ting.
The idea of "general education"
will never be defined finally or remain
constant. The debate itself is impor
tant. If students and faculty lose in
terest in the subject, as they pursue
the demands of their specialties, the
University will have begun the decline
to becoming an expensive trade
school.
