# New Education Recipe Is Needed To Satisfy Growth Requirements
## 
### ROD LEVINE 
The General Studies Program Bul
letin states, "The General Studies Pro
gram is designed to supply the liberal
education portion of your Stanford
experience."
This view of liberal education as a
commodity to be supplied to students
is probably the fundamental fault
of the Program. It is doubtful whether
anyone could honestly suggest that
General Studies succeeds in broaden
ing students' intellectual outlooks.
The program is weakly defended
as "the best possible system under the
circumstances." If this were the best
we could do, then perhaps General
Studies requirements would be worth
less- However, the problem lies with
the specific manifestation of require
ments, not with the presence of re
quirements themselves.
Cheerlos Requirements
The stated objective of supplying
the "liberal-education portion of your
Stanford education" sounds like the
"minimum daily growth require
ments" that I get in my Cheerios.
General Studies treats liberal educa
tion in a cook-book method, and the
courses reflect this:
Take one student and marinate in
five units of anthropology. Rinse well.
Transfer to a test tube containing
nine units of Physical Science. Boil
thoroughly. Soak in four units of
Philosophy of Art. Allow to ferment
briefly and then bake in a pan well
greased with five units of Christian
Ethics. This recipe serves 5,000 un
dergraduates.
The General Studies Program re
lies heavily on large, introductory
lecture courses for area requirements.
These, as well as Western Civ, seem
to be based on the theory that a dip
in the humanities, social sciences, and

natural sciences supplies all the nec
essary nutrients for a liberal educa
tion.
With the exception of a few courses
taught by dedicated professors, these
General Studies courses have little
impact on students. At the beginning
of the quarter one is faced with an
imponderable mass of introductory
material which could dull anyone's in
terest.
This emphasis on superficial treat
ment of introductory material seems
to be planned. The Bulletin states:
"Undergraduate teaching should
provide the best in liberal education
and it should make abailable the best
in specialized study."
So we are told that a liberal educa
tion is separate from (even if com
plementary to) specialized study. I
strongly disagree. Specialized study
need not be limited to vocational
training. General Studies ought to
offer in-depth, specialized study out
side one's major field.
More Penetration
Could we not offer fifteen unit, year
long courses which would do more
than scratch the surface of a general
topic? These ought to be alternatives
to the area requirements. They ought
to be flexible emphasizing individual
study and research, though lectures
and seminars would be included.
Could we not offer freshmen directed
reading and independent study as
alternatives to Western Civ? Western
Civ supposedly offers an introduction
to the history of ideas and to the
academic method. Let's actually use
the academic method then, and per
haps stimulate a search for knowledge
which will be personally fulfilling.
These and similar programs will
require faculty time and interest.
Undoubtedly the costs will be high,

but if there are people who will do
nate $5 million to build an UGLY,
then surely there must be others who
might endow a program designed to
improve General Studies.
Breadth Studies
I suggest, then, that a new program
is needed to replace General Studies.
For lack of a better name I have re
ferred to it as "Breadth Studies." I
suggest changing the program, but
not eliminating requirements outside
the major department.
Some students argue that if a per
son is capable of meeting Stanford's
admission requirements, then he is
surely capable of structuring his
academic program. This would pro
vide him a program suited to his
needs and not to the average needs
of 5000 undergraduates. This argu
ment has a seductive ring to it. It
strikes another blow for freedom in
the never-ending battle against the
coercive power of the University.
I don't want to belabor the point,
but I would suggest that most of us
need a little coercion at times. We
tend to cloister ourselves in the ruts
of past success and security. Why
should a chemistry major study
Shakespeare? Many students discov
er "why" only after being pushed into
a General Studies course.
Breadth requirements are necessary
to insure exposure to a number of the
arts and sciences. The requirements
ought to be structured so that they
give a push to those who need it,
while not restricting the freedom of
choice of those who do not.
The time has come for a change in
undergraduate requirements. We no
longer need a General Studies Pro
gram whose stated objective is to "sup
ply" a mass-produced liberal educa
tion.

coercive power of the University.
I don't want to belabor the point,
but I would suggest that most of us
need a little coercion at times. We
tend to cloister ourselves in the ruts
of past success and security. Why
should a chemistry major study
Shakespeare? Many students discov
er "why" only after being pushed into
a General Studies course.
Breadth requirements are necessary
to insure exposure to a number of the
arts and sciences. The requirements
ought to be structured so that they
give a push to those who need it,
while not restricting the freedom of
choice of those who do not.
The time has come for a change in
undergraduate requirements. We no
longer need a General Studies Pro
gram whose stated objective is to "sup
ply" a mass-produced liberal educa
tion.
The General Studies Program Bul
letin states, "The General Studies Pro
gram is designed to supply the liberal
education portion of your Stanford
experience."
This view of liberal education as a
commodity to be supplied to students
is probably the fundamental fault
of the Program. It is doubtful whether
anyone could honestly suggest that
General Studies succeeds in broaden
ing students' intellectual outlooks.
The program is weakly defended
as "the best possible system under the
circumstances." If this were the best
we could do, then perhaps General
Studies requirements would be worth
less- However, the problem lies with
the specific manifestation of require
ments, not with the presence of re
quirements themselves.
Cheerlos Requirements
The stated objective of supplying
the "liberal-education portion of your
Stanford education" sounds like the
"minimum daily growth require
ments" that I get in my Cheerios.
General Studies treats liberal educa
tion in a cook-book method, and the
courses reflect this:
Take one student and marinate in
five units of anthropology. Rinse well.
Transfer to a test tube containing
nine units of Physical Science. Boil
thoroughly. Soak in four units of
Philosophy of Art. Allow to ferment
briefly and then bake in a pan well
greased with five units of Christian
Ethics. This recipe serves 5,000 un
dergraduates.
The General Studies Program re
lies heavily on large, introductory
lecture courses for area requirements.
These, as well as Western Civ, seem
to be based on the theory that a dip
in the humanities, social sciences, and

natural sciences supplies all the nec
essary nutrients for a liberal educa
tion.
With the exception of a few courses
taught by dedicated professors, these
General Studies courses have little
impact on students. At the beginning
of the quarter one is faced with an
imponderable mass of introductory
material which could dull anyone's in
terest.
This emphasis on superficial treat
ment of introductory material seems
to be planned. The Bulletin states:
"Undergraduate teaching should
provide the best in liberal education
and it should make abailable the best
in specialized study."
So we are told that a liberal educa
tion is separate from (even if com
plementary to) specialized study. I
strongly disagree. Specialized study
need not be limited to vocational
training. General Studies ought to
offer in-depth, specialized study out
side one's major field.
More Penetration
Could we not offer fifteen unit, year
long courses which would do more
than scratch the surface of a general
topic? These ought to be alternatives
to the area requirements. They ought
to be flexible emphasizing individual
study and research, though lectures
and seminars would be included.
Could we not offer freshmen directed
reading and independent study as
alternatives to Western Civ? Western
Civ supposedly offers an introduction
to the history of ideas and to the
academic method. Let's actually use
the academic method then, and per
haps stimulate a search for knowledge
which will be personally fulfilling.
These and similar programs will
require faculty time and interest.
Undoubtedly the costs will be high,

but if there are people who will do
nate $5 million to build an UGLY,
then surely there must be others who
might endow a program designed to
improve General Studies.
Breadth Studies
I suggest, then, that a new program
is needed to replace General Studies.
For lack of a better name I have re
ferred to it as "Breadth Studies." I
suggest changing the program, but
not eliminating requirements outside
the major department.
Some students argue that if a per
son is capable of meeting Stanford's
admission requirements, then he is
surely capable of structuring his
academic program. This would pro
vide him a program suited to his
needs and not to the average needs
of 5000 undergraduates. This argu
ment has a seductive ring to it. It
strikes another blow for freedom in
the never-ending battle against the
coercive power of the University.

then surely there must be others who
might endow a program designed to
improve General Studies.
Breadth Studies
I suggest, then, that a new program
is needed to replace General Studies.
For lack of a better name I have re
ferred to it as "Breadth Studies." I
suggest changing the program, but
not eliminating requirements outside
the major department.
Some students argue that if a per
son is capable of meeting Stanford's
admission requirements, then he is
surely capable of structuring his
academic program. This would pro
vide him a program suited to his
needs and not to the average needs
of 5000 undergraduates. This argu
ment has a seductive ring to it. It
strikes another blow for freedom in
the never-ending battle against the
coercive power of the University.
I don't want to belabor the point,
but I would suggest that most of us
need a little coercion at times. We
tend to cloister ourselves in the ruts
of past success and security. Why
should a chemistry major study
Shakespeare? Many students discov
er "why" only after being pushed into
a General Studies course.
Breadth requirements are necessary
to insure exposure to a number of the
arts and sciences. The requirements
ought to be structured so that they
give a push to those who need it,
while not restricting the freedom of
choice of those who do not.
The time has come for a change in
undergraduate requirements. We no
longer need a General Studies Pro
gram whose stated objective is to "sup
ply" a mass-produced liberal educa
tion.
The General Studies Program Bul
letin states, "The General Studies Pro
gram is designed to supply the liberal
education portion of your Stanford
experience."
This view of liberal education as a
commodity to be supplied to students
is probably the fundamental fault
of the Program. It is doubtful whether
anyone could honestly suggest that
General Studies succeeds in broaden
ing students' intellectual outlooks.
The program is weakly defended
as "the best possible system under the
circumstances." If this were the best
we could do, then perhaps General
Studies requirements would be worth
less- However, the problem lies with
the specific manifestation of require
ments, not with the presence of re
quirements themselves.
Cheerlos Requirements
The stated objective of supplying
the "liberal-education portion of your
Stanford education" sounds like the
"minimum daily growth require
ments" that I get in my Cheerios.
General Studies treats liberal educa
tion in a cook-book method, and the
courses reflect this:
Take one student and marinate in
five units of anthropology. Rinse well.
Transfer to a test tube containing
nine units of Physical Science. Boil
thoroughly. Soak in four units of
Philosophy of Art. Allow to ferment
briefly and then bake in a pan well
greased with five units of Christian
Ethics. This recipe serves 5,000 un
dergraduates.
The General Studies Program re
lies heavily on large, introductory
lecture courses for area requirements.
These, as well as Western Civ, seem
to be based on the theory that a dip
in the humanities, social sciences, and

natural sciences supplies all the nec
essary nutrients for a liberal educa
tion.
With the exception of a few courses
taught by dedicated professors, these
General Studies courses have little
impact on students. At the beginning
of the quarter one is faced with an
imponderable mass of introductory
material which could dull anyone's in
terest.
This emphasis on superficial treat
ment of introductory material seems
to be planned. The Bulletin states:
"Undergraduate teaching should
provide the best in liberal education
and it should make abailable the best
in specialized study."
So we are told that a liberal educa
tion is separate from (even if com
plementary to) specialized study. I
strongly disagree. Specialized study
need not be limited to vocational
training. General Studies ought to
offer in-depth, specialized study out
side one's major field.
More Penetration
Could we not offer fifteen unit, year
long courses which would do more
than scratch the surface of a general
topic? These ought to be alternatives
to the area requirements. They ought
to be flexible emphasizing individual
study and research, though lectures
and seminars would be included.
Could we not offer freshmen directed
reading and independent study as
alternatives to Western Civ? Western
Civ supposedly offers an introduction
to the history of ideas and to the
academic method. Let's actually use
the academic method then, and per
haps stimulate a search for knowledge
which will be personally fulfilling.
These and similar programs will
require faculty time and interest.
Undoubtedly the costs will be high,

but if there are people who will do
nate $5 million to build an UGLY,
then surely there must be others who
might endow a program designed to
improve General Studies.
