# General Studies
## A 						New Approach Is Needed 
### PAUL RUPERT 
To add one's voice to the chorus
of General Studies critics is to side
with the majority of Stanford under
graduates.
To do so now might serve to revive
discussion on the one issue that binds
us together. While what follows must
be a limited review, it is hoped that
it will suggest some experiments for
next year and some points for con
sideration by the Packer Committee —
for which we have so many expecta
tions.
The primary accusation aimed at
the present General Studies Program
is that it does not grow from a clear
philosophy of education. It takes its
rather sprawling, sampling nature
from the theory that breadth is de
sirable in an education and is achieved
by massive overdoses of courses in a
number of fields.
Automatic Education
This philosophy assumes that if the
best students and professors are
placed in some unwieldy introductory
courses, an education of sorts must
occur. The Stanford student finds him
self in fifteen General Studies courses
his freshman year—with all those
units of science (many of which are
ill-conceived, filler courses), and an
unfortunately limited range of class
es. This is due to the rather absurd
failure to allow the expansion of
choices which a pass-fail privilege in
General Studies Courses might en
courage.
That an alternate philosophy of ed
ucation is vitally needed at Stanford
is a point I will assume. In light of
the recent criticisms of general edu
cation which I have heard and read,
great emphasis is placed on the de
sirability of introducing creative flex
ibility. With this in mind, I will sug
gest a few possible alternatives to
the present program.
The most drastic revision would be
the abolition of all required courses,
thus allowing the student to find a
general education where he will —
with the assistance of qualified ad
visors who could suggest cohesive

programs in the student's field of in
terest.
Such an idea assumes that a stu
dent's interests will lead him into a
coherent variety of fields which will
guarantee breadth and foster even
greater depth. Thus, a student of Nazi
Germany turns to psychology, sociol
ogy, communications, and expression
ist art to understand the problem.
There is, as well, the presupposition
that the open, well-rounded mind is
based on a quality of thought rather
than a quantity of data.
A more conservative plan would be
to revise selectively the present Gen
eral Studies curriculum. The exces
sive units of science, math or lan
guage, humanities, and social science
could be pared down, leaving a solid
core of basic courses—ideally includ
ing freshman English, Western Civ,
and a good lab science.
Such reduction seems advisable—if
not absolutely necessary—in view of
the recent expansion of the Overseas
Campuses Program. The valuable ad
dition of this program to the "liberal
education" of more than 50 per cent
of the student body seems to dupli
cate the accomplishments of General
Studies. With language, humanities,
and social science offered abroad—

and perhaps more intensive forms of
learning outside the academic con
fines—to limit the freedom of the re
tured undergraduate to sample
fields outside his major and to pursue
new and stronger interests is to abort
the very process one initiates.
Perhaps the best idea — one that
could be implemented next year—
would be to experiment with several
different programs. Groups of fifty
freshmen could be selected to follow
the two plans discussed above and
other alternatives like a "case study"
approach or a "Great Books" pro
gram.
Work and Study
The "case study" approach would
allow for two quarters of reading, re
search, and writing, followed by ac
tual field work in a given area. A stu
dent might read extensively in po
litical theory and behavior and then
work in the State legislature.
He might then study journalism
and communications, followed by
work on a newspaper. While such a
program might not be feasible on a
large, University-organized scale, it
should be offered for self-motivated
students as a substitute for the illu
sion of General Studies which keep
dis-interested students atrophied on

the Farm.
The "Great Books" method would
incorporate a one or two year tutorial
for persons expressing an interest in
directed reading or writing under a
series of professors. The student's
work could be focused on a central
theme or project suggested by the
classics and expanded from there.
Motivation and Curiosity
A relevant point is that each of
these programs require self-motiva
tion and a curious mind on the part
of the student. We must recognize
that with our present plethora of dis
ciplines and journals, sampling a va
riety of fields when one is not inter
ested is totally meaningless.
There is a definite feeling that the
state of the student body and the
exigencies of an acceptable education
demand an entirely new approach—
one that is no longer afforded by the
archaic, massive program called Gen
eral Studies. It was based upon differ
ent assumptions in a different Stan
ford 10 years ago.
The failure to come to terms with
the potential of a student body at
tracted by the claims of the "Harvard
of the West" is not simply unfortu
nate. It is to assure Stanford's drift
away from the "Edge of Greatness."
