# Courses Exist In Isolation

### PETER DAHL Assistant to the Director 
General Studies Program
The question under consideration is
a thorny one. In an attempt to an
swer it one ought to undertake a
lengthy philosophical inquiry into re
lated questions as well.
What, for example, are the goals of
education in general? What distin
guishes a university education from
a college education and what from a
high school education? What distin
guishes an undergraduate education

from a graduate education? The an
swers to these questions will have
considerable influence in shaping the
answer to the question at hand, are
crucial questions, questions that must
be answered by the University if it is
to achieve an identity. But we do not
have space to deal with them here.
A general or liberal education is a
difficult, probably impossible, idea to
define. Generally, I view a liberal edu
cation as one that by design attempts
to place the student in possession of
the accumulated wisdom of the past;
it engenders a sense of history, a
sense of belonging to and indebted
ness toward what has gone before,
while at the same time equipping him
to critically evaluate it, and preparing
him to make a meaningful contribu
tion to mankind in the present and in
the future.
Ideally, the liberally educated per
son will possess that rare balance be
tween head and heart which is essen
tial to the ultimate survival of the
race, both physically and spiritually.
The scientist in whom a true liberal
education has taken root might know
how to make napalm, but he will re
fuse to make it. The non-scientist in
whom a liberal education has taken
root is no romantic; he has a pro
found respect for the methods and
uses of science.
Considerable Flexibility
The current General Studies pro
gram has the advantage of consider
able flexibility, but that may be a
weakness. I do not think that the pro
gram is able to contribute much to
the ideal outlined above, except in an
accidental way. The program is badly
fragmented; its courses exist in isola
tion. A student may fulfill his science
requirement by taking two quarters
of biology, a quarter of logic, and a
quarter of, say, advanced mathe
matics.
These subjects are of course valu
able in themselves, but they scarcely
constitute a basic education in science.
The same argument may be applied
to the requirements in the humanities
and social sciences.
Precisely articulated structure is es
sential to the educational process, and
what we have in our program is the
appearance of structure. However
limited our understanding of the good
liberal education may be, it is clear
that it does not consist in a casual
cook's tour through the academic
supermarket, in which the "consu
mer" selects a can of German verbs,
a jar of social science, a carton of
physical science, and a sprig or two
of existentialism.
In an arrangement such as ours—
in which the courses have little or no
relationship to each other, and the
student must struggle very hard to

achieve some sense of wholeness out
of the scattered parts—too much is
left to chance. Education is a serious
matter, and order, concentration, and
discipline are essential to its success.
If the idea of general education is
still viable in the high-powered mod
ern university, then we might try to
design an integrated, coherent pro
gram in the humanities, social scien
ces, and natural sciences, required of
all students in their first two years
Specialization and preparation for
graduate study could be delayed until
the junior and senior years, after a
solid intellectual foundation has been
established. Emphasis in the first two
years could be on historical events of
major significance and upon the most
significant achievements in the arts
and sciences—the idea being to "en
sure" that, before they specialize, stu
dents really understand the important
contributions of the various historical
periods to human thought and institu
tions. Why not, for example, study
Renaissance history, art, music, lit
erature, and science in a coordinated
fashion in the same quarter?
Implementation
But of course I know why not.
Even if the idea outlined above is
worthy of consideration, it would be
almost impossible to implement. There
would be a universal shout among the
students that someone had taken
away their "freedom." And, given the
rigid departmentalization of the Uni
versity, the task of designing and
staffing such a program, and of co
ordinating it among the various con
tributing departments, would be as
tronomical in its proportions.
So we are back where we began,
with the current General Studies pro
gram.
The program, when it was insti
tuted ten years ago, was the product
of much debate and compromise.
There was, and is, as much disagree
ment among professors in the Univer
sity as to what constitutes a univer
sity undergraduate education as there
is among students.
When the results of the Packer
Committee's study of education at
Stanford are known, any changes in
the current General Studies require
ments are going to be the product of
the same kind of debate and compro
mise. This is a statement, not of crit
icism, but of the political facts of life.
Platonic Curriculum?
There may be, in some Platonic
realm, the perfect General Studies
curriculum, but grasping it is another
matter. If we are fortunate, the wLsest
among us will also be in the positions
of greatest influence and power as the
new study proceeds.
This is largely a matter of chance,
of course. But one can hope.

Stanford are known, any changes in
the current General Studies require
ments are going to be the product of
the same kind of debate and compro
mise. This is a statement, not of crit
icism, but of the political facts of life.
Platonic Curriculum?
There may be, in some Platonic
realm, the perfect General Studies
curriculum, but grasping it is another
matter. If we are fortunate, the wLsest
among us will also be in the positions
of greatest influence and power as the
new study proceeds.
This is largely a matter of chance,
of course. But one can hope.
General Studies Program
The question under consideration is
a thorny one. In an attempt to an
swer it one ought to undertake a
lengthy philosophical inquiry into re
lated questions as well.
What, for example, are the goals of
education in general? What distin
guishes a university education from
a college education and what from a
high school education? What distin
guishes an undergraduate education

from a graduate education? The an
swers to these questions will have
considerable influence in shaping the
answer to the question at hand, are
crucial questions, questions that must
be answered by the University if it is
to achieve an identity. But we do not
have space to deal with them here.
A general or liberal education is a
difficult, probably impossible, idea to
define. Generally, I view a liberal edu
cation as one that by design attempts
to place the student in possession of
the accumulated wisdom of the past;
it engenders a sense of history, a
sense of belonging to and indebted
ness toward what has gone before,
while at the same time equipping him
to critically evaluate it, and preparing
him to make a meaningful contribu
tion to mankind in the present and in
the future.
Ideally, the liberally educated per
son will possess that rare balance be
tween head and heart which is essen
tial to the ultimate survival of the
race, both physically and spiritually.
The scientist in whom a true liberal
education has taken root might know
how to make napalm, but he will re
fuse to make it. The non-scientist in
whom a liberal education has taken
root is no romantic; he has a pro
found respect for the methods and
uses of science.
Considerable Flexibility
The current General Studies pro
gram has the advantage of consider
able flexibility, but that may be a
weakness. I do not think that the pro
gram is able to contribute much to
the ideal outlined above, except in an
accidental way. The program is badly
fragmented; its courses exist in isola
tion. A student may fulfill his science
requirement by taking two quarters
of biology, a quarter of logic, and a
quarter of, say, advanced mathe
matics.
These subjects are of course valu
able in themselves, but they scarcely
constitute a basic education in science.
The same argument may be applied
to the requirements in the humanities
and social sciences.
Precisely articulated structure is es
sential to the educational process, and
what we have in our program is the
appearance of structure. However
limited our understanding of the good
liberal education may be, it is clear
that it does not consist in a casual
cook's tour through the academic
supermarket, in which the "consu
mer" selects a can of German verbs,
a jar of social science, a carton of
physical science, and a sprig or two
of existentialism.
In an arrangement such as ours—
in which the courses have little or no
relationship to each other, and the
student must struggle very hard to

achieve some sense of wholeness out
of the scattered parts—too much is
left to chance. Education is a serious
matter, and order, concentration, and
discipline are essential to its success.
If the idea of general education is
still viable in the high-powered mod
ern university, then we might try to
design an integrated, coherent pro
gram in the humanities, social scien
ces, and natural sciences, required of
all students in their first two years
Specialization and preparation for
graduate study could be delayed until
the junior and senior years, after a
solid intellectual foundation has been
established. Emphasis in the first two
years could be on historical events of
major significance and upon the most
significant achievements in the arts
and sciences—the idea being to "en
sure" that, before they specialize, stu
dents really understand the important
contributions of the various historical
periods to human thought and institu
tions. Why not, for example, study
Renaissance history, art, music, lit
erature, and science in a coordinated
fashion in the same quarter?
Implementation
But of course I know why not.
Even if the idea outlined above is
worthy of consideration, it would be
almost impossible to implement. There
would be a universal shout among the
students that someone had taken
away their "freedom." And, given the
rigid departmentalization of the Uni
versity, the task of designing and
staffing such a program, and of co
ordinating it among the various con
tributing departments, would be as
tronomical in its proportions.
So we are back where we began,
with the current General Studies pro
gram.
The program, when it was insti
tuted ten years ago, was the product
of much debate and compromise.
There was, and is, as much disagree
ment among professors in the Univer
sity as to what constitutes a univer
sity undergraduate education as there
is among students.

staffing such a program, and of co
ordinating it among the various con
tributing departments, would be as
tronomical in its proportions.
So we are back where we began,
with the current General Studies pro
gram.
The program, when it was insti
tuted ten years ago, was the product
of much debate and compromise.
There was, and is, as much disagree
ment among professors in the Univer
sity as to what constitutes a univer
sity undergraduate education as there
is among students.
When the results of the Packer
Committee's study of education at
Stanford are known, any changes in
the current General Studies require
ments are going to be the product of
the same kind of debate and compro
mise. This is a statement, not of crit
icism, but of the political facts of life.
Platonic Curriculum?
There may be, in some Platonic
realm, the perfect General Studies
curriculum, but grasping it is another
matter. If we are fortunate, the wLsest
among us will also be in the positions
of greatest influence and power as the
new study proceeds.
This is largely a matter of chance,
of course. But one can hope.
General Studies Program
The question under consideration is
a thorny one. In an attempt to an
swer it one ought to undertake a
lengthy philosophical inquiry into re
lated questions as well.
What, for example, are the goals of
education in general? What distin
guishes a university education from
a college education and what from a
high school education? What distin
guishes an undergraduate education

from a graduate education? The an
swers to these questions will have
considerable influence in shaping the
answer to the question at hand, are
crucial questions, questions that must
be answered by the University if it is
to achieve an identity. But we do not
have space to deal with them here.
A general or liberal education is a
difficult, probably impossible, idea to
define. Generally, I view a liberal edu
cation as one that by design attempts
to place the student in possession of
the accumulated wisdom of the past;
it engenders a sense of history, a
sense of belonging to and indebted
ness toward what has gone before,
while at the same time equipping him
to critically evaluate it, and preparing
him to make a meaningful contribu
tion to mankind in the present and in
the future.
Ideally, the liberally educated per
son will possess that rare balance be
tween head and heart which is essen
tial to the ultimate survival of the
race, both physically and spiritually.
The scientist in whom a true liberal
education has taken root might know
how to make napalm, but he will re
fuse to make it. The non-scientist in
whom a liberal education has taken
root is no romantic; he has a pro
found respect for the methods and
uses of science.
Considerable Flexibility
The current General Studies pro
gram has the advantage of consider
able flexibility, but that may be a
weakness. I do not think that the pro
gram is able to contribute much to
the ideal outlined above, except in an
accidental way. The program is badly
fragmented; its courses exist in isola
tion. A student may fulfill his science
requirement by taking two quarters
of biology, a quarter of logic, and a
quarter of, say, advanced mathe
matics.
These subjects are of course valu
able in themselves, but they scarcely
constitute a basic education in science.
The same argument may be applied
to the requirements in the humanities
and social sciences.
Precisely articulated structure is es
sential to the educational process, and
what we have in our program is the
appearance of structure. However
limited our understanding of the good
liberal education may be, it is clear
that it does not consist in a casual
cook's tour through the academic
supermarket, in which the "consu
mer" selects a can of German verbs,
a jar of social science, a carton of
physical science, and a sprig or two
of existentialism.
In an arrangement such as ours—
in which the courses have little or no
relationship to each other, and the
student must struggle very hard to

achieve some sense of wholeness out
of the scattered parts—too much is
left to chance. Education is a serious
matter, and order, concentration, and
discipline are essential to its success.
If the idea of general education is
still viable in the high-powered mod
ern university, then we might try to
design an integrated, coherent pro
gram in the humanities, social scien
ces, and natural sciences, required of
all students in their first two years
Specialization and preparation for
graduate study could be delayed until
the junior and senior years, after a
solid intellectual foundation has been
established. Emphasis in the first two
years could be on historical events of
major significance and upon the most
significant achievements in the arts
and sciences—the idea being to "en
sure" that, before they specialize, stu
dents really understand the important
contributions of the various historical
periods to human thought and institu
tions. Why not, for example, study
Renaissance history, art, music, lit
erature, and science in a coordinated
fashion in the same quarter?
Implementation
But of course I know why not.
Even if the idea outlined above is
worthy of consideration, it would be
almost impossible to implement. There
would be a universal shout among the
students that someone had taken
away their "freedom." And, given the
rigid departmentalization of the Uni
versity, the task of designing and
staffing such a program, and of co
ordinating it among the various con
tributing departments, would be as
tronomical in its proportions.
