# Mich. Daily To Be Investigated
## 
### 
(CPS)—The Michigan Dally
Is about to be investigated.
The University of Michigan's
Board of Control of Student
Publications has asked that the
school's Faculty Senate Advi
sory Committee on University
Affairs (FACUA) establish a
committee "to consider the prop
er purpose, function, and re
sponsibility of a student news
paper in this university com
munity."
A resolution of the publica
tions board asks that the new
committee investigate whether
"the existing arrangements at
the University of Michigan ade
quately serve these goals."
Disastrous Impact
Dally editor Mark Killings
worth stated the Board's request
for an investigation did not in
dicate if such an inquiry might
lead to a limitation on the Daily's
tradition of editorial freedom.

If such a limitation occurred,
Killingsworth safid, "it would
have disastrous consequences,
not on the Dally but also for the
entire university community."
Professor Luke Cooperrider,
chairman of the publications
board, said the board felt the
need for "the creation of a chan
nel of communication within the
university community and for a
review by that community of
the arrangements which have
governed the relation between
the university, the board, and
the newspaper."
Cooperrider stated, "Members
of the board are conscious that
doubts exist concerning these
arrangements and, not believing
themselves to be all wise in
this regard, have simply con
cluded that the entire commu
nity will benefit from the ex
change of views which the re

quest (to the faculty group) will
hopefully produce."
Year's Dispute
Kenneth Winter, a student
member of the publications
board, said the dispute over the
Daily had been simmering for
about a year. He said that prob
lems had arisen when certain
members of Michigan's Board
of Regents "didn't like what the
Daily was saying."
Winter said the regents com
plained to the board a year ago,
asking the board to look into
Daily operations. He stated,
"They were upset for the same
reason that anybody who goes
about to censor is upset. The
Daily editors had power in the
community and there was no
check over that power."
However, Winter said, the
problem was discussed in terms
of such things as "the expanded
scope of the Daily" and the fact
that freshmen and sophomores
were covering important stories.
Communications Problem
Winter stated that the board
debated the problem for a year,
and met with the Daily editors.
"At one point," he said, "it
was concluded there was some
thing called 'the university com
munications problem.' "
A former Daily staffer, Win
ter said that the problem has
now been stated as "just an in
vestigation of the relation of
the board to the Daily."
"This doesn't mean that now
it's going to be a censorship
move," said Winter. He said that
among the problems discussed
might be the possibility of mak
ing the Daily independent, and
the possibility of founding a sec
ond newspaper on the Ann Ar
bor campus.

If such a limitation occurred,
Killingsworth safid, "it would
have disastrous consequences,
not on the Dally but also for the
entire university community."
Professor Luke Cooperrider,
chairman of the publications
board, said the board felt the
need for "the creation of a chan
nel of communication within the
university community and for a
review by that community of
the arrangements which have
governed the relation between
the university, the board, and
the newspaper."
Cooperrider stated, "Members
of the board are conscious that
doubts exist concerning these
arrangements and, not believing
themselves to be all wise in
this regard, have simply con
cluded that the entire commu
nity will benefit from the ex
change of views which the re

quest (to the faculty group) will
hopefully produce."
Year's Dispute
Kenneth Winter, a student
member of the publications
board, said the dispute over the
Daily had been simmering for
about a year. He said that prob
lems had arisen when certain
members of Michigan's Board
of Regents "didn't like what the
Daily was saying."
Winter said the regents com
plained to the board a year ago,
asking the board to look into
Daily operations. He stated,
"They were upset for the same
reason that anybody who goes
about to censor is upset. The
Daily editors had power in the
community and there was no
check over that power."
However, Winter said, the
problem was discussed in terms
of such things as "the expanded
scope of the Daily" and the fact
that freshmen and sophomores
were covering important stories.
Communications Problem
Winter stated that the board
debated the problem for a year,
and met with the Daily editors.
"At one point," he said, "it
was concluded there was some
thing called 'the university com
munications problem.' "
A former Daily staffer, Win
ter said that the problem has
now been stated as "just an in
vestigation of the relation of
the board to the Daily."
"This doesn't mean that now
it's going to be a censorship
move," said Winter. He said that
among the problems discussed
might be the possibility of mak
ing the Daily independent, and
the possibility of founding a sec
ond newspaper on the Ann Ar
bor campus.
