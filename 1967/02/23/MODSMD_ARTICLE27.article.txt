# SECOND IN WORLD
## Eshelman Sets Vault Mark 
### JIM MALLERY 
Stanford pole vaulter Jim
Eshelman vaulted last
Friday night to shatter his own
school record and win the Gold
en Gate Invitational Indoor
Track Meet.
Peter Boyce was third in the
high jump with a leap of 6'-10"
and Craig Vaughan finished
fourth in the long jump, going
23'-8 X".
Eshelman's vault placed him
second in the world this year in
indoor vaulting and also second
all-time behind Bob Seagren of
Southern California. His efforts
also earned him the Athlete of
the Meet award.
'Vaughan Scratches at 25'
Vaughan, who two weeks ago
leaped had trouble with
his steps and was unable to sur
pass that distance officially.
However, he did hit 25'-2" on
two jumps but scratched by less
than an inch on both of them.
Roger Cox ran 6.2 In the "60
yard dash, but was unable to
place in the fast field. Bud
Walsh clocked 7.3 in the pre
liminaries of the 60 yard high
hurdles, for his best time of the
season, but he injured a muscle
and was able to run only 7.5
sec. in the finals. That time was

good for sixth place.
Chuck Menz and Mike Dono
ley faired well in the unusual
Devil Take The Hindmost Mile,
where the last man in each lap
is cut from the race, leaving
only three men still running In
the eleventh and final lap.
Menz was fifth and Donoley
finished third with a time of
4:28, which is a fast time con
sidering the gruelling pace one
is forced to run to keep from
being last in the field at the
end of a lap.

The mile relay team of Russ
Taplin, Dan Woodruff, Larry
Larson, and Jim Ward finished
third with a time of 3:26.0, the
best time of the year for them.
Best Performance Indoors
Though Stanford did not place
as well in this meet as past
meets, Coach Jordan called this
their best performance of the
indoor season as a team. Nearly
everyone competing improved
or nearly matched their best
previous efforts.
Though this was the final in

door meet for most of the Stan
ford team, three members may
see more action. Eshelman
leaves Friday for a meet in To
ronto that night, and he, Boyce,
and Vaughan may also compete
in the AAU indoor champion
ships in Oakland next weekend.

Peter Boyce was third in the
high jump with a leap of 6'-10"

fourth in the long jump, going
23'-8 X".
Eshelman's vault placed him
second in the world this year in
indoor vaulting and also second
all-time behind Bob Seagren of
Southern California. His efforts
also earned him the Athlete of
the Meet award.
'Vaughan Scratches at 25'
Vaughan, who two weeks ago
leaped had trouble with
his steps and was unable to sur
pass that distance officially.
However, he did hit 25'-2" on
two jumps but scratched by less
than an inch on both of them.
Roger Cox ran 6.2 In the "60
yard dash, but was unable to
place in the fast field. Bud
Walsh clocked 7.3 in the pre
liminaries of the 60 yard high
hurdles, for his best time of the
season, but he injured a muscle
and was able to run only 7.5
sec. in the finals. That time was

good for sixth place.
Chuck Menz and Mike Dono
ley faired well in the unusual
Devil Take The Hindmost Mile,
where the last man in each lap
is cut from the race, leaving
only three men still running In
the eleventh and final lap.
Menz was fifth and Donoley
finished third with a time of
4:28, which is a fast time con
sidering the gruelling pace one
is forced to run to keep from
being last in the field at the
end of a lap.

The mile relay team of Russ
Taplin, Dan Woodruff, Larry
Larson, and Jim Ward finished
third with a time of 3:26.0, the
best time of the year for them.
