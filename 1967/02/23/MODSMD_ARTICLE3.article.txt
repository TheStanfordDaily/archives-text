# Harris: Career Of Commitment

Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
