# Harris: Career Of Commitment
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.
An end to war will come he said,
only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be
be jailed for his resistence to the
md his pre
dominantly male audience to re
- and join him
in jail.
Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.
Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.

lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.
An end to war will come he said,
only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be
be jailed for his resistence to the
md his pre
dominantly male audience to re
- and join him
in jail.
Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.
Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.

the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.
An end to war will come he said,
only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be
be jailed for his resistence to the
md his pre
dominantly male audience to re
- and join him
in jail.
Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.
Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.

part, "He broke fresh ground —

the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.
An end to war will come he said,
only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be
be jailed for his resistence to the
md his pre
dominantly male audience to re
- and join him
in jail.
Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.
Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."

a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.
An end to war will come he said,
only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be
be jailed for his resistence to the
md his pre
dominantly male audience to re
- and join him
in jail.
Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.
Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.

Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents

representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.

only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be

Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.
Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free

Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal

sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.
An end to war will come he said,
only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be
be jailed for his resistence to the
md his pre
dominantly male audience to re
- and join him
in jail.
Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.

was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os

Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
Few people were more surprised
than Dave Harris when he was elect
ed president of ASSU last year. He
won by 565 votes out of a total of
4296, the largest turnout for any stu
dent election in Stanford's history.
"Originally, we ruled out the idea
of winning," he said at the time. "Our
intention was to make the rest of the
candidates speak to the important is
sues."
Harris had toyed with the idea of
running for ASSU president as early
as two years ago, but at that time,
he says, it was "pure fantasy." When
the time came for nominating peti
tions to be submitted last spring, he
almost didn't run. His petition was
turned in almost at the last minute.
Even during the campaign, he says,
his main effort was simply to stir up
discussion. He and his post-primary

opponent, Bob Klein, were long-time
personal friends.
The editors of The Dally called his
election "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has
been subtly brewing within the Stan
ford student community the past few
years." The defeated finalist said that
"under the leadership of Dave Harris,
this student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on edu
cational reform within the context of
a larger educational community."
Regarding his victory, Harris said
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of figure to weld their dis
sent around."
For most people, Harris was—and
still is—the personification of campus
radicalism. His appearance gave the
first clues—long hair, moustache, rim
less glasses, wrinkled clothes, no tie.
But the difference between him and
the ordinary politician went deeper.

Harris was profoundly committed to
change, to "building a better model of
education." And university adminis
trators, in his view, were often the
chief obstacles to reform.
Harris was not always a radical.
He admits that when he first came to
Stanford, he was "an all-American
frosh type." A good deal of the meta
morphis came, he says, after a trip to
Mississippi. He went, in characteristic
fashion, after a last minute decision,
and the hatred and brutality he en
countered there while he worked for
Negro civil rights "blew my mind."
Summer '66
Harris and other students met last
June with faculty and administrators
in June for the Asilomar Conference.
In discussions on educational reform
at Stanford, they reached general
agreement on the desirability of an
expanded pass-fail grading system,
analysis of housing programs,
and other changes. Harris also
worked that summer in Stan
ford's administrative intern pro
gram.
He led the Stanford delegation
to the National Student Con
gress in Illinois last summer.
He quickly became the most
widely known spokesman for a
radical faction of the Liberal
Caucus. A resolution on the
Vietnam war, proposed mainly
by Harris, called for immediate
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and characterized the war as an
attempt to further "the Ameri
can empire ... in a calculated
barbaric fashion . . . against the
will of the indiginous popula
tion." The resolution failed to
pass the caucus after a debate
that lasted until 4:30 in the
morning.
The caucus did pass a resolu
tion calling for a cense fire, ne
gotiations, free elections and
withdrawal of support from the
Ky regime. During the debate,
Harris said, "If you come out
with this resolution, you will be
saying you feel strongly about
the war but you don't want to
say it."
Walk Out
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone de
bate over a resolution on the
draft. At this point, Harris and
a number of other delegates
walked out of the meeting in
protest. They assembled later
at a "radical caucus," during
which Harris said, "My reason
for breaking off from the Lib
eral Caucus is not because my
resolution didn't get passed. It
is because of the mechanism we
are forced to work with. That
mechanism is inadequate for the
kind of society I want to build."
The anti-draft resolution pro
posed by Harris was softened
by the Liberal Caucus and even
tually passed the Congress.
In an interview, Harris cited
the Liberal Caucus as an exam
ple of the conflict between con
tent and form. He said the em
phasis on united political stands
destroys the value of discussion.
It points up the fact, he main
tained, that "politics is a matter
of backstabbing."
Significant Departure
The defection of the Harris
group was apparently a signifi
cant departure from the normal
easy Liberal Caucus control of
the annual student congresses.
One observer at the radicals'
meeting after the split with the
Liberal Caucus commented, "I'm
not a member of the "radical
caucus" and I disagree with
what you stand for. But I want
to tell you that this is the first
time at this Congress I have
heard people get together and
say what is wrong with NSA.
You are trying to stop playing
the political game and say what
luck."
By the time the school year
started last September, Harris'
fame had had a chance to reach
many more parts of the coun
try. But those freshmen who
missed seeing his picture in
Time got to hear him speak dur
ing pre-registration week.
Side Shows
"Universities must see them
selves as apparatuses which are
largely side shows to education.
Real education is taking place
among students," he told 1300
incoming students. "Anyone
from the lowest teaching assist
ant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students
and explain what he's doing,
how he's doing it, and how this
affects education."
The following week, Harris
spoke to freshmen at Branner
Hall and elaborated on his
views about the University
( ideally it should be a four
year leave of absence from so
ciety"); fraternities ("They are
small worlds functioning around
pre-established ideas."); getting
a degree ("strictly a business
proposition. Tt has nothing to do
with education."); and grades
("They make education an ex
ternal realization instead of an
internal one.").
Rebuttals To Harris
At the same time, Harris be
gan receiving rebuttals from
such critics as R. W. Madison,
the "Old Timer," who wrote in

a letter to The Daily saying that
Harris was "presumptuous to
assume anyone in his right mind
would go for his so-called 'phi
losophies' that only affect one's
self and to hell with anything or
anyone else."
At about this time, the ASSU
Housing Commission began
work on its sweeping study of
University residences. The com
mission chairman, Jan Jacobi,
had been appointed the previous
spring to be Harris' chief advi
sor on housing affairs. Last fall,
his official connection with Har
ris ended as he took over the
work of organizing the indepen
dent commission. Jacobi says,
however, that Harris kept in
very close touch with the com
mission even though he exer
cised no direct control of it
whatever.
After three weeks in office,
Harris evaluated the work of his
administration. "We're trying to
involve the whole student com
munity, rather than having a
few people playing power poli
tics. Because I don't see myself
as an organizer, going around
leading all the crusades, my job
should be more of an 'input' of
ideas and suggestions."
Many Unsolved Problems
There were still many un
solved problems, of course.
Women were pressing for the
right to live off campus, the
ASSU coffee house issue was
stirring up controversy, and
ideas were flying for student
run cooperative stores and dor
mitories.
Meanwhile LASSU condition
ally approved Harris' appoint
ment of himself and four other
students to the Committee of 15.
And in mid-October the Univer
sity announced that gifts and
contributions had fallen off but
added that the decrease could
not be attributed to Harris' ac
tivities as student body presi
dent.
Soon afterward, Harris pub
licly denounced the military
draft system in a forum on con
scientious objection. He had
sent his 11-S student classifica
tion back to his draft board last
summer. Later, in December, he
was reclassified I-A.
Now he said he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft
at all. Application for conscien
tious objector infers that the
draft board has the right to
make the decision." At the pres
ent time, he has passed his phy
sical and is awaiting further
word on his status.
In late October some dispute
arose concerning one of Harris'
appointments to the Committee
of 15. LASSU refused to confirm
the appointment of Jan Handke
when she failed to appear be
fore it. Harris stood firm, but
when a deadlock subsequently
developed between him and cer
tain legislators who were just
as firmly against Miss Handke's
appointment, Harris nominated
Sara Syer insttead. (Miss Syer's
nomination was subsequently
approved by LASSU.)
Ignominious Haircut
On October 20, as Harris was
leaving that LASSU meeting, he
was waylayed by about 20 mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, who pinned him down
and shaved his head. The cam
pus reacted immediately to the
attack by the masked fraternity
men. A letter signed by 23 other
fraternity men condemned the
assault as "unacceptable behav
ior in the university communi
ty." The Dean of Students an
nounced at first that he was re
ferring the case to the Judicial
Council.
Students reacted variously;
some thought it was humorous,
some serious. One student said,
"If they reprimand those guys,
I'll help them cut off the rest of
it." Another said, "The haircut
was tantamount to symbolic cas
tration." The president of Delta
Tau Delta house said he did not
think the attack was either per
sonal or malicious. He pointed
to the fact that Harris' beard
was left intact and that his at
tackers had even offered him a
cigarette while they were shav
ing his head.
Later it was announced that
a Delt alumnus was so pleased
with the incident that he treated
the entire Delt house to a steak
dinner.

Harris' comment was, "I've
often thought something like
this might happen. I've won
dered what makes people do
things like that."
The University launched an
investigation into the incident,
a move which would ordinarily
have been reserved for the Ju
dicial Council. The Council did,
however, conduct an investiga
tion of its own, on the basis of
which it placed 22 Delts on pro
bation. The Dean's office placed
12 other Delts on probation.
Challenge To Sterling
In early November Harris
challenged President Sterling's
decision to name students to
Presidential Committees who
had not been nominated by Har
ris or LASSU. Harris asked the
students he had not nominated
to resign from the committees
as a gesture of "student solidar
ity." He claimed that "students
named to the committees with
out being designated by the stu
dent body president and en
dorsed by LASSU cannot claim
to represent the student body.
. . . It's a matter of constituency
and representation. Dr. Sterling
should realize this."
At the same time, LASSU
passed a resolution sponsored
by Harris calling for the estab
lishment of a pass-fail grading
system for freshman vear He
said it would take tremendous
pressure off the freshmen, add
ing, "For education to take
place, a certain calm is neces
sary." The resolution is still
being considered by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
In mid-November, the ASSU
Education Commission began
looking into possible areas for
research and action. At its first
meeting, Harris stressed that
the Commision "shouldn't be
oriented toward practical poli
tics. The idea is not to find
something acceptable. It is to
find something good." Once
good ideas were presented, he

said, it would be the work of
smaller committees to make
them acceptable. Some of the
commission's subcommittee's
are still conducting their stud
ies.
Conscientious Objector
In December, Harris was clas
sified 1-A by his draft board. He
then appealed for conscientious
objector status, but said he was
not sure he would take even al
ternative service, as the Selective
Service System requires. "I am a
conscientious objector," he said,
"but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows."
Also in December, Harris and
other student body presidents
and college newspaper editors —
representing 100 campuses in all
—sent an open letter to Presi
dent Johnson demanding free
discussion about the Vietnam
war. Though he signed the letter,
Harris said later that he didn't
think it said enough and com
plained that it was "too respect
ful."
In January, Harris' stand a
gainst Selective Service became
stronger. Speaking at a noon
rally in White Plaza, he called for
concerted opposition to the draft.
An end to war will come he said,
only when "we, the conscriptees,
refuse to be cannon fodder any
more." He said he expected to be
be jailed for his resistence to the
md his pre
dominantly male audience to re
- and join him
in jail.
Packer Committee Dispute
The first week in January,
Harris urged students to partici
pate in a rent payment boycott
to dramatize student requests
for upperclass women to have
the option of living off campus.
The issue has not yet been fully
resolved.
When the administration an
nounced that it was choosing the
student members of the new
Steering Committee for the
Study of Education at Stanford

(the so-called Packer Commit
tee), a dispute began over the
fact that students themselves
were not choosing the student
members. LASSU proposed cir
culating a petition to ask that the
members be chosen by a joint
student - faculty committee. Har
ris stated, "We have to fight for
representation. This is not a
small power problem of politics.
It concerns the whole problem of
the way people look at the Uni
versity."
Early this month Harris and
35 other student body presidents
from around the country attend
ed a closed conference in Wash
ington with Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. The meeting came
as a result of the letter of protest
against the Vietnam war, sent to
the President late last year Hy
100 student leaders.
Harris said most of the group
were moderates, but most of
them left the meeting more op
posed to the war than before it,
"except for myself, and that's
only because I've reached the
saturation point."
When the student members of
the Packer Committee were
named two weeks ago, Harris
spoke at another rally in White
Plaza. He called the committee
a "sophisticated whitewash" and
called upon students to recognize
their collective power. Differ
ences between student and ad
ministration positions still per
sist.

The ASSU Housing Commis

was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os

Dedication To Harris
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion Report, released last week,
was dedicated to Dr. Maurice Os
borne, head of the Stanford
Health Service, and David Har
ris. The dedication to Harris was
a quotation from the works of
Dag Hammsrskjold. It said, in
part, "He broke fresh ground —
because, and only because he had
the courage to go ahead without
asking whether others were fol
lowing or even understood."
And Tuesday, David Harris
turned in his resignation.
