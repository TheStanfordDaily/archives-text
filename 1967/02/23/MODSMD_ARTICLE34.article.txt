## No Answers From Humphrey 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with President Ster
ling that "it is unfortunate that
. . . a group of students and
non-students . . . attempted un
successfully to impede his
(Humphrey's) departure." We
had hoped to be successful in
impeding Humphrey's departure
and will try to do a better, more
organized job next time. Per
haps we can even keep Hum
phrey around long enough so
that our questions will be an
swered instead of cleverly
evaded.
Secondly, I question the right
of President Sterling to apolo
gize in the name of Stanford
University. It seems to me that
those of us who took part in
this "incident" are part of Stan
ford also. By what authority
does Mr. Sterling apologize for
my actions and the actions of
other students and faculty?
Many of us feel no need to apol
ogize. Tn fact, I suspect many
feel that Mr. Humphrey owes
us an apology for insulting our
intelligence with cute phrases
and canned garbage.
Finally, as far as causing
HHH any "Inconvenience or em
barrassment," I am deeply
sorry. However, my sorrow is
tempered somewhat because it
seems clear that what we are
doing in Vietnam is a little more
than inconvenient and embar
rassing; and as long as Hubert
Humphrey and this government
continue a genocidal war and
call it "moral," they can expect
continual inconvenience, embar
rassment, and harassment from
that segment of society which
still has a conscience.

Editor, The Dally:
As a Stanford graduate stu
dent and concerned American
citizen, I was greatly disturbed
by some of the incidents attend
ing the visit of the Vice Presi
dent to our campus
The seating arrangements at
Memorial Auditorium were
vaguely reminiscent of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee hearings held in San
Francisco several years ago and
certainly not in keeping with
the tradition of one of America's
finest universities. Further, the
concern of President Sterling
seemed to focps more on insur
ing Mr. Humphrey's conveni
ence than on helping to reflect
to the Vice President and the
administration the representa
tive views of the academic com
munity.
In view of this situation it is
more understandable why the
Vice President says"I have
never found out" why a large
and growing fraction of the aca
demic community strongly op
poses the administration posi
tion in Vietnam.

• A Disgrace
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that, Irrespec
tive of one's convictions con
cerning Vietnam, the conduct of
Vice-President Humphrey on
this campus was disgraceful. It
served finally to convince me of
the insidious corruption of this
society, yet for all of us as mem
bers of an intellectual commu
nity it should have been appal
ling.
Any man who attempts, as
Humphrey did here, to turn
moral protest of an ugly war to
his own political advantage com
mits an act callous beyond
words. That Humphrey should
have committed such an act iti
the name of freedom of intel
lectual discourse is only more a
disgrace, and a reflection upon
the community that allowed it.
Humphrey refused utterly to
admit that the wisdom and mor
ality of our policy in Vietnam
could still be deeply problemati
cal for Americans. The first and
most basic rule of a common
intellectual life is that all par
ties must admit to a problem
where a problem exists.
No matter how great the exi
gencies of this war, and no mat
ter how thoroughly he is con
vinced of the lightness of it, for
Humphrey to ignore (he misgiv

ings and protests of many mem
bers of this community is to
place himself beyond the point
past which a man is no longer
granted the respect and courte
sies of an intellectual commu
nity.
It seems to me that from the
beginning Monday Humphrey
had placed himself beyond that
point. In itself, that is a disap
pointment; the disgrace is that
the man could attempt to ma
nipulate to his own political ad
vantage the protest of members
of his audience to his personal
and intellectual arrogance, and
to our policy in Vietnam.
For Humphrey first to ignore
the moral anguish of members
of this community, and then to
distort to his own ends the pro
test arising from that anguish is
in my mind an utter disgrace
and a crime. I am ashamed of
him, and I am ashamed of the
part of this community so shal
low in its respect for others,
and in its respect for the rules
by which intellectual life is to
be guided, that this could have
been allowed here.

• Storm Troopers
Editor, The Dally:
Watching the conduct of a
substantial portion of Stanford's
so-called "intellectual" and "en
ligtened" student body at Mon
day's speech by Vice President
Humphrey left me feeling both
sick at the sight of their intol
erance and ashamed of member
ship in an academic community
which has become a breeding
ground for the type of hate and
intolerance which justifies sup
pression of debate and assault
of those who do not agree on
the dubious basis that "the end
justifies the means."
I had always thought that in
tolerance and a willingness to
listen to the views of others
(and especially to let others be
heard) was a characteristic of
intellectual maturity. And Stan
ford, I had heard, was an intel
lectually enlightened place.
Yet, while Vice President
Humphrey spoke in Memorial
Auditorium, the young dema
gogues of the new left did their
best to prevent the large crowd
gathered outside of the audito
rium from hearing what the
Vice President had to say. They
ranted and raved, quoted Radio
Hanoi and The Peking Review,
and generally made themselves
obnoxious to those trying hard
to listen to Mr. Humphrey.
Then, these young storm
troopers (sporting armbands,
no less), after attempting to as
sault the Vice President as he
left the auditorium, began urg
ing people to follow Humphrey
to a San Francisco speaking en
gagement where they were (I
quote) "going to make so much
noise that no one will be able
to hear him."
This brand of "intellectual en
lightenment" to which we in the

Stanford community are becom
ing accustomed would hardly
be recognized as such by the
18th century Frenchman who
wrote "I disapprove of what you
say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it."

• Why Apologize?
Editor, The Daily:
In this world of cheerful ro
bots, it is perhaps no great sur
prise that an official of this uni
versity should feel it necessary
to apologize to Vice President
Humphrey for his treatment by
anti-war demonstrators Monday.
To imply that the demonstration
was influenced by "non-stu
dents" as did President Sterling
in his statement published in
Tuesday's Chronicle, however, is
a blatant distortion of fact and
a crude display of intellectual
irresponsibility.
The protest was planned on
the Stanford campus by Stan
ford students and faculty; all
•of the protestors in Memorial
Auditorium — as Mr. Sterling
well knows — were from the-
Stanford community; and if
there were any non-students
among those outside the audito
rium their number was insig
nificant.
Perhaps Mr. Sterling also does
not know that a university is a
community of students and
scholars which in no way can
be represented by a single man,
even if he happens to be its ap
pointed president. In this sense,
his apology on behalf of the
Stanford community is an ob
vious exercise in self-deception;
Sterling speaks not for Stanford
but for himself, and this he
should have the candor to ad
mit. Even wore he truly to ex
press his individual regrets,
however, he might better have
directed his words to the stu
dent body than to the press.
Humphrey's mindless men
dacity, his calculated causistry,
his refusal to speak to the is
sues were insults to the intelli
gence of the Stanford commu
nity. The attempt by students
personally to confront the Vice
President, to make it clear that
a large number of Stanford stu
dents rejected his arrogant jus
tification of mass killings was
the only moral and responsible
answer to his entirely spacious
performance in Memorial Audi
torium. The vocal and vigorous
action of these demonstrators is
commendable, for they spoke
when silence had become irre
sponsibility, they acted when
inaction had come to mean ap
proval. By contrast, the sophis
try of a university official, who
should know better, is deplor
able. RICHARD GILLAM

• Get Serious
Editor, The Daily:
Before Monday morning 1 was
willing to listen to both sides in
the Vietnam controversy, and I

felt that the people opposing
the administration's policies
were serious in their protest. I
am still willing to listen to both
sides of the argument, but Mon
day's post-speech rush on Vice
President Humphrey convinced
me that many of the "immediate
de-escalation" people cannot be
taken seriously.
These people seem to believe
that the administration is com
mitting a moral wrong by using
military force to accomplish its
ends in Southeast Asia. And yet,
during a demonstration to voice
their opinion on the matter,
they themselves resorted to mob
tactics and Violence. In their
protest, they used the very
methods they were protesting.
They said, "Peace in Vietnam!
Let's jump the Vice Presi
dent." Obviously these people
cannot have considered serious
ly and taken to heart what they
are trying to say.

• Not All Of Us
Editor, The Daily:
A front page account of the

Vice President's visit by your
reporter in Tuesday's Daily
bore the prominent title "Fac
ulty Feel V.P. Skirted Issues."
A number of colleagues and I
were present at the meeting: no
one approached us for our opin
ions yet your reporter presumes
to speak for the faculty.
Honesty in reporting would
seem to require that the report
er state the size of the sample
interviewed, whether ihe sam
pling included those without
white arm bands, and what the
specific results were If the sam
pling was restricted to the few
names mentioned in the article,
it was biased to begin with and
under no circumstances justified
the general conclusion implicit
in the title.
As for the activities of the pro
testers, 1 might have been a
little more sympathetic had I
seen even one sign protesting
the deliberate atrocities perpe
trated against civilians by the
Viet Cong, atrocities which start
ed long before American in
volvement in Vietnam.
