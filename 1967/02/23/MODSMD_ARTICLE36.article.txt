# 'He Broke Fresh Ground'
## 
### 
David Harris has resigned as student body
president. He will be missed.
The inspired goals for which he fought are
far from achieved â€”the intellectual community
of scholars he so clearly envisioned remains a
dream; the university is still governed from
without rather than within; an education is still
viewed by many as a commodity rather than
as a process, and reform has hardly been in
stitutionalized.
But a year ago all of these were only vague
ideals held by a tiny fragment of the Univer
sity community. Today they have at least been
brought to the attention of the whole com
munity, and here lies the great contribution of
David Harris. He has been able to communi
cate to students, who once understood educa
tion to be the process of absorbing what was

thrown at them in the classroom, that there is
something much greater to be sought: some
thing as likely to be found at home as in the
classroom, as often to be gained from one's
peers as one's elders.
This communication has always been his stated
goal. By his own admission, he is not the person
to direct the bureaucracy necessary to run this
University. What he promised was to talk about
the issues, to do his best to bring the educa
tion message to the entire community. He has
done what he promised, and leaves to the rest
of us the challenge to implement his lofty
ideals. The challenge is one we must all accept.
The full effect of his presidency will only
be known when, in the hopefully not-too-dis
tant future, his ideas have been translated into
reality.
And David Harris will have been the prophet.
