# Insult Added To Injury
## 
### 
Hubert Humphrey's appearance at Stanford
was an insult to the academic community, not
so much because of what he said, but because
of the way he said it. He apparently does not
understand the difference between a University
and a Democratic women's tea.
The Vice President was invited to participate
in a dialogue with the members of this com
munity, but did nothing more than repeat the
line that has been heard so often from a multi
tude of officials ranging from the President to
minor State Department employees. Humphrey
did not answer the questions he wa.s asked. In
stead, he offered only a barrage of cliches,
generalizations, and contradictions. Having
once had the "dubious honor" of being a pro
fessor, he should have known better than to
talk down to his audience; some mention of
the United States' foreign policy dilemma, for
instance, would have been more appropriate
for his opening remarks than his inane chat
tering on Time magazine's "now generation."
The strongest indication of the Vice Presi
dent's naivete appeared in his claim that the
academic community stands firmly behind the
present Administration. The loud applause of
his supporters in Memorial Auditorium could
not conceal the discontent of the numerous
protesters both inside and outside. It should

not minimize the significance of a protest sup
ported by a number of Stanford's most dis
tinguished faculty members. And it will never
eliminate the disillusionment of the two thou
sand students who begged the Vice President
to answer some of their questions.
If many in the academic community are, in
deed, behind President Johnson's policies, then
they have yet to be heard from. Ironically,
the only group at Stanford to welcome the
Vice President was the Young Republicans.
Where are the Administration's supporters
whenever there is a rally or teach-in? Where
are they when the issues are openly discussed?
Are they afraid of their views or are they just
less articulate than the Administration's opposi
tion? If these supporters really do exist, then
they do so only as statistics, for they have so
far not contributed their voices to the existing
dialogue.
President Sterling has apologized in the name
of Stanford for Monday's incident, implying,
with excuses reminiscent of Berkeley, that non
students were in part responsible for the dis
turbance as the Vice President tried to leave.
This interpretation of the facts is disquieting.
President Sterling may have been disturbed,
but many Stanford students were not; they
were indignant and should have been.

the United States' foreign policy dilemma, for
instance, would have been more appropriate
for his opening remarks than his inane chat
tering on Time magazine's "now generation."
The strongest indication of the Vice Presi
dent's naivete appeared in his claim that the
academic community stands firmly behind the
present Administration. The loud applause of
his supporters in Memorial Auditorium could
not conceal the discontent of the numerous
protesters both inside and outside. It should

not minimize the significance of a protest sup
ported by a number of Stanford's most dis
tinguished faculty members. And it will never
eliminate the disillusionment of the two thou
sand students who begged the Vice President
to answer some of their questions.
If many in the academic community are, in
deed, behind President Johnson's policies, then
they have yet to be heard from. Ironically,
the only group at Stanford to welcome the
Vice President was the Young Republicans.
Where are the Administration's supporters
whenever there is a rally or teach-in? Where
are they when the issues are openly discussed?
Are they afraid of their views or are they just
less articulate than the Administration's opposi
tion? If these supporters really do exist, then
they do so only as statistics, for they have so
far not contributed their voices to the existing
dialogue.
President Sterling has apologized in the name
of Stanford for Monday's incident, implying,
with excuses reminiscent of Berkeley, that non
students were in part responsible for the dis
turbance as the Vice President tried to leave.
This interpretation of the facts is disquieting.
President Sterling may have been disturbed,
but many Stanford students were not; they
were indignant and should have been.
Hubert Humphrey's appearance at Stanford
was an insult to the academic community, not
so much because of what he said, but because
of the way he said it. He apparently does not
understand the difference between a University
and a Democratic women's tea.
The Vice President was invited to participate
in a dialogue with the members of this com
munity, but did nothing more than repeat the
line that has been heard so often from a multi
tude of officials ranging from the President to
minor State Department employees. Humphrey
did not answer the questions he wa.s asked. In
stead, he offered only a barrage of cliches,
generalizations, and contradictions. Having
once had the "dubious honor" of being a pro
fessor, he should have known better than to
talk down to his audience; some mention of
the United States' foreign policy dilemma, for
instance, would have been more appropriate
for his opening remarks than his inane chat
tering on Time magazine's "now generation."
