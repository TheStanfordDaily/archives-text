# When A College Forum Is A Propaganda Base...

### DAVE GLICK 
Amid the controversy over the
walk-out on Vice President Hu
bert Humphrey, one fact should
not be lost—that those who
walked out and those who sat in
silence agree that the adminis
tration's policy in Vietnam is a
moral outrage and a legal tra
vesty, and that to mobilize pub
lic support, the administration
has resorted to the distorting
cliches of its Cold War liberal
rhetoric.
But while both groups share
a common disapproval of the
war and a common desire for
instant and sincere peace efforts
by our government, the ques
tion of strategy divided us. In a
meeting held at The Experiment
the Wednesday evening prior to
Humphrey's visit, roughly 100
students and a few professors
discussed the methods by which
we would demonstrate to Hum
phrey and the community at
large our moral outrage over
the Vietnam war.
The proposal of a silent pro
test was discussed and voted
down. A second proposal, to dis
rupt the meeting so as to pre
vent its taking place, was voted
down virtually unanimously,
with but three or four votes in
favor. The third alternative, the
orderly walk-out that took place,
then was voted on and received
an overwhelming majority of
votes.
Different Angles
The divided opinion over strat
egy can essentially be accounted
for by differing perceptions of
efficacy. Those of us who sup
ported a walk-out—and among
us were numerous faculty mem
bers — did so because we be
lieved the effect of a silent pro
test would be greatly mitigated
by the applause of all those who
would receive Humphrey warm
ly.
Even if half the audience re
spected the silent protest, such
efforts would only lend a hollow
quality to the existing applause.
And to a politician conscious of
public opinion, even hollow ap
plause could be interpreted as
an endorsement. But we wanted
it clear we give Hubert Hum
phrey and American oppression
in Vietnam no such endorse
ment.
We therefore sought a more
visible means of demonstrating
to Humphrey the ever-increas
ing disapproval of America's
academic community to the ad
ministration's policy in Vietnam.
If we failed to demonstrate our
disapproval, we would have
given up all claim to any moral
or intellectual integrity. And
too, if the administration is led
to believe that it has duped the
academic community — those
that should know — where is
there hope of change?
Believing that only a consen
sus of public opinion against
the war can coerce our recalci
trant administration into gen
uinely seeking peace, both forms
of protest were designed to give
witness to disapproval of Viet
nam policy, and to enlist the
support of those sympathetic to
our position.
To those who say we who

walked out are closed-minded,
we would have you listen to our
point of view. We do not oppose
freedom of speech. We were, in
fact, glad that those undecided
and those in favor of the war
could listen to Humphrey, hop
ing, of course, that they too
would see through the shamness
of his empty words.
Ironically, it is because we do
cherish freedom of speech that
we walked out on the Vice
President. For the futility of
any genuine dialogue was evi
dent to those of us who have
heard the same verbiage
mouthed by a McNamara, Tay
lor or Rusk, be it in the mass
media or in a supposed college
forum like the one here. If the
administration did have honest
answers which spoke to our crit
icism, would they not have pub
licized them by now?
Call That Dialogue?
We believe the administration
is already firmly committed to
its position in Vietnam and came
here not to engage in a genuine
exchange of ideas with the aca
demic community but to peddle
once again its spurious Cold
War liberalism. Moreover, we
now feel that the occasion
proved our contention.
The format was such that no
real dialogue ensued. A ques
tion was asked by each panel
member and the Vice President
responded. Later, the Vice Pres
ident responded to questions re
ceived from the audience, but
again no exchange took place.
Humphrey's visit thus pro
duced nothing unexpected. As
was anticipated, he took as his
underlying assumption that we
should be in Vietnam and have
a commitment to be there. These
are among the very assump
tions we question and which
form part of the basis for our
criticism. Yet these are precise
ly the issues which never find
their way into the administra
tion's or the mass media's dis
cussion of Vietnam.
False Picture
We are aware that college
forums like the one held here
serve the interests of the admin
istration. For wherever the ad
ministration sends its big guns,
the situation appears to out
siders as a free exchange of
ideas. In each instance a public
leader appears to be going be
fore the people to engage in
give-and-take dialogue in an ef
fort to explain our Vietnam po
sition and answer criticism of it.
This is not, in effect, what
takes place. Though we acknowl
edge the attempt of the Political
Union to initiate meaningful
discourse, we resent Humphrey's
exploiting the situation in an
effort to create the false picture
of a dialogue—that precious es
sence which underlies genuine
democracy.
All we ask is for a Hubert
Humphrey to step off the podi
um and talk meaningfully to the
real issues which underlie criti
cism in true debate fashion. For
it is the administration's unwar
ranted credability, parading in
the guise of liberal cliches, that
must be exposed as fraudulent
and immoral.

lor or Rusk, be it in the mass
media or in a supposed college
forum like the one here. If the
administration did have honest
answers which spoke to our crit
icism, would they not have pub
licized them by now?
Call That Dialogue?
We believe the administration
is already firmly committed to
its position in Vietnam and came
here not to engage in a genuine
exchange of ideas with the aca
demic community but to peddle
once again its spurious Cold
War liberalism. Moreover, we
now feel that the occasion
proved our contention.
The format was such that no
real dialogue ensued. A ques
tion was asked by each panel
member and the Vice President
responded. Later, the Vice Pres
ident responded to questions re
ceived from the audience, but
again no exchange took place.
Humphrey's visit thus pro
duced nothing unexpected. As
was anticipated, he took as his
underlying assumption that we
should be in Vietnam and have
a commitment to be there. These
are among the very assump
tions we question and which
form part of the basis for our
criticism. Yet these are precise
ly the issues which never find
their way into the administra
tion's or the mass media's dis
cussion of Vietnam.
False Picture
We are aware that college
forums like the one held here
serve the interests of the admin
istration. For wherever the ad
ministration sends its big guns,
the situation appears to out
siders as a free exchange of
ideas. In each instance a public
leader appears to be going be
fore the people to engage in
give-and-take dialogue in an ef
fort to explain our Vietnam po
sition and answer criticism of it.
This is not, in effect, what
takes place. Though we acknowl
edge the attempt of the Political
Union to initiate meaningful
discourse, we resent Humphrey's
exploiting the situation in an
effort to create the false picture
of a dialogue—that precious es
sence which underlies genuine
democracy.
All we ask is for a Hubert
Humphrey to step off the podi
um and talk meaningfully to the
real issues which underlie criti
cism in true debate fashion. For
it is the administration's unwar
ranted credability, parading in
the guise of liberal cliches, that
must be exposed as fraudulent
and immoral.
Amid the controversy over the
walk-out on Vice President Hu
bert Humphrey, one fact should
not be lost—that those who
walked out and those who sat in
silence agree that the adminis
tration's policy in Vietnam is a
moral outrage and a legal tra
vesty, and that to mobilize pub
lic support, the administration
has resorted to the distorting
cliches of its Cold War liberal
rhetoric.
But while both groups share
a common disapproval of the
war and a common desire for
instant and sincere peace efforts
by our government, the ques
tion of strategy divided us. In a
meeting held at The Experiment
the Wednesday evening prior to
Humphrey's visit, roughly 100
students and a few professors
discussed the methods by which
we would demonstrate to Hum
phrey and the community at
large our moral outrage over
the Vietnam war.
The proposal of a silent pro
test was discussed and voted
down. A second proposal, to dis
rupt the meeting so as to pre
vent its taking place, was voted
down virtually unanimously,
with but three or four votes in
favor. The third alternative, the
orderly walk-out that took place,
then was voted on and received
an overwhelming majority of
votes.
Different Angles
The divided opinion over strat
egy can essentially be accounted
for by differing perceptions of
efficacy. Those of us who sup
ported a walk-out—and among
us were numerous faculty mem
bers — did so because we be
lieved the effect of a silent pro
test would be greatly mitigated
by the applause of all those who
would receive Humphrey warm
ly.
Even if half the audience re
spected the silent protest, such
efforts would only lend a hollow
quality to the existing applause.
And to a politician conscious of
public opinion, even hollow ap
plause could be interpreted as
an endorsement. But we wanted
it clear we give Hubert Hum
phrey and American oppression
in Vietnam no such endorse
ment.
We therefore sought a more
visible means of demonstrating
to Humphrey the ever-increas
ing disapproval of America's
academic community to the ad
ministration's policy in Vietnam.
If we failed to demonstrate our
disapproval, we would have
given up all claim to any moral
or intellectual integrity. And
too, if the administration is led
to believe that it has duped the
academic community — those
that should know — where is
there hope of change?
Believing that only a consen
sus of public opinion against
the war can coerce our recalci
trant administration into gen
uinely seeking peace, both forms
of protest were designed to give
witness to disapproval of Viet
nam policy, and to enlist the
support of those sympathetic to
our position.
To those who say we who

walked out are closed-minded,
we would have you listen to our
point of view. We do not oppose
freedom of speech. We were, in
fact, glad that those undecided
and those in favor of the war
could listen to Humphrey, hop
ing, of course, that they too
would see through the shamness
of his empty words.
Ironically, it is because we do
cherish freedom of speech that
we walked out on the Vice
President. For the futility of
any genuine dialogue was evi
dent to those of us who have

with but three or four votes in
favor. The third alternative, the
orderly walk-out that took place,
then was voted on and received
an overwhelming majority of
votes.
Different Angles
The divided opinion over strat
egy can essentially be accounted
for by differing perceptions of
efficacy. Those of us who sup
ported a walk-out—and among
us were numerous faculty mem
bers — did so because we be
lieved the effect of a silent pro
test would be greatly mitigated
by the applause of all those who
would receive Humphrey warm
ly.
Even if half the audience re
spected the silent protest, such
efforts would only lend a hollow
quality to the existing applause.
And to a politician conscious of
public opinion, even hollow ap
plause could be interpreted as
an endorsement. But we wanted
it clear we give Hubert Hum
phrey and American oppression
in Vietnam no such endorse
ment.
We therefore sought a more
visible means of demonstrating
to Humphrey the ever-increas
ing disapproval of America's
academic community to the ad
ministration's policy in Vietnam.
If we failed to demonstrate our
disapproval, we would have
given up all claim to any moral
or intellectual integrity. And
too, if the administration is led
to believe that it has duped the
academic community — those
that should know — where is
there hope of change?
Believing that only a consen
sus of public opinion against
the war can coerce our recalci
trant administration into gen
uinely seeking peace, both forms
of protest were designed to give
witness to disapproval of Viet
nam policy, and to enlist the
support of those sympathetic to
our position.
To those who say we who

walked out are closed-minded,
we would have you listen to our
point of view. We do not oppose
freedom of speech. We were, in
fact, glad that those undecided
and those in favor of the war
could listen to Humphrey, hop
ing, of course, that they too
would see through the shamness
of his empty words.
Ironically, it is because we do
cherish freedom of speech that
we walked out on the Vice
President. For the futility of
any genuine dialogue was evi
dent to those of us who have
heard the same verbiage
mouthed by a McNamara, Tay
lor or Rusk, be it in the mass
media or in a supposed college
forum like the one here. If the
administration did have honest
answers which spoke to our crit
icism, would they not have pub
licized them by now?
Call That Dialogue?
We believe the administration
is already firmly committed to
its position in Vietnam and came
here not to engage in a genuine
exchange of ideas with the aca
demic community but to peddle
once again its spurious Cold
War liberalism. Moreover, we
now feel that the occasion
proved our contention.
The format was such that no
real dialogue ensued. A ques
tion was asked by each panel
member and the Vice President
responded. Later, the Vice Pres
ident responded to questions re
ceived from the audience, but
again no exchange took place.
Humphrey's visit thus pro
duced nothing unexpected. As
was anticipated, he took as his
underlying assumption that we
should be in Vietnam and have
a commitment to be there. These
are among the very assump
tions we question and which
form part of the basis for our
criticism. Yet these are precise
ly the issues which never find
their way into the administra
tion's or the mass media's dis
cussion of Vietnam.
False Picture
We are aware that college
forums like the one held here
serve the interests of the admin
istration. For wherever the ad
ministration sends its big guns,
the situation appears to out
siders as a free exchange of
ideas. In each instance a public
leader appears to be going be
fore the people to engage in
give-and-take dialogue in an ef
fort to explain our Vietnam po
sition and answer criticism of it.
This is not, in effect, what
takes place. Though we acknowl
edge the attempt of the Political
Union to initiate meaningful
discourse, we resent Humphrey's
exploiting the situation in an
effort to create the false picture
of a dialogue—that precious es
sence which underlies genuine
democracy.
All we ask is for a Hubert
Humphrey to step off the podi
um and talk meaningfully to the
real issues which underlie criti
cism in true debate fashion. For
it is the administration's unwar
ranted credability, parading in
the guise of liberal cliches, that
must be exposed as fraudulent
and immoral.
Amid the controversy over the
walk-out on Vice President Hu
bert Humphrey, one fact should
not be lost—that those who
walked out and those who sat in
silence agree that the adminis
tration's policy in Vietnam is a
moral outrage and a legal tra
vesty, and that to mobilize pub
lic support, the administration
has resorted to the distorting
cliches of its Cold War liberal
rhetoric.
But while both groups share
a common disapproval of the
war and a common desire for
instant and sincere peace efforts
by our government, the ques
tion of strategy divided us. In a
meeting held at The Experiment
the Wednesday evening prior to
Humphrey's visit, roughly 100
students and a few professors
discussed the methods by which
we would demonstrate to Hum
phrey and the community at
large our moral outrage over
the Vietnam war.
The proposal of a silent pro
test was discussed and voted
down. A second proposal, to dis
rupt the meeting so as to pre
vent its taking place, was voted
down virtually unanimously,
with but three or four votes in
favor. The third alternative, the
orderly walk-out that took place,
then was voted on and received
an overwhelming majority of
votes.
