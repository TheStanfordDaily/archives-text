## The 						Many Colors Of A 'Non-Student' 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
It's interesting that President
Sterling apologized for the con
duct of the "student and non
students" toward Vice President
Humphrey. I wonder whether
the use of the words "non-stu
dents" is an effort to conjure up
visions of Berkeleyites and Com
munists rushing here to take
over the demonstration (which
was not the case) or whether
the President is reticent to ad
mit that many of the so-called
non-students were In fact facul
ty members of this University.

• Killer Doves
Editor, The Daily:
As he hurriedly departed from
the side entrance of the Me

tnorial Auditorium, Vice Presi
dent Hubert Humphrey was con
fronted with a curious spectacle:
pacifists on the warpath. "MUR
DERER, MURDERER," scream
ed a dozen contorted and violent
mouths. "KILL him, SHOOT
him, SHOOT HIM" came the
chorus from these lovers of
peace. The Vice President wept
openly and said, "There are so
many of them."
At the subsequent peace meet
ing a dove spokesman urged
everyone to be present at the
San Francisco Civic Auditorium,
where Humphrey was to speak
at 3. "We won't go In. We 11 do
what they did to break up the
HUAC hearing in San Francisco
in May, 1960, (i.e., we'll riot).
We're going to make it so Hum
phrey can't speak." And then

these lovers of free speech at
Berkeley and peace in Vietnam
went home to rest up for an
exciting afternoon.

• Look Again
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Hanen's comments in his
letter on the Business School
(Daily, Feb. 21) are notable
chiefly for their obscurity, and
it is not at all clear whether
they were intended humorously
or seriously.
If Mr. Hanen was indeed seri
ous then his conclusions ought
to be questioned. Certainly his
credentials as a critic of Busi
ness School education, as well as
a judge of psychological aberra

tion (e.g., "sick, sick, sick,
SICK") have not been estab
lished. Nor has he bothered to
go beyond the hoary stereotype
of the businessman to dray his
conclusions-
The spectre of a world full
of managers with no one to man
age seems clearly contradicted
by the continued demand for
their services, in government
and education as well as busi
ness. If Mr. Hanen is suggesting
that professional managers are
obsolete, then I urge that he ex
amine the evidence. If he is sug
gesting a greater emphasis on
salesmanship or mourning the
death of the salesman, then I
urge his enrollment in a Dale
Carnegie course.

• Whither the Dream?
Editor, The Daily:
Tim Haight's article on the
American Dream is, indeed, a
message of despair. How can
leadership emerge in an affluent
society in which few care about
the death of a Negro in Missis
sippi or a soldier in Vietnam?
The so-called modern University
helps to perpetuate an adoles
cent subculture. It isolates the
student from the world and
dulls his sensitivity to the mean
ing of death. The tragedy is:
How can students create a Vi
sion of the Future without a
knowledge of the present?
