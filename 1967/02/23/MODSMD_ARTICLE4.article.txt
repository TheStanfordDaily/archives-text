# NEGROES AT STANFORD
## 'One Per Cent Hardly Enough' 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The Negro students at Stanford
have diverse backgrounds, ideas, and
attitudes. But they agree on one thing:
Stanford should have more Negroes.
Some say that if they had it to do
again, they would not come to Stan
ford unless there were more Negroes
here. Others say the situation is tol
erable and they would come again
as freshmen.
There are approximately 80 Ne
groes at Stanford this yearâ€”about
one per cent of the undergraduate
student body. Four years ago, there
were less than forty- This year's
freshman class has the largest num
ber of Negroes in Stanford's history,
with 33.
Problems
John Calmore, a senior in political
science, said that the lack of Negroes
creates problems for the few that are
here. "Negroes don't know how to
act," he said, "because there are no
points of reference."
Social life here is white, accord
ing to Calmore. "If you don't do things
the white way, you don't do them at
all. If you are real strong, you can
hit the books hard. Now, with more
Negroes here, you can go someplace
else," he said.
"If I could do it over aj;ain, I
would go to either Berkeley or
UCLA," Calmore added. "I could get
just as good an education at Berke
ley and my life would be broader."
A 1 \yilburn, a senior majoring In
biology, feels that Stanford should
admit rnpre Negroes and minority stu

dents "Many whites didn't even know
Negroes before they came here," he
Said.
Ideal Percentage
"The ideal percentage of minority
groups at Stanford should resemble
the percentage of minority groups in
the United States population," claimed
Pam Mason, a sophomore psychology
major. "This is not the place to meet
other Negroes now," she said, "but
things are beginning to happen."
Miss Mason said white values are
being imposed on her here, but the
siutation was no worse than in the
rest of the country.
A sophomore, Nate Kirtman, said
more Negroes should be admitted,
but only if they meet the admission
standards. "If they're qualified, let
them come," he said. Kirtman said he
had encountered no problems in his
social life at Stanford and the situa
tion was not much different than at
the San Francisco high school he at
tended.
One Negro who said he wouldn't go
to Stanford again unless it admitted
more Negroes was Ron Miller, a sen
ior living in Stern Hall.
Was Shocked
Miller, who attended a "99.9 per cent
Negro high school" in Oakland, said
he was shocked when he first came
to Stanford. "There are entirely dif
ferent values here," he said, "and
acceptable forms of behavior are dif
ferent."
An example of the difference is Mil
ler's yellow shoes. "When I wear
my shoes around here, people stare

at me," he said. "But when I wear
them at home, all I get is compli
ments."
Whites and Negroes should main
tain their own identities, Miller con
tinued. He said he does not deny the
whites their values, but "they should
accept the Negro for what he really
is instead of what they want him to
be."
Miller said he has encountered a
"handful" of segregationists here.
"Sometimes people don't talk to you,
or they get up and leave when you sit
down," he commented. He has over
heard others saying that he plays
"funny music."
White Values Imposed
The imposition of white values on
Negroes extends to athletic teams,
according to Miller, a football play
er. "Very few schools have coaches
that understand Negroes. They don't
realize that when they're unfair with
one Negro, it hurts the other Negroes
on the team."
Miller said although wearing a
moustache is part of the Negro cul
ture, he had to shave his off if he
wanted to play football.
John Powell, a sophomore, feels
that whites at Stanford are different
from those he went to school with in
Detroit. He said that most whites
here think the Negro should adjust to
their values, "but most Negroes have
no intention of doing this."
The whites here are naive, he con
tinued, and have apparently never
been in contact with Negroes before.
"I got along with whites at home,
but it is more difficult here," Powell
said.
Depledged SAE
Powell pledged Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon last spring, but depledged to live
in Fremont House of Stern Hall. "It
seems most natural for Negroes to
stay together," he said. There were
seven Negroes living in Fremont last
year, when Powell made his decision.
"If I knew what I know now, I
would have gone to the University of
Michigan or Harvard," Powell said.
He was accepted at both schools as
a freshman.
According to Powell, Interact, the
recently formed Negro group on cam
pus, is a good idea. "This school is
very segregated," he said, "if there is
any interaction, it's the Negro iden
tifying with the whites." Interact
was formed to promote "understand
ing" between Negroes and whites at
Stanford.
A senior psychology major, Berna
dette Nelson, said she was not shocked
when she came here, "but it was dif
ferent" There are two reasons why
she thinks she should have gone to
UCLA instead of Stanford, she said.
First, the UCLA student body is more

diverse, and second, there are more
Negroes there.
Surprised At Ignorance
Jan Hutchinson, a Lagunita soph
omore, said she likes the students
here, but was surprised at how igno
rant some of them are about Negroes.
She said Stanford was everything
she expected it to be and her social
life was not hindered. "I have never
encountered segregation or discrim
ination here," Miss Hutchinson said.
Her only complaint is that some
campus groups, mainly fraternities,
do not have much contact with Ne
groes. "Fraternities with racial clauses
are shutting out the world," she said.
"However, the fraternities here are
better than at most schools," she
added.
"The white students are either pret
ty sincere or pretty good actors," ac
cording to freshman Art Wilson.
A Negro who goes to Stanford has
to give up certain things, Wilson
said. "People are a lot warmer at
other places," he said, "and a Negro
has to give up his social life here."
Wilson said he appreciates white
parties, "but sometimes you're in the
mood for good hometown music " He
cited Interact's Malcolm X commera
tion Tuesday night as "the new
change that's coming."
Wilson's advice to Negroes who
want to come to Stanford is "Evaluate
yourself and let yourself know exactly
what's going to happen."
