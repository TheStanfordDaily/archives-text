# Wisconsin Students Blockade Chancellor
## 
### 
MADISON (AP) — 16 University
of Wisconsin students were arrested
Wednesday during a demonstration
against a chemical firm which pro
duces napalm used iti Vietnam.
The University chancellor, Robben
Fleming, was blockaded in his office
for 2 x / 2 hours as he met with leaders
of the demonstration against the Dow
Chemical Corp.
Fleming offered to ask that the stu
dents be freed but insisted that the
campus remain open for job inter
views by the company.
The 16 students were arrested on
disorderly conduct charges as they
marched on both the ouilding used
for the job interviews and on the ad
ministration building.
About 150 persons threw up a solid
wall in the corridors outside the office
where Fleming was meeting with th^

protest leaders and voiced threats to
keep the chancellor a prisoner until
the arrested students were freed.
Fleming repeated that the "free
speech" policy of the University
meant that no activities should be
barred on the campus solely because
of disagreement over belief. He said
this policy covered job interviews.
There's no prospect of backing
way from this historic principle,"
•aid Fleming. "We're willing to go
through a Berkeley for that principle.
We'll go through that tragedy."
Fleming, in recommending the
charges be dropped, offered to have
le students released on his personal
recognizance. Dane County Sheriff's
officers refused to agree to that offer.
The chancellor proceeded with plans
for an open meeting with students
later Wednesday night.
