The following are statements from students, faculty, and admtnls
tratiors, give to The Daily after it notified them of Dave Harris'
resignation as student body president.
Tom Forstenzer, Speaker of the Legislature:
If there are watersheds or turning points in the life of an insti
tution, Dave Harris' administration has been one for this university.
He has articulated profound questions about the function of the
university. In the realm of ideas he has effectively challenged those
committed to the status quo of so-called quality education, as prac
ticed at Stanford and elsewhere. He has successfully challenged stu
dents, both friends and antagonists alike, to confront the basic
questions of the student's role in the university and the proper
goals of higher education from the student point of view.
These issues are yet to be resolved, but Dave has done more than
anyone to see they are dealt with rather than ignored. We can t
ask more from any individual.
Jan Jacobi, ASSU Housing Commission Chairman:
As we attempted to say in the dedication of the Housing Com
mission Report, David Harris' greatest contribution to Stanford has
been that he, and he alone, by the strength of his convictions and
the vision he holds of the ideal educational community, has changed
the atmoshere at this University from one of stagnation to one
where change is indeed possible.
I know that his resignation has been best for him as a person,
but it fills me with a great sadness to know that Stanford, as it
presently exists, has failed to comprehend the significance of what
he has sought to accomplish.
Like Woodrow Wilson, David Harris has been years ahead of his
time, but it is my strong conviction that like Wilson, the future
shall honor him with the distinction of having been a prophet in
his own time.
Richard Lyman, Provost:
David Harris is a man of many talents. I disagree with much
that he has said and done, but there is no doubt that he has stim
ulated people-—both opponents and supporters—to think about edu
cation at Stanford.
I do not believe, as his brief letter of resignation would seem to
imply, that he has exhausted the possibilities for constructive lead
ership inherent in the position of student body president
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the Chapel:
I don't know what Dave's reasons are for resigning, and maybe
that's beside the point.
His ASSU administration has taken its toll on him, and I think
in the long run, beneficially, on official Stanford. But he's been
there long enough for all of us to see his real stature, his authentic
qualities of greatness. How often do you see a man who, in being
himself, can help you be and find yourself; in whom you're able to
detect no deviousness at all; whose compassion is no less compas
sionate for being unsentimental; who cares like hell about the
world he live in, and can somehow go on loving and believing in
the people who inhabit it, even while he protests the ways we go
on lousing it up?
For all his sharp, unremitting criticism—in part, of course, be
cause of it—all of us, and all of Stanford, and the whole college
and university scene in America are better for having had him
where he's been.
Philip Rhinelander, Philosophy Professor and Chairman of the
Committee of Fifteen:
Dave has performed a valuable service in focusing attention on
many questions which deserve careful thought and consideration.
I hope we are on the way toward making real progress in the solu
tion of important educational issues.
