# Stanford Prof Named To Investigation Of Intelligence Activity In Academia
## 
### 
Professor Gabriel Almond yester
day was named to a four-member
panel to investigate possible relations
between the American Political Sci
ence Association (APSA) and the
Central Intelligence Agency.
Robert A. Dahl, APSA president
and currently in residence at Stan
ford's Behavioral Center, convened
the special panel in the wake of a
New York Times article which
charged that two high-ranking mem
bers of APSA also held top posts in
an organization which disbursed CIA
funds to private groups.
Contacted last night, Almond said
the association's "reputation of schol
arly neutrality" has been placed in
question. "We have to find out to
what extent our own association has
been affected," he noted.
Funneling Money
In a page one article February 19,
Tho Times claimed that Operations
and Policy Research of Washington

had been used by the CIA to funnel
money to private groups.
Evron Kilpatrick, currently execu
tive director of APSA, is president of
Operation and Policy Research, and
his aide, Max Campelman. is treas
urer and general counsel of APSA.
Dahl named Almond and three oth
er past presidents of APSA to study
possible CIA influence on the associa
tion resulting from Operation and
Policy Research money.
Others named to the panel were R.
Taylor Cole, provost of Duke Uni
versity; C. Herman Pritichett, Pro
fessor of political science at the Uni
versity of California at Santa Bar
bara; and David B. Truman dean of
Columbia College, Columbia Univer
sity.
Almond told The Dally last night
the investigation would he primarily
an internal matter, but that the com
mittee might make recommendations
to the association concerning the

larger issue of the ClA's influence on
the academic community.
Neutral
"We have a reputation for being
neutral, scientific scholars," Almond
said. He said the association's reputa
tion could seriously be hurt at home
and abroad by the affair.
In his letter to the four scholars,
Dahl said he was "sickened and
alarmed" by the news accounts of the
ClA's activities.
"The CIA has penetrated academic
and cultural circles through founda
tions and pseudo-foundations to which
they channeled funds. There are
bound to be' evil effects from such
practices," the letter said.
