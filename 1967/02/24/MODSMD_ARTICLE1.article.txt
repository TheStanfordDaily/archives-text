# Law Prof Asks 'In Loco Parentis' Review
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
The time has come for serious
consideration of the possibility of the
University's abandoning its parental
role of governing student, conduct, ac
cording to Law Professor John R.
McDonough.
A member of Committee of Fifteen
and chairman of its subcommittee on
judicial procedure, McDonough set
forth his views of the In loco parentis
concept in a recent interview and in
a speech before a group of alumni
in Orange County and Los Angeles
last weekend.
McDonough sees the Fundamental
Standard as a reflection of the in loco
parentis concept, a kind of conduct
code which may have been appropri
ate fifty years ago, but which now
should be re-examined as a conduct
regulator.
In addition to embodying the in loco
parentis concept, the Fundamental
Standard "probably had an element of
snobbishness in it," said McDonough.
"It was a standard of conduct for Stan

ford men and women, and, as such,
was meant to be more stringent than
the standards imposed by society gen
erally on the hoi polol by the criminal
law and ordinary convention."
Pointing out that in loco parentis
may have once served "a useful pur
pose," McDonough added that it is now
time to re-evaluate the University's
parental role considering the signifi
cant changes which Stanford has un
dergone in recent years.
Reformulation
First of these changes is the com
position of student population: Stan
ford is no longer an "exclusively un
dergraduate university."
In addition, he said that "Many if
not most undergraduates come to us
less willing than their predecessors
to accept the University's authority in
regard to matters of personal be
havior."
In addition, society's standards gov
erning conduct have changed consid
erably, and the judgment of Stanford
students' conduct is made difficult by

having to define standards in discipline
cases. McDonough suggests that the
Fundamental Standard be reformu
lated in the light of modern condi
tions.
What kind of standards of conduct
would be in effect with the abandon
ment of the in loco parentis concept?
Student Rule?
"We would run into a whole new set
of problems," McDonough said, "and
we haven't yet dealt with what kind
of mechanism would be used for gov
erning conduct." One possibility, he
acknowledged, would be the estab
lishment of some rules by the student
government, "subject to university ap
proval."
McDonough believes that the con
cept of the residence university may
be retained even if in lot*) parentis
were abandoned. "There is no neces
sary connection between the concept
of the residence university and in loco
parentis," he said.
Giving up its parental role, the Uni
versity would still be concerned with

student conduct from at least two
points of view: that of the educator
and that of the proprietor of the cam
pus. In regard to the former, a viola
tion of the Honor Code and academic
standards or disruption of classes
"would be grounds for University con
cern about the violator's continued
presence here."
McDonough suggests that rules of
health, safety and mutual convenience
would apply to all persons on campus.
Thus, "the University might take the
view that it would not knowingly per
mit the violation of federal or state
law on the campus. If so . .. that view
would presumably apply just as fully
to faculty . . administrators, employ
ees and visitors as to students."
Off-Campus Violations
McDonough pointed out that in the
past, local law enforcement agencies
have sometimes made it a practice to
turn over to Stanford authorities
Stanford students violating laws off
campus with the assumption that the
student would be disciplined by school

officials. The changes he proposes
would require reconsideration of this
practice.
He added that there "would be little
if any University concern with a stu
dent's conduct off campusâ€”with his
exploits in the San Francisco Ten
derloin, with his encounters with the
Highway Patrol, the Peninsula police
departments, or the Alcoholic Bev
erage Control Commission, or with
whom he happened to be living."
The University might take the "it's
not our job" attitude toward conduct
involving off-campus violations of
state or federal laws, and local law en
forcement agencies would no longer
be able to assume that Stanford is
responsible in this area.
Judicial Tribunals
A major reason for McDonough's
proposals is that he believes they
could lead to the simplification of ju
dicial proceedings. In regard to such
proceedings, they "would no longer be
brought to 'punish' a student who had
violated a code of behavior." Mc-
Donough asserted that student judi
cial tribunals operating in recent years
have introduced a "much larger ele
ment of legality" into the governing
of conduct and that judicial processes
have become "essentially criminal
proceedings."
With the abandonment of in loco
parentis concept, students would not
be punished as violators of a gen
eral code of behavior; rather the pro
ceeding would simply determine

whether a student had failed to live
up to the expectation of the university
community in a significant way.
"A student's expulsion or suspen
sion would no longer be regarded as
an extreme form of punishment for
anti-social behavior," he said. "Rather,'
it would simply be a determination
that the University, as one part to a
mutually - assumed consensual rela-"
tionship, had concluded that it was un
willing to go on living and working
with the student concerned."
Demerit System
Instead of "sentencing" a student to
a given number of hours on a work
project as "punishment," a judicial
tribunal might assign demerits where' 1
expulsion or suspension was not justi
fied. He proposed that continued ac-J
cumulation of demerits would result
in automatic suspension or
or an inquiry into the appropriateness
of such action.
"If the University continues to act
in loco parentis, it is certain to find
itself confronted with a myriad of.
what are essentially legal and moral
problems in areas where both law and
morals are themselves in considerable
ferment.
"Moreover, it will be continuing to
proceed on the basis of assumptions
which . . are certainly questionable"
as applied to graduate students, are'
rejected by an increasing proportion'
of undergraduates, and may well nolP
be shared by a good many parents,
he said.
The time has come for serious
consideration of the possibility of the
University's abandoning its parental
role of governing student, conduct, ac

parentis concept, a kind of conduct
code which may have been appropri
ate fifty years ago, but which now
should be re-examined as a conduct
regulator.
In addition to embodying the in loco
parentis concept, the Fundamental
Standard "probably had an element of
snobbishness in it," said McDonough.
"It was a standard of conduct for Stan

ford men and women, and, as such,
was meant to be more stringent than
the standards imposed by society gen
erally on the hoi polol by the criminal
law and ordinary convention."
Pointing out that in loco parentis
may have once served "a useful pur
pose," McDonough added that it is now
time to re-evaluate the University's
parental role considering the signifi
cant changes which Stanford has un
dergone in recent years.
Reformulation
First of these changes is the com
position of student population: Stan
ford is no longer an "exclusively un
dergraduate university."
In addition, he said that "Many if
not most undergraduates come to us
less willing than their predecessors
to accept the University's authority in
regard to matters of personal be
havior."
In addition, society's standards gov
erning conduct have changed consid
erably, and the judgment of Stanford
students' conduct is made difficult by

having to define standards in discipline
cases. McDonough suggests that the
Fundamental Standard be reformu
lated in the light of modern condi
tions.
What kind of standards of conduct
would be in effect with the abandon
ment of the in loco parentis concept?
Student Rule?
"We would run into a whole new set
of problems," McDonough said, "and
we haven't yet dealt with what kind
of mechanism would be used for gov
erning conduct." One possibility, he
acknowledged, would be the estab
lishment of some rules by the student
government, "subject to university ap
proval."
McDonough believes that the con
cept of the residence university may
be retained even if in lot*) parentis
were abandoned. "There is no neces
sary connection between the concept
of the residence university and in loco
parentis," he said.
Giving up its parental role, the Uni
versity would still be concerned with

student conduct from at least two
points of view: that of the educator
and that of the proprietor of the cam
pus. In regard to the former, a viola
tion of the Honor Code and academic
standards or disruption of classes
"would be grounds for University con
cern about the violator's continued
presence here."
McDonough suggests that rules of
health, safety and mutual convenience
would apply to all persons on campus.
Thus, "the University might take the
view that it would not knowingly per
mit the violation of federal or state
law on the campus. If so . .. that view
would presumably apply just as fully
to faculty . . administrators, employ
ees and visitors as to students."
Off-Campus Violations
McDonough pointed out that in the
past, local law enforcement agencies
have sometimes made it a practice to
turn over to Stanford authorities
Stanford students violating laws off
campus with the assumption that the
student would be disciplined by school

officials. The changes he proposes
would require reconsideration of this
practice.
He added that there "would be little
if any University concern with a stu
dent's conduct off campusâ€”with his
exploits in the San Francisco Ten
derloin, with his encounters with the
Highway Patrol, the Peninsula police
departments, or the Alcoholic Bev
erage Control Commission, or with
whom he happened to be living."
The University might take the "it's
not our job" attitude toward conduct
involving off-campus violations of
state or federal laws, and local law en
forcement agencies would no longer
be able to assume that Stanford is
responsible in this area.
Judicial Tribunals
A major reason for McDonough's
proposals is that he believes they
could lead to the simplification of ju
dicial proceedings. In regard to such
proceedings, they "would no longer be
brought to 'punish' a student who had
violated a code of behavior." Mc-
Donough asserted that student judi
cial tribunals operating in recent years
have introduced a "much larger ele
ment of legality" into the governing
of conduct and that judicial processes
have become "essentially criminal
proceedings."
With the abandonment of in loco
parentis concept, students would not
be punished as violators of a gen
eral code of behavior; rather the pro
ceeding would simply determine

whether a student had failed to live
up to the expectation of the university
community in a significant way.
"A student's expulsion or suspen
sion would no longer be regarded as
an extreme form of punishment for
anti-social behavior," he said. "Rather,'
it would simply be a determination
that the University, as one part to a
mutually - assumed consensual rela-"
tionship, had concluded that it was un
willing to go on living and working
with the student concerned."
Demerit System
Instead of "sentencing" a student to
a given number of hours on a work
project as "punishment," a judicial
tribunal might assign demerits where' 1
expulsion or suspension was not justi
fied. He proposed that continued ac-J
cumulation of demerits would result
in automatic suspension or
or an inquiry into the appropriateness
of such action.
"If the University continues to act
in loco parentis, it is certain to find
itself confronted with a myriad of.
what are essentially legal and moral
problems in areas where both law and
morals are themselves in considerable
ferment.
"Moreover, it will be continuing to
proceed on the basis of assumptions
which . . are certainly questionable"
as applied to graduate students, are'
rejected by an increasing proportion'
of undergraduates, and may well nolP
be shared by a good many parents,
he said.
The time has come for serious
consideration of the possibility of the
University's abandoning its parental
role of governing student, conduct, ac
cording to Law Professor John R.

may have once served "a useful pur
pose," McDonough added that it is now
time to re-evaluate the University's
parental role considering the signifi
cant changes which Stanford has un
dergone in recent years.
Reformulation
First of these changes is the com
position of student population: Stan
ford is no longer an "exclusively un
dergraduate university."
In addition, he said that "Many if
not most undergraduates come to us
less willing than their predecessors
to accept the University's authority in
regard to matters of personal be
havior."
In addition, society's standards gov
erning conduct have changed consid
erably, and the judgment of Stanford
students' conduct is made difficult by

having to define standards in discipline
cases. McDonough suggests that the
Fundamental Standard be reformu
lated in the light of modern condi
tions.
What kind of standards of conduct
would be in effect with the abandon
ment of the in loco parentis concept?
Student Rule?
"We would run into a whole new set
of problems," McDonough said, "and
we haven't yet dealt with what kind
of mechanism would be used for gov
erning conduct." One possibility, he
acknowledged, would be the estab
lishment of some rules by the student
government, "subject to university ap
proval."
McDonough believes that the con
cept of the residence university may
be retained even if in lot*) parentis
were abandoned. "There is no neces
sary connection between the concept
of the residence university and in loco
parentis," he said.
Giving up its parental role, the Uni
versity would still be concerned with

student conduct from at least two
points of view: that of the educator
and that of the proprietor of the cam
pus. In regard to the former, a viola
tion of the Honor Code and academic
standards or disruption of classes
"would be grounds for University con
cern about the violator's continued
presence here."
McDonough suggests that rules of
health, safety and mutual convenience
would apply to all persons on campus.
Thus, "the University might take the
view that it would not knowingly per
mit the violation of federal or state
law on the campus. If so . .. that view
would presumably apply just as fully
to faculty . . administrators, employ
ees and visitors as to students."
Off-Campus Violations
McDonough pointed out that in the
past, local law enforcement agencies
have sometimes made it a practice to
turn over to Stanford authorities
Stanford students violating laws off
campus with the assumption that the
student would be disciplined by school

officials. The changes he proposes
would require reconsideration of this
practice.
He added that there "would be little
if any University concern with a stu
dent's conduct off campusâ€”with his
exploits in the San Francisco Ten
derloin, with his encounters with the
Highway Patrol, the Peninsula police
departments, or the Alcoholic Bev
erage Control Commission, or with
whom he happened to be living."
The University might take the "it's
not our job" attitude toward conduct
involving off-campus violations of
state or federal laws, and local law en
forcement agencies would no longer
be able to assume that Stanford is
responsible in this area.
Judicial Tribunals
A major reason for McDonough's
proposals is that he believes they
could lead to the simplification of ju
dicial proceedings. In regard to such
proceedings, they "would no longer be
brought to 'punish' a student who had
violated a code of behavior." Mc-
Donough asserted that student judi
cial tribunals operating in recent years
have introduced a "much larger ele
ment of legality" into the governing
of conduct and that judicial processes
have become "essentially criminal
proceedings."
With the abandonment of in loco
parentis concept, students would not
be punished as violators of a gen
eral code of behavior; rather the pro
ceeding would simply determine

whether a student had failed to live
up to the expectation of the university
community in a significant way.
"A student's expulsion or suspen
sion would no longer be regarded as
an extreme form of punishment for
anti-social behavior," he said. "Rather,'
it would simply be a determination
that the University, as one part to a
mutually - assumed consensual rela-"
tionship, had concluded that it was un
willing to go on living and working
with the student concerned."
Demerit System
Instead of "sentencing" a student to
a given number of hours on a work
project as "punishment," a judicial
tribunal might assign demerits where' 1
expulsion or suspension was not justi
fied. He proposed that continued ac-J
cumulation of demerits would result
in automatic suspension or
or an inquiry into the appropriateness
of such action.
"If the University continues to act
in loco parentis, it is certain to find
itself confronted with a myriad of.
what are essentially legal and moral
problems in areas where both law and
morals are themselves in considerable
ferment.
"Moreover, it will be continuing to
proceed on the basis of assumptions
which . . are certainly questionable"
as applied to graduate students, are'
rejected by an increasing proportion'
of undergraduates, and may well nolP
be shared by a good many parents,
he said.
The time has come for serious
consideration of the possibility of the
University's abandoning its parental
role of governing student, conduct, ac
cording to Law Professor John R.
McDonough.

In addition, society's standards gov
erning conduct have changed consid
erably, and the judgment of Stanford
students' conduct is made difficult by

having to define standards in discipline
cases. McDonough suggests that the
Fundamental Standard be reformu
lated in the light of modern condi
tions.
What kind of standards of conduct
would be in effect with the abandon
ment of the in loco parentis concept?
Student Rule?
"We would run into a whole new set
of problems," McDonough said, "and
we haven't yet dealt with what kind
of mechanism would be used for gov
erning conduct." One possibility, he
acknowledged, would be the estab
lishment of some rules by the student
government, "subject to university ap
proval."
McDonough believes that the con
cept of the residence university may
be retained even if in lot*) parentis
were abandoned. "There is no neces
sary connection between the concept
of the residence university and in loco
parentis," he said.
Giving up its parental role, the Uni
versity would still be concerned with

student conduct from at least two
points of view: that of the educator
and that of the proprietor of the cam
pus. In regard to the former, a viola
tion of the Honor Code and academic
standards or disruption of classes
"would be grounds for University con
cern about the violator's continued
presence here."
McDonough suggests that rules of
health, safety and mutual convenience
would apply to all persons on campus.
Thus, "the University might take the
view that it would not knowingly per
mit the violation of federal or state
law on the campus. If so . .. that view
would presumably apply just as fully
to faculty . . administrators, employ
ees and visitors as to students."
Off-Campus Violations
McDonough pointed out that in the
past, local law enforcement agencies
have sometimes made it a practice to
turn over to Stanford authorities
Stanford students violating laws off
campus with the assumption that the
student would be disciplined by school

officials. The changes he proposes
would require reconsideration of this
practice.
He added that there "would be little
if any University concern with a stu
dent's conduct off campusâ€”with his
exploits in the San Francisco Ten
derloin, with his encounters with the
Highway Patrol, the Peninsula police
departments, or the Alcoholic Bev
erage Control Commission, or with
whom he happened to be living."
The University might take the "it's
not our job" attitude toward conduct
involving off-campus violations of
state or federal laws, and local law en
forcement agencies would no longer
be able to assume that Stanford is
responsible in this area.
Judicial Tribunals
A major reason for McDonough's
proposals is that he believes they
could lead to the simplification of ju
dicial proceedings. In regard to such
proceedings, they "would no longer be
brought to 'punish' a student who had
violated a code of behavior." Mc-
Donough asserted that student judi
cial tribunals operating in recent years
have introduced a "much larger ele
ment of legality" into the governing
of conduct and that judicial processes
have become "essentially criminal
proceedings."
With the abandonment of in loco
parentis concept, students would not
be punished as violators of a gen
eral code of behavior; rather the pro
ceeding would simply determine

whether a student had failed to live
up to the expectation of the university
community in a significant way.
"A student's expulsion or suspen
sion would no longer be regarded as
an extreme form of punishment for
anti-social behavior," he said. "Rather,'
it would simply be a determination
that the University, as one part to a
mutually - assumed consensual rela-"
tionship, had concluded that it was un
willing to go on living and working
with the student concerned."
Demerit System
Instead of "sentencing" a student to
a given number of hours on a work
project as "punishment," a judicial
tribunal might assign demerits where' 1
expulsion or suspension was not justi
fied. He proposed that continued ac-J
cumulation of demerits would result
in automatic suspension or
or an inquiry into the appropriateness
of such action.
"If the University continues to act
in loco parentis, it is certain to find
itself confronted with a myriad of.
what are essentially legal and moral
problems in areas where both law and
morals are themselves in considerable
ferment.
"Moreover, it will be continuing to
proceed on the basis of assumptions
which . . are certainly questionable"
as applied to graduate students, are'
rejected by an increasing proportion'
of undergraduates, and may well nolP
be shared by a good many parents,
he said.
