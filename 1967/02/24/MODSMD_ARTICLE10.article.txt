# Brain Center Located For Sex Hormones
## 
### 
Using an experimental drug,
two Stanford researchers have
pinpointed a specific brain cen
ter which regulates the produc
tion of the male sex hormones.
The discovery should help oth
ers understand how the secre
tion of hormones is controlled
and how science might apply
them to treat various sexual
disorders.
The researchers are George J.
Bloch, a graduate student in
physiology, and Dr. Julian M.
Davidson, assistant professor of
physiology at Stanford Medical
School. Their findings were re
ported in the current issue of
"Science."
The two men found that a par
ticular brain center in the hy
pothalamus called the "median
eminence" is specifically in
volved in activating the mech
anisms that produce "gonadro
tropin secretion."
The new drug, Cyproterone,
normally suppresses masculine
sexual fucntion when it is cir

culated in the blood and does not
reach the brain in large
amounts.
Normally, when there is a
deficiency of the male hormone
in the body, the pituitary gland
produces gonadotropic hormone,
which, in turn, stimulates the
testes to produce male hormone,
the researchers said.
More recent studies on plant
ing the drug in the pituitary
gland showed no effects on sex
ual function in the animal. Thus,
they reasoned, the pituitary
gland itself is not sensitive to
variations in sex hormone levels
in the blood but depends on sig
nals from the reception the
brain.
