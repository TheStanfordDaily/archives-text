# Secret War Papers At Hoover Lib.
## 
### 
The once-secret papers of a
former San Francisco mayor,
Roger D. Lapham, who became
a top U.S. foreign aid adminis
trator, and a rare 1944 edition of
Mao Tse-tung's "Selected Works"
are among the items in an ex
hibit, "Civil War in China: 1945-
49," now on display in the lobby
of Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion.
Lapham, now deceased, was
major of San Francisco from
1944 to 1948, after rising from
clerk to president and board
chairman of the Hawaii Steam
ship Co.
From May of 1948 through
June of 1949, as the civil war's
bloody tide began to run strong
ly for Mao's Communists and
against Chiang Kai-shek's Na
tionalists, Lapham headed the
aid mission to China of the Eco
nomic Cooperation Administra
tion (ECA), a forerunner of the
present Agency for International
Development (AID).
