# Experiment Emphasizing More Than Seminars
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The Experiment is broaden
ing its range of activities this
quarter in an effort to place its
seminar schedule in the broad
er context of a "Radical commu
nity."
This student group, organized
last fall as a reaction against
what its founders regarded as a
stifling environment, has begun
expanding Into such areas as
poetry reading, film showings
and psychedelic cultural work
shops. And they hope to begin
publishing a magazine next

quarter.
All this is an attempt to de
velop a totally new environment
of freedom and self-knowledge,
says Barry Greenberg, who
founded the Experiment and
runs it still today with co
founder Ira Arlook. In a rare re
laxed moment recently in his
office in the Experiment build
ing, Greenberg was elaborating
on his conception of the radi
cal community.
"It is radical in the sense of
trying to drive to the center of
ourselves, of getting at the roots.
Also you try to realize the role

of society in determining what
the self is, because you cannot
understand 'self' except in a
social context."
Further development of this
theme and the Experiment phi
losophy is found periodically in
the editorial columns of the Ex
periment's journal, Resistance
(formerly called Commitment).
"Some people have accused us
of being anti-intellectual," says
Greenberg. "This is not true.
What we are anti is the use of
the intellect to propagate the
repressive aspects of this so
ciety. Intellect has become a tool

of repression."
Greenberg says some have ac
cused the Experiment of being
negative. This is true, he says,
only to the extent that it is "a
negation of the repression that
this society represents. Rebel
lion begins with negation. In
order to build toward freedom,
you have first to break away
from repression."
The sense of community which
the Experiment is trying to de
velop has its geographical focus
in the building that used to be
the Western Cilivization Li
brary. That is where the poetry

readings, showings, some
seminars «nd so on, take place.
Greenberjjf. says, however, that
the intends to go
ahead wini its plans to move the
Placemenijyfeervice into the build
ing towarjQr the end of next quar
ter. tTh&i is now a faculty
group looming into the possibility
of Experiment keep
at least pArt of the building.)
For this reason, among others,
the Experiment needs more stu
dent support.
If the is threat
ened thufjfwith losing its head
quarters, survival will ulti

mately depend, according to
Greenberg, on the commitment
of a greater number of students
to the idea of a radical com
munity. This will require, he
says, an increasing amount of
risk-taking.
Persuading dissatisfied stu
dents to do something about
their dissatisfaction is precisely
the problem the Experiment
now faces. Many are content
with their lives, of course, but
those who are not are often, pre
sumably, reluctant to change
them. "Our focus," says Green
berg, "is still the uncommitted,
skeptical student who is look
ing for an alternative."
The Experiment was estab
lished to provide this alternative.
It is not merely an escape from
drab existence. It is an invita
tion to a new approach to exis
tence. If a student is not men
tally prepared to forget about
his achievement symbols, fragile
idols and artificial values, then
the Experiment's task is doubly
difficult.
"Our immediate goal," says
Greenberg, "is to convince in
dividuals that they can make
choices and that they can develop
outside the narrow bounds of
this society."
Enrollment figures provide
some hope in this direction. This
quarter, 325 signed up for sem
inars, 125 more than last quar
ter. Of these, about 75 per cent
have paid their $10 membership
fee, a percentage which Green
berg would like to see raised

considerably.
At the beginning, he says, it
was necessary to emphasize the
seminars. But now the Experi
ment is trying to shift away
from the being identified solely
with them. "We're hoping that
at spring quarter pre-registra
tion, more people will join the
Experiment not just for the
seminars," he says.
And so the Experiment has
moved into the political sphere.
One manifestation of this move
ment is the circulating of pe
titions recently calling for a re
opening of the inquiry into
President Kennedy's assassina
tion. The premise for this wider
orientation is that one cannot
separate the political from the
social, just as one cannot sep
arate the social from the self.
Another political project of
some Experiment members is
the current investigation into
Stanford's connections with the
Defense Department through,
for example, Stanford Research
Institute and Varian Associates.
The outcome is as yet uncertain.
On the artistic side, the Ex
periment has sponsored several
poetry readings this quarter by
Stanford students. It hopes to at
tract other Bay Area poets soon.
The Experiment also exhibited
some Cuban films recently as
part of its film workshop, and it
hopes to obtain some East Ger
man films soon. It also is en
couraging the making of "under
ground" films by its own mem
bers.

poetry readings this quarter by
Stanford students. It hopes to at
tract other Bay Area poets soon.
The Experiment also exhibited
some Cuban films recently as
part of its film workshop, and it
hopes to obtain some East Ger
man films soon. It also is en
couraging the making of "under
ground" films by its own mem
bers.
The Experiment is broaden
ing its range of activities this
quarter in an effort to place its
seminar schedule in the broad
er context of a "Radical commu
nity."
This student group, organized
last fall as a reaction against
what its founders regarded as a
stifling environment, has begun
expanding Into such areas as
poetry reading, film showings
and psychedelic cultural work
shops. And they hope to begin
publishing a magazine next

quarter.
All this is an attempt to de
velop a totally new environment
of freedom and self-knowledge,
says Barry Greenberg, who
founded the Experiment and
runs it still today with co
founder Ira Arlook. In a rare re
laxed moment recently in his
office in the Experiment build
ing, Greenberg was elaborating
on his conception of the radi
cal community.
"It is radical in the sense of
trying to drive to the center of
ourselves, of getting at the roots.
Also you try to realize the role

of society in determining what
the self is, because you cannot
understand 'self' except in a
social context."
Further development of this
theme and the Experiment phi
losophy is found periodically in
the editorial columns of the Ex
periment's journal, Resistance
(formerly called Commitment).
"Some people have accused us
of being anti-intellectual," says
Greenberg. "This is not true.
What we are anti is the use of
the intellect to propagate the
repressive aspects of this so
ciety. Intellect has become a tool

of repression."
Greenberg says some have ac
cused the Experiment of being
negative. This is true, he says,
only to the extent that it is "a
negation of the repression that
this society represents. Rebel
lion begins with negation. In
order to build toward freedom,
you have first to break away
from repression."
The sense of community which
the Experiment is trying to de
velop has its geographical focus
in the building that used to be
the Western Cilivization Li
brary. That is where the poetry

readings, showings, some
seminars «nd so on, take place.
Greenberjjf. says, however, that
the intends to go
ahead wini its plans to move the
Placemenijyfeervice into the build
ing towarjQr the end of next quar
ter. tTh&i is now a faculty
group looming into the possibility
of Experiment keep
at least pArt of the building.)
For this reason, among others,
the Experiment needs more stu
dent support.
If the is threat
ened thufjfwith losing its head
quarters, survival will ulti

mately depend, according to
Greenberg, on the commitment
of a greater number of students
to the idea of a radical com
munity. This will require, he
says, an increasing amount of
risk-taking.
Persuading dissatisfied stu
dents to do something about
their dissatisfaction is precisely
the problem the Experiment
now faces. Many are content
with their lives, of course, but
those who are not are often, pre
sumably, reluctant to change
them. "Our focus," says Green
berg, "is still the uncommitted,
skeptical student who is look
ing for an alternative."
The Experiment was estab
lished to provide this alternative.
It is not merely an escape from
drab existence. It is an invita
tion to a new approach to exis
tence. If a student is not men
tally prepared to forget about
his achievement symbols, fragile
idols and artificial values, then
the Experiment's task is doubly
difficult.
"Our immediate goal," says
Greenberg, "is to convince in
dividuals that they can make
choices and that they can develop
outside the narrow bounds of
this society."
Enrollment figures provide
some hope in this direction. This
quarter, 325 signed up for sem
inars, 125 more than last quar
ter. Of these, about 75 per cent
have paid their $10 membership
fee, a percentage which Green
berg would like to see raised

considerably.
At the beginning, he says, it
was necessary to emphasize the
seminars. But now the Experi
ment is trying to shift away
from the being identified solely
with them. "We're hoping that
at spring quarter pre-registra
tion, more people will join the
Experiment not just for the
seminars," he says.
And so the Experiment has
moved into the political sphere.
One manifestation of this move
ment is the circulating of pe
titions recently calling for a re
opening of the inquiry into
President Kennedy's assassina
tion. The premise for this wider
orientation is that one cannot
separate the political from the
social, just as one cannot sep
arate the social from the self.
Another political project of
some Experiment members is
the current investigation into
Stanford's connections with the
Defense Department through,
for example, Stanford Research
Institute and Varian Associates.
The outcome is as yet uncertain.

arate the social from the self.
Another political project of
some Experiment members is
the current investigation into
Stanford's connections with the
Defense Department through,
for example, Stanford Research
Institute and Varian Associates.
The outcome is as yet uncertain.
On the artistic side, the Ex
periment has sponsored several
poetry readings this quarter by
Stanford students. It hopes to at
tract other Bay Area poets soon.
The Experiment also exhibited
some Cuban films recently as
part of its film workshop, and it
hopes to obtain some East Ger
man films soon. It also is en
couraging the making of "under
ground" films by its own mem
bers.
The Experiment is broaden
ing its range of activities this
quarter in an effort to place its
seminar schedule in the broad
er context of a "Radical commu
nity."
This student group, organized
last fall as a reaction against
what its founders regarded as a
stifling environment, has begun
expanding Into such areas as
poetry reading, film showings
and psychedelic cultural work
shops. And they hope to begin
publishing a magazine next

quarter.
All this is an attempt to de
velop a totally new environment
of freedom and self-knowledge,
says Barry Greenberg, who
founded the Experiment and
runs it still today with co
founder Ira Arlook. In a rare re
laxed moment recently in his
office in the Experiment build
ing, Greenberg was elaborating
on his conception of the radi
cal community.
"It is radical in the sense of
trying to drive to the center of
ourselves, of getting at the roots.
Also you try to realize the role

of society in determining what
the self is, because you cannot
understand 'self' except in a
social context."
Further development of this
theme and the Experiment phi
losophy is found periodically in
the editorial columns of the Ex
periment's journal, Resistance
(formerly called Commitment).
"Some people have accused us
of being anti-intellectual," says
Greenberg. "This is not true.
What we are anti is the use of
the intellect to propagate the
repressive aspects of this so
ciety. Intellect has become a tool

of repression."
Greenberg says some have ac
cused the Experiment of being
negative. This is true, he says,
only to the extent that it is "a
negation of the repression that
this society represents. Rebel
lion begins with negation. In
order to build toward freedom,
you have first to break away
from repression."
The sense of community which
the Experiment is trying to de
velop has its geographical focus
in the building that used to be
the Western Cilivization Li
brary. That is where the poetry

readings, showings, some
seminars «nd so on, take place.
Greenberjjf. says, however, that
the intends to go
ahead wini its plans to move the
Placemenijyfeervice into the build
ing towarjQr the end of next quar
ter. tTh&i is now a faculty
group looming into the possibility
of Experiment keep
at least pArt of the building.)
For this reason, among others,
the Experiment needs more stu
dent support.
If the is threat
ened thufjfwith losing its head
quarters, survival will ulti

mately depend, according to
Greenberg, on the commitment
of a greater number of students
to the idea of a radical com
munity. This will require, he
says, an increasing amount of
risk-taking.
Persuading dissatisfied stu
dents to do something about
their dissatisfaction is precisely
the problem the Experiment
now faces. Many are content
with their lives, of course, but
those who are not are often, pre
sumably, reluctant to change
them. "Our focus," says Green
berg, "is still the uncommitted,
skeptical student who is look
ing for an alternative."
The Experiment was estab
lished to provide this alternative.
It is not merely an escape from
drab existence. It is an invita
tion to a new approach to exis
tence. If a student is not men
tally prepared to forget about
his achievement symbols, fragile
idols and artificial values, then
the Experiment's task is doubly
difficult.
"Our immediate goal," says
Greenberg, "is to convince in
dividuals that they can make
choices and that they can develop
outside the narrow bounds of
this society."
Enrollment figures provide
some hope in this direction. This
quarter, 325 signed up for sem
inars, 125 more than last quar
ter. Of these, about 75 per cent
have paid their $10 membership
fee, a percentage which Green
berg would like to see raised

considerably.
At the beginning, he says, it
was necessary to emphasize the
seminars. But now the Experi
ment is trying to shift away
from the being identified solely
with them. "We're hoping that
at spring quarter pre-registra
tion, more people will join the
Experiment not just for the
seminars," he says.
And so the Experiment has
moved into the political sphere.
One manifestation of this move
ment is the circulating of pe
titions recently calling for a re
opening of the inquiry into
President Kennedy's assassina
tion. The premise for this wider
orientation is that one cannot
separate the political from the
social, just as one cannot sep
arate the social from the self.
