# One-Dimensional Protest Seen In Experiment's Community
## 
### PETER LYMAN 
The Experiment has its source
in a radical view of American so
ciety perhaps best articulated
by Herbert Marcuse in One-Di
mensional Man. One-dimen
sional society is incapable of the
kind of self-criticism which en
ables it to change, to generate
new concepts of freedom to meet
new realities. While the Great
Society may achieve the Utopias
of the New Deal, those freedoms
do not reveal the kinds of free
dom possible in the modern
world and in addition may be in
capable of meeting the threats
to freedom posed by new reali
ties.
Foremost of the new realities
is a technological society in
which individual identity is de
fined as a role in the "system."
While this reality has not vio

lated the values of individual
rights, there has been a decline
in the institutions which teach
political responsibilities, what
used to be called the civic vir
tues. We are creating a society
of specialists which can sustain
a high technological culture, but
which is incapable of self-critic
ism and direction because the
individuals in it are discrete par
ticles, incapable of citizenship.
The Experiment, then, looks to
the University as the last institu
tion in our society capable of
preserving the civic virtues of a
free society, but finds the Uni
versity teaching technology, not
citizenship. Thus our education
teaches us to think critically
about our training, but not how
to think critically about our
lives. One can see evidence of
this division in the sophisticated

rationality evident in class while
our lives outside of class in
the "residence university" re
flect the new barbarism of a
technological society.
The vision of the Experiment
is to reveal the dangers of a
one-dimensional education which
prepares us to think critically
but not act critically, and to
create a university community
which can preserve critical val
ues in a society which has turned
its achievement of Utopia into a
closed society.
Unfortunately the Experiment
has tended to become one-dimen
sional itself in becoming a cen
ter of dissent rather than an
alternative to the University. As
a negatively defined community
it tends to sublimate discontent
into the therapy of protest.
While protest is justified, it is
not a critique but a negation.
The most effective critique would
be to create a two-dimensional
community within the Univer
sity, and be subversive in its
existence, not in in its protest.
The leaders of the Experiment
are aware of this, but find most
students willing to accept ther
apy for their alienation, and un
willing to make the commitment
necessary to create a counter
community. The Experiment
could probably prosper in being
a focus for dissent, but would
join the service of a one-dimen
sional society.
