What is great about the Ex
periment is that most of the
members realize that they are
dwarves, a sign, perhaps, that
they are on the road to good
health. And they realize as well
that this university is run by
dwarves who not only fail to
recognize their own condition,
but persist in measuring them
selves with very large yard
sticks. Just read the Stanford
Observer!
Then read Commitment. I like
the Experiment because it is
critical, of itself as well as of
the university and its social con
text, and is devoted to some kind
of creative alternative to the
competency, knowledge-is-power,
knowledge-is-a-commodity stan
dards of the Stanford adminis
tration. There are no grades, no
roles to play, no alumni, De
fense Department or parental de
mands to satisfy. It is simply a
loosely-knit community of stu
dents seeking to integrate the
social and educational environ
ments; students who don't view
knowledge as a commodity on
the open market for which the
student competes, and which,
once gained (or purchased) gives
the student a measure of power.
Education is growth. And per
haps in the Experiment one can
expect to grow into something
more than a dwarf.
