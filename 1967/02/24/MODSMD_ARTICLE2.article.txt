# Open Letter To Humphrey Protests Stanford Speech
## 
### LINDSAY BLACKMAN 
"I find going out through the great
universities that most of the people
are with us," stated Vice President
Hubert Humphrey during his visit to
the Stanford campus on Monday.
This comment has provoked an ad
hoc group of Stanford students and
faculty to draft an open letter ol
protest to the Vice President.
Text Of Letter
Mr. Vice President: As students and
faculty of Stanford University, we
wish to make clear to you that cur
rent United States policy in Vietnam
does not have the support of the aca
demic community and to protest your
misuse of the platform given you.
We oppose the war on many dif
ferent grounds, but we all expect clear
and honest answers to our questions
about the nature of the conflict in
Vietnam, the alms of the United States
in entering that conflict, and the ef
fects of the war on the people of Viet
nam.
Instead, we are answered with the
evasions and misrepresentations which
characterized your appearance at Stan
ford. Such answers as yours would
be completely unacceptable in an
academic community no matter what
the subject; when the terrible suffer
ing of all the people in Vietnam is in
volved, we must all respond with dis
may, and many of us with outrage.

At Sunday night's teach-in, an an
nouncement was made of a Monday
night meeting of Students for Demo
cratic Society (SDS) which would
evaluate Humphery's visit and the
forms of protest employed.
Monday's meeting also considered
many forms of response to Hum
phrey's statements. Among those sug
gested were flooding the Vice Presi
dent's office with personal letters and
sending open letters bearing many
signatures. From these ideas emerged
the present letter.
Proposed by Assistant Dean of the
Chapel Gordon Verplank, the letter
was authored by John Cann, graduate
in microbiology and a member of
both SDS and the United Campus
Christian Ministry.
Cann emphasized that the letter
does not represent a protest by any
particular campus organization, but
is a means for protest by anyone who
is dissatisfied with the Vice Presi
dent's response to the questions posed
by the panel.
Verplank told The Daily, "The Vice
President misused the platform given
to him, yet he used it with all the
effectiveness of a terribly astute pol
itician. What disturbed me most was
his glibness in the face of such suf
fering in Vietnam.
"The whole occasion was a sobering
reminder that many in our commu

nity would appear to be in full agree
ment with the Administration's policy
in Vietnam. That leaves those who are
concerned with escalating peace rather
than bombing with their work cut
out for them."
At another point in his response
to questions, Humphrey stated, "I
think what the Administration is do
ing on moral principle is to be com
medned rather than to be condemned,
and I think history will prove it."
In response to this declaration, Ver
plank asserts, "If it was Humphrey's
intention to justify the war on moral
principles, it's up to those in this
community to refute this claim and go
further by saying that this war is not
moral."
Early signers of the letter include
David Harris, Dean of the Chapel B.
Davie Napier, Professors Novak,
Brown, Ruotolo, and Leppert- Gordon
Verplank, Barry Greenberg, and
Henry Muller have also signed the
communication.
Cann also noted that the letter, in
addition to registering a protest,
should stimulate discussion of the
war and of Humphrey's visit. Copies
of the letter are currently circulating
among campus residences and aca
demic departments.
The letter can be signed at The Ex
periment. Cann urged that everyone
write personal letters.
