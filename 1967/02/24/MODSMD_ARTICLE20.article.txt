# Place To Meet Friends, Find People Who Care
## 
### JEAN D. DEUPREE 
The Experiment nas been a
way of finding friends, of find
ing the people who care and of
participating in a more relevant
process of education.
I'm new to Stanford, a grad
uate student who switched fields
and is taking undergraduate
courses. How do I find friends?
The best friends that I have
here at Stanford are people that
I met in two Experiment semi
nars last quarter. This quarter,
having the Experiment building
has made a big difference to my
life on campus—a place to meet
informally and talk, a place
which is much better than the
Union because I see the same
people over and over and have a
chance to get to know them.
Who are these people—the
"people who care"? My first
observation at Stanford was of
a sharp division in the student
body: lots of Ivy League types
whose orientation is toward mak
ing money and having fun, and
fa small segment of "hippy"
types — alienated and out for
kicks. I think that the work of
the world is done by people who
work within the system to
change it—the "people who care"
—social workers, teachers, with

a larger vision of what the hu
man community could be. These
people are hard to find because
they don't wear the uniforms
or the attitudes of the extreme
described above, and the Ex
periment has been a means of
finding these people.
I'm planning to go into teach
ing. In the past few years I
have studied, traveled and
taught, and have become increas
ingly dissatisfied with our pres
ent system of education. True
education comes in discussion
and argument with other people
and in living what you study,
not theorizing about it. Participa
tion in two seminars in the Ex
periment last quarter was the
most relevant part of my Stan
ford experience, both from the
point of view of hearing new
ideas and working over my own
ideas, and from the point of view
of watching a new kind of edu
cational experience in action.
