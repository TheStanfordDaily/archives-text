# 'What's Happening,' Above All, An Attitude

### ROBERT CRONBACH 
The Experiment has many
facets. Its seminar allows for
an exploration into self and so
ciety that is curtailed by the
regular university structure. An
individual is free to explore
further his interests without be
ing penalized by grades or re
stricted by the time allotted on
a quarter basis. Further, Experi
ment seminars provide for stud
ies into areas 1 ignored by the
regular curriculum.
In addition, the Exneriment
Is what's happening, baby. It is
a center for activities of all

sorts: movies, lectures, dancing,
etc. The Experiment provides a
living room away from home
where one can feel comfortable
and pass an afternoon or free
period among friendly people.
Above all, the Experiment is
to me an atitude, a realization
that the existing structures of
society lack and often block my
research for those things that I
value. The Experiment then be
comes a center for exploration
into new forms which do not
hinder one's search and incorp
orate what I value.
