## Dylan Thomas Is Joyously Revisited 
### STANLEY EICHELBAUM 
We were certainly in the
presence ol a commanding
personality last night at
the City Theater, Whether
it was Dylan Thomas or
Jack Aranson who contrib
uted more to a memorable
evening is something 1
can't quite decide.
But in "The World of Dy
lan Thomas," Aranson
plays Thomas. And Thom
as plays himself, supplying
the eloquent torrents of
words, lie did on cam
puses and lecture plat*
lorms shortly before his
untimely death 111 1953
The idea of Aranson's
one-man entertainment is
simply to recapture one of
those lectern sessions. And
the Welsh poet's ghost
must have blessed the o' •
casion. in which Aranson
vividly and movingly give*-

us the best of Dylan Thom
as.
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE
I say "the best." because
the actor has already pro
trayed the poet at his trag
ic and truculent worst, in
the boozy, self-destructive
twilight of his life, as de
picted in the play. "Dy
lan."
That was last year's in
delible success at the City
Theater And from it came
the present program,
which Aranson lias himself
assembled — an inevitable
follow-up to "Dylan." since
we are now looking at the
exuberant, creative side of
the man. And the pleasure
is all ours.
We knew full well how
much Aranson could re
semble the late poet, in his
shaggy-headed, fleshy and
magnetic demeanor. But

there was scarcely enough
of the Welsh heartbeat and
joy in "Dylan."
RESONANT
This is what Aranson has
undertaken to show us, in
selections from stories,
poems and commentaries
by Thomas. He reads them
with splendid, mellifluent
resonance, showering us
with glissandos of verse,
humor and disarming nar
rative.
First, there are memo
ries of childhood — remi
niscences of a spa town in
Wales, of people, of events,
of winter, of "snow that
•grew overnight on the roofs
of the houses like a pure
grandfather's moss."
The memories have "no
older and no end." but
surge forth in mesmeric
and metronomic fashion
as in the delightfully lyri

cai "Child s Christmas in
Wales"
For nearly an hour, Ar
anson drifts back over Dy
lan's boyhood. And for an-

other hour, he presents the
poet in a more mature
light, sulking, or exhilarat
ed, or wittily recounting
the novelties of a visit to
America.
THE CHALLENGE
Aranson's choice of ex
cerpts is excellent. And
since he is a consummate
actor, he deftly and con
vincingly meets the chal
lenge of being Thomas.
Well, not only Thomas, but
Thomas mischievously im
personating people lie has
known.
As a tour de force, it
comes over with remark
able effect 1 enjoyed it
immensely. Aranson has
obviously I ou n d another
strong and durable attrac
tion — one that 1 hope you
will see

For nearly an hour, Ar
anson drifts back over Dy
lan's boyhood. And for an-

other hour, he presents the
poet in a more mature
light, sulking, or exhilarat
ed, or wittily recounting
the novelties of a visit to
America.
THE CHALLENGE
Aranson's choice of ex
cerpts is excellent. And
since he is a consummate
actor, he deftly and con
vincingly meets the chal

Well, not only Thomas, but
Thomas mischievously im

JACK ARANSON
Again as Dylan
We were certainly in the
presence ol a commanding
personality last night at
the City Theater, Whether
it was Dylan Thomas or
Jack Aranson who contrib
uted more to a memorable
evening is something 1
can't quite decide.
But in "The World of Dy
lan Thomas," Aranson
plays Thomas. And Thom
as plays himself, supplying
the eloquent torrents of
words, lie did on cam
puses and lecture plat*
lorms shortly before his
untimely death 111 1953
The idea of Aranson's
one-man entertainment is
simply to recapture one of
those lectern sessions. And
the Welsh poet's ghost
must have blessed the o' •
casion. in which Aranson
vividly and movingly give*-

us the best of Dylan Thom
as.
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE
I say "the best." because
the actor has already pro
trayed the poet at his trag
ic and truculent worst, in
the boozy, self-destructive
twilight of his life, as de
picted in the play. "Dy
lan."
That was last year's in
delible success at the City
Theater And from it came
the present program,
which Aranson lias himself
assembled — an inevitable
follow-up to "Dylan." since
we are now looking at the
exuberant, creative side of
the man. And the pleasure
is all ours.
We knew full well how
much Aranson could re
semble the late poet, in his
shaggy-headed, fleshy and
magnetic demeanor. But

there was scarcely enough
of the Welsh heartbeat and
joy in "Dylan."
RESONANT
This is what Aranson has
undertaken to show us, in
selections from stories,
poems and commentaries
by Thomas. He reads them
with splendid, mellifluent
resonance, showering us
with glissandos of verse,
humor and disarming nar
rative.
First, there are memo
ries of childhood — remi
niscences of a spa town in
Wales, of people, of events,
of winter, of "snow that
•grew overnight on the roofs
of the houses like a pure
grandfather's moss."
The memories have "no
older and no end." but
