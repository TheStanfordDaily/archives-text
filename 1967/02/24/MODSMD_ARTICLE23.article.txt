THEATER
Stanford Repertory Theater's next production, Anton Chekov's
THE CHERRY ORCHARD, opens Wednesday at Memorial Audi
torium. In light of SRTs splendid recent performance entitled
"Morning, Noon and NigM with Chekov," great things are expected
for the new 15-performance run at Mem Aud. There will be a
matinee performance next Saturday. Tickets available at the Me
morial Hall box office.
The Playhouse Theater in SF concludes it's highly successful
run of THE FHYICIST this weekend. Final performances of Fred
rich Durrenmatt's tragicomic attack on atomic warfare will be to
night and tomorrow night at 8:30. The Playhouse will open next
weekend with GALLOWS HUMOR, Jack Richardon's mocking
satire of Man's willingness to sacrifice life for order and joy for
conformity.
The Committee will launch its newest venture, the Committee
Theater, with a preview of THE FOOL'S PLAY. Author Larry
Hankin describes his play as " a bright costume comedy about sin,
guilt, corruption, violence, sex, dope and international relations, set
In medieval times." Sounds a bit different than the old medieval
morality plays.
! On the following Friday the Committee Theater will preview
MACBIRD. In case you're like way behind the times, "Macßird"
is Barbara Garson's vitriolic, howling funny parody of "Macbeth"
which carcitures President Johnson (Macßird) as the alleged mur
derer of President Kennedy. President Johnson might take note of
his own words In a speech to the theatrical guild: "To the artists
of the stage, who give us all mankind in all its disguises and so give
us ourselves as truly we are, I pay tribute."
The American Conservatory Theater in SF continues excellent.
Theater-goers this weekend can see their much acclaimed produc
tions of SIX CHA RATERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR and
TARTUFFE, on Friday and Saturday nights respectively.
MOVIES
Tresidder's Japanes Film Series continues Friday night with
THRONE OF BLOOD, Kurosawa's brilliant cinematic adaptation of
Macbeth into the story of a 16th century Japanese war-lord whose
mania for power leads him down a hellish road paved with evil
intentions. Believers in the old stereotype of submissive Occidental
wives will be shocked by the Lady Macßird type femmc fatale of
this movie.
Sidney Poitier and Claudia McNeil star in Tresidder's Saturday
night movie, A RAISIN IN THE SUN. A poor Negro families tries
to decide what to do with a windfall of money.
The favorite films of yesterday continue to haunt the area thea
ters. The Carlos has THE COLLECTOR; the Tivoli, TOM JONES;
and the Paris, A THOUSAND CLOWNS. If matters get any worse,
Palo Altoities will only go to their Neighborhood theaters for
movies missed on the Late, Late Show. Which might be an ideal
escape from Gil Hile.
KISS KISS KILL KILL will be on the tele tomorrow night The
only reason I mention this (aside from wanting to kill space) is
that from the previews the movies seems suspiciously like "Gold
finger." Or, perhaps, this being the earlier movie, "Goldflnger"
seems suspiciously like this. There is the diabolical schemer who
plots to rule the world through monopolizing the gold supply, and
there are the voluptlous femalian guardsmen who spice up the
scenery if not the content.
Sunday night at Mem Aud features THE SPY WHO CAME IN
FROM THE COLD, which stars Richard Burton in a low-key epi
sode in the ldll-a-day life of a cold war spy. Somewhat selfconscious,
"The Spy" is still the best of the bleeding reality school of spy
thriller*.
Pauline Kael lectures 7:45 p.m. Wednesday, at Dinkelspiel. Per
haps the pre-eminent movie critic in America today, Miss Kael
has an extraordinary gift for ripping apart your favorite movies,
and making delightfully good sense in so doing.
MUSIC
The world-famous Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra concludes its
Midpeninsula tour de force tonight with a concert at the Gunn
High School Auditorium in Palo Alto.
The great South African jazz pianist, DOLLAR BRAND, will
play in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on March 5. Brand's music is a com
bination of urban South African music and American jazz. Critics
have called him the Thelonius Monk of Cape Town- Tickets avail
able at the Tresidder box-office.
