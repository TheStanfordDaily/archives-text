# 'Georgy Girl' A Zany Delight
## 
### CURTISS B. KECK 
Director Silvio Ranazzini's
"Georgy Girl" is as hilarious
as it is sad, as cruel as it is ten
der, and as zany as it is real.
The black and white British ex
port has all of these qualities
and more. It is a movie for
everyone, about everyone; and
one, which if you miss, your
smile in a world preoccupied
with itself will come all the less
quickly.
Georgy. What can one say
about Georgy that has not al
ready been said, and said bet
ter, on the countless faces that
frown in self-pity and then burst
into a glow over some small
fancy.
As the corpulent, self-sacriflc
ing, and effusive Georgy Girl,
Lynn Redgrave turned in a
truly magnificant performance.
Her acting virtuosity goes be
yond what one even would ex
pect from the tutelaged daugh
ter of Sir Michael and Vanessa
Redgrave.
Love To Spare
Miss Redgrave portrays so per
fectly the awkward and oafish
Georgy. Georgy truly is a
magnum corpus. She is an ugly
girl living in a roomful of mir
rors, who has boundless love—

love enough to shine on all the
world. And yet the world around
her would rather bask in other
lights.
Roommate Meredith (Char
lotte Rampling) takes advantage
of Georgy's homely instincts and
uses her as a weatherall door
mat for her own nocturnal ex
curions.
Georgy does have the bed
loving affection of Jos (Alan
Bates), her roommate's energetic
husband, and of James (James
Mason), her father's multi
millionaire employer. But as re
cepticals for her desperate need
to love and be loved, Jos is
porous, James is is impervious,
and both are unsatisfactory.
New Protagonist
Georgy's roommate gets preg
nant. Aha, a new protagonist
enters stage left. The roommate
is so disgusted and hateful of
her pregnancy and the birth that
she abandons the baby at the
hosiptal and skips away to new
excitements.
Georgy has found someone to
love and be dependent upon her.
The baby becomes more impor
tant than Jos, who cannot give
her the security which, for the
baby's sake, she now needs.
Multimillionaire James Mason

has been after Georgy to sign
a contract making her his fully
constituted mistress. Georgy
had refused to submit to the old
lecher's droolings. But with Jos
gone and Georgy in need of
some semblance of family life
for the baby, why not?
Baby Makes Three
The movie ends with the peal
of wedding bells; and Georgy
and her rich hubby drive off
in the honeymoon Silver Cloud
— with the baby in between
them, of course.
Fat And Ugly?
Jos, in a moment of precep
tion, spoke the underlying theme
of the movie when he told
Georgy, "You're a freak, you
know, not because you're fat
and ugly; it's just that you're
always going around trying to
save people." Throughout, the
movie ran the risk of sinking in
to heavy pathos had Director
Ranazzini dwelled more on
Georgy's ugliness or tried to
evoke pity for the girl
the audience. Fortunately he did
not and the movie was saved
from being bogged down in a
tear welled quagmire.
Alan Bates was sensational in
the role of Jos, Georgy's room
mate's roommate and finally

just Georgy's roomie. He al
ways exuded a carefree Joie de
vivre that kept him on top of
every situation. His facial ex
pressions and sprectral multiple
acting talents earmark him as
a gifted actor that soon will be
challenging the ranks of his
English mates, Terrence Stamp
and Michael Caine.
Mason Flawless
James Mason also gave a flaw
less performance as the wealthy
old roue who got what he wanted
in the end. Mason received the
nomination for a Academy
Award for Best Supporting Ac
tor for the role, and it seems
little wonder why.
The title song, sung by the
Seekers, and long the number
one disc in the countryside, is
up for another tribute: Nomina
tion for Academy Award for
Best Title Song.
