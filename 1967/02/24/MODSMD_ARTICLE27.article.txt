## Baseball Team Blanks St. Mary's

JOE HERNANDEZ
Behind some good pitching
and stout hitting, the Stanford
varsity baseball team defeated
St. Mary's, 8-0, last Tuesday.
The Indians rallied for three
runs in the third and for five
runs in the fifth to put them
ahead early in the going. Mean
while pitchers Sandy Vance,
Daro Quiring, and Don Rose
were handling the St. Mary bat
ters with ease. They held the foe
to one hit, a triple in the second.
The varsity will be back in
action with two home games
this weekend. This afternoon at
3:00 the Tribe takes on Chico
State. Saturday afternoon at
2:00 Sacramento State will test
the Indians.
Santa Clara
After these two contests the
Indians have only one more tune
up, a game next Tuesday with
USF, before they face rival
Santa Clara in a two game se
ries.
The fifth inning against St.
Mary's certainly tuned up the

hitters as nine men came to the
plate.
Frank Duffy led off with a
single to deep shortstop. Marty
Erck singled into the hole be
tween second and first, with
Duffy stopping at second. How
ever, on the next pitch, Duffy
bases. Mike Schomaker singled
sharply to center scoring both
Erck and Swan and moving
Whalen over to third. Jack Hod
ges came up and sent a high,
deep fly to left scoring Whalen.
Pitcher Is A Hitter
Schomaker moved to second
on the throw home. Quiring

helped his own cause with a line
drive single down the left field
line to score Schomaker. Bob
Parker flied to center to end the
inning.
Parker singled in Schomaker
in the third and then Stanford
scored two more runs on a wild
pitch and an error for three
runs.
Rose was the most effective
Stanford pitcher; however, nei
stole third. Dick Swan followed
with a short fly to center that
dropped in for a hit and an RBI.
Bill Holt flied out, and then
Bob Whalen walked to load the

ther Vance nor Quiring had any
trouble keeping St. Mary's score
less. Rose faced nine men and
put away nine men in his three
innings.

Stanford's defense was flaw
less as the Tribe had no errors.
