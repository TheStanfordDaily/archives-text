# Swimmers Aim For Records; Papooses Seek Second Win
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
; Indian swimmers get a final
<;rack at Stanford's beleaguered
pool records this afternoon at
3:00 against the College of Se
quoias. The Stanford frosh go
against COS in double dual
tompetition, and face Cal State
Hayward here at 2 p.m. Satur
day.

Greg Buckingham will get a
fresh shot at the NCAA record
for the 200 individual medley.
Buckingham, who has already
set two NCAA records this sea
son, missed Roy Saari's 1:56.7
IM record by a scant .4 second
last weekendâ€”this was barely 5
minutes after he won the 1000
free against USC.

Every single meet record fell
in last weekend's UCLA and
USC swimming meets, dragging
8 pool records into oblivion.
Although the Indians have
been doing hard, long distance
workouts all week long, the COS
meet should produce some top
times as several Cards gun for
the NCAA qualifying standards.
Stanford enters the AAWU
championships next Thursday,
where the Indians will have to
fight USC for the title.
Frosh Swimmers 1-1
The Stanford frosh, after los
ing 54-50 to Cal in their open
ing meet, beat Santa Ana JC
64-40 two weeks ago to even
their record.
Butterflier and IM man Richie
Williams, butterflier Jim Nickol
off, breaststroker Nick Dondero,
and freestyler Dennis Daly have
fired the biggest guns for the
Papooses. Bill Main has won the
diving competition in a breeze
in each outing and has also put
some zip into the Papoose sprint
lineup.
Bill Bly broke Hans Dankers
1000 freestyle record with a
12:02.4 performance against
Santa Ana. Greg Amundson
gained second places in both the
200 and 500 free against Santa
Ana.
Sequoias should push the
frosh harder than Cal State this
weekend.
