# Buss States Vietnam Peace Must Precede Negotiations
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
The essential problem of the Viet
nam war is not the "transition from
bombing to negotiations" but the
"transition from war to peace," accord
ing to Prof. Claude A. Buss.
The Vietnam war is best described
as "overcostly, haphazard and stupid,"
said Buss, speaking here yesterday.
He explained the cost of the war by an
illustration from Secretary of State
Dean Rusk who says we "could take
the Viet Cong and give each one a

villa on the Riviera for less expense
than it's costing us to kill them."
Negotiations may be possible, but
the basic question is "Can we get some
kind of cease fire? Buss said. "Agree
ments may not come quickly or easily
. . . or may not even last. We could
continue arguing . . . but quit killing
each other while the arguing is going
on," he said.
Investigating the possibilities for
peace, Buss cited first the tactic of
"ordinary de-escalation" which
"wouldn't necessarily jeopardize our
security. I'm not convinced that one
has to add to numbers to increase
security. You can escalate to the point
where you get diminishing returns,"
he said.
Negotiation Questioned
Buss also questioned the value of
settlement talks. "Negotiation is not
the magic word we think it to be.
Agreement to negotiate is not agree
ment to agree," he said. He pointed
out that the U.S. has its Fourteen
Points for consideration, the NLF
has five such points, Hanoi has four
points, and "not one is about to budge."
The "consciousness of nationhood"
of the Vietnamese is making our re
lations with them more difficult than
ever, Buss explained. The propaganda
of Premier Ky, of the NLF, and of

Hanoi all mention "unity, democracy,
independence and neutrality." They all
want the same things but have dif
ferent definitions of what these things
mean. And, he added, they are not
willing to accept the definitions that
the U.S. might give to these concepts.
The Vietnamese have had a history
of feeling opposition to outside forces,
according to Buss. This was originally
directed against the Khmers, later
against the Chinese, and finally
against the French. Now they have
"at least, a feeling of solidarity
against the U.S. as an outsider," he
said.
They feel that the U.S. has taken
from them responsibility in their own
country. "Their first choice should be
not what Washington wants, but what
the Vietnamese want," he said.
Buss explained the present conflict
in Vietnam as a deterrent to the "other
war" of economic and social change
occurring before the actual outbreak
of hostilities five years ago.
Concerning economic progress, the
biggest problem is the growing popu
lation. "The Vietnamese elite say
they can't go on as an agricultural
country after hostilities cease . . .
they need an industrial basis to pro
vide jobs for people when the war is
over."

He said however, that the result of
bombing of rice paddies, one of the
primary sources of subsistence and
the effects of defoliation will prevent a
speedy economic recovery in the event
of cessation of hostilities.
Government Failure
Buss cited the breakdown of local
government traditions and the lack of
understanding between local and cen-'
tral government officials as one of the
principal political problems.
The Vietnamese now have a mili
tary junta in charge of the central
government, he explained, with about
30 military officials who are "adminis
tering, not governing the country."
"Many people say they don't want
government by a military group," he
said. He added that the Constituent
Assembly is a "step toward civilian
government." However, 80 per cent of
the representatives are from the
armed forces, civil service, or are
teachers or lawyers. The group ex
cludes representation of the majority
of the masses.
Those who believe the war effort
is justified feel that they are "con
tributing to a better world and the
establishment of rule of law. We must
question whether we are promoting
our own security or doing a great deal
of damage to our own soul," he said.

tral government officials as one of the
principal political problems.
The Vietnamese now have a mili
tary junta in charge of the central
government, he explained, with about
30 military officials who are "adminis
tering, not governing the country."
"Many people say they don't want
government by a military group," he
said. He added that the Constituent
Assembly is a "step toward civilian
government." However, 80 per cent of
the representatives are from the
armed forces, civil service, or are
teachers or lawyers. The group ex
cludes representation of the majority
of the masses.
Those who believe the war effort
is justified feel that they are "con
tributing to a better world and the
establishment of rule of law. We must
question whether we are promoting
our own security or doing a great deal
of damage to our own soul," he said.
The essential problem of the Viet
nam war is not the "transition from
bombing to negotiations" but the
"transition from war to peace," accord
ing to Prof. Claude A. Buss.
The Vietnam war is best described
as "overcostly, haphazard and stupid,"
said Buss, speaking here yesterday.
He explained the cost of the war by an
illustration from Secretary of State
Dean Rusk who says we "could take
the Viet Cong and give each one a

villa on the Riviera for less expense
than it's costing us to kill them."
Negotiations may be possible, but
the basic question is "Can we get some
kind of cease fire? Buss said. "Agree
ments may not come quickly or easily
. . . or may not even last. We could
continue arguing . . . but quit killing
each other while the arguing is going
on," he said.
Investigating the possibilities for
peace, Buss cited first the tactic of
"ordinary de-escalation" which
"wouldn't necessarily jeopardize our
security. I'm not convinced that one
has to add to numbers to increase
security. You can escalate to the point
where you get diminishing returns,"
he said.
Negotiation Questioned
Buss also questioned the value of
settlement talks. "Negotiation is not
the magic word we think it to be.
Agreement to negotiate is not agree
ment to agree," he said. He pointed
out that the U.S. has its Fourteen
Points for consideration, the NLF
has five such points, Hanoi has four
points, and "not one is about to budge."
The "consciousness of nationhood"
of the Vietnamese is making our re
lations with them more difficult than
ever, Buss explained. The propaganda
of Premier Ky, of the NLF, and of

Hanoi all mention "unity, democracy,
independence and neutrality." They all
want the same things but have dif
ferent definitions of what these things
mean. And, he added, they are not
willing to accept the definitions that
the U.S. might give to these concepts.
The Vietnamese have had a history
of feeling opposition to outside forces,
according to Buss. This was originally
directed against the Khmers, later
against the Chinese, and finally
against the French. Now they have
"at least, a feeling of solidarity
against the U.S. as an outsider," he
said.
They feel that the U.S. has taken
from them responsibility in their own
country. "Their first choice should be
not what Washington wants, but what
the Vietnamese want," he said.
Buss explained the present conflict
in Vietnam as a deterrent to the "other
war" of economic and social change
occurring before the actual outbreak
of hostilities five years ago.
Concerning economic progress, the
biggest problem is the growing popu
lation. "The Vietnamese elite say
they can't go on as an agricultural
country after hostilities cease . . .
they need an industrial basis to pro
vide jobs for people when the war is
over."

He said however, that the result of
bombing of rice paddies, one of the
primary sources of subsistence and
the effects of defoliation will prevent a
speedy economic recovery in the event
of cessation of hostilities.

government traditions and the lack of

country. "Their first choice should be
not what Washington wants, but what
the Vietnamese want," he said.
Buss explained the present conflict
in Vietnam as a deterrent to the "other
war" of economic and social change
occurring before the actual outbreak
of hostilities five years ago.
Concerning economic progress, the
biggest problem is the growing popu
lation. "The Vietnamese elite say
they can't go on as an agricultural
country after hostilities cease . . .
they need an industrial basis to pro
vide jobs for people when the war is
over."

He said however, that the result of
bombing of rice paddies, one of the
primary sources of subsistence and
the effects of defoliation will prevent a
speedy economic recovery in the event
of cessation of hostilities.
Government Failure
Buss cited the breakdown of local
government traditions and the lack of
understanding between local and cen-'
tral government officials as one of the
principal political problems.
The Vietnamese now have a mili
tary junta in charge of the central
government, he explained, with about
30 military officials who are "adminis
tering, not governing the country."
"Many people say they don't want
government by a military group," he
said. He added that the Constituent
Assembly is a "step toward civilian
government." However, 80 per cent of
the representatives are from the
armed forces, civil service, or are
teachers or lawyers. The group ex
cludes representation of the majority
of the masses.
Those who believe the war effort
is justified feel that they are "con
tributing to a better world and the
establishment of rule of law. We must
question whether we are promoting
our own security or doing a great deal
of damage to our own soul," he said.
