# CARDS SEEK THIRD WIN
## Wrestlers Host Cat Bears 
### 
Coach Jerry Budzik and his
wrestling team go after their
third win in a row Saturday
night in which, from a tradition
point of view, is the most im

portant dual meet of the sea
son.
Meeting the Card matmen in
Encina Gym at 8:00 will be the
Golden Bears from the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley.
The teams have similar poten
tial and records, and the out
come will probably be deter
mined by the last match, the
heavyweight class.
Terry Crenshaw carries the
Tribe's hopes there against the
Cal heavyweight who beat last
year's confcrence champ by one
point. But Crenshaw rallied for
a six point edge over the same
man, and thus stands a slight
favorite.
Borchers Unbeaten
Len Borchers, 152 pound cap
tain of the team, goes into this
last dual match before the con

ference championships next
week undefeated in all compe
tition.
He leads the following and
Crenshaw onto the mat: John
Tam at 123, Gerry Beaudoin at
137, John Coutrakan at 147, who
is subbing for the injured John
Suttle, Doug Gunesch at 160,
Burt Ambler at 167, and Bud
Hollingbery at 177.
The team will forfeit 130, as
it has most of the year, but Cal
has been forfeiting 147.
