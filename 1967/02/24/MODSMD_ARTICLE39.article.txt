# Reporter's Notebook
## The 						Death Of A Dream 
### Jim Selna 
David Harris' decision 1 .0 re
sign will undoubtedly be re
ceived with mixed reaction with
in and without the University.
However, this reporter's imme
diate reaction is one of frank
disappointment.
Han-is brought a new philoso
phy to the campus, and if his
critics claimed that his views on
education were not new, they
had to concede that he was the
first to enunciate them with
such unequivocal vigor.
A product of the New Left,
though he shunned the label,
Harris in the end succumbed to
the critical anomaly which has
plagued the radical movement
on a larger scale. He failed to
bridge the gap between philo
sophical purity and the realities
of an on-going enterprise.
Bole of Seclusion
Yet while other elements of
the New Left saw "the poets
turn to generals," the"artistic
socialist" traded his role for se
clusion.
Harris told the voters last
May that he did not plan to win,
and that he only hoped to have
educational issues discussed.
Consequently, Harris did not
choose his words with calcula
tion. Rather, he "defined the
limits" of this thought and ac
tion.
Harris asked for, and got, a
personal mandate. He let few
forget it during the inflghts
which took much of his time in
Legislature.
A Quiet Time
Fall quarter has traditionally
been a quiet time for student
government — major proposals
are in committee and surface
for public notice only in late

winter quarter. Few expected a
placid quarter however, and
some even wondered what sort
of three ring circus the student
body president would build for
himself.
But the fall, if it was more
noisy than usual, was filled with
squabbling and bickering — fra
ternity problems, political in
fighting over appointments, and
the hair-shaving incident. Curi
ously devoid of educational mer
it, each of these was a non-issue
in the light of what Harris had
said in the spring.
The push for increased pass
fail grading, a new undergradu
ate colloquium program, the
Grove Project and the work of
the Housing Commission spoke
to the issue of education in a
substantive way. But the re
sults seemed meager, not in
themselves but in comparison
with what had been expected.
Harris Thrust
Squabbling and attrition
seemed to wear away at the
thrust which Harris has brought
to the campus. Although many
of the blocks to progress fell on
the other side of the fence, Har
ris suffered from the errors of a
chief executive new to his
powers and created problems for
himself. The core of the Harris
administration was made up of
sound talent, but clearly student
follow through beyond the level
of top leaders was wanting.
And then many of the short
comings stemmed from Harris'
approach which grasped partic
ulars in terms of generalities
and generalities in terms of
symbols. This was the case in
the fight over the appointments
to the Presidential Committees

and to the Packer Study Group.
Harris brought the style of a
charismatic leader to his post,
and ironically not the style of a
good administrator. The minutia
of organizational paper-shuffling
bored him and consequently the
normal frustration of public life
took a greater toll on his ener
gies.
Ariadne's Web
The rumored came to pass
when Harris no longer wished
to continue his efforts to un
ravel the Ariadne's web of Uni
versity problems.
Yet Harris misjudged either
his own talents or the extent of
University problems. We doubt
the former was the case. And
if the latter is true, then it
seemed that Harris had all the
more reason for staying on in
his post.
He leaves the student body
with the same challenge he pre
sented last spring, better artic
ulated but nevertheless the same
challenge.
The resignation may shock
some into action. But the same
jolt might have been applied by
Harris from White Memorial
Plaza.
The Harris experiment reached
for more than it could ever hope
to attain. But the failure of
dreamers and idealists lies not
in their vision, nor in their in
ability to reach their ideals.
Rather their fall is in their loss
of faith, or their willingness to
act upon that faith, which
causes them to opt out of the
system.
Harris' decision to resign di
minishes not only his own
dream, but also that of a good
part of the student body.

Harris told the voters last

educational issues discussed.
Consequently, Harris did not

A Quiet Time
Fall quarter has traditionally
been a quiet time for student
government — major proposals
are in committee and surface
for public notice only in late

winter quarter. Few expected a
placid quarter however, and
some even wondered what sort
of three ring circus the student
body president would build for
himself.
But the fall, if it was more
noisy than usual, was filled with
squabbling and bickering — fra
ternity problems, political in
fighting over appointments, and
the hair-shaving incident. Curi
ously devoid of educational mer
it, each of these was a non-issue
in the light of what Harris had
said in the spring.
The push for increased pass
fail grading, a new undergradu
ate colloquium program, the
Grove Project and the work of
the Housing Commission spoke
to the issue of education in a
substantive way. But the re
sults seemed meager, not in
themselves but in comparison
with what had been expected.
Harris Thrust
Squabbling and attrition
seemed to wear away at the
thrust which Harris has brought
to the campus. Although many
of the blocks to progress fell on
the other side of the fence, Har
ris suffered from the errors of a
chief executive new to his
powers and created problems for
himself. The core of the Harris
administration was made up of
sound talent, but clearly student
follow through beyond the level
of top leaders was wanting.
And then many of the short
comings stemmed from Harris'
approach which grasped partic
ulars in terms of generalities
and generalities in terms of
symbols. This was the case in
the fight over the appointments
to the Presidential Committees

and to the Packer Study Group.
Harris brought the style of a
charismatic leader to his post,
and ironically not the style of a
good administrator. The minutia
of organizational paper-shuffling
bored him and consequently the
normal frustration of public life
took a greater toll on his ener
gies.
Ariadne's Web
The rumored came to pass
when Harris no longer wished
to continue his efforts to un
ravel the Ariadne's web of Uni
versity problems.
Yet Harris misjudged either
his own talents or the extent of
University problems. We doubt
the former was the case. And
if the latter is true, then it
seemed that Harris had all the
more reason for staying on in
his post.
He leaves the student body
with the same challenge he pre
sented last spring, better artic
ulated but nevertheless the same
challenge.
The resignation may shock
some into action. But the same
jolt might have been applied by
Harris from White Memorial
Plaza.
The Harris experiment reached
for more than it could ever hope
to attain. But the failure of
dreamers and idealists lies not
in their vision, nor in their in
ability to reach their ideals.
Rather their fall is in their loss
of faith, or their willingness to
act upon that faith, which
causes them to opt out of the
system.
Harris' decision to resign di
minishes not only his own
dream, but also that of a good
part of the student body.
David Harris' decision 1 .0 re
sign will undoubtedly be re
ceived with mixed reaction with
in and without the University.
However, this reporter's imme
diate reaction is one of frank
disappointment.
Han-is brought a new philoso

Harris told the voters last

A Quiet Time
Fall quarter has traditionally
been a quiet time for student
government — major proposals
are in committee and surface
for public notice only in late

winter quarter. Few expected a
placid quarter however, and
some even wondered what sort
of three ring circus the student
body president would build for
himself.
But the fall, if it was more
noisy than usual, was filled with
squabbling and bickering — fra
ternity problems, political in
fighting over appointments, and
the hair-shaving incident. Curi
ously devoid of educational mer
it, each of these was a non-issue
in the light of what Harris had
said in the spring.
The push for increased pass
fail grading, a new undergradu
ate colloquium program, the
Grove Project and the work of
the Housing Commission spoke
to the issue of education in a
substantive way. But the re
sults seemed meager, not in
themselves but in comparison
with what had been expected.
Harris Thrust
Squabbling and attrition
seemed to wear away at the
thrust which Harris has brought
to the campus. Although many
of the blocks to progress fell on
the other side of the fence, Har
ris suffered from the errors of a
chief executive new to his
powers and created problems for
himself. The core of the Harris
administration was made up of
sound talent, but clearly student
follow through beyond the level
of top leaders was wanting.
And then many of the short
comings stemmed from Harris'
approach which grasped partic
ulars in terms of generalities
and generalities in terms of
symbols. This was the case in
the fight over the appointments
to the Presidential Committees

and to the Packer Study Group.
Harris brought the style of a
charismatic leader to his post,
and ironically not the style of a
good administrator. The minutia
of organizational paper-shuffling
bored him and consequently the
normal frustration of public life
took a greater toll on his ener
gies.
Ariadne's Web
The rumored came to pass
when Harris no longer wished
to continue his efforts to un
ravel the Ariadne's web of Uni
versity problems.
Yet Harris misjudged either
his own talents or the extent of
University problems. We doubt
the former was the case. And
if the latter is true, then it
seemed that Harris had all the
more reason for staying on in
his post.
He leaves the student body
with the same challenge he pre
sented last spring, better artic
ulated but nevertheless the same
challenge.
The resignation may shock
some into action. But the same
jolt might have been applied by
Harris from White Memorial
Plaza.
The Harris experiment reached
for more than it could ever hope
to attain. But the failure of
dreamers and idealists lies not
in their vision, nor in their in
ability to reach their ideals.
Rather their fall is in their loss
of faith, or their willingness to
act upon that faith, which
causes them to opt out of the
system.
Harris' decision to resign di
minishes not only his own
dream, but also that of a good
part of the student body.
David Harris' decision 1 .0 re
sign will undoubtedly be re
ceived with mixed reaction with
in and without the University.
However, this reporter's imme
diate reaction is one of frank
disappointment.
Han-is brought a new philoso
phy to the campus, and if his
critics claimed that his views on
education were not new, they
had to concede that he was the
first to enunciate them with
such unequivocal vigor.
A product of the New Left,
though he shunned the label,
Harris in the end succumbed to
the critical anomaly which has
plagued the radical movement
on a larger scale. He failed to
bridge the gap between philo
sophical purity and the realities
of an on-going enterprise.
