# Two Minutes of Haight
## And His Own Received Him Not 
### Tim Haight 
Dave Harris' resignation
makes public feelings that have
been dominant in "radical" stu
dent circles lately. Stanford is
simply not a place for a dreamer
to find people willing to dream
and work with him.
Harris decided to run because
all the other candidates were
proposing only frills on the
same old status quo. Dave
thought that the problems fac
ing our generation demanded
more than frills, and, too ideal
istically we now see, he thought
that Stanford University, if im
proved, could be a place from
which the necessary solutions
and exhortations could come.
Harris was, and is, an artist.
He had an aesthetic vision of
what a university should be.
Perhaps it was never clearly ar
ticulated while he was in office,
but it was based on the old saws
that are handed out in cata*
logues. It had the heart-rending
sentimentality of a weather
beaten old bandstand in the
park.
It said that we at the univer
sity were concerned with truth,
that we recognized ourselves as
the budding leaders of coming
generations, that we were part
of an independent community
that could serve society without
being of society. Even now, peo

pie will read this and say, "Of
course."
But Dave's artistic sense
wouldn't let him define these
concepts as conveniently as the
theorists of the multiversity do.
To him truth meant equality,
empathy, action. Ik meant equal
ity in that all things, and all
people, must be subject to a fair
consideration — a consideration
that conscientiously battles
against the distortions of self
interest, selective perception, or
bias.
It meant empathy because
Dave is one of this generation
who feels the need for humanity
in every judgment—of humility
and the willingness to let his
humanness speak in his deal
ings with people as well as his
intelligence.
It meant action in the way
Unamuno meant action when he
said, "At times to be silent is to
lie." The search for truth did
not mean continual searching
without finding for Harris. It
meant the need to act coupled
with the ability to admit mis
takes.
Needless to say Dave was not
an astute tactician. He lacked
the cynicism, or sense of his
tory, to be the Machiavelli need
ed in the halls of Space City
Academe. He was not a media

tor-initiator. He was a prophet.
Perhaps the real failure of his
administration lies upon the
shoulders of those who thought
they could translate him to the
bureaucracy.
A few days ago, a well-known
University figure said that what
the United States needed was a
source of moral leadership. He
then proposed an agency sup
ported by government but total
ly independent of it, to examine
the problems of today and to
morrow. We were a little dis
mayed when we realized that
many had thought a university
to be that kind of place.
Some lessons have been
learned during the reign of
Dave Harris, some lessons about
the University and ourselves.
The most important is that we
should stop looking to the uni
versity for leadership. As an in
stitution it is conservative and
more interested in what it can
get from society than what it
can give to it.
And we, ourselves, are the
children of the rich, for the most
part unable and unwilling to
even dream of a future without
war, without discrimination,
without poverty. If we do adopt
the general rhetoric we stop
there, feeling smug and liberal
but letting our lives follow the

lines of least resistance. While
Marx may linger in our academ
ic consciousness, we are the
children of Coca-Cola.
It is impossible to say il the
people in this community will
ever realize that the crying need
in our society is for prophets,
for men with vision who will
analyze and challenge the behe
moth that our society has be
come. Social forces are so
strong. But we can say, with
some finality, that few here
have yet done so, and that they
are for the most part silent.
Dave almost resigned last
quarter. It was the tacticians
among his followers who, mis
perceiving the University and
fearing the reaction in the na
tional press, dissuaded him. But
he was right. Stanford Univer
sity—its students, faculty, and
administration, was not ready
for Dave Harris.
