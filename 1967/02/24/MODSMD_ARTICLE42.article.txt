## Ideas To Reality: Harris A Quitter? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
"A good artist is a deadly
enemy of society; and the most
dangerous thing that can hap
pen to an enemy, no matter how
cynical, is to become a benefici
ary. No society, no matter how
good, could be mature enough
to support a real artist without
mortal danger to the artist."
—James Agee to the
Partisan Review, July 1939.
If it was the intention of Dave
Harris to bring an awareness to
the Stanford community, I be
lieve he was successful. If it
was the intention of Dave Har
ris to bring change to the Stan
ford community, he quit; there
fore he was a failure.
It is a long and unpleasant
road from an idea to a reality.
Few of Harris's ideas were
novel. They were only novel to
Stanford. He was in a position
to be a man of action, a Jane
Addams, a John Dewey, etc. But
he quit. Is this activism—ideas
without reality?
Is Dave Harris a hollow man?

Eliot's "The Hollow Men".

Editor, The Dally:
Dave Harris' touch of great
ness has surely reached us all
at one point or another during
his tenure. But how much richer
the experience for all of us, and
how much more beneficial to the
University his services, now
that his abrupt departure has
signaled the identity of that
great legendary figure of whom,
come to think of it, Dave Harris
has always represented a con
temporary image. He came to
power, did all that could be
done, and when the wind of
freedom shifted, he was gone.
Farewell, Mary Poppins.

Editor, The Daily:
Thursday's Daily editorial,
"Insult Added to Injury," was
aptly titled. The Vice President's
reception at Stanford was an in
sult to the dignity of national
office, and this editorial is al
most as appalling.
How can the Daily reconcile
the "loud applause of his sup
porters in Memorial Audito

rium" with Its question "Where
are the Administration's sup
porters?" In this Republic can't
people support existing policy
without picketing, rallying, or,
as on Monday, just generally
being rude?
It is not irony that the Young
Republicans were the only group
to welcome Mr. Humphrey.
While it would be a long time
before many of them would vote
for him, the YR's were actually
Interested in listening, even if
they might not have agreed.
As one of many supporters of
a strong policy in Vietnam who
really do exist, I hereby contrib
ute my "voice to the existing
dialogue."

We, the undersigned members
of the Inter-Wilbur Council,
would like to congratulate the
Freshmen Year Subcommittee
of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion on a job well done. The
Subcommittee's proposal for a
Wilbur Experiment follows nec
essarily from the sociological
and psychological evidence pre
sented in the Report. We can
verify the data from our own
five-month long experience in
the Wilburness; we support the
proposal itself as a necessary,
but not sufficient, step in the
direction of exposing Freshmen
to the challenge and diversity of
university life.
We, thus, ask that the propo
sal for a coed Wilbur Experi
ment next fall be considered in
the light of our feelings that
it would best administer to the
needs of both future Freshmen
classes and the University as a
whole. Sentimental ties, alas,

Editor, The Daily:
Allow me to extend my con
gratulations to all who made
Vice-President Humphrey's visit
to Stanford such a rousing suc
cess. Gentlemen: you have done
much to bring glory to the
names of your organizations,
and to Stanford. Walking out in
the middle of Mr. Humphrey's
speech is to be commended as
being the epitome of toleration.
And as we all know, toleration
is one of the keynotes of our
"now generation," as can be
seen in our appeals for civil
rights and other causes com
parable to that of the walk-out.
Furthermore, by going in, sit
ting down, and then leaving, you
prevented many nasty "conserv
ative" Humphrey supporters
from hearing him.
The storming of the Vice-
President's car after the speech
is perhaps the most graphic
demonstration of your great and
overwhelming desire for peace.
By threatening Mr. Humphrey
with violence and physical harm,
you are showing how you refuse
to involve yourself in a "war"
which calls for the injury of
some of our "brothers" over
seas. Yes, gentlemen, you are
truly to be congratulated for
your fine demonstration for
peace (not "of" peace). Wouldn't
it be great if, the next time
someone from the Administra

killed him?

We, the undersigned members
of the Inter-Wilbur Council,
would like to congratulate the
Freshmen Year Subcommittee
of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion on a job well done. The
Subcommittee's proposal for a
Wilbur Experiment follows nec
essarily from the sociological
and psychological evidence pre
sented in the Report. We can
verify the data from our own
five-month long experience in
the Wilburness; we support the
proposal itself as a necessary,
but not sufficient, step in the
direction of exposing Freshmen
to the challenge and diversity of
university life.
We, thus, ask that the propo

ment next fall be considered in
the light of our feelings that
it would best administer to the
needs of both future Freshmen
classes and the University as a
whole. Sentimental ties, alas,

Editor, The Daily:
Allow me to extend my con
gratulations to all who made
Vice-President Humphrey's visit
to Stanford such a rousing suc
cess. Gentlemen: you have done
much to bring glory to the
names of your organizations,
and to Stanford. Walking out in
the middle of Mr. Humphrey's
speech is to be commended as
being the epitome of toleration.
And as we all know, toleration
is one of the keynotes of our
"now generation," as can be
seen in our appeals for civil
rights and other causes com
parable to that of the walk-out.
Furthermore, by going in, sit
ting down, and then leaving, you
prevented many nasty "conserv
ative" Humphrey supporters
from hearing him.
The storming of the Vice-
President's car after the speech
is perhaps the most graphic
demonstration of your great and
overwhelming desire for peace.
By threatening Mr. Humphrey
with violence and physical harm,
you are showing how you refuse
to involve yourself in a "war"
which calls for the injury of
some of our "brothers" over
seas. Yes, gentlemen, you are
truly to be congratulated for
your fine demonstration for
peace (not "of" peace). Wouldn't
it be great if, the next time
someone from the Administra

It is a long and unpleasant

It is a long and unpleasant

Thursday's Daily editorial,
"Insult Added to Injury," was
aptly titled. The Vice President's
reception at Stanford was an in
sult to the dignity of national
office, and this editorial is al
most as appalling.
How can the Daily reconcile
the "loud applause of his sup
porters in Memorial Audito

rium" with Its question "Where
are the Administration's sup
porters?" In this Republic can't
people support existing policy
without picketing, rallying, or,
as on Monday, just generally
being rude?
It is not irony that the Young
Republicans were the only group
to welcome Mr. Humphrey.
While it would be a long time
