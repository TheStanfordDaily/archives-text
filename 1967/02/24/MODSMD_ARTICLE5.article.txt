# Was Housing Committee's Report Fair?
## 
### KIRK HANSON News Analysis 
What really happened in the Hous
ing Commission's Fraternity Sub
committee?
Did the rush of a deadline push the
members to submit the report without
really considering all aspects of it?
Did some anti-fraternity elements
dominate the preparation of the re
port?
It appears both these statements are
partially true and that many other
problems were encountered by the
subcommittee in its four months of
work. The report of the Fraternity
Subcommittee was published as part
of the Housing Commission Report
in last Wednesday's Daily.
The first, subcommittee was dis
solved on Nov. 1 when a three man
chairmanship proved unworkable,
housing Commission Chairman Jan
Jacobi claimed that: "The representa
tive of the Interfraternity Council has
imposed himself and his organization
as a barrier to any further examina
tion of the fraternity system from
our intended objective and thorough
point of view."
Dale Maehelot the IFC representa
tive, had charged that Joel Kugel
mass, another of the three chairmen,

was making discussion impossible by
imposing his anti-fraternity views.
New Committee
The committee was reconstructed
by Jacobi with Wilbur sponsor Dave
Calfee as the new chairman. Calfee
prepared a general outline for a study
of fraternities which was accepted by
the new subcommittee and interviews
were begun to collect data relevant
to the points to be considered. The in
formation was to be submitted by
Thanksgiving, but interviews were
not completed. Calfee tried to get the
data back before Christmas vacation.
He could not get most of it, however,
until the end of January.
The committee had not met since
before Thanksgiving and now had less
than two weeks to put together the
information and make its report.
During the week of Feb. 1 Dave Cal
fee wrote a rough draft combining
the information he thought relevant to
the study and report. Joel Kugelmass,
earlier accused of being anti-fra
ternity, revised the report.
However, when the full committee
was to meet on Sunday, Feb. 5, to con
sider the completed report. Kugelmass
had not finished his revision of the
draft, and Calfee asked the 10 mem
bers of the 17-man committee that
were present to approve the entire re

port on the basis of a verbal summary
given by Kugelmass.
Several members objected, saying
they wanted to see the written report.
Calfee had it available in his room
that evening for the members to read.
It is not clear how many members ac
tually did read the report (some, how
ever, accepted Kugelmass's verbal
summary.)
Corrections
Three members, Dave Harker, Geoff
Smith, and Dave Pugh, objected to
the final form and wrote four pages
of corrections to the final draft. Most
of these were incorporated by Calfee,
who then handed the completed re
port without conclusions or recom
mendations to Housing Commission
chairman Jan Jacobi. On Tuesday,
February 7, Jacobi returned the draft
to Calfee and asked him to add some
conclusions and make some recom
mendations.
Jacobi later claimed Kugelmass was
asked to do this "because of his ability
to write clearly and concisely."
Before the report (with conclusions)
was resubmitted to Jacobi, Calfee con
tacted Smith, Hakken, and Pugh,
asking them if they wished to see the
conclusions and the report in its final
form. Geoff Smith objected to the
recommendations. He wrote an alter

nate set of conclusions and asked Cal
fee to leave his name off the report
if Kugelmass's conclusions stood. Cal
fee turned over both the completed
report and Smith's conclusions to
Jacobi. Jacobi did not substantially
change Kugelmass's conclusions.
Who Approved
It is unclear how many of the 17
committee members saw the final re
port with conclusions. Calfee and
Jacobi claim a majority of the mem
bers either saw and approved this
final form or gave him tacit approval
of it. The Daily has verified that seven
members saw and approved the fined
form, but of the other ten, Smith dis
approved, and the other nine were
given no chance to see, discuss, or ap
prove it. At no point in the final de
liberations was a vote taken by the
subcommittee.
When the report was printed in
The Daily, the names of all mem
bers of the subcommittee were in
cluded with, "as acknowledgement for
services given to the Housing Com
mission," according to Jacobi. How
ever, this was not made clear in the
publication of the report and has re
sulted in three members, Geoff Smith,
Gene Lucero, and Bud Carpeneti, with
drawing their "support" of the report.
Smith disagreed with Jacobi and

Trimbur's statement in Tuesday's
Paily that Kugelmass' conclusions
were selected for "stylistic" reasons.
"My conclusions had very substantive
differences and less antagonistic lan
guage," said Smith. These differences
included elimination of the 25 per cent
draw proposal, the appeal to the Santa
Clara County District Attorney, and
public filing of affidavits."
Many questions have been raised
about the educational focus and the in
terviewing procedures of the report.
The interviews concentrated on rush
procedures and hell/help week and
made little attempt to examine edu
cational opportunities in the houses.
The question the writers of the re
port used to examine educational op
portunity was "What are some of the
house's more important traditions?"
(No. 22, part I). When none of the
houses listed specifically academic
activities as traditions, the writers con
cluded there was little position to say
about fraternities in the academic
sphere.
Confidence Violated
Some of those interviewed claimed
violation of confidence in the use of in
formation collected by the interview
ers. Calfee asked that interviewers not
take any information in confidence
(but evidently there was no uniform
ity in practice).
