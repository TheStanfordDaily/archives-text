and tomorrow.

Over eighty debate teams will
be discussing the topic "Re

Champions
Each school may enter two top
debate teams In the tournament,
one of the largest in the West.
Many national and state cham
pions from across the country
will be competing in the events.
Until last year, the tourna
ment had never been larger than
15 schools. Last year 18 schools
were involved, and this year the
total has jumped to 46, largely
as a result of increased effort on
the part of the forensics depart
ment and the Stanford Speech
Association. Individual events
are also new to the tournament,
which before had usually in
cluded only debate. t
The tournament serves as a
prelude to the California State
tournament, which will be held
here next year for the first time
in Stanford history.
