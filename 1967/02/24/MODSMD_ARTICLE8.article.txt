Buechner was working on the
play at his death in 1837. But
the expressionistic writing, in
short vivid scenes, and the mix
ture of the comic with tragedy,
was so far ahead of his time that
the play was not produced until
1913.
Since then, however, its great
ness has been recognized and
every new theatrical movement,
from Brecht's epic theatre to
Beckett's theatre of the absurd
has acclaimed Buechner as a
fore-runner. Alban Berg based

his famous opera Worzeck upon
it.
The story is simple: a soldier
murders his mistress when she
starts an affair with an officer.
Buechner based his play upon a
similar incident that ended in a
trial that aroused great con
troversy, for the murderer suf
fered from hallucinations and

paranoia and many felt he could
not be held responsible for his
actions.
Buechner intensified Woy
zeck's distraught state by adding
a sadistic doctor (a caricature
of one of his own professors)
who keeps Woyzeck on a diet
of peas.
