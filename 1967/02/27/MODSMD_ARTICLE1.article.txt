# Harris Resignation Fails To Incite Strong Reaction
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Apathetic acceptance seems to char
acterize many students' reactions to
the resignation of Dave Harris.
Although many said they were ini
tially surprised by the former Student
Body President's move, only a few
of those questioned expressed deep
concern.
"It seems a bit odd that Dave
should resign in the midst of such
big improvements begun under his
administration," said senior Chuck
Hogan.
Freshman Pat Klein commented,
"It didn't seem to me that he actual
ly did anything. I think he was good
because he asked the right questions
and started people examining the
University's policies on education. He
used his position of power and pres
tige to direct inquiry—I don't know if
he could have done much else. If he
was finished, it's a good thing he re
signed. The people with whom he had
to deal were often immediately set
against him because of his appear
ance and his expressed views on na
tional policies."
Confusion
Several students felt the resigna
tion was confusing and questioned
Harris' motives. Some thought it was
a dramatic way to call new attention
to his educational views. Others eval
uated his action as a "selfish move."
"He hasn't taken into consideration
the whole University picture. He fails
to realize the harm someone else
might do his attitude has been so per
sonal," stated one senior.
Several students said they were dis
appointed because Harris was not ful
filling his responsibilities. "Regard
less of why you take on a job, you
should finish it. If you don't want the
job, don't accept it," said freshman
Kip Thieriot.
Another Stern Frosh said he didn't
think Harris' reasons were valid. "He
just wanted to get out. By calling
him a prophet or saying that his mis
sion was through, you're giving him
more charisma than I think he de
served."
Bight to Besign
Junior Jim Stark said Harris had
every right to resign. "Students
weren't backing him, and he needed
that to accomplish his goals. I got
the feeling that he was just tired of
the apathy and wanted to get back
to studying."
"During the elections last spring

Harris specifically stated he didn't
want anyone to vote for him unless
he was prepared to put his body on
the line," said Wilbur sponsor Rick
Levin. "I can really understand his
position. I feel sad for Stanford. I
don't see this as an admission of de
feat or a surrender."
Greater Scope
Levin continued, "Before Harris'
administration people who were dis
satisfied with General Studies talked
about changing the science require
ment; now they question the whole
concept of a general education. Be
fore people talked about liberalizing
open house rules; now they're exam
ining the whole idea of In loco part r.-
tis. When you look at it in those
terms, I hardly think you can say
nothing was accomplished."
Perhaps the most graphic opinion
came from freshman Chip Martin. "I
think it's bitchin'—a recognition on
his part that it's impossible to get
anything done that's greatly opposed
to the administration's policies—espe
cially by looking and acting like a
creep. The first time I heard him I
thought he was well spoken and had
good ideas. When I got to talk to him
later I thought his appearance was
revolting and some of the things he
said were ridiculous."
Consistent Conclusion
Sponsor Kate Nichols characterized
the reaction at Roble as "relatively
mild." She added, "I was glad for
Dave. It was a consistent way for
him to conclude what he's been say
ing. He has always emphasized the
importance of personal initiative. His
resignation is saying once more that
students will have to be the ones who
act."
A Grove House senior praised Har
ris' contribution to the intellectual at
mosphere at Stanford. "I think his
ideas and philosophy are overwhelm
ing. It's significant that this kind of
impetus for change came from a stu
dent. I think the pressures of the po
sition were really difficult for Dave.
He disagreed so violently that it was
actually painful for him to participate
at all. I hope this doesn't set back the
cause of student activism. Although
those who know Dave can understand
his resignation, it might hurt the fu
ture chances of a person with similar
ideas to be elected.
Progress Will Continue
Robert Freelen, faculty resident at
Stern said Harris was in a good posi

tion to express his ideas and was sur
prised at the resignation."I don't
think, however, the progress of educa
tion at Stanford will be impeded. You
can have lots of ideas, but you can't
really take a school of 12,000 and
change it overnight.
"Unfortunately, I don't think a
great number of people really care. I
don't understand what touches peo
ple personally. We've never had a
time of greater discussion or oppos
ing opinions, but still too few are in
volved. Harris' resignation came at a
time when there's more hope for
change than ever before with the pro
motions of Provost Lyman and Dean
Smith and the initiation of the Packer
Committee," Freelen concluded.
