## 
###

cepted for selection to attend
the following sessions at Stan
ford's Overseas Campuses: Aus
tria VI, France XVI, and Italy
XVI (March-September, 1968);
Britain V and Germany XX
(January-June, 1968).
Information, application cards,
and course lists for all these
groups may be obtained at the
Overseas Campuses Office, Room
1-C, as well as in most living
groups. The deadline for submit
ting applications for the above
groups will be Thursday, March
9, 1967, at 5 p.m- Announcement
of students selected will be made
on April 3, 1967.
Professors who will teach dur
ing the above groups are Lohner
(MEL), Vermes (History), North
(Political Science) in Austria;
Harris (English), Felstiner (En
glish), Wolfinger (Political Sci
ence) in Britain; Miller (Art and
Architecture) and Zelditch (So
ciology) in France; Harmon
(Music), Strothmann (MEL),
S pindler (Anthropology), and
Mazour (History) in Germany;
Chowning (Music), Friedlander
(English), and Bark (History)
in Italy.
The recently announced
changes, allowing greatly in
creased flexibility and choice of
courses, will be in full operation
for all the above groups. The
most noticeable change in the
course lists is the addition by
each professor each quarter of a
lour-unit colloquium open to all

students whether or not they
have had the basic courso. For
example, Dr. Vermes will offer
at Stanford in Austria History
127w, Central European History,
as the basic lecture course, and
History 103 a, The Disintegration
of the Austro-Hungarian Mon
archy, as a colloquium limited
to fifteen students. Signups for
colloquia at all campuses will be
conducted at the Overseas Cam
puses Office during the orienta
tion period on the same rotating
alphabetical basis as registration
occurs each quarter.
Both the basic lecture course

and the colloquium will satisfy
the respective part of the Gen
eral Studies requirements pro
viding that the courses are not
taken on a Pass-Fail basis. In
other words, the opportunity
exists to satisfy while overseas
all the General Studies area re
quirements in humanities and
social sciences providing the rel
evant courses are taken for a
letter grade. At all campuses ex
cept Stanford in Britain, suc
cessful completion of two quar
ters of the six-unit intensive lan
guage course fulfills the entire
General Studies requirement in

foreign language, including the
additional four units in Area C.l.
Some confusion has arisen as
to whether language taken be
fore going overseas may be tak
en for Pass-Fail grading. Thosu
students wishing to offer two
quarters of language taken at
Stanford as the language train
ing necessary for attendance at
any campus except Britain must
take those two courses for a
letter grade.
Any students wishing clarifica
tion or further information are
invited to come to the Overseas
Campuses Office.

groups may be obtained at the
Overseas Campuses Office, Room
1-C, as well as in most living
groups. The deadline for submit
ting applications for the above
groups will be Thursday, March
9, 1967, at 5 p.m- Announcement
of students selected will be made
on April 3, 1967.
Professors who will teach dur
ing the above groups are Lohner
(MEL), Vermes (History), North
(Political Science) in Austria;
Harris (English), Felstiner (En
glish), Wolfinger (Political Sci
ence) in Britain; Miller (Art and
Architecture) and Zelditch (So
ciology) in France; Harmon
(Music), Strothmann (MEL),
S pindler (Anthropology), and
Mazour (History) in Germany;
Chowning (Music), Friedlander
(English), and Bark (History)
in Italy.
The recently announced
changes, allowing greatly in
creased flexibility and choice of
courses, will be in full operation
for all the above groups. The
most noticeable change in the
course lists is the addition by
each professor each quarter of a
lour-unit colloquium open to all

students whether or not they
have had the basic courso. For
example, Dr. Vermes will offer
at Stanford in Austria History
127w, Central European History,
as the basic lecture course, and
History 103 a, The Disintegration
of the Austro-Hungarian Mon
archy, as a colloquium limited
to fifteen students. Signups for
colloquia at all campuses will be
conducted at the Overseas Cam
puses Office during the orienta
tion period on the same rotating
alphabetical basis as registration
occurs each quarter.
Both the basic lecture course

and the colloquium will satisfy
the respective part of the Gen
eral Studies requirements pro
viding that the courses are not
taken on a Pass-Fail basis. In
other words, the opportunity
exists to satisfy while overseas
all the General Studies area re
quirements in humanities and
social sciences providing the rel
evant courses are taken for a
letter grade. At all campuses ex
cept Stanford in Britain, suc
cessful completion of two quar
ters of the six-unit intensive lan
guage course fulfills the entire
General Studies requirement in

foreign language, including the
additional four units in Area C.l.
Some confusion has arisen as
to whether language taken be
fore going overseas may be tak
en for Pass-Fail grading. Thosu
students wishing to offer two
quarters of language taken at
Stanford as the language train
ing necessary for attendance at
any campus except Britain must
take those two courses for a
letter grade.
Any students wishing clarifica
tion or further information are
invited to come to the Overseas
Campuses Office.
Applications are now being ac
cepted for selection to attend
the following sessions at Stan
ford's Overseas Campuses: Aus
tria VI, France XVI, and Italy
XVI (March-September, 1968);
Britain V and Germany XX
(January-June, 1968).

and course lists for all these
groups may be obtained at the
