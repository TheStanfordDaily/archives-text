# Pirandello: Misplaced Sex, Violence
## 
### ROBERT SAINT LOUP 
The American Conservatory
Theatre call themselves the
"ACTion people," with a phrase
reminiscent of our dear Vice
"resident's "NOW generation."
Action, if nothing else, they
are certainly giving the San
Francisco theater-goers, with a
repertory season of 16 plays,
many of them rehashes of those
«iven in the 1966 Stanford Sum
mer Festival.
Last Wednesday the seventh
production of the season opened
for a long run at the Marines'
Theater, San Francisco. It was a
transparently popularizing and
excessively melodramatic per
formance of Pirandello's Six
Charaters in Search of an Au
hor.
For example, they did not use
a translation of Pirandello's 1921
existentialist drama. They used
an "adaptation," a Rubicon
which a conscientious director
ihould refuse to cross.
Horrific And Melodramatic
The English adaptation by
Paul Mayer is itself strongly
oriented toward the horrific and
the melodramatic. Pirandello's
language, however, is formal,
sober, conventional. Its very
tonelessness against the drama
of six characters abandoned by
their author is what creates the
real pathos of the piece.
Pathos, not melodrama. Direc
tors Ball and Ringland bring on
their characters caught in a pool
if light, swaying rhythmically,
all six (not Pirandello's four)
iressed in black.
That they should dispense with
the Pirandello play which is be
ing rehearshed when the six

characters come on stage is
understandable.
That they should substitute a
smug and long drawn out re
hearsal of their own Charley's
Aunt was also to be expected.
But when they change the
scenes and alter the sense of a
play which was a theatrical tri
umph in capitals from Tokyo to
Barcelona, then something is
seriously adrift-
Barbara Colby, for instance,
tarty and mini-skirted, has an ex
ceptionally moving scene in the
back-room of a hat shop with her
step-father. At one point she
slipped off her clothes behind a
screen, insisting that she must
be nude for the seduction scene
with her step-father.
She only pulls them back on
after Scott Hylands, as the Di
rector, yells at her that nudity
can not be allowed on the live
stage.
But it was never there in the
first place. Pirandello's step
daughter is desperate only that
the situation should be enacted:
"You can represent me as you
like, Mr. Director, even clothed."
In the next ACT production,
she'll be offering him L.S.D.
Climax
At the climax of ACT's per
formance the small boy watches
his sister drown and then climbs
up a ladder in the middle of the
stage and shoots himself in the
mouth. Gasps in the audience.
But a still, small voice from
Pirandello should remind us that
this suicide takes place in the
bushes of the garden, off-stage
in the true classical tradition of
violence depicted rather than en
acted.

The six characters are trun
cation victims of an incomplete
artistic inspiration. The author
himself has told how they pes
tered him for years with their
strange nostalgic plot. They
have a fixed immutable reality, a
suspended identity of which
mere acting can only give an
illusion.
Inexplicable
Thus their most crucial scene
comes at the point when the step
daughter pleads with an empty
table and a burning lamp to
finish their story. For some in
explicable reason ACT staged
this pathetic prayer-scene twice,
once at the first entrance of the
six characters. In no place could
it be less appropriate.
Jay Doyle gave a sinister,

transvestite stunt as Madame
Pace, the procuress, who is sum
moned spiritually to be present
at the seduction which she ar
ranged. In the original she is a
blowsy, "enormously fat" vul
garity; still, this is the "NOW
generation."
Richard Dysart is command
ing in the key role of the father,
a part which he has played for
many years. But handling his
step-daughter's breasts and
burying his head in her groin,
though eminently suited to the
scene of Topless, is unfortu
nately not Pirandello.
"If I had to play an old boy
going into a cathouse," drawled
one of the rehearsing troupe,
"that's how I'd do it." And that
is how ACT did it.

"that's how I'd do it." And that
is how ACT did it.
The American Conservatory
Theatre call themselves the
"ACTion people," with a phrase
reminiscent of our dear Vice
"resident's "NOW generation."
Action, if nothing else, they
are certainly giving the San
Francisco theater-goers, with a
repertory season of 16 plays,
many of them rehashes of those
«iven in the 1966 Stanford Sum
mer Festival.
Last Wednesday the seventh
production of the season opened
for a long run at the Marines'
Theater, San Francisco. It was a
transparently popularizing and
excessively melodramatic per
formance of Pirandello's Six
Charaters in Search of an Au
hor.
For example, they did not use
a translation of Pirandello's 1921
existentialist drama. They used
an "adaptation," a Rubicon
which a conscientious director
ihould refuse to cross.
Horrific And Melodramatic
The English adaptation by
Paul Mayer is itself strongly
oriented toward the horrific and
the melodramatic. Pirandello's
language, however, is formal,
sober, conventional. Its very
tonelessness against the drama
of six characters abandoned by
their author is what creates the
real pathos of the piece.
Pathos, not melodrama. Direc
tors Ball and Ringland bring on
their characters caught in a pool
if light, swaying rhythmically,
all six (not Pirandello's four)
iressed in black.
That they should dispense with
the Pirandello play which is be
ing rehearshed when the six

characters come on stage is
understandable.
That they should substitute a
smug and long drawn out re
hearsal of their own Charley's
Aunt was also to be expected.
But when they change the
scenes and alter the sense of a
play which was a theatrical tri
umph in capitals from Tokyo to
Barcelona, then something is
seriously adrift-
Barbara Colby, for instance,
tarty and mini-skirted, has an ex
ceptionally moving scene in the
back-room of a hat shop with her
step-father. At one point she
slipped off her clothes behind a
screen, insisting that she must
be nude for the seduction scene
with her step-father.
She only pulls them back on
after Scott Hylands, as the Di
rector, yells at her that nudity
can not be allowed on the live
stage.
But it was never there in the
first place. Pirandello's step
daughter is desperate only that
the situation should be enacted:
"You can represent me as you
like, Mr. Director, even clothed."
In the next ACT production,
she'll be offering him L.S.D.
Climax
At the climax of ACT's per
formance the small boy watches
his sister drown and then climbs
up a ladder in the middle of the
stage and shoots himself in the
mouth. Gasps in the audience.
But a still, small voice from
Pirandello should remind us that
this suicide takes place in the
bushes of the garden, off-stage
in the true classical tradition of
violence depicted rather than en
acted.

The six characters are trun
cation victims of an incomplete
artistic inspiration. The author
himself has told how they pes
tered him for years with their
strange nostalgic plot. They
have a fixed immutable reality, a
suspended identity of which
mere acting can only give an
illusion.
Inexplicable
Thus their most crucial scene
comes at the point when the step
daughter pleads with an empty
table and a burning lamp to
finish their story. For some in
explicable reason ACT staged
this pathetic prayer-scene twice,
once at the first entrance of the
six characters. In no place could
it be less appropriate.
Jay Doyle gave a sinister,

transvestite stunt as Madame
Pace, the procuress, who is sum
moned spiritually to be present
at the seduction which she ar
ranged. In the original she is a
blowsy, "enormously fat" vul
garity; still, this is the "NOW
generation."
Richard Dysart is command
ing in the key role of the father,
a part which he has played for
many years. But handling his
step-daughter's breasts and
burying his head in her groin,
though eminently suited to the
scene of Topless, is unfortu
nately not Pirandello.
"If I had to play an old boy
going into a cathouse," drawled
one of the rehearsing troupe,
"that's how I'd do it." And that
is how ACT did it.

one of the rehearsing troupe,
"that's how I'd do it." And that
is how ACT did it.
The American Conservatory
Theatre call themselves the
"ACTion people," with a phrase
reminiscent of our dear Vice
"resident's "NOW generation."
Action, if nothing else, they
are certainly giving the San
Francisco theater-goers, with a
repertory season of 16 plays,
many of them rehashes of those
«iven in the 1966 Stanford Sum
mer Festival.
Last Wednesday the seventh
production of the season opened
for a long run at the Marines'
Theater, San Francisco. It was a
transparently popularizing and
excessively melodramatic per
formance of Pirandello's Six
Charaters in Search of an Au
hor.
For example, they did not use
a translation of Pirandello's 1921
existentialist drama. They used
an "adaptation," a Rubicon
which a conscientious director
ihould refuse to cross.
Horrific And Melodramatic
The English adaptation by
Paul Mayer is itself strongly
oriented toward the horrific and
the melodramatic. Pirandello's
language, however, is formal,
sober, conventional. Its very
tonelessness against the drama
of six characters abandoned by
their author is what creates the
real pathos of the piece.
Pathos, not melodrama. Direc
tors Ball and Ringland bring on
their characters caught in a pool
if light, swaying rhythmically,
all six (not Pirandello's four)
iressed in black.
That they should dispense with
the Pirandello play which is be
ing rehearshed when the six

characters come on stage is
understandable.
That they should substitute a
smug and long drawn out re
hearsal of their own Charley's
Aunt was also to be expected.
But when they change the
scenes and alter the sense of a
play which was a theatrical tri
umph in capitals from Tokyo to
Barcelona, then something is
seriously adrift-
Barbara Colby, for instance,
tarty and mini-skirted, has an ex
ceptionally moving scene in the
back-room of a hat shop with her
step-father. At one point she
slipped off her clothes behind a
screen, insisting that she must
be nude for the seduction scene
with her step-father.
She only pulls them back on
after Scott Hylands, as the Di
rector, yells at her that nudity
can not be allowed on the live
stage.
But it was never there in the
first place. Pirandello's step
daughter is desperate only that
the situation should be enacted:
"You can represent me as you
like, Mr. Director, even clothed."
In the next ACT production,
she'll be offering him L.S.D.
Climax
At the climax of ACT's per
formance the small boy watches
his sister drown and then climbs
up a ladder in the middle of the
stage and shoots himself in the
mouth. Gasps in the audience.
But a still, small voice from
Pirandello should remind us that
this suicide takes place in the
bushes of the garden, off-stage
in the true classical tradition of
violence depicted rather than en
acted.

The six characters are trun
cation victims of an incomplete
artistic inspiration. The author
himself has told how they pes
tered him for years with their
strange nostalgic plot. They
have a fixed immutable reality, a
suspended identity of which
mere acting can only give an
illusion.
Inexplicable
Thus their most crucial scene
comes at the point when the step
daughter pleads with an empty
table and a burning lamp to
finish their story. For some in
explicable reason ACT staged
this pathetic prayer-scene twice,
once at the first entrance of the
six characters. In no place could
it be less appropriate.
Jay Doyle gave a sinister,

transvestite stunt as Madame
Pace, the procuress, who is sum
moned spiritually to be present
at the seduction which she ar
ranged. In the original she is a
blowsy, "enormously fat" vul
garity; still, this is the "NOW
generation."
Richard Dysart is command
ing in the key role of the father,
a part which he has played for
many years. But handling his
step-daughter's breasts and
burying his head in her groin,
though eminently suited to the
scene of Topless, is unfortu
nately not Pirandello.

one of the rehearsing troupe,
"that's how I'd do it." And that
is how ACT did it.
