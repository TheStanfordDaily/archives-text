# Swing Into Swim With Swami
## 
### 
A holy man from India, Swami
A. C. Bhaktivedanta, will be at
the Experiment tonight at 8 p.m.
to "chant, dance, and turn every
one on."
The Swami — which literally
means one who can dictate to
his senses—is the founder of
Acharya International Society
for Krishna Consciousness Inc.
The 71-year-old native of India
is a graduate of the University
of Calcutta.
San Francisco beat poet Allen
Ginsberg met the Swami a year
ago when he established his
first temple in New York. Gins
berg calls him one of the more
conservative leaders of his faith.
Rules Of The Religion
The Swami will not tolerate
LSD, marijuana, or alcoho,. In
fact, he will not allow coffee,
tea, cigarettes, or sexual im
proprieties.
Other demands made on the
students of the Indian holy man
are that they bathe daily and
not eat meat.
A second temple was opened
by the Swami last Wednesday
at 518 Frederick Street in the
outskirts of the Haight-Ashbury
district. When his disciples have
learned enough, the Swami
plans to establish a temple in

Montreal, probably this spring.
Future Temples
In the Swami's newest temple,
a small store with a large plate
glass window, there is a small
altar, incense, and burning can
dles.
Since everyone who enters is
required to remove his shoes at
the door, there are severed small

carpets on the floor. The most
prominent of these is a large
oriental rug in the center of the
room.
The location for the temple
was chosen by the Swami's dis
ciples because the rent was so
low, and not because the move
ment seeks to convert the hip
pies.
