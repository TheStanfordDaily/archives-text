# General Studies Adds Physiology 110, 111
## 
### 
Two new courses in physiology
will be added to the General
Studies curriculum Spring quar
ter.
General Studies 110, Elemen
tary Human Physiology (3
units) is designed to give stu
dents an understanding of the
fundamentals of human physiol
ogy, with emphasis on normal
function of the coordinated reg
ulatory mechanisms of the body.
An elementary knowledge of
chemistry, physics and human
anatomy on about a high school
level will be assumed.
Alone, the course is open to
students as a General Studies
elective in the natural sciences.
Together with its companion lab

oratory course, General Studies
111, it is designed to meet the
curriculum requirements in pre
nursing and physical education.
General Studies 111, Human
Physiology Demonstration Lab
oratory (1 unit) is limited to stu
dents enrolled in 110 and pro
vides laboratory demonstrations
of the principles involved in 110.
Both courses will be taught

of the Department of Radiology
of the School of Medicine. Lec
tures for 110 will be scheduled
in Room 460, TThF at 1:15, and
