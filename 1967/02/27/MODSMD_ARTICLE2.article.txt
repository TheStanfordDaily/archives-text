# Roble Dollies Accept C15 Open House Hours
## 
### CHRIS RIGOS 
On February 7, Roble Hall voted to
accept new Open House regulations
as proposed by the Student Legisla
ture.
The students choose to allow four
open houses a week, from 12 noon to
2:15 a.m. on Friday and Saturday,
and from 12 noon to midnight on
Wednesday and Sunday.
Jennifer Bond, secretary of Roble
Hall, explained that the students had
been thinking about changing the
open house regulations since fall quar
ter. However, to show their respect
for the Committee of Fifteen, the
freshman girls decided to postpone
action until it finished its report.
After the report was made, the Ro
ble students expected the Board of
Trustees to discuss the issue of more
and longer open houses. When the
Board did not consider the proposal
on Jan. 19 as announced, the students
felt it had "broken faith" and decided
to vote on the issue themselves.
Miss Bond said a letter had been
sent to the Dean of Students explain
ing the girls' action and protesting
the manner in which the University
handled the issue.
The topic of open houses was dis
cussed by the girls in corridor meet
ings. Many girls wanted a more lib
eral policy, feeling the atmosphere in
the Roble lounge was "uncomfort
able" and "artificial". The majority
desired the freedom to bring their
dates up to their rooms for more pri
vacy.
A few girls disagreed, fearing their
privacy would be limited by having
boys in the halls.

Several girls reported that the fact
that they would disagree with Uni
versity policy by voting new open
house regulations had not at all been
a consideration in their decision.
Rather they had considered the mat
etr one of personal convenience. All
the girls were informed that the de
cision for obeying the new or the old
regulations was left up to their own
judgment.
