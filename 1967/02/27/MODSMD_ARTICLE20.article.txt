# Students Plan Vietnam Strike
## 
### 
A nation-wide student strike
protesting the war in Vietnam
has been planned for the week
of April 8-15.
According to Neil Reichline,
editor of the UCLA Dally Bruin,
the strike is intended to "para
lyze colleges and universities
across the nation."
Reichline, a senior at UCLA,
attended the national student
peace strike conference in Chi
cago in late December.
The conference planned the
April strike and decided, Reich
line reported, that "campus lead
ers of the various groups do
what they feel was appropriate
at their college or university dur
ing the week in April scheduled
for protest."
No definite plans for the strike
have been made, Reichlane
stated, adding that "whether the
protest will actually take place
remains a matter of conjecture."
The final plans will be made
within the next month, Reichline
concluded.
