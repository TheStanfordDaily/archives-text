Stanford's basketball team re
turned from its Oregon foray
with the .500 AAWU percentage
it left with after two contests
went down to the last minutes
of play, losing to Oregon State

54-51, and beating Oregon 71-58.
Friday night, the Tribe stood
tied with Oregon State 51-51 with
about 1:30 left in the game.
Both teams tried to control the
ball for a final shot, but Stan
ford fouled and Mike Markham
of the Beavers made two foul
shots.
In desperation after losing the
ball the Tribe fouled again, and
Vince Fritz's foul shot sealed the
decision for the Beavers.
Stanford held the lead through
out the first half, but was unable
to repeat its early season win.
The Beavers, who are now 5-5,
tied the score, and then with
stood nine changes of the leader
to win 54-51-
Art Harris pumped in 17 points
for the Cards to tie Loy Peter
son of OSU as the high scorer.

Mai MacElwain had 13, and Gary
Petersmeyer scored eight.
