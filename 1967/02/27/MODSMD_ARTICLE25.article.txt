# Tribe Pitching Gains Two Wins
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Indian baseball squad
took the measure of two non
league foes last weekend as they
shut out Chico State, 6-0, and de
feated Sacramento State, 6-3.
Both games featured some
fine pitching by the Tribe stag.
In a game shortened to six in
nings by rain Friday, Frank
Klinger scattered four hits
amongst Chico State batters to
win easily, 6-0. His first 29 pitch
es were strikes.
Saturday a trio of Stanford
hurlers put Sacramento State
down with two hits. Sandy

Vance, who was the winner,
walked a man in the second and
dispatched the other nine bat
ters he faced with ease. Don
Rose also kept Sacramento hit
less in the last three innings.
Bad Luck
Daro Quiring, who had some
bad luck, gave up a triple in the
sixth that brought in two runs.
He also gave up a lead ofi dou
ble in the fourth but he dis
posed of the next three hitters
harmlessly.
A four run rally in the third
wet inning against Chico piled
on top of two Stanford runs in

the second added up to disaster
for the opposition.
Mike Ammirato started things
off in the third with a single.
Mark Marquess sacrificed him
to second, and Bob Boone
brought him home with a sin
gle to left. Bob Gallagher dou
bled in Boone and after a walk
Jeff Rohlfing singled home two
more runs.
The Indians struck early
against Sacramento. Jack Hod
ges led off with a walk, moved
to second on a fielder's choice,
and scored on a hit to right
field by Marty Erck. Stanford

proceeded to load the bases with
one out, but a nice double play
started by the third baseman
ended the threat.
Long Ball
Homeruns by Hodges in the
second and by Dick Swan in the
fifth put the Indians ahead to
stay and a couple of singles in
the seventh added some icing to
the cake.
Hodges' homer came with one
out and two men on. Mike Scho
maker got on base the hard way
when he was hit in the head
with a fast ball. The resounding
crack brought the fans to their
feet, but his helmet saved him.
He continued playing after a
meeting with the trainer. Vance
got aboard on a throwing error,
and Hodges followed with a line
drive homer over the left field
fence to increase Stanford's
lead to 4-0.
Swan hit his homer against
the bank in left field with two
out and no one on in the fifth.
His long drive hit at the top of
the bank about 370 feet away.

Frank Duffy singled and
moved to second on a passed
ball to put him in scoring posi
tion in the seventh inning. Erck
singled him home with his third
single of the day.
Thn»e Runs
Sacramento made their move
in the sixth. Stanford pitcher
Daro Quiring walked the oppos
ing pitcher after some close
calls went the other way. He
also walked the next man. A
force at second left men on first
and third with one away. The
next batter hit a bounding ball
to shortstop Duffy who fired
home.
However, the ball was low,
allowing the runner on third
to score. With two men on base
the next batter hit a fly ball to
right center which was just
over the head of outfielder Bob
Whalen and went for a triple.
Quiring struck out the next man
and the only after popped up.

over the head of outfielder Bob

Quiring struck out the next man
and the only after popped up.

The Indian baseball squad
took the measure of two non
league foes last weekend as they
shut out Chico State, 6-0, and de
feated Sacramento State, 6-3.
Both games featured some
fine pitching by the Tribe stag.
In a game shortened to six in
nings by rain Friday, Frank
Klinger scattered four hits
amongst Chico State batters to
win easily, 6-0. His first 29 pitch
es were strikes.
Saturday a trio of Stanford
hurlers put Sacramento State
down with two hits. Sandy

Vance, who was the winner,
walked a man in the second and
dispatched the other nine bat
ters he faced with ease. Don
Rose also kept Sacramento hit
less in the last three innings.
Bad Luck
Daro Quiring, who had some
bad luck, gave up a triple in the
sixth that brought in two runs.
He also gave up a lead ofi dou
ble in the fourth but he dis
posed of the next three hitters
harmlessly.
A four run rally in the third
wet inning against Chico piled
on top of two Stanford runs in

the second added up to disaster
for the opposition.
Mike Ammirato started things
off in the third with a single.
Mark Marquess sacrificed him
to second, and Bob Boone
brought him home with a sin
gle to left. Bob Gallagher dou
bled in Boone and after a walk
Jeff Rohlfing singled home two
more runs.
The Indians struck early
against Sacramento. Jack Hod
ges led off with a walk, moved
to second on a fielder's choice,
and scored on a hit to right
field by Marty Erck. Stanford

proceeded to load the bases with
one out, but a nice double play
started by the third baseman
ended the threat.
Long Ball
Homeruns by Hodges in the
second and by Dick Swan in the
fifth put the Indians ahead to
stay and a couple of singles in
the seventh added some icing to
the cake.
Hodges' homer came with one
out and two men on. Mike Scho
maker got on base the hard way
when he was hit in the head
with a fast ball. The resounding
crack brought the fans to their
feet, but his helmet saved him.
He continued playing after a
meeting with the trainer. Vance
got aboard on a throwing error,
and Hodges followed with a line
drive homer over the left field
fence to increase Stanford's
lead to 4-0.
Swan hit his homer against
the bank in left field with two
out and no one on in the fifth.
His long drive hit at the top of
the bank about 370 feet away.

Frank Duffy singled and
moved to second on a passed
ball to put him in scoring posi
tion in the seventh inning. Erck
singled him home with his third
single of the day.
Thn»e Runs
Sacramento made their move
in the sixth. Stanford pitcher
Daro Quiring walked the oppos
ing pitcher after some close
calls went the other way. He
also walked the next man. A
force at second left men on first
and third with one away. The
next batter hit a bounding ball
to shortstop Duffy who fired
home.
However, the ball was low,
allowing the runner on third
to score. With two men on base
the next batter hit a fly ball to
right center which was just
over the head of outfielder Bob
Whalen and went for a triple.
