# Ruggers Bop Cal 22-14 To Win Axe Series Opener
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Taking advantage of virtually
every scoring opportunity, the
Stanford Rugby team defeated
the California ruggers 22-14 Sat
urday in the first game of the
home-and-home series that an
nually decides the winner of the
Big Game Scrum Axe.
"We were able to come
through when it counted, down
in their territory," commented
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
after the game.
"Then despite terrible playing
conditions, the scrum dug in
and held off everything but
their kicking game."
Remember Biff Game?
It seemed as if little had been
done to Cal's Memorial Stadium
since the Big Game football
quagmire of last fall. The mud
was six inches deep in places.
Cal jumped off to an early
lead when Randy Thaman
scored on a drop kick.
But Stanford bounced back
with alert Leon Hartvickson
getting the equalizer.
Hartvickson Ties It Up
Hartvickson, playing perhaps
his finest game of the season,
pounced on a loose ball after a

lineout deep in Cal territory and
scored the try.
Mike Grace's conversion made
it 5-3 for Stanford, though Tha
man soon put Cal back into the
lead with a penalty kick three
pointer.
Bob Blunt then put Stanford
back into the lead for keeps
with the most spectacular play
of the game.
Blunt Gets Another
The ball had been pop-kicked
into Bear territory by Grace.
Blunt followed and made a leap
ing catch of Grace's kick, land
ing in the end zone with the ball
and three points.
Grace missed the ensuing con
version kick, but countered min
utes later with a penalty kick
good for three more Stanford
points.
Breakaway Bob Newbery
turned a five yard scrum into
the initial score of the second
period.
Newbery On The Ball
Newbery waited until the
powerful Stanford scrum pushed
the Bears into their own goal
line, then dropped onto the ball
for the try.
Despite the muddy conditions

Grace made the conversion and
followed that with another pen
alty kick shortly after. Grace
scored 11 points for the day, all
on kicks.
With the score against them
19-6, Call rallied for two tries at
the end of the game. Don Guest
and Rick Laven both ran for
tries and Thaman made one con
version, but this still left Cal
short by eight points which it
must try to make up next Sat
urday when it meets Stanford
here at 1:30.
