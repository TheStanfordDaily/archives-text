# Experiment Is Homeless
## 
### PEGGY RUSK 
The Experiment will be homeless
next quarter unless someone can
find it a new location.
The University Planning Commis
sion reports that the Experiment will
have to move from its present loca
tion in the old Western Civ Reserve
Library in mid-April or May to make
room for the displaced Placement
Office. The Placement Office is one of
many offices now occupying West En
cina which must be relocated while
the building is undergoing renovation.
When the remodeling is completed,
Encina will be occupied by the Food
Research Institute.
Administrators from the Planning
Office, the Provost's Office and other
involved departments are holding a
special meeting this week to try to
find a solution to the problem- How

ever, no one seems optimistic because
of the tremendous shortage of office
and classroom space on campus.
Mr. James Thurber, Assistant to the
Vice President and Provost, stated,
"We will search every bit of space
possible, but it is a difficult situa
tion." The Placement Office must move
into the building by summer so they
can be ready for their busy fall
schedule. The Planning Office, there
fore, must begin work next quarter
in order to have the work completed
by summer.
The possibility that the Experi
ment and the Placement Office could
share the old library is unlikely since
the Placement Office believes that the
entire building will not be large
enough to satisfy all their space re
quirement.
Last quarter when the Reserve Li
brary was moved to the Meyer Li

brary, there was a scramble for the
use of the vacated building. The Ex
periment, The Stanford Repertory
Theater, and the Stanford Bookstore
all wanted to use it as well as a num
ber of departments which needed extra
classrooms. The Experiment was fin
ally given permission to use the stra
tegically located building with the un
derstanding that the location would
only be temporary.
However, the Experiment is reluc
tant to move out with no new head
quarters in sight. A number of fac
ulty members, including Professors
Guerard and Rhinelander, are already
supporting the Experiment's effort to
obtain a permanent headquarters.
Barry Greenberg, founder and spokes
man for the Experiment, expressed
his desire that "students and faculty
will join us in trying to maintain our
location or help us to find a new one."

sion reports that the Experiment will
have to move from its present loca
tion in the old Western Civ Reserve
Library in mid-April or May to make
room for the displaced Placement
Office. The Placement Office is one of
many offices now occupying West En
cina which must be relocated while
the building is undergoing renovation.
When the remodeling is completed,
Encina will be occupied by the Food
Research Institute.
Administrators from the Planning
Office, the Provost's Office and other
involved departments are holding a
special meeting this week to try to
find a solution to the problem- How

ever, no one seems optimistic because
of the tremendous shortage of office
and classroom space on campus.
Mr. James Thurber, Assistant to the
Vice President and Provost, stated,
"We will search every bit of space
possible, but it is a difficult situa
tion." The Placement Office must move
into the building by summer so they
can be ready for their busy fall
schedule. The Planning Office, there
fore, must begin work next quarter
in order to have the work completed
by summer.
The possibility that the Experi
ment and the Placement Office could
share the old library is unlikely since
the Placement Office believes that the
entire building will not be large
enough to satisfy all their space re
quirement.
Last quarter when the Reserve Li
brary was moved to the Meyer Li

brary, there was a scramble for the
use of the vacated building. The Ex
periment, The Stanford Repertory
Theater, and the Stanford Bookstore
all wanted to use it as well as a num
ber of departments which needed extra
classrooms. The Experiment was fin
ally given permission to use the stra
tegically located building with the un
derstanding that the location would
only be temporary.
However, the Experiment is reluc
tant to move out with no new head
quarters in sight. A number of fac
ulty members, including Professors
Guerard and Rhinelander, are already
supporting the Experiment's effort to
obtain a permanent headquarters.
Barry Greenberg, founder and spokes
man for the Experiment, expressed
his desire that "students and faculty
will join us in trying to maintain our
location or help us to find a new one."
The Experiment will be homeless
next quarter unless someone can
find it a new location.
