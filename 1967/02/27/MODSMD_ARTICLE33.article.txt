# What Now?

David Harris is no longer student body presi
dent, but student interest in the affairs of the
University should not cease. The resignation
marks the beginning of a new era: a period in
which greater emphasis must be placed on im
plementation of the ambitious ideals outlined
so far.
There is no doubt that student "activism" in
the last few years, and in particular with Har
ris' election, has had an effect on the thinking
of everyone in the University. The administra
tion, for its part, has responded by showing a
renewed interest in improving Stanford's educa
tion and a new willingness to effect change.
It has, for instance, revamped its upper echelons
and has appointed to high posts men known
for more progressive views and greater open
ness to student ideas. In addition, the University
has initiated an ambitious reevaluation of its
educational program.
The changes within the structure and the
creation of new mechanisms, however, should
not hinder continued interest in the problems
of the University from those outside the struc
ture. It should not be sufficient to accept rele
gation of controversial issues to the Packer
Study. Discussion of all problems by the entire
academic community must continue; this can
only help an issue find its way through the ad
ministrative maze.

The new ASSU President faces a difficult
task in his short term. He must continue to fight
for the issues that have been brought to the
surface this year and, in doing so, must be the
administrator David Harris was not. At the
same time he must continue to excite students
about improving the University. The most im
portant issues which have come up this year
have yet to be resolved:
— The movement to allow off-campus liv
ing for women has been given to the Packer
Study and, despite overwhelming support from
the student body, sees little chance of imple
mentation next fall.
— The Committee of Fifteen's proposal for
new open house hours has not evoked any posi
tive response from the President or the Trustees.
— Demands for student selection of students
on the Steering Committee were not granted,
and no promise has been given that students
will be allowed greater participation in the se
lection of students on the subcommittees.
— The Wilbur Experiment, despite the nec
essity for immediate improvement of the hous
ing situation, has so far received no endorse
ment from the administration.
Student demands for reform did not end with
David Harris' exit. They deserve the active
support of all who have an interest in improving
this University.
