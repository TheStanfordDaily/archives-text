In the wake of the disclosure
of ties between the National Stu
dent Association and the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency, people
are disappearing.
Bob, who as the director of
Covert Action Division Number
Five was the ClA's liaison with
NSA. has vanished. A few
weeks ago, you could contact
him by calling the Agency for
International Development. Yes
terday, AID officials said there
was no record he had ever
worked for the development
agency.
And there is Manuel. W hen
last seen, Manuel was travelling
between Now York and Califor
nia. He was said to be working
for the Regional Development
Administration of the Com
merce Department. This week,
the Commerce Department said
they had no listing for Manuel.
Man of Contacts
In the late 1.950'5, Manuel was
NSA's Latin American assistant.
It was the time of the silent
generation, yet Manuel was an
activist. He made contact with
the Christian Democratic move
ment in the Americas; ho met

with United States international
affairs groups.
He also made contact with the
CIA. Bob, who later became the
Covert Action Division's liaison
man, was NSA's president dur
ing Manuel's tenure as Latin
American assistant.
Manuel left NSA and returned
to school. He spent some time
on a West Coast campus. And
he developed a reputation for
being übiquitous. Manuel was
seen everywhere: he was in
Latin America, he attended
meetings of the reportedly ClA
linked United States Youth
Council, he visited NSA's offices
periodically.
Then Manuel bowered. In
1964, together with such old
NSA staffers as Bob of the Co
vert Action Division, he founded
Intercontinental Research, Inc.,
in Washington.
Research Stops
Located in a suite of ten of
fices at 2016 P Street, Intercon
tinental was supposed to be
available on a consultant basis
to anyone who needed "re
search" done. Participants in
NSA's International Student Re
lations Seminar attended the
cocktail partv celebrating the

opening of Intercontinental's of
fices.
This week, Intercontinental
wasn't answering its phones.
The door was bolted, and there
was no one looking through the
peephole to determine whether
you were admissable.
Manuel had another job in
1964. He was vice-president of
the International Development
Foundation, which receives sub
stantial portions of its income
from CIA sources.
During 1964, International
Development received fi60,000
from the respectable Benjamin
Rosenthal Foundation of New
York. Rosenthal's sources were
not as respectable, as the money
had been received from the
Tower Fund ($40,000) and the
Edsel Fund (520,000). Both
Tower and Edsel have been
cited as CIA conduits.
Same Source
Tower and Edsel also fun
neled money to International
Development through other sup
posedly legitimate foundations.
Sitting in International Devel
opment's New York otTices at
205 E. 42nd St., Manuel admin
istered funds said by his organi
zation to be used for developing
"leadership for develop

ment in the emerging coun
tries."
Interestingly, another former
NSA international assistant,
Robert, is one of the board
members of International Devel
opment.
In his position, Manuel gave
more than $300,000 yearly to
various Christian Democratic
groups in the Americas.
Anti-Communism
Somehow, in its efforts to de
velop leadership in the emerg
ing countries, International De
velopment also fund money to
finance groups like Institute for
International Youth Affairs in
New York. The Institute is best
known for publication of the
rigidly anti-Communist maga
zine, "Youth and Freedom."
When Manuel left Interna
tional Development late in 1965,
supposedly to work for the
Commerce Department, his job
was taken by Nancy.
Nancy had formerly worked
in Latin American program
ming for the United States
Youth Council. International
Development says she is not in
the country.
And the Commerce Depart
ment says they nevor heard of
Manuel.
