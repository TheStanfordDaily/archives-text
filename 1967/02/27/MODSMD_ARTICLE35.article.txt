## Pinning Down The Applause 
### Bob Fishman 
Who were the Stanford stu
dents who applauded so enthusi
astically when Vice-President
Humphrey strode onto the stage
of Memorial Auditorium last
week?
They weren't conservatives;
Humphrey is a founder of the
ADA and therefore dangerous.
They weren't liberals; the lib
erals berated Humphrey last
year for selling out and then
stopped wasting their breath.
They weren't lovers of Lyn
don B. Johnson. When Hum
phrey compared Johnson's place
in history with Harry Truman's,
the applause was notable in its
absence.
And they certainly weren't
caught up in the stentorian
grandeur of Humphrey's peri
odic sentences. The Vice-Presi
dent's loudest applause came
when he first appeared, before
he said anything.
Not Just Loyalty
Clearly, the standard labels
and standard loyalties cannot
explain why so many students
disregarded the pleas of so
many distinguished professors
to remain silent.
The applause, in fact, was so
great that one would have
thought that Humphrey was an
nouncing the answers to the
next Western Civ exam instead
of re-mouthing the banalities
we'd all heard before.
The students who applauded,
I think, were not interested in
affirming their loyalty to any
program or man—least of all to
Hubert Humphrey.
But the applauders were grate
ful to the Vice-President for
saving them from a difficult
moral decision.
For everyone in Memorial Au
ditorium knew that the Viet
namese War has been under an
unprecedented attack from the
intellectual and moral leaders of
this nation.

They could not have been un
aware of the plague of lies and
distortions and half-truths which
has been visited upon the
United States by its own gov
ernment.
But, for better or for worse,
opposition to the war has be
come entangled in people's
minds with revolt against many
other aspects of American life.
Students who see themselves as
the white-hope of middle-class
respectability therefore find op
position even more threatening
than acquiescence. It means be
coming one of them: The bushy
haired dissenters.
From the respectable point of
view, opposition inevitably In
volves alienating parents, dress
ing strangely, and receiving
nasty letters from the high
school civics teacher who recom
mend you for the Daughters of
the American Revolution Citi
zenship Prize.
It means re-evaluating goals
and values. ("Is becoming
Chairman of the Board of Dow
Chemical really a noble ambi
tion?")
One of Them
Worse still, it means re-defin
ing yourself as the sort of per
son who would mock the pro
nouncements of presidents or
walk out on high public officials.
For most Stanford students,
opposition to the war is no mere
political decision. It's an iden
tity crisis.
Only a few wholly resolve
this problem. Most are caught
between outright opposition, a
position they shrink from em
bracing, and allout support, a
position they find increasingly
hard to justify.
The best solution is, of course,
to deny that the problem exists.
Either the Vietnam protesters
or the federal government must
become respectable.
Even the leadership of Rob

ert McAfee Brown does not
seem to have changed the status
of the "Vietnam fanatics," as
CBS News recently labeled—or
is it libeled?—the demonstra
tors.
Call It Treason
But standing on stage Monday
was a man who claimed that
there was no cause for uneasi
ness, that American interven
tion is not only morally justified
but morally necesary, that the
"credibility gap" is a fancy
name for some unfortunate mis
understandings, and that the
protesters are dogmatic and
traitorous.

(Humphrey, of course, never
called the protestors "traitors."
He simply pointed out that the
division in American opinion
was encouraging Hanoi. He
must have felt that his listeneis
were intelligent to draw the in
ference themselves.)
The Vice-President, in other
words, assured his listeners
that there was no cause for iden
tity crises, soul-searching, or
moral uneasiness. They couui
lean back in their chairs in a
posture of moral self-righteous
ness.
Wouldn't you applaud?
