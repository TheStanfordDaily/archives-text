## War: Violence Begins At Home 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
It seems to me that the whole
disgusting spectacle surround
ing Hubert Humphrey's visit
emphasizes the increasing irra
tionality that is coming to char
acterize many supporters and
opponents of the Vietnam war.
Especially disturbing is the fact
that this blindness and intoler
ance can exist in an academic
community. Bizarre events tend
to become news in themselves
and push the most important
concern—a meaningful attempt
to understand the issues of the
war—into the background.
The walk-out, the silent pro
test, and the armbands were
peaceful gestures symbolizing
opposition to the war and were
intended to show a concern for
peace. However, what the pub
lic saw in the mass media was
the chaos of the chase after
Humphrey's car. Such action,
plus the heckling antics of a
few screaming left-wingers in
side and outside the auditorium,
merely confirms the gullible
Right in its distorted view that
all opposition to the war comes
from "kooks."
The raging extremists of the
Left have their counterparts on
the Right in the robots who ex
press their intolerance and
closed-mindedness through dis
tortion and an appeal to super
charged emotionalism. I must
sadly say that Humphrey did
much to strengthen these people
and to subvert a true discussion
of the issues by his appeals to
emotion.
Particularly disgusting was

his invocation of the electric
name of Kennedy, hypothesizing
that he would be doing the same
thing as Johnson in Vietnam.
Furthermore, his comparison of
Vietnam with Greece and Berlin
stimulated the outdated but still
emotionally charged conditioned
reflex of opposition to the inter
national monolithic communist
conspiracy.
Basically, what I am asking
is that all sides consider this
war in the most rational and
objective manner possible, al
ways remembering that our pri
mary concern is the people of
Vietnam. To do this, it is neces
sary to shed mythology and to
focus upon the primary issues
involved, and to stop attacking
both verbally and physically the
personality and the person of
anyone holding an opposite
view.
What discussed me most be
cause it seemed to symbolize the
essence of the most frightening
aspect of the whole Humphrey
affair was an incident involving
me personally. I was standing
peacefully on the sidewalk gaz
ing in horror at the mob chas
ing the Humphrey car. Sudden
ly a young man ran up and
threw a football-type shoulder
block across my chest because
I was wearing an armband and
a peace button.
Then an NROTC student with
hate in his eyes walked by and
sneered and hissed at me. While
I was mentally and emotionally
stunned by all of this, the
thought struck me that maybe
it all symbolized the worst hor
ror about this war—that it has
caused people in this country,
even at Stanford, to become full
of hate, fear, violence, intoler
ance, and irrationality, and that
it is leading to the disintegra
tion of love and of the human
spirit. Maybe this in itself is a
sufficiently compelling reason to
oppose war.

• Culinary Gap
Editor, The Daily:
How is it, in a supposedly
democratic university, that food
at the Tresidder Union is both
tasteless and expensive, while
at a distance of fifty yards, in
the Faculty Club, our teachers
can eat a sumptuous lunch each
day for $1.50?

• Band-Aids
Editor, The Daily:
I was greatly impressed by
the large number of students
and faculty who wore white
armbands at the Humphrey
speech last Monday. For me, it
symbolized a bandage for bind
ing the wound that this war is
inflicting on our whole society
and most of the people in this
country.
I boliove these armbands were
a dignified way of saving our

war in Vietnam hurts me; that
I am opposed to our present
administration's aggressive pol
icy in Vietnam. I hope in the
future more people will think
of ways to continually express
publicly their dissatisfaction
with the war.

• Shame To You
Editor, The Daily:
I was astonished and sad
dened upon seeing the small
crowd of perhaps 300 people
who turned out to hear Claude
Buss speak about Vietnam in
Memorial Auditorium on Feb
ruary 23. Astonished because I
didn't expect to get a seat, let
alone have a wide choice; sad
dened because I thought the
Stanford community cared more
about learning the facts of an
important issue.
Quite a contrast to the scene
in the same place three days
earlier. But I suppose its more
fun for the protestors to protest
the problem than to seek an
swers to it, more fun for the
spectators to thirst for some
gladiator's blood than to deepen
their understanding of him or
his cause.
SHAME on you who, regard
less of your Vietnam leanings,
flocked to the HHH spectacular
but ignored Claude Buss ... both
in droves.

• A Better Way
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter to you dated Feb
ruary 13th 1967, a number of
science and engineering stu
dents expressed their support of
American policy in Vietnam.
They make evident their aware
ness of their moral responsibil
ity to society, as men of science
and technology, and as such, I
respect their opinions.
I am also an engineering stu
dent. I am from the country of
Malaysia and I have spent years
in your country learning meth
ods by which a less-developed
country like mine may strive
for progress. Your open society
has provided me with this op
portunity, and for this I am
grateful.
I am not fully knowledgeable,
but I am not unaware, of events
in Vietnam and it is with sad
ness that I view your country's
major role in that tragedy. It
seems that this country, in her
pursuit of military victory, is
destroying the very principles
for which she claims to be fight
ing. The Secretary-General of
the U.N. and other responsible
world leaders have, directly and
indirectly, challenged the U.S.'s
position in Southeast Asia. I, as
one Asian, cannot feel any less
concerned.
Not too long ago, Malaysia
foogbt a nation-wide guerrilla

war. Acts o! terrorism, destruc
tion and death were daily occur
rences. At the peak of the emer
gency, the British had more
than one hundred thousand me
under arms. But, Malaysia's
trial by fire could only end
when the sound of guns gave
way to the winning of the peo
pie, by means of sweeping po
litical and social reforms.
As there are scientists and
engineers who believe in deve*
oping agents of death and de
struction, so there are others
who are builders and see them
selves as harbingers of a better
way of life. The latter are cor
vinced that man shall not be
the cause of his own extinction

• After Dinner?
Editor, The Daily:
I wish you would issue The
Daily in the evening. When I'v
just crawled out of bed and am
eating breakfast, it's more than
my poor stomach can stand to
read quotations in which that
immature, naive boy, Dave Har
ris, is compared to Woodrow
Wilson.

• Angry Mob
Editor, The Daily:
As one who opposes the ad
ministration policy in Vietnam
and who participated in the si
lent protest in Mem Aud during
Mr. Humphrey's visit, I must
express my concern at the near
violence done to him after his
speech.
I can understand the frustra
tions that led students to want
to get the message of protest
through to the vice-president,
for I felt considerable frustra
tion myself. But I cannot under
stand the mentality that risks
violence at Stanford as a means
of opposing violence in Viet
nam. Nor can I find it proper
for members of a university
community to repudiate a point
of view by threatening an as
sault upon the holder of the
point of view.
We may need to look for new
ways of expressing disagree
ment with administration pol
icy, but mob action is certainly
not one of them. Mr. Hum
phrey's performance inside
Mem Aud made me tremble for
our nation's future, but Lf the
treatment he got outside Mem
Aud is typical of more than a
tiny handful of students, I trem
ble also for our university's fu
ture.
