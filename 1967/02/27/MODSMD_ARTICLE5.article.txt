# Collins Proposes Unity Of Effort
## 
### 
Newly-elevated ASSU President
Michael Collins spoke hopefully yes
terday of Stanford's prospects of be
coming a "great" University.
"We've got to train our sights once
again on what we've been talking
about all along," Collins said, "educa
tional reform."
"But we can't approach it from the
angle of student power," he continued,
"because that concept, as it has re
cently been defined, is an anachron
ism."
Collins called the recent interest in
"constituency rather than communi
ty" a move away from the ideal stu
dents should be working for, commu
nity government. "If the community
welcomes this idea," he said, "then the
place where it'll be instituted, realis-

tically, is the Packer Committee."
"The Packer Committee opens up,
for the first time, the possibility for
real change. For now, at least in Its
public statements, the University Is
welcoming reform, a new direction,
and a new emphasis.
He also expressed the fear of "see
ing the same thing happen to the
Packer Committee that happened to
Dave, and that is people saying 'That's
a good idea, so go ahead and do it,'
and just leaving them to get it done.
But they won't get it done, because
it's got to be a community effort."
"And by emphasizing the fact that
the Packer Committee is a commu
nity effort," Collins continued, "we lay
the groundwork for the notion of com
munity, for the model of the univer
sity should be, for education."
Collins hopes to set up small com
mittees later this year that will work
on proposals in specific areas where
reform is needed.
Expanding on his belief that the
concept of student power in anachron
istic, Collins stated "it's a tactic de
veloped cut of absolute necessity in a
period that was literally forced on
us by the administration, a period
when there was nother way of getting
things done in the area of social
change."
"But it's no longer an applicable
concept, for a couple of reasons.
First, social reforms, like liquor and
social regulations, are either accom
plished or inevitable. Secondly, you
just aren't going to get people to
spend the night in White Plaza to
demonstrate a need to abolish Gen
eral Studies, and that's the kind of
concern we're dealing with now."
Collins also announced that his of
fice hours will be from 12:30 to 2
p.m. on Monday,'

it's got to be a community effort."
"And by emphasizing the fact that
the Packer Committee is a commu
nity effort," Collins continued, "we lay
the groundwork for the notion of com
munity, for the model of the univer
sity should be, for education."
Collins hopes to set up small com
mittees later this year that will work
on proposals in specific areas where
reform is needed.
Expanding on his belief that the
concept of student power in anachron
istic, Collins stated "it's a tactic de
veloped cut of absolute necessity in a
period that was literally forced on
us by the administration, a period
when there was nother way of getting
things done in the area of social
change."
"But it's no longer an applicable
concept, for a couple of reasons.
First, social reforms, like liquor and
social regulations, are either accom
plished or inevitable. Secondly, you
just aren't going to get people to
spend the night in White Plaza to
demonstrate a need to abolish Gen
eral Studies, and that's the kind of
concern we're dealing with now."
Collins also announced that his of
fice hours will be from 12:30 to 2
p.m. on Monday,'
Newly-elevated ASSU President
Michael Collins spoke hopefully yes
terday of Stanford's prospects of be
coming a "great" University.
"We've got to train our sights once
again on what we've been talking
about all along," Collins said, "educa
tional reform."
"But we can't approach it from the
angle of student power," he continued,
"because that concept, as it has re
cently been defined, is an anachron
ism."
Collins called the recent interest in
"constituency rather than communi
ty" a move away from the ideal stu
dents should be working for, commu
nity government. "If the community
welcomes this idea," he said, "then the
place where it'll be instituted, realis-

tically, is the Packer Committee."
"The Packer Committee opens up,
for the first time, the possibility for
real change. For now, at least in Its
public statements, the University Is
welcoming reform, a new direction,
and a new emphasis.
He also expressed the fear of "see
ing the same thing happen to the
Packer Committee that happened to
Dave, and that is people saying 'That's
a good idea, so go ahead and do it,'
and just leaving them to get it done.
But they won't get it done, because
it's got to be a community effort."
