# National Newspapers Deplore Student 'Attack' On Humphrey
## 
### DICK RIORDAN 
Stanford students' treatment of Vice
President Humphrey has drawn highly
critical national coverage. Newspaper
editorials across the country describe
the disturbance during Humphrey's
departure as shameful, puerile, and
anti-intellectual.
Their basic arguments are that the
office of the Vice President demands
respect regardless of the incumbent
and that such action as was observed
at Stanford disrupts the orderly dis
cussion of public issues, infringing
upon the right to express and defend
one's views which every member of
a democratic society possesses.
None of the editorials confronts
the question of whether or not the
Vice President's speech indicated a
desire for orderly discussion and de
bate of governmental policy.
Perhaps the strongest comment
was made by a Washington Post edi
torial which claimed that Stanford
students merit the reproach "deserved
by everyone who resorts to physical
violence in a democratic society where
other means of dissent exist."
This accusation of physical violence
arose from the statements of several
reporters who claimed that the crowd
had struck the Vice President's car
with their fists. However, the occu
pants of the car denied this, and no
one reported damage to any of the
cars.
Stanford students also deserve re
proach, continued the Washington
Post, because their behavior "is the
kind of violent intervention in dis
ciplined debate that the world grew
accustomed to in Germany during the
rise of Nazism.
"The first resort of a sterile anti
intellectual fringe in a country is to
rowdyism. No group in this country
ought to put a higher value on the
right to orderly dissent than those
who have a minority anti-govem

mental view to express. And nothing
is more likely to diminish or impair
that right than the empty-headed, ir
responsible, irrational disorder of such
demonstrations."
A San Francisco Chronicle editorial
observed that Humphrey " 'kept his
cool' before, during and after their
unseemly demonstration. Here as
throughout his public career, Mr.
Humphrey has shown himself to be
a man of such dignity as befits his
high office, and of the warmth that
his personal feeling and opinions
plainly denote."
A Daily editorial described the per
sonal feelings and opinions which
Humphrey voiced to the Stanford

community as a repetition of "the
line that has been heard so often
from a multitude of officials ranging
from the President to minor State De
partment employees. . . a barrage of
cliches, generalizations, and contra
dictions."
Although not as censorious as the
Washington Post, the Los Angelas
Times took a similar viewpoint. It
quoted Humphrey's statement that
"the first sign of immaturity and
dogma and doctrine and intellectual
tyranny is when a person is unwilling
to stay and listen." "That obvious
lesson," remarked the editorial, "still
needs to be learned by many imma
ture students."
