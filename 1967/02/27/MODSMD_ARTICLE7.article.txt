# MEL's 'Woyzeck'
## German Play Intense, Unique 
### DAVE HAKKEN 
The Modem European Languages
Department's production of Woyzeck
displays an intense if unprofessional
understanding of Georg Buchner's
unique drama. Last Saturday's stag
ing indicates an optimistic future for
foreign language drama at Stanford.
Buchner himself is best described as
being about 100 years ahead of his
time. The terms used to describe his
plays, Expressionist and even "epic"
in the Brechtian sense, are from the
Twentieth Century. Woyzeck is a de
scription of an individual and his
psychological reaction to the social
pressures which have formed him.
The three manuscripts of the play,
which Buchner was still writing at his
death in 1837, indicate no essential
scene order.
Like Expressionist drama, there is
little more than an external chrono
logical order. The play is rather an
attempt to express through several
does. Woyzeck himself is a tragic
actions to the external forces and mo

tives which cause him to do what he
does. Woqzeck himself is a tragic
character, not in the Greek sense of
tragedy due to character flaw, but as
a victim of a social system within
which he can do nothing to prevent
his personal tragedy, a tragedy for
which he is not to blame.
Low Class Hero
It is the essential individuality of
Buchner's low class hero Woyzeck
which separates his work from the po
litical drama of his "Young Germany"
contemporaries. Woyzeck is driven to
kill his common law wife by the cir
cumstances of his position at the bot
tom of the German social scale; yet
it is Woyzeck and not a personifica
tion of "low class man" who murders.
The untempered pessimism of the
play is also essentially modern. The
spectator feels the author's pity for
his character, but cannot feel any
hope for him or for the society of
which he is a part.
Anthony Graham-White's cast un
derstood the character of Buchner's
drama well. The fast pace of the play,
composed of several scenes never
more than a few minutes long, helped
Graham-White glide over many of the
somewhat awkward situations result
ing from a cast with little dramatic
experience. Yet it was essentially this
lack of dramatic aflectodness which
made the production a direct expres
sion of the revolutionary theatrical
content in Buchner's work.
This is not to say that the perform
ance was not without its moments of
professional brilliance. Joachim von
der Thusen's portrayal of the "Dok
tor" was superb and professional in
the finest sense of the term. He was
able to transmit effectively both the
inanity and incompetence of the up
per class society of which the Doktor
is a part in a manner grasping the
pathetic humor which Buchner gave
this character.
The Real Spirit
It was the performance of Richard
Figge as Woyzeck which captured the
real spirit of Buchner's play, how
ever. From the opening scene Figge

conveyed the inexpressible frustration
which is Woyzeck, and it was the
intensity of his protrayaJ which made
understandable Woyzeck's suicide. It
is indicative of Graham-White's re
straint from overextending the limited
facilities of Dinkelspiel Auditorium
that he waited until his moment to
vary his light pattern into a deep blue.
It is this dedication to the drama
itself, the play for its own sake, which
indicates a bright future for foreign
language drama at Stanford. The ex
istence of sueh a theater at Stan
ford, partly because of the reorganiza
tion of the Speech and Drama Depart
ment, of which Mr. Graham-White is
a part, offers to the foreign language
departments personnel with the abil
ity to create out of foreign drama an
experience which goes beyond drama
into education.
It is this dedication which will make
the proposed production of the
French and Italian Department, and
the continued work of the Modern
European Languages Department a
dynamic contribution to the Stanford
academic community.
