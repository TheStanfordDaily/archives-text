# Beta Chi: Local Fraternity Vs. National Ties

(First in a series of articles on local
fraternities)
What happens when a fraternity breaks its
national ties? Of the four fraternities on cam
pus which have gone local, Beta Chi, formerly
Sigma Nu, has prehaps undergone the most
significant changes, the most recent, of which
was last fall's decision to abolish selective
rush and open membership to anyone in the
Stanford community.
Beta Chi was the second fraternity on campus
to disaffiliate from its national organization, a
decision which ended a two-year struggle with
the national over practices and principles, the
most significant being a membership clause
which discriminated on the basis of race.
In the summer of 1962 at a meeting of the
national fraternity in Pittsburg a motion to
abolish the discriminatory clauses had been
defeated by a vote of 215 to 76 Subsequently
the Stanford chapter introduced a motion to
eliminate the Oriental clause only, which failed
by a 2-1 over all margin.
In November of that year the chapter voted
to withdraw from the national organization
and become a local fraternity because of its

"fundamental disagreement" with the national
over the discriminatory clauses.
This move toward independence had orig
inated from the class of "63, a group of fresh
men student leaders who had pledged the fra
ternity as a group in 1960.
Former house president T. Grey (1962-63),
a member of the 1960 pledge class, stated at
the time of disaffiliation that "As pledges, we
felt that the discriminatory principles and
practices of the national were vesti
gal remnants from another era, anachronisms,
which must surely shortly disappear. We have
found this analysis was mistaken."
'Changes In Order'
John McCarthy, a member of the 1961 pledge
class and house president in 1962-63, 1963-64
said he "probably wouldn't have joined" the
fraternity if such changes hadn't been in
order.
According to McCarthy, the racial discrim
ination conflict was the issue which, when com
bined with other conflicts with the national
"pushed it over the top," and forced the local
chapter to articulate its stand. McCarthy feels
that even without the rebuff the Stanford
chapter received from the national at the

1962 convention, the fraternity would have dis
affiliated within a couple of years anyway.
Present Beta Chi President Dick Williams
cites several reasons for the action, among
them the discriminatory clause, a "desire to
be fully autonomous" and to dispense with
ritual which had largely fallen into disuse any
way, and a feeling that the expense of national
ties constituted an excessive hardship on the
house budget.
Williams sees the decision to go local as a
"reversal in values . . . for instance, the Sigma
Nu motorcycle garage was converted into the
house library." After the change, the fratern
ity's academic standing, previously in the
lower bracket, rated among the top five in the
time immediately following the conversion
and remained in the top one-third in the past
two > ears.
All of the fraternities which have gone local
view alumni support as a significant factor
in determining the subsequent status of the
fraternity, especially in regard to financial
matters. For the former members of Sigma
Nu, relations with alumni presented one of
the darker aspects to the problem of ad
justment.

Contact with alumni had not beeen particu
larly strong in the past, and the proposals at
the 1962 convention met with hostility on the
part of the national "establishment" and alum
ni. According to Williams, alums projected "at
least a five year period for such a change to
happen." But the Stanford group decided not
to wait, and the next fall they translated their
principles into aciion.
The lack of information made available to
alumni about the plans for the Sigma Nu's
proposed autonomy may have constituted a
temporary setback for the fraternity in ad
justing to its new status. Yet contacts were re
newed, and by 1965 a group of alumni helped
form a corporation, the Association of Beta
Chi, Inc., in order to enter negotiations with
the University for the purpose of repurchasing
the house.
With last fall's decision to abolish selective
rush, the chapter again "made a mistake" in
failing to contact alumni and inform them of
the group's intentions, according to Williams.
Again, alumni support has been somewhat
weaker than in the past.
While this independence of alumni support
seems to follow from the fraternity's desire

to be autonomous, McCarthy sops alumni sup
port as a means of intervention between the
fraternity and University powers—such as the
business otlice.
Beta Chi, Inc.
McCarthy points to the case of the Associa
tion of Beta Chi, Inc. as an example of coopera
tion with former chapter members in provid
ing for growth and changes within the house.
Under this interpretation of the fraternity's
autonomy, the group would not operate spe
cilicully as a university residence, and fra
ternity members might form their own co
operative types of residences, possibly off
campus. McCarthy also expresses doubts about
the cluster plan for fraternities, since a large
amount of individuality is sacrificed and
groups are forced to tie themselves to the
University purse strings.
Just as dissatisfaction with the national
organization led to disaffiliation from that
group, dissatisfaction with the selective liv
ing principle and rush procedures led last fall
to the abolishment of selective rush. Beta Chi's
efforts at redefining the fraternity show what
may be possible for other living groups in this
system who want to break out of the pattern.

tion of Beta Chi, Inc. as an example of coopera
tion with former chapter members in provid
ing for growth and changes within the house.
Under this interpretation of the fraternity's
autonomy, the group would not operate spe
cilicully as a university residence, and fra
ternity members might form their own co
operative types of residences, possibly off
campus. McCarthy also expresses doubts about
the cluster plan for fraternities, since a large
amount of individuality is sacrificed and
groups are forced to tie themselves to the
University purse strings.
Just as dissatisfaction with the national
organization led to disaffiliation from that
group, dissatisfaction with the selective liv
ing principle and rush procedures led last fall
to the abolishment of selective rush. Beta Chi's
efforts at redefining the fraternity show what
may be possible for other living groups in this
system who want to break out of the pattern.

What happens when a fraternity breaks its
national ties? Of the four fraternities on cam
pus which have gone local, Beta Chi, formerly
Sigma Nu, has prehaps undergone the most
significant changes, the most recent, of which
was last fall's decision to abolish selective
rush and open membership to anyone in the
Stanford community.
Beta Chi was the second fraternity on campus
to disaffiliate from its national organization, a
decision which ended a two-year struggle with
the national over practices and principles, the
most significant being a membership clause
which discriminated on the basis of race.
In the summer of 1962 at a meeting of the
national fraternity in Pittsburg a motion to
abolish the discriminatory clauses had been
defeated by a vote of 215 to 76 Subsequently
the Stanford chapter introduced a motion to
eliminate the Oriental clause only, which failed
by a 2-1 over all margin.
In November of that year the chapter voted
to withdraw from the national organization
and become a local fraternity because of its

"fundamental disagreement" with the national
over the discriminatory clauses.
This move toward independence had orig
inated from the class of "63, a group of fresh
men student leaders who had pledged the fra
ternity as a group in 1960.
Former house president T. Grey (1962-63),
a member of the 1960 pledge class, stated at
the time of disaffiliation that "As pledges, we
felt that the discriminatory principles and
practices of the national were vesti
gal remnants from another era, anachronisms,
which must surely shortly disappear. We have
found this analysis was mistaken."
'Changes In Order'
John McCarthy, a member of the 1961 pledge
class and house president in 1962-63, 1963-64
said he "probably wouldn't have joined" the
fraternity if such changes hadn't been in
order.
According to McCarthy, the racial discrim
ination conflict was the issue which, when com
bined with other conflicts with the national
"pushed it over the top," and forced the local
chapter to articulate its stand. McCarthy feels
that even without the rebuff the Stanford
chapter received from the national at the

1962 convention, the fraternity would have dis
affiliated within a couple of years anyway.
Present Beta Chi President Dick Williams
cites several reasons for the action, among
them the discriminatory clause, a "desire to
be fully autonomous" and to dispense with
ritual which had largely fallen into disuse any
way, and a feeling that the expense of national
ties constituted an excessive hardship on the
house budget.
Williams sees the decision to go local as a
"reversal in values . . . for instance, the Sigma
Nu motorcycle garage was converted into the
house library." After the change, the fratern
ity's academic standing, previously in the
lower bracket, rated among the top five in the
time immediately following the conversion
and remained in the top one-third in the past
two > ears.
All of the fraternities which have gone local
view alumni support as a significant factor
in determining the subsequent status of the
fraternity, especially in regard to financial
matters. For the former members of Sigma
Nu, relations with alumni presented one of
the darker aspects to the problem of ad
justment.

Contact with alumni had not beeen particu
larly strong in the past, and the proposals at
the 1962 convention met with hostility on the
part of the national "establishment" and alum
ni. According to Williams, alums projected "at
least a five year period for such a change to
happen." But the Stanford group decided not
to wait, and the next fall they translated their
principles into aciion.
The lack of information made available to
alumni about the plans for the Sigma Nu's
proposed autonomy may have constituted a
temporary setback for the fraternity in ad
justing to its new status. Yet contacts were re
newed, and by 1965 a group of alumni helped
form a corporation, the Association of Beta
Chi, Inc., in order to enter negotiations with
the University for the purpose of repurchasing
the house.
With last fall's decision to abolish selective
rush, the chapter again "made a mistake" in
failing to contact alumni and inform them of
the group's intentions, according to Williams.
Again, alumni support has been somewhat
weaker than in the past.
While this independence of alumni support
seems to follow from the fraternity's desire

to be autonomous, McCarthy sops alumni sup
port as a means of intervention between the
fraternity and University powers—such as the
business otlice.

justing to its new status. Yet contacts were re
newed, and by 1965 a group of alumni helped
form a corporation, the Association of Beta
Chi, Inc., in order to enter negotiations with
the University for the purpose of repurchasing
the house.
With last fall's decision to abolish selective
rush, the chapter again "made a mistake" in
failing to contact alumni and inform them of
the group's intentions, according to Williams.
Again, alumni support has been somewhat
weaker than in the past.
While this independence of alumni support
seems to follow from the fraternity's desire

to be autonomous, McCarthy sops alumni sup
port as a means of intervention between the
fraternity and University powers—such as the
business otlice.
Beta Chi, Inc.
McCarthy points to the case of the Associa
tion of Beta Chi, Inc. as an example of coopera
tion with former chapter members in provid
ing for growth and changes within the house.
Under this interpretation of the fraternity's
autonomy, the group would not operate spe
cilicully as a university residence, and fra
ternity members might form their own co
operative types of residences, possibly off
campus. McCarthy also expresses doubts about
the cluster plan for fraternities, since a large
amount of individuality is sacrificed and
groups are forced to tie themselves to the
University purse strings.
Just as dissatisfaction with the national
organization led to disaffiliation from that
group, dissatisfaction with the selective liv
ing principle and rush procedures led last fall
to the abolishment of selective rush. Beta Chi's
efforts at redefining the fraternity show what
may be possible for other living groups in this
system who want to break out of the pattern.

What happens when a fraternity breaks its
national ties? Of the four fraternities on cam
pus which have gone local, Beta Chi, formerly
Sigma Nu, has prehaps undergone the most
significant changes, the most recent, of which
was last fall's decision to abolish selective
rush and open membership to anyone in the
Stanford community.
Beta Chi was the second fraternity on campus
to disaffiliate from its national organization, a
decision which ended a two-year struggle with
the national over practices and principles, the
most significant being a membership clause
which discriminated on the basis of race.
In the summer of 1962 at a meeting of the
national fraternity in Pittsburg a motion to
abolish the discriminatory clauses had been
defeated by a vote of 215 to 76 Subsequently
the Stanford chapter introduced a motion to
eliminate the Oriental clause only, which failed
by a 2-1 over all margin.
In November of that year the chapter voted
to withdraw from the national organization
and become a local fraternity because of its

"fundamental disagreement" with the national
over the discriminatory clauses.
This move toward independence had orig
inated from the class of "63, a group of fresh
men student leaders who had pledged the fra
ternity as a group in 1960.
Former house president T. Grey (1962-63),
a member of the 1960 pledge class, stated at
the time of disaffiliation that "As pledges, we
felt that the discriminatory principles and
practices of the national were vesti
gal remnants from another era, anachronisms,
which must surely shortly disappear. We have
found this analysis was mistaken."
'Changes In Order'
John McCarthy, a member of the 1961 pledge
class and house president in 1962-63, 1963-64
said he "probably wouldn't have joined" the
fraternity if such changes hadn't been in
order.
According to McCarthy, the racial discrim
ination conflict was the issue which, when com
bined with other conflicts with the national
"pushed it over the top," and forced the local
chapter to articulate its stand. McCarthy feels
that even without the rebuff the Stanford
chapter received from the national at the

1962 convention, the fraternity would have dis
affiliated within a couple of years anyway.
Present Beta Chi President Dick Williams
cites several reasons for the action, among
them the discriminatory clause, a "desire to
be fully autonomous" and to dispense with
ritual which had largely fallen into disuse any
way, and a feeling that the expense of national
ties constituted an excessive hardship on the
house budget.
Williams sees the decision to go local as a
"reversal in values . . . for instance, the Sigma
Nu motorcycle garage was converted into the
house library." After the change, the fratern
ity's academic standing, previously in the
lower bracket, rated among the top five in the
time immediately following the conversion
and remained in the top one-third in the past
two > ears.
All of the fraternities which have gone local
view alumni support as a significant factor
in determining the subsequent status of the
fraternity, especially in regard to financial
matters. For the former members of Sigma
Nu, relations with alumni presented one of
the darker aspects to the problem of ad
justment.

Contact with alumni had not beeen particu
larly strong in the past, and the proposals at
the 1962 convention met with hostility on the
part of the national "establishment" and alum
ni. According to Williams, alums projected "at
least a five year period for such a change to
happen." But the Stanford group decided not
to wait, and the next fall they translated their
principles into aciion.
The lack of information made available to
alumni about the plans for the Sigma Nu's
proposed autonomy may have constituted a
temporary setback for the fraternity in ad
justing to its new status. Yet contacts were re
newed, and by 1965 a group of alumni helped
form a corporation, the Association of Beta
