# Two To Act In The Zoo Story
## 
### 
Edward Albee's The Zoo Story
will be presented at the Experi
ment from March 3 through 5.
Curtain time for all perfor
mances will be 8:30 p.m., and
admission is free. There will
also be a preview on Wednesday
March 1.
The format of the perform
ance will be an original in that
after the play has been run
through once, following a short
intermission, it will be presented
again, with the two actors
switching parts.
The story deals with the con
frontation of two modern yet an
tithetical characters. The two
actors, William Clebsch and
John Stahlin, devised the idea
for the format last year.
They feel that as well as bene
fitting themselves, the presenta
tion will benefit the audience,
both by allowing the viewers to
see the well-defined differences
which can arise out of the same
work, and by allowing them to
see the play again. This, they
hope, will help to answer ques
tions raised during the first per
formance.
Clebsch and Stahlin, want
to bring out the differences in
herent in the actors' conceptions
of the two roles, and eliminate
any degree of sameness in the
two versions that would be im
posed by a director.
