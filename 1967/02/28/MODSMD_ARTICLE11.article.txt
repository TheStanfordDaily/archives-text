Large Lounge on "The Plight of
Soviet Jewry." The talk is the
last in a series of lectures on
Judaism Under Communism
sponsored by the Hillel Founda
tion.
Dr. Rahn has recently return
ed from a tour of the Soviet
Union with 23 other national
leaders of Hadassah, a Jewish
women's organization. The mis
sion to Russia was prompted by
a deep concern for the existence
of Jews in the U.S.S.R. as well
as interest in the medical and
educational installations of that
country.

concluded that a positive Jewish
identity exists among the Jews
in the Soviet Union, despite of
ficial efforts to eradicate the
spirit of Judaism. Soviet Jews

are still isolated from contact
with Jewish people in other
countries and are not permitted
to develop the institutions of
communal life.
In association with the Ameri
can Jewish Conference on So
viet Jewry, Hadassah had de
manded that the Russian gov
ernment grant its Jewish and
other ethnic groups the rights
and privileges accorded to oth
er groups within the U.S.S.R.

many and educated at the Uni
versities of Berlin, Freiberg,
