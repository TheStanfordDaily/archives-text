# Stanford Boxers Set For Naval Tourney
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Stanford will enter four men
in the Naval Collegiate Boxing
Tournament at Mare Island to
night at 7:30.
The Tourney draws from all
the teams <n the area, though a
reduced card this year has left it
somewhat doubtful that even the
four boxers entered will all par
ticipate.
Stanford will be represented
by Dave Hibbitts at 139, Tom
Steiner at 156, Bill Thomas at
147, and Gene Moffett in the
heavyweight division.

Hibbitts has a 2-1-0 record
this season and is a letter win
ner for the Indians.
This will bo the first varsity
match for Steiner, a rugged jun
ior coming up from the physical
education classes.
Bill Thomas has a 1-3-0 season
record, coming into this match
as the hard-luck member of the
varsity squad.
It will be the varsity debut
for Moffett as well as Steiner.
Moffett is a football and rugby
veteran for Stanford and a
strong competitor.

The Stanford team is 2-2 for
the year, both losses coming at
hands of the California boxing
team.
"This will bo a good chance
for the two new boxers, Steiner
and Moffett," commented Stan
ford Coach Ray Lunny. "We
have high hopes for both of
them for next year's team."
The next dual meet for Stan
ford will be the final match of
the season, against Chico State
College at Chico an Saturday,
March 4.
The participants in the Chico
meet have not yet been named.
