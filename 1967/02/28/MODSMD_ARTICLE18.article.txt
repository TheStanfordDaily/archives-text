the meet and rolled up 52 points
all-around.

high bar and trampoline, where
according to Coach John Gil
more, they could have added an

Stanford's gymnasts fell to
San Jose State Saturday night,
358.-149.75 despite the fact
that it was the Indians' best
meet of the season.
Spartan Tony Cappola prac
tically put on a one man show as
he captured six first places in
the meet and rolled up 52 points
all-around.
Almost Season High
The Indians were hurt in the
high bar and trampoline, where
according to Coach John Gil
more, they could have added an
other 7 points or so. Had they
added those points, the Indians
would have been up to 156, a
season high.

Stanford outscored SJS in
each of the last three events of
the meet, the six point lead that
the Spartans had gained on the
high bar was too great for the
Cards to overcome.
Best performances were
turned in on the parallel bars,
floor exercise and side horse. In
the parallel bars, John Marks
scored 8.5, John Rihderknecht
8.45 and Jim Snyder 8.1, to give
the team a total of 25.05.
Snyder Returns
Snyder, who just returned to
the team after an injury, also
posted an 8.5, his season high,
in the long horse. Jim Petersen
was still unable to work all
around due to his wrist injury.
