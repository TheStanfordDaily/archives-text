# Socialist To Consider Prospects For Peace
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Norman Thomas, six-time Socialist
Party candidate for President of the
United States, will speak in Cubberley
Auditorium this afternoon at 4:15.
His speech, "Road to Peace", will be
a part of the Political Union's Focus
on the Great Society in America and
will deal with the "values of interna
tional democracy."
Lambda Nu will hold a reception
for Thomas at 2 p.m. This evening,
Thomas, who will be a guest of Stern,
will participate in an informal discus
sion in the Serra Lounge.
Last spring when he was at Stan
ford, Thomas was extremely critical
of President Johnson's handling of
the Vietnam situation.
'Get Out'
"We have got to get out," he said.
"It is incredible that we should be
sending boys to die for people who
don't want them there."
Thomas also commented at that
time "We must either co-exist with
China or cease to exist."
During the factional disputes with
in the Socialist Party in the 1930'5,
Thomas represented the "progres
sive" faction opposing the old-line

Marxists. As part of his 1936 Presi
dential campaign, Thomas criticized
the New Deal for meeting only eco
nomic emergency while failing to cor
rect the moral problems.
As the issues of Communism, fasc
ism, and organized labor weakened
the party through further factional
ism, the New Deal stole much of the
Socialist Party's appeal.
Trip To Russia
His trip to Russia during the 1937
purges, left Thomas very disen
chanted with the Soviet experiment.
When the United States entered
World War II with Russia as an ally,
Thomas criticized that country for
her totalitarian form of government.
While he retreated somewhat from
his stand of absolute pacifism,
Thomas remained a member of the
Keep America Out of War Commit
tee. He felt American envolvement
in the war would only spread fascism
at home without destroying it abroad.
Despite his political interests,
Thomas was ordained a minister of
the American Parish in West Harlem.
He received his A.B. from Princeton
in 1905, where he was valedictorian of
his class.

rect the moral problems.
As the issues of Communism, fasc
ism, and organized labor weakened
the party through further factional
ism, the New Deal stole much of the
Socialist Party's appeal.
Trip To Russia
His trip to Russia during the 1937
purges, left Thomas very disen
chanted with the Soviet experiment.
When the United States entered
World War II with Russia as an ally,
Thomas criticized that country for
her totalitarian form of government.
While he retreated somewhat from
his stand of absolute pacifism,
Thomas remained a member of the
Keep America Out of War Commit
tee. He felt American envolvement
in the war would only spread fascism
at home without destroying it abroad.
Despite his political interests,
Thomas was ordained a minister of
the American Parish in West Harlem.
He received his A.B. from Princeton
in 1905, where he was valedictorian of
his class.
Norman Thomas, six-time Socialist
Party candidate for President of the
United States, will speak in Cubberley
Auditorium this afternoon at 4:15.
His speech, "Road to Peace", will be
a part of the Political Union's Focus
on the Great Society in America and
will deal with the "values of interna
tional democracy."
Lambda Nu will hold a reception
for Thomas at 2 p.m. This evening,
Thomas, who will be a guest of Stern,
will participate in an informal discus
sion in the Serra Lounge.
Last spring when he was at Stan
ford, Thomas was extremely critical
of President Johnson's handling of
the Vietnam situation.
'Get Out'
"We have got to get out," he said.
"It is incredible that we should be
sending boys to die for people who
don't want them there."
Thomas also commented at that
time "We must either co-exist with
China or cease to exist."
During the factional disputes with
in the Socialist Party in the 1930'5,
Thomas represented the "progres
sive" faction opposing the old-line

Marxists. As part of his 1936 Presi
dential campaign, Thomas criticized
the New Deal for meeting only eco
nomic emergency while failing to cor
rect the moral problems.
