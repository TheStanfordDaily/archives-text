## 'Intolerance' Evokes Disgust 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have gotten fairly disgusted
in the last few days reading the
letters of those who utterly
condemn Vice President Hum
phrey for maintaining that our
role in the Vietnamese war is
morally justified. I have never
seen such intellectual intolerance
as that exhibited by Humphrey's
detractors who deride him for
holding a belief contrary to
theirs, for sincerely making a
judgment they feel is intolerable
because it is not the one they
would make.
Bob Fishman's editorial
(Daily, Feb. 27) impuning the
moral-intellectual integrity of
Humphrey's applauders is so far
the climax of this irrational dog
matism that cannot conceive of
anyone holding a different opin
ion and at the same time retain
ing some shred of honor.
I applauded the Vice President
not in flight from identity crises,
soul-searching, or moral un
easiness. I took no refuge in
moral self • righteousness, a
charge I cannot help laying be
fore the bigots I speak of.
.Rather, I applauded the state
ment of a moral belief that I,
after much sincere consideration
of all viewpoints involved, have
decided —quite freely and hon
estly—to embrace.

• Injustice
Editor, The Daily:
Re Bob Fishman's column in
the February 27 Daily: after
reading his article I feel com
pelled to offer additions and in
terpretations to some of the
grossly unfair and inadequate
remarks made by him.
First, I question the logic of
anyone who could falsely as
sume that Mr. Humphrey was
giving assurance to his listeners
so that "they could lean back in
their chairs in a posture of
moral self-righteousness."
It would be an unfathomable
injustice to assume that our
government is not constantly col
lecting information, examining,
and re-examining our position
in Vietnam and other areas of
the world, and therefore, that
those who support our govern
ment's policies have no obliga
tion to maintain the same search
ing attitude. To do otherwise is
to commit a horrendous breach
of trust and to undermine the
roots of our democratic society.
Secondly, I find myself won
dering about the thoroughness
of that individual who re-defines
himself as a "mocker." Since
Mr. Fishman did not write
otherwise, am I to assume that
all this individual does is mock?
I see little evidence to suggest
that this individual has clearly
stated goals and programs upon
which our government could
base its foreign policy in the
events of withdrawal from Viet
nam. Until such alternative roles
are developed, I will continue to
be amazed that public officials
will afford him such respect and
consideration as they do at pres
ent.
Thirdly, I would appreciate a
clarification of the membership
in the CBS group of "Vietnam
fanatics" led by Robert McAfee
Brown. Surely this does not in
clude those who walked out on
the Vice President or those who
came close to injuring him after
his speech. I believe one of the
handouts passed around before
the speech and Professor's
Brown's letter in the same is
sue of The Daily as Fishman's
column clearly point out his dis
approval of those groups' acts.
Finally, I would like to say,
yes, I would applaud.

• Misunderstood
Editor, The Daily:
In the article on Negroes at
Stanford, Steve Gruber unfortu
nately misunderstood my reas
ons for depledging SAE. When
I pledged SAE, I was well aware
of the fact that five Negroes
lived in Fremont. I thought I
had explicitly explained to Steve
my reasons for depledging; ap
parently I had not.
I do feel it is natural for Ne
groes to associate with each
other because they have more
in common; but if a white and
Negro can really get to know
one another or can meet on
some common ground, it can be
come natural for them to associ
ate. I believe I had this common
ground with the guys in SAE.
I explained to the members of
SAE why I depledged and do not
feel compelled to give an ex
planation to the rest of the Stan
ford community, but it was not
due to a desire to "stay" with
the Negroes in Fremont.

• Hardly A Prophet
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily quotes Dave Harris
as stating "Originally, we ruled
out the idea of winning . . . Our
intention was to make the rest
of the candidates speak to the
important issues." This goal
was accomplished in the pri
mary election. In view of Har
ris's remark "I can't be an exec
utive, I can't be an administra
tor," he should have resigned at
that time because being student
body president demands these
very capabilities.
Furthermore, we cannot con
cur with the laudatory views
that Harris is a "prophet" by
virtue of his "sharp unremit
ting criticism." It is relatively
simple to criticize in White Pla
za, but histrionics alone are not
constructive. Appeals shouted
over a microphone are far from
positive contributions to the un
iversity. Words are of little val
ue when divorced from pro
grams of action conscientiously
pursued.
In his column of February 24,
Tim Haight praised the moral
leadership which Harris gave
the university. Is it moral to
assume a prestigious position in
order to express personal views
without accepting the full-term
duties inherent in that position?

• Ironic Tyranny
Editor, The Daily:
The recent controversy over
the CIA-NSA relationship un
derlines a certain irony which
appears ever more frequently
in U.S. governmental policy.
Apologists for the CIA remind
its critics that "The U.S. could
not comfortably sit by while
Moscow made its grandstand
play for the imaginations and
loyalities of the world's youth."
(Time, Feb. 24) To strike a blow
for freedom, to prevent the ne
farious Communist plot to infil
trate youth groups, the U.S.
chose to employ the N.S.A.;
thereby making the student rep
resentatives—and indirectly the
student bodies of the 300 mem
ber institutions — involuntary,
and often unwilling, parties to
U.S. cold war diplomacy. In
short, our government adopted
the tactics of its opponents.
Our government fights a war
in Vietnam for the self-deter
mination of peoples. It fights
against those who would terror
ize and slaughter peaceful civil
ians, who mutilate prisoners,
who are aggressors. To end this
unbearable state of affairs, the
U.S. terrorizes and kills peace
ful civilians, tortures prisoners,
establishes itself firmly in coun
tries some 6,000 miles away, and
supports a military junta.
It does all this while striving

for the implementation of our
ideology, which is every bit as
foreign to Vietnam as is that of
the Communists. (Remember
that candidates for the Constitu
ent Assembly were screened be
fore their names could be placed
on the ballots.)
One reason we have found the
Communist domination of var
ious states so appalling is the
unwillingness of the Commu
nists to allow free speech and
criticism of their rule. Yet, how
ever much we loathe coercion
and intimidation, those who op
pose the war have been intimi
dated upon occassion—reclassi
fied 1-A—and sent off to Asia
and elsewhere.
Opponents of the war are
called un-American and investi
gated by the government. Of
ficials of the government ignore
the voice of honest, well-founded
dissent, refuse repeatedly to
justify their actions in a mean
ingful way to those they are
supposed to represent.
I would very much like to
respect and feel akin to the
country in which I live; but how
can I, when it. so frequently imi
tates the tactics of the countries
it tells me I am supposed to die
opposing. I am very tempted,
rather, to employ the words of
Diderot's "Rameau's Nephew,"
who, asked if fighting for his
country is vanity, replies: "Van
ity! There are no countries left.
All I see from pole to pole is
tyrants and slaves."

• Referendum
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the unrep
resented constituency of LASSU,
i.e. a Stanford student, I wel
come the series of fresh anal
ysis on that body by Fritz
Schaefer. To me it seems amaz
ing that I, along with most oth
ers here, do not know my rep
resentatives nor do they know or
attempt to know me; yet they
claim to represent me.
Perhaps my ignorance is due
to a lack of interest, but then,
why should I be interested in the
attempts of David Harris and his
toads to play politicians. When,
by his activism, announcedly
representative of American stu
dents, he strains the relation
ship of me and millions of other
students vis-a-vis our draft
boards and thereby frustrates
many attempts to get an educa
tion, supposedly the purpose of
going to college, I realize his
game is getting out of hand.
This "providing (of) benefits
to students" is one of the LASSU
purposes mentioned in Tom
Shanahan's letter (Daily, Feb.
20) defending the system; the
other is representation of stu
dent opinion to faculty and ad
ministrators which even he
senses is a farce in view of the
LASSU proposal to condemn stu
dent participation in the stu
dent-faculty Planning (Packer)
Committee.
The homogeneity of Harris'
appointments indicates that what
is best for SDS is best for Stan
ford students. However, I don't
subscribe to this parochial view.
Instead of baiting the adminis
tration and picketing "to get
what we (whoever that means)
want" a student-faculty-adminis
tration rapprochcment should be
attempted.
To this end I urge that the
following proposal be submitted
to the Stanford student body in a
mass referendum:
If you are for more moderate
relations among the various Uni
versity groups and truer rep
resentation of student opinion,
make love; but if you are for
hate, intolerance and misrepre
sentation (and have the con
science of your convictions) mail
in your 2-S deferment.

• Roar!
Editor, The Daily:
Near the Lagunita this week
I observed the Stanford Police
detaining two motorcyclists who
had been riding on the dam. I
would like to commend the
campus police. There is a sign
on the dam prohibiting vehicles
of all types and yet, every day
there is to be seen the inevitable
barrage of motorcycles.
I would like to send out an ap
peal that we maintain a little
peace and quiet in at least one
corner of our campus for those
who enjoy walking there. Espe
cially with all the construction
going on, those places are get
ting harder to come by.

• Outside Vietvs
(Editor's note: The following
two letters were sent by alumni
to President Sterling, with cop
ies to THE DAILY.)
What has happened to Stan
ford? This evening on national
TV news I see Stanford stu
dents running like a howling
mob after the Vice President of
the United States. Climbing on
the automobile and throwing
themselves in front of it to be
forcibly removed by police of
ficials and the Secret Service.
I understand I was a member
of the "passive generation"
(Class of 1951). However, in
1951 Stanford had an Honor
Code and part of the Honor
Code was The Fundamental
Standard. I reread it this eve
ning;
"Students are expected to
show both within and without
the University sueh respect for
order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others, as is
demanded of good citizens. Fail
ure to do this will be sufficient
cause for removal from the Uni
versity."
Has this Fundamental Stan
dard been repealed along the
line or does todays Stanford stu
dent feel he is above respect,
dignity, and the limited exercise
of dissent traditional in a demo
cratic society.
Those limited numbers who
participated in this demonstra
tion should feel ashamed and
should be discredited by the Uni
versity in the traditional man
ner—suspension! But, in a
larger sense, the student body
of today should stand with
bowed head for having per
mitted a climate to develop
where free and open dissent
takes the form of a howling,
running, mob baying at the
heels of a Vice President of the
United States.

I realize that it protocol to
apologize to Vice President
Humphrey for the events lead
ing up to and surrounding his
impromptu foot race with stu
dents of Stanford.
I believe, however, that is is
Humphrey who owes the apol
ogy, not only to the students
of Stanford, but to the whole
generation they represent.
