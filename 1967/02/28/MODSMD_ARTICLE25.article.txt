# The 						â€˜Betrayed Generation'
## 
### BOB EWEGEN Editor, Colorado Daily 
Well, scratch one dream.
The United States National
Student Association, the leading
voice of American youth in the
postwar era, has officially admit
ted that it has been supported
for a decade by funds of the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency.
As in most pacts of dishonor,
it was easy for both participants
to rationalize their actions. In
the early 50's USNSA was des
perately short of money, espe
cially to carry on their vital in
ternational program. These pro
grams included NSA's member
ship in the International Student

Conference, scholarships to such
foreign nations as Algeria, ex
change programs and other
vital projects.
It is at this point that the CIA
entered the picture. USNSA has
a liberal image in America. But
in the context of world student
opinion it emerged as a conser
vative one. USNSA's progressive
ideals and pragmatic American
ism were probably America's
best possible image to a world
student body which blinks at the
jingoistic term "UnAmerican"
and fails to understand our holy
crusade against the forms of so
cialism which many of their
countries practice.
Complications
Furthermore, USNSA was the
most influential member, both
financially and spiritually, of the
International Student Confer
ence (ISC). ISC, composed main
ly of Western and neutralist na
tions, was the only force block
ing the rival International
Union of Students (IIJS) from
dominating world student orga
nizations.
The lUS, headquartered in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, was and
is dominated by Communist
youth organizations. Thus, the
corrupt bargain was struck- by
USNAS out of apparent neces
sity, by CIA out of callous op
portunism.
For a while the bargain
worked. USNSA built a strong
financial base. Last year they
were strong enough to give up
CIA money entirely rather than
continue to compromise princi
ple. CIA had an effective Ameri
can voice in the councils of world
student opinion. But the fruits of

the poisoned tree cannot long en
dure when the baseness of their
genesis Is known.
Trust Betrayed
Many names have been pro
posed for this generation. We
are not the silent generation,
nor the lost generation. Perhaps
we have been in search of a
name. But now the student lead
ers of America know. We are
the infiltrated generation. We
are the kept generation. We are
the preempted generation. The
words coined in jest at Berkeley,
"Don't trust anyone over thirty,"
came back to mock us now in
earnest.
In terms of the ideals of our
greatest organization, in terms
of the seriousness of our goals,
in terms of the very sanctity
of human idealism itself, we are
now dazed to find that we have
been but kept radicals, allowed
to bray nobly while chewing for
fodder of those who have cyni
cally herded us for their own
ends. USNSA will be a long time
recovering.
For its part the CIA will pay
heavily too. We have handi
capped ourselves with a per
manent plateau of distrust
through world youth. It will be
a long time before an Asian,
African or Latin American stu
dent listens to an American visi
tor without wondering if he
has been subsidized or screened
to parrot words not of his own
choosing. With the new genera
tion of student leaders, who will
he facing us across negotiating
tables a brief generation hence,
this may be our greatest diplo
matic catastrophe of the post
war period.

The Class of 007
Well, scratch one dream.
The United States National
Student Association, the leading
voice of American youth in the
postwar era, has officially admit
ted that it has been supported
for a decade by funds of the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency.
As in most pacts of dishonor,
it was easy for both participants
to rationalize their actions. In
the early 50's USNSA was des
perately short of money, espe
cially to carry on their vital in
ternational program. These pro
grams included NSA's member
ship in the International Student

Conference, scholarships to such
foreign nations as Algeria, ex
change programs and other
vital projects.
It is at this point that the CIA
entered the picture. USNSA has
a liberal image in America. But
in the context of world student
opinion it emerged as a conser
vative one. USNSA's progressive
ideals and pragmatic American
ism were probably America's
best possible image to a world
student body which blinks at the
jingoistic term "UnAmerican"
and fails to understand our holy
crusade against the forms of so
cialism which many of their
countries practice.
Complications
Furthermore, USNSA was the
most influential member, both
financially and spiritually, of the
International Student Confer
ence (ISC). ISC, composed main
ly of Western and neutralist na
tions, was the only force block
ing the rival International
Union of Students (IIJS) from
dominating world student orga
nizations.
The lUS, headquartered in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, was and
is dominated by Communist
youth organizations. Thus, the
corrupt bargain was struck- by
USNAS out of apparent neces
sity, by CIA out of callous op
portunism.
For a while the bargain
worked. USNSA built a strong
financial base. Last year they
were strong enough to give up
CIA money entirely rather than
continue to compromise princi
ple. CIA had an effective Ameri
can voice in the councils of world
student opinion. But the fruits of

the poisoned tree cannot long en
dure when the baseness of their
genesis Is known.
Trust Betrayed
Many names have been pro
posed for this generation. We
are not the silent generation,
nor the lost generation. Perhaps
we have been in search of a
name. But now the student lead
ers of America know. We are
the infiltrated generation. We
are the kept generation. We are
the preempted generation. The
words coined in jest at Berkeley,
"Don't trust anyone over thirty,"
came back to mock us now in
earnest.
In terms of the ideals of our
greatest organization, in terms
of the seriousness of our goals,
in terms of the very sanctity
of human idealism itself, we are
now dazed to find that we have
been but kept radicals, allowed
to bray nobly while chewing for
fodder of those who have cyni
cally herded us for their own
ends. USNSA will be a long time
recovering.
For its part the CIA will pay
heavily too. We have handi
capped ourselves with a per
manent plateau of distrust
through world youth. It will be
a long time before an Asian,
African or Latin American stu
dent listens to an American visi
tor without wondering if he
has been subsidized or screened
to parrot words not of his own
choosing. With the new genera
tion of student leaders, who will
