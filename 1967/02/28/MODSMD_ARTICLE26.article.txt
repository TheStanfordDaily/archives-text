# The 						Capitol Scene
## Hard Times For Agents 
### Art Buchwald 
Many students have been in
terviewed concerning how they
felt to discover they were part of
a CIA-financed operation, but no
body has bothered to interview
anyone from the CIA to ask
how he felt to be part of a stu
dent organization.
I had the good fortune to
speak to a CTA man on a park
bench in Lafayette Square. I
knew he was a CIA man the
minute I saw him because he
was counting out $100,000 in
cash to give to several students
who were picketing the White
House to stop the bombing in
Vietnam.
One of the bills blew away,
and when I retrieved it for the
agent he told me to keep it and
invited me to sit down
"lt's very discouraging," he
said. "Here I thought I had
joined a professional outfit, and
it turns out that all I'm doing is
giving money to students and
labor union leaders."
Lost Prestige
"But that's a big responsibil
ity," I said. "Not everyone can
be a James Bond."
"That's all right for you to
say," he replied, feeding a squir
rel a $100 bill. "But when I
joined the CIA, I thought it was
just a few of us fighting the
evil forces of communism
throughout the world. Now it
turns out every Tom, Dick,
Harry and even Gloria is work
ing for the CIA. Half the damn
country is somehow supported
by the organization, and there
just doesn't seem to be any dis
tinction in being a secret agent
any more."
"It's true that there are more
of you than you thought," I said.
"But you have to remember it
was your money that made the
whole thing possible."
Just then a man came up and

said, "I need $75,000 to send a
Vassar student tour up the Ama
zon."
The CIA agent counted out
$75,000 and gave it. to the man.
"May I have an extra $5 for
lunch?" the man asked.
The agent gave him $20.
"Evoryone thinks we're made of
money," he said to me after the
man left. "But the truth is
they're getting very sticky over
at headquarters. You have to
prove you're a completely inde
pendent organization without
any posible government ties be
fore you can become eligible for
CIA funds."
"I guess there aren't many of
those left any more," I said.
And Hell's Angels
A motorcycle roared up and a
tough, bearded fellow in a leath
er jacket came over. "We need
25 grand to start a chapter in
Wilmington, Del."
The CIA man gave him $25,-
000.
"Are you behind the Hell's
Angels, too?" I asked in amaze
ment.
"Don't ask," the agent replied.
"I don't know how to say
this," I said, "but I have a syn
dicated column and I'm up to
my ears in debt. I'm sure I could
perform some service for you."
"How much do you need?" the
agent asked.
"Could I have $10,000 to start
with ? With that kind of money
I could really fight communism."
He reached into his satchel
and counted out the cash. "Well,
that about cleans me out," he
said. "I'll have to go back to
Langley and get some more."
"Thanks a million," I said
gratefully.
"Don't mention it. We've been
trying to put a columnist on the
payroll for a long time now. Be
sides, you have an honest face."
