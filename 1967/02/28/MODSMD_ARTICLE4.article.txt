# Building Plans Reevaluated
## Administration Holds Housing Report Fate 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
News Analysis
The University has been presented
with a housing report written mainly
by students and a building plan drawn
drawn up by the administration. So
far there has been no word from the
administration, which will make the
final decision, on whether the recom
mendations of the ASSU Housing
Commission will be incorporated into
its plans.
It was announced about four
months ago that construction of
David and Margaret Jacks Hall is
being postponed. The third fraternity
cluster and Robert Moore Hull, how
ever, are scheduled for occupancy in
1968.
As things now stand, according to
Edward Scoles of the University
Housing Office, plans for Robert
Moore Hall are undergoing reevalu
ation in light of several recent de
velopments. Questions have been
raised about its design, facilities for
specifically educational input, fi
nances, and University enrollment,
questions that, according to Dean of
Students Joel Smith, could conceiv
ably bring about revision or even

cancellation of present plans.
Wilbur Experiment
Smith told The Daily that the pro
posals in the ASSU report for a Wil
bur Experiment in housing are now
being given serious consideration by
the administration and will be taken
up by the Study of Education at Stan
ford headed by Vice Provost Herbert
Packer. Whether or not to build Rob
ert Moore Hall according to present
designs is a subject being taken up
by a different group of people, which
will make it final decision today.
Robert Moore, as it is now con
ceived, will have no facilities for
seminar rooms and faculty residences.
It will house 140 men and 140 women,
with central dining and recreational
facilities, lounge and study. If it is
built now, there will be additional
expense required if the administra
tion should decide that he Wilbur
Experiment ought to be expanded to
all University housing.
It is fairly apparent that the ad
ministration has decided more dormi
tories are needed on this campus.
How they will be built is a question
that was decided long before the
ASSU housing report was released.

There is little connection between
the proposals of the Housing Com
mission and the housing facilities the
administration plans to build, insofar
as they might conflict. The two items
which have been removed from the
plans for Robert Moore — seminar
rooms and faculty residences — are
specifically endorsed by the Housing
Commission. They can, however, be
added later if the administration de
cides they are desirable.
The fraternity cluster, scheduled
for completion in autumn 1968, does
not as a group of buildings run con
trary to any of the Housing Commis
sion's recommendations. The question
of whether fraternities should exist
at all may be argued long and heat
edly. The Housing Commission main
tains that selective living defeats edu
cation by excluding diversity. The fra
ternities maintain that they do not
exclude diversity and that even if
they did, who a person wants to live
with is nobody's business but his own.
The fact remains, however, that if
fraternities were ever abolished, the
buildings could easily be converted
into living groups like the Grove
Project, which is now attempting to

remove the dichotomy between class
room and residential experience.
If the Wilbur Experiment is tried
and proves to be successful, it would
by no means be impossible to spread
the concept to other University hous
ing.
Education-In-Residence
Carrying education into the resi
dence depends only to a small degree
on what the residence looks like. Coed
living is feasible even in dormitories
as they exist now. Faculty contact
with students is helped by the faculty
resident system, but it may be that
the cost is prohibitive, something that
can best be decided by the University
Housing Office. Seminars, classes and
tutoring might best be carried on in
special rooms, but these can be ar
ranged even after a dormitory is
built.
A separate question might be, how
will the new housing facilities live
up to Stanford's professed idea that
"living and learning, social and in
tellectual life, should not be separate
but together"? It remains to be seen.
The question is expected to be taken
up by the Packer committee on the
Study of Education at Stanford.

Education-In-Residence
Carrying education into the resi
dence depends only to a small degree
on what the residence looks like. Coed
living is feasible even in dormitories
as they exist now. Faculty contact
with students is helped by the faculty
resident system, but it may be that
the cost is prohibitive, something that
can best be decided by the University
Housing Office. Seminars, classes and
tutoring might best be carried on in
special rooms, but these can be ar
ranged even after a dormitory is
built.
A separate question might be, how
will the new housing facilities live
up to Stanford's professed idea that
"living and learning, social and in
tellectual life, should not be separate
but together"? It remains to be seen.
The question is expected to be taken
up by the Packer committee on the
Study of Education at Stanford.
News Analysis
The University has been presented
with a housing report written mainly
by students and a building plan drawn
drawn up by the administration. So
far there has been no word from the
administration, which will make the
final decision, on whether the recom
mendations of the ASSU Housing
Commission will be incorporated into
its plans.
It was announced about four
months ago that construction of
David and Margaret Jacks Hall is
being postponed. The third fraternity
cluster and Robert Moore Hull, how
ever, are scheduled for occupancy in
1968.
As things now stand, according to
Edward Scoles of the University
Housing Office, plans for Robert
Moore Hall are undergoing reevalu
ation in light of several recent de
velopments. Questions have been
raised about its design, facilities for
specifically educational input, fi
nances, and University enrollment,
questions that, according to Dean of
Students Joel Smith, could conceiv
ably bring about revision or even

cancellation of present plans.
Wilbur Experiment
Smith told The Daily that the pro
posals in the ASSU report for a Wil
bur Experiment in housing are now
being given serious consideration by
the administration and will be taken
up by the Study of Education at Stan
ford headed by Vice Provost Herbert
Packer. Whether or not to build Rob
ert Moore Hall according to present
designs is a subject being taken up
by a different group of people, which
will make it final decision today.
Robert Moore, as it is now con
ceived, will have no facilities for
seminar rooms and faculty residences.
It will house 140 men and 140 women,
with central dining and recreational
facilities, lounge and study. If it is
built now, there will be additional
expense required if the administra
tion should decide that he Wilbur
Experiment ought to be expanded to
all University housing.
It is fairly apparent that the ad
ministration has decided more dormi
tories are needed on this campus.
How they will be built is a question
that was decided long before the
ASSU housing report was released.

There is little connection between
the proposals of the Housing Com
mission and the housing facilities the
administration plans to build, insofar
as they might conflict. The two items
which have been removed from the
plans for Robert Moore — seminar
rooms and faculty residences — are
specifically endorsed by the Housing
Commission. They can, however, be
added later if the administration de
cides they are desirable.
The fraternity cluster, scheduled
for completion in autumn 1968, does
not as a group of buildings run con
trary to any of the Housing Commis
sion's recommendations. The question
of whether fraternities should exist
at all may be argued long and heat

exclude diversity and that even if

with central dining and recreational
facilities, lounge and study. If it is
built now, there will be additional
expense required if the administra
tion should decide that he Wilbur
Experiment ought to be expanded to
all University housing.
It is fairly apparent that the ad
ministration has decided more dormi
tories are needed on this campus.
How they will be built is a question
that was decided long before the
ASSU housing report was released.

There is little connection between
the proposals of the Housing Com
mission and the housing facilities the
administration plans to build, insofar
as they might conflict. The two items
which have been removed from the
plans for Robert Moore — seminar
rooms and faculty residences — are
specifically endorsed by the Housing
Commission. They can, however, be
added later if the administration de
cides they are desirable.
The fraternity cluster, scheduled
for completion in autumn 1968, does
not as a group of buildings run con
trary to any of the Housing Commis
sion's recommendations. The question
of whether fraternities should exist
at all may be argued long and heat
edly. The Housing Commission main
tains that selective living defeats edu
cation by excluding diversity. The fra
ternities maintain that they do not
exclude diversity and that even if
they did, who a person wants to live
with is nobody's business but his own.
The fact remains, however, that if
fraternities were ever abolished, the
buildings could easily be converted
into living groups like the Grove
Project, which is now attempting to

remove the dichotomy between class
room and residential experience.
If the Wilbur Experiment is tried
and proves to be successful, it would
by no means be impossible to spread
the concept to other University hous
ing.
Education-In-Residence
Carrying education into the resi
dence depends only to a small degree
on what the residence looks like. Coed
living is feasible even in dormitories
as they exist now. Faculty contact
with students is helped by the faculty
resident system, but it may be that
the cost is prohibitive, something that
can best be decided by the University
Housing Office. Seminars, classes and
tutoring might best be carried on in
special rooms, but these can be ar
ranged even after a dormitory is
built.
A separate question might be, how
will the new housing facilities live
up to Stanford's professed idea that
"living and learning, social and in
tellectual life, should not be separate
but together"? It remains to be seen.
The question is expected to be taken
up by the Packer committee on the
Study of Education at Stanford.
