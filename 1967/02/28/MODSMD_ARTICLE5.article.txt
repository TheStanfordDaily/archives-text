# Group To Begin Vietnam Protest
## 
### BEVERLY CORY 
A white armband worn every
Wednesday may become the standard
symbol of protest of the Vietnamese
war, for Stanford students. The arm
band will hopefully serve as a stimu
lus to educated discussion of the prin
ciples behind the conflict in Southeast
Asia.
This is the hope of the Ad-Hoc
Committee Concerned about Vietnam,
which today is distributing on campus
a statement announcing the new form
of dissent.
The paper reads in part: "As a sign
of our concern for the suffering on
both sides in Vietnam and as an ex
pression of our desire for peace, we
urge you to join us in wearing a
white armband every Wednesday."
Armbands Provided
A table will be manned in White
Plaza from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. tomorrow,
providing armbands to students who
need them. "But even a white hand
kerchief would work," said one of the
instigators of the movement.
Vice-president Humphrey's visit to
Stanford sparked the idea last week
when a group of faculty members
urged students to wear armbands as
part of the silent protest. Observers
impressed by this means of disapprov
al met Thursday to discuss perpetu
ating the idea, forming a committee
whose stated purpose is "to speak
out against a national policy that is
leading our world toward disaster."

A commitee member named the
most important goal of the move,
"to provoke discussion about Viet
nam on campus." Students who wear
armbands, he said, will indicate a
willingness to explain and defend
their position on the war. "If someone
is wearing an armband, others will
go up and ask him 'Why?' In this
way the protest has educational
value."
Continuing Nature
Another important aspect of this
protest, the committee feels, is its
continuing nature. "We want to do
something that doesn't ebb and flow;
we want a demonstration that shows
continued concern, week after week."
The effort is designed to draw Stan
ford into a national program which
originated at UCLA. This program
coordinates about 40 universities
across the U.S. which currently hold
some kind of protest each Wednesday
noon. Some engage speakers, others
maintain silent vigils.
Stanford's commitee hopes that the
use of armbands will spread to these
other schools, and also that some of
their activities might be brought here,
possibly spring quarter.
The armbands, as a dignified way of
showing discontent, involve no radical
or violent demonstrations. As such,
the committee hopes they will appeal
to moderates who have before hesi
tated to express their opposition for
fear of being identified with left-wing
groups.

both sides in Vietnam and as an ex
pression of our desire for peace, we
urge you to join us in wearing a
white armband every Wednesday."
Armbands Provided
A table will be manned in White
Plaza from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. tomorrow,
providing armbands to students who
need them. "But even a white hand
kerchief would work," said one of the
instigators of the movement.
Vice-president Humphrey's visit to
Stanford sparked the idea last week
when a group of faculty members
urged students to wear armbands as
part of the silent protest. Observers
impressed by this means of disapprov
al met Thursday to discuss perpetu
ating the idea, forming a committee
whose stated purpose is "to speak
out against a national policy that is
leading our world toward disaster."

A commitee member named the
most important goal of the move,
"to provoke discussion about Viet
nam on campus." Students who wear
armbands, he said, will indicate a
willingness to explain and defend
their position on the war. "If someone
is wearing an armband, others will
go up and ask him 'Why?' In this
way the protest has educational
value."
Continuing Nature
Another important aspect of this
protest, the committee feels, is its
continuing nature. "We want to do
something that doesn't ebb and flow;
we want a demonstration that shows
continued concern, week after week."
The effort is designed to draw Stan
ford into a national program which
originated at UCLA. This program
coordinates about 40 universities
across the U.S. which currently hold
some kind of protest each Wednesday
noon. Some engage speakers, others
maintain silent vigils.
Stanford's commitee hopes that the
use of armbands will spread to these
other schools, and also that some of
their activities might be brought here,
possibly spring quarter.
The armbands, as a dignified way of
showing discontent, involve no radical
or violent demonstrations. As such,
the committee hopes they will appeal
to moderates who have before hesi
tated to express their opposition for
fear of being identified with left-wing
groups.
A white armband worn every
Wednesday may become the standard
symbol of protest of the Vietnamese
war, for Stanford students. The arm
band will hopefully serve as a stimu
lus to educated discussion of the prin
ciples behind the conflict in Southeast
Asia.
This is the hope of the Ad-Hoc
Committee Concerned about Vietnam,
which today is distributing on campus
a statement announcing the new form
of dissent.
The paper reads in part: "As a sign
of our concern for the suffering on
both sides in Vietnam and as an ex
pression of our desire for peace, we
urge you to join us in wearing a
white armband every Wednesday."
