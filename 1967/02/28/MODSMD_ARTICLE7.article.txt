# Panel Seeks Tighter Student Deferments
## 
### WILLIAM F. ARBOGAST 
WASHINGTON (AP> — A Citizens'
panel recommended to the House
Armed Services Committee yesterday
tightening draft deferment for stu
dents and more emphasis on induc
tion of younger men in the 19-25-year
age group.
The report of the panel headed by
retired Gen. Mark W. Clark was made
public by the committee.
It supports the general philosophy
of of the present selective service sys
tem It rejects proposals for a national
lottery system and a universal na
tional service system that would
equate non-military service with mili
tary duty.
Uniform Deferment
If approved by Congress, the recom
mendations would promote more uni
formity in deferment procedures of
local draft boards and reduce the like
lihood of youths being inducted into
military service after their 21st birth
day.
The Clark committee is separate

from a National Commission on Se
lective Service set up by President
Johnson last summer in the wake of
mounting study protests to the draft.
That presidential group is expected to
make its recommendations to John
son later this week.
In contrast to the Clark panel, the
presidential group is reported plan
ning to suggest that Johnson ask
Congress to revolutionize the draft
with a lottery system.
The Younger Men
However, the presidential group is
reported—as does the Clark commit
tee— favoring taking the younger
men first. At present the draft begins
with 26-year olds and works down in
the 1A bracket.
Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, the National
Draft Director, has favored keeping
the draft system pretty much as it is
and especially considers a lottery im
practical. He has indicated he would
not object to changing the age-order.
The new induction system proposed
by the Congressional panel would en

courage local draft boards to meet
monthly draft quotas by inducting 1A
registrants in the 19-20 age group
ahead of older registrants. Older
registrants would continue to be eli
gible for induction until age 26 but
as a considerably reduced priority.
The student deferment system
would be revised to provide that all
bona fide students of institutions of
higher learning be granted deferment
while remaining students in good
standing and until they received their
undergraduate degree or reach age
24. Deferred student then would revert
to the 1A pool for induction on the
same basis as non-students in the
19-20 age group.
Student Deferment
Students electing to claim a student
deferment would waive any possible
entitlement to a later deferment based
on other than student status, except in
extreme hardship cases.
Students deferments would not con
tinue for post-graduate training ex
cept in specified critical occupations or

professions.
A special national manpower re
sources board would determine lists of
essential and critically needed cate
gories for deferment. Local draft
boards would decide on deferment or
induction of individuals in these cate
gories.
'Distribute Burden'
The panel urged the President to
use his existing authority to order
reservists to active duty "so as to dis
tribute the burden of the Vietnam war
more equitably between inductees and
their reserve contemporaries."
Turned down by the panel was a
suggestion to create an all-volunteer
military force through substantial in
creases in military compensation.
The panel was appointed last year
by Chairman L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C.,
of the Armed Services Committee and
Rep. William H. Bates, R-Mass., rank
ing minority member, to help in pend
ing committee consideration of possi
ble changes in draft law induction pro
visions expiring July 1.

Clark, who now lives in Charles
ton, SC., recently resigned as Presi
dent of The Citadel.
Other panel members are: W. Ster
ling Cole, of Washington, D.C., former
member of Congress and former Di
rector of the International Atomic
Energy Agency; Dr. Frederick L.
Hovde, President, Purdue University;
Robert D. Murphy, former Under Sec
retary of State and presently Chair
man of the Board, Corning Glass In
ternational, Coring, N.Y.; Dr. Jerome
Holland, President, Hampton Institute.
Earl H. Blaik of New York City,
former football coach at the U.S. Mili
tary Academy and presently Chair
man of the Executive Committee,
AVCO Corp ; Charles E. Saltzman,
former vice president, of the New
York Stock Exchange and presently a
partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. of
New York City; and the Right Rev

WASHINGTON (AP> — A Citizens'
panel recommended to the House
Armed Services Committee yesterday
tightening draft deferment for stu
dents and more emphasis on induc
tion of younger men in the 19-25-year
age group.
The report of the panel headed by
retired Gen. Mark W. Clark was made
public by the committee.
It supports the general philosophy
of of the present selective service sys
tem It rejects proposals for a national
lottery system and a universal na
tional service system that would
equate non-military service with mili
tary duty.
Uniform Deferment
If approved by Congress, the recom
mendations would promote more uni
formity in deferment procedures of
local draft boards and reduce the like
lihood of youths being inducted into
military service after their 21st birth
day.
The Clark committee is separate

from a National Commission on Se
lective Service set up by President
Johnson last summer in the wake of
mounting study protests to the draft.
That presidential group is expected to
make its recommendations to John
son later this week.
In contrast to the Clark panel, the
presidential group is reported plan
ning to suggest that Johnson ask
Congress to revolutionize the draft
with a lottery system.
The Younger Men
However, the presidential group is
reported—as does the Clark commit
tee— favoring taking the younger
men first. At present the draft begins
with 26-year olds and works down in
the 1A bracket.
Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, the National
Draft Director, has favored keeping
the draft system pretty much as it is
and especially considers a lottery im
practical. He has indicated he would
not object to changing the age-order.
The new induction system proposed
by the Congressional panel would en

courage local draft boards to meet
monthly draft quotas by inducting 1A
registrants in the 19-20 age group
ahead of older registrants. Older
registrants would continue to be eli
gible for induction until age 26 but
as a considerably reduced priority.
The student deferment system
would be revised to provide that all
bona fide students of institutions of
higher learning be granted deferment
while remaining students in good
standing and until they received their
undergraduate degree or reach age
24. Deferred student then would revert
to the 1A pool for induction on the
same basis as non-students in the
19-20 age group.
Student Deferment
Students electing to claim a student
deferment would waive any possible
entitlement to a later deferment based
on other than student status, except in
extreme hardship cases.
Students deferments would not con
tinue for post-graduate training ex
cept in specified critical occupations or

professions.
A special national manpower re
sources board would determine lists of
essential and critically needed cate
gories for deferment. Local draft
boards would decide on deferment or
induction of individuals in these cate
gories.
'Distribute Burden'
The panel urged the President to
use his existing authority to order
reservists to active duty "so as to dis
tribute the burden of the Vietnam war
more equitably between inductees and
their reserve contemporaries."
Turned down by the panel was a
suggestion to create an all-volunteer
military force through substantial in
creases in military compensation.
The panel was appointed last year
by Chairman L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C.,
of the Armed Services Committee and
Rep. William H. Bates, R-Mass., rank
ing minority member, to help in pend
ing committee consideration of possi
ble changes in draft law induction pro
visions expiring July 1.

Clark, who now lives in Charles
ton, SC., recently resigned as Presi
dent of The Citadel.
Other panel members are: W. Ster
ling Cole, of Washington, D.C., former
member of Congress and former Di
rector of the International Atomic
Energy Agency; Dr. Frederick L.
Hovde, President, Purdue University;
Robert D. Murphy, former Under Sec
retary of State and presently Chair
man of the Board, Corning Glass In
ternational, Coring, N.Y.; Dr. Jerome
Holland, President, Hampton Institute.

WASHINGTON (AP> — A Citizens'
panel recommended to the House
Armed Services Committee yesterday
tightening draft deferment for stu
dents and more emphasis on induc
tion of younger men in the 19-25-year
age group.
The report of the panel headed by
retired Gen. Mark W. Clark was made
public by the committee.
It supports the general philosophy
of of the present selective service sys
tem It rejects proposals for a national
lottery system and a universal na
tional service system that would
equate non-military service with mili
tary duty.
Uniform Deferment
If approved by Congress, the recom
mendations would promote more uni
formity in deferment procedures of
local draft boards and reduce the like
lihood of youths being inducted into
military service after their 21st birth
day.
The Clark committee is separate

from a National Commission on Se
lective Service set up by President
Johnson last summer in the wake of
mounting study protests to the draft.
That presidential group is expected to
make its recommendations to John
son later this week.
In contrast to the Clark panel, the
presidential group is reported plan
ning to suggest that Johnson ask
Congress to revolutionize the draft
with a lottery system.
The Younger Men
However, the presidential group is
reported—as does the Clark commit
tee— favoring taking the younger
men first. At present the draft begins
with 26-year olds and works down in
the 1A bracket.
Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, the National
Draft Director, has favored keeping
the draft system pretty much as it is
and especially considers a lottery im
practical. He has indicated he would
not object to changing the age-order.
The new induction system proposed
by the Congressional panel would en

courage local draft boards to meet
monthly draft quotas by inducting 1A
registrants in the 19-20 age group
ahead of older registrants. Older
registrants would continue to be eli
gible for induction until age 26 but
as a considerably reduced priority.
The student deferment system
would be revised to provide that all
bona fide students of institutions of
higher learning be granted deferment
while remaining students in good
standing and until they received their
undergraduate degree or reach age
24. Deferred student then would revert
to the 1A pool for induction on the
same basis as non-students in the
19-20 age group.
Student Deferment
Students electing to claim a student
deferment would waive any possible
entitlement to a later deferment based
on other than student status, except in
extreme hardship cases.
Students deferments would not con
tinue for post-graduate training ex
cept in specified critical occupations or

professions.
A special national manpower re
sources board would determine lists of
essential and critically needed cate
gories for deferment. Local draft
boards would decide on deferment or
induction of individuals in these cate
gories.
'Distribute Burden'
The panel urged the President to
use his existing authority to order
reservists to active duty "so as to dis
tribute the burden of the Vietnam war
more equitably between inductees and
their reserve contemporaries."
Turned down by the panel was a
suggestion to create an all-volunteer
military force through substantial in
creases in military compensation.
The panel was appointed last year
by Chairman L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C.,
of the Armed Services Committee and
Rep. William H. Bates, R-Mass., rank
ing minority member, to help in pend
ing committee consideration of possi
ble changes in draft law induction pro
visions expiring July 1.

Clark, who now lives in Charles
ton, SC., recently resigned as Presi
dent of The Citadel.
Other panel members are: W. Ster
ling Cole, of Washington, D.C., former
member of Congress and former Di
rector of the International Atomic
Energy Agency; Dr. Frederick L.
Hovde, President, Purdue University;
Robert D. Murphy, former Under Sec
retary of State and presently Chair
man of the Board, Corning Glass In
