# A 						Native Vietnamese Tells Where And Why US Fails
## 
### HOWARD MOFFETT 
(CPS)—Trang, which is not
his real name, came to see me
this morning. He's been on vaca
tion since the government shut
down his newspaper in Decem
ber. The Guardian had always
been critical of Ky and the
junta, but its pointed coverage of
Tran Van Van's assassination—
specifically its refusal to assume
he was murdered by the Viet
Cong—brought the lid down.
Trang is soft-spoken, but cap
able of bitter invective. He's
fond of imported cigarettes, and
reads both Maugham and Balzac
in the originals. He led a Viet
Minh company in the war
against the French. Withal he
is one of the most charming and
loyal men I know.
U.S. Cannot Win
He had nothing particular on
his mind. We talked about Op
eration Cedar Falls, Ky, the as
sembly, the price of rice, the
prospects for civilian govern
ment. What he had to say
wouldn't have made Mr. John
son any happier. For example:
Item: American soldiers will
never beat the Viet Cong.
We had been talking about
the U. S. attempt to raze the
Viet Cong jungle stronghold
known as tho Iron Triangle, 30
miles north of Saigon. "Ameri
cans can't defeat the Viet Cong;
only the Vietnamese can do
that," he said. But Trang, I pro
tested, the ARVN sure isn't do
ing it now. (The Army of the
Republic of Viet Nam, except
for a few commanders and a
handful of units, is notorious
for low morale, inflexibility,
sluggishness and devastating
public relations.)
"Don't blame the ARVN," he
replied. "They are good soldiers,
but they must be led. They must
have something to fight for.
They must be animated by a
good example." ARVN soldiers
get fed on 20 cents a day. Most
of them have little conception of
what they are defending (pre
sumably the Vietnamese na
tion). Most of their officers are
still French-trained fat cat
hacks.
Ky's Credibility Gap
Item: Prime Minister Ky's
credibility gap is almost as wide
as President Johnson's.
"Nobody believes him," Trang
said. "One day he announces
that press censorship will be
lifted, the next days the papers
are full of white spaces. (This

is true. It happened just last
week.) He shouldn't say things
that he knows will never be
done."
"The same thing with prices.
He says he will do everything
to keep prices down. Last month
first grade rice was 2100 piastres
per hundred kilos. Now it's 3300.
(Prices traditionally go up for
Tet, the Vietnamese New Year,
but a 50 percent rise cannot be
explained that way.) Just a
couple of months ago the Econ
omy Minister announced that
imported USAID rice would be
sold at 900 p's. It's 1600 now."
And going up.
Government Corruption
Item: When the people think
of the government, they think of
two things—American influence
and corruption.
I had asked him what kind of
government might expect to win
the support of the people.
"There will bo no solution that
is not a nationalist solution,"
Trang said. (Is that so hard to
understand, Mr. Johnson, Mr.
Rusk, Mr. McNamara?)
He was not optimistic about
the chances of Ky and the mili
tary stepping aside to allow a
transfer of power to a constitu
tionally elected civilian govern
ment: "If Ky wants to stay in
power, there is no reason for the
Americans to ailow anyone else
to replace him. He's easy to han
dle. He has no training, no edu
cation, no independent char
acter. His government is full of
corruption." But Trang, I said,
I have never heard any of his
critics call him personally cor
rupt.
"He has his own kind of cor
ruption. One of his Air Force
pilots just came back from the
Philippines and Hong Kong
with 600 transistor radios. Do
you think he doesn't know about
that? Have you ever been in the
houses of the army staff? (I
hadn't) They have everything—
cars, television, refrigerators,
air conditioners—and no papers
for any of it. It's all illegal. Or
the new police chief in Rach
Gia (a delta town on the Gulf
of Thailand): he made 25 mil
lion piasters in his first month.
Do you expect the people to
love their government?"
Item: American technological
warfare is continuing to make
enemies among the Vietnamese.
Trang had just heard from
friends in Dinh Tuong, a delta
province southwest of Saigon,

that American defoliation chem
icals were killing many crops.
"Even though it is dropped over
Viet Cong areas, the wind blows
it. In some areas near My Tho
(the second largest delta town)
orange production is only one
third of last year's crop."
These problems are not new,
nor are they easy to solve. Basic
ally, they are the same problems
that faced the late President
Ngo Dinh Diem and John F.
Kennedy. Promises and pro
grams have come and gone for
six years, making cynics out of
thousands of Vietnamese and
hundreds of Americans serving
in Viet Nam. But the problems
are still here.
Some of Trang's details may
be inaccurate. The graft stories
would be virtually impossible to
verify, and an American might
even have trouble checking the
report of defoliation in Dinh
Tuong.
See To Believe
But that's not the point. Polit
ically what Trang said is just as
true as if he had made it all
up. Because hundreds of thou
sands of Vietnamese believe it.
They have seen enough of what
he was talking about, enough
promises and programs turned
into pork barrels, that they will
believe nothing else until they
see massive evidence to the con
trary.
The picture Trang painted is
perhaps too bleak. There are
non-communist Vietnamese na
tionalists who believe progress
is being made, however slowly.
By and large they are the ones
who work or deal with Ameri
cans.
I don't know if Trang is more
right than they are. I don't
know how many Vietnamese
Trang speaks for. But I tend to
think it is many, many more
than most of the Americans
realize.

See To Believe
But that's not the point. Polit
ically what Trang said is just as
true as if he had made it all
up. Because hundreds of thou
sands of Vietnamese believe it.
They have seen enough of what
he was talking about, enough
promises and programs turned
into pork barrels, that they will
believe nothing else until they
see massive evidence to the con
trary.
The picture Trang painted is
perhaps too bleak. There are
non-communist Vietnamese na
tionalists who believe progress
is being made, however slowly.
By and large they are the ones
who work or deal with Ameri
cans.
I don't know if Trang is more
right than they are. I don't
know how many Vietnamese
Trang speaks for. But I tend to
think it is many, many more
than most of the Americans
realize.
(CPS)—Trang, which is not
his real name, came to see me
this morning. He's been on vaca
tion since the government shut
down his newspaper in Decem
ber. The Guardian had always
been critical of Ky and the
junta, but its pointed coverage of
Tran Van Van's assassination—
specifically its refusal to assume
he was murdered by the Viet
Cong—brought the lid down.
Trang is soft-spoken, but cap
able of bitter invective. He's
fond of imported cigarettes, and
reads both Maugham and Balzac
in the originals. He led a Viet
Minh company in the war
against the French. Withal he
is one of the most charming and
loyal men I know.
U.S. Cannot Win
He had nothing particular on
his mind. We talked about Op
eration Cedar Falls, Ky, the as
sembly, the price of rice, the
prospects for civilian govern
ment. What he had to say
wouldn't have made Mr. John
son any happier. For example:
Item: American soldiers will
never beat the Viet Cong.
We had been talking about
the U. S. attempt to raze the
Viet Cong jungle stronghold
known as tho Iron Triangle, 30
miles north of Saigon. "Ameri
cans can't defeat the Viet Cong;
only the Vietnamese can do
that," he said. But Trang, I pro
tested, the ARVN sure isn't do
ing it now. (The Army of the
Republic of Viet Nam, except
for a few commanders and a
handful of units, is notorious
for low morale, inflexibility,
sluggishness and devastating
public relations.)
"Don't blame the ARVN," he
replied. "They are good soldiers,
but they must be led. They must
have something to fight for.
They must be animated by a
good example." ARVN soldiers
get fed on 20 cents a day. Most
of them have little conception of
what they are defending (pre
sumably the Vietnamese na
tion). Most of their officers are
still French-trained fat cat
hacks.
Ky's Credibility Gap
Item: Prime Minister Ky's
credibility gap is almost as wide
as President Johnson's.
"Nobody believes him," Trang
said. "One day he announces
that press censorship will be
lifted, the next days the papers
are full of white spaces. (This

is true. It happened just last
week.) He shouldn't say things
that he knows will never be
done."
"The same thing with prices.
He says he will do everything
to keep prices down. Last month
first grade rice was 2100 piastres
per hundred kilos. Now it's 3300.
(Prices traditionally go up for
Tet, the Vietnamese New Year,
but a 50 percent rise cannot be
explained that way.) Just a
couple of months ago the Econ
omy Minister announced that
imported USAID rice would be
sold at 900 p's. It's 1600 now."
And going up.
Government Corruption
Item: When the people think
of the government, they think of
two things—American influence
and corruption.
I had asked him what kind of
government might expect to win
the support of the people.
"There will bo no solution that
is not a nationalist solution,"
Trang said. (Is that so hard to
understand, Mr. Johnson, Mr.
Rusk, Mr. McNamara?)
He was not optimistic about
the chances of Ky and the mili
tary stepping aside to allow a
transfer of power to a constitu
tionally elected civilian govern
ment: "If Ky wants to stay in
power, there is no reason for the
Americans to ailow anyone else
to replace him. He's easy to han
dle. He has no training, no edu
cation, no independent char
acter. His government is full of
corruption." But Trang, I said,
I have never heard any of his
critics call him personally cor
rupt.
"He has his own kind of cor
ruption. One of his Air Force
pilots just came back from the
Philippines and Hong Kong
with 600 transistor radios. Do
you think he doesn't know about
that? Have you ever been in the
houses of the army staff? (I
hadn't) They have everything—
cars, television, refrigerators,
air conditioners—and no papers
for any of it. It's all illegal. Or
the new police chief in Rach
Gia (a delta town on the Gulf
of Thailand): he made 25 mil
lion piasters in his first month.
Do you expect the people to
love their government?"
Item: American technological
warfare is continuing to make
enemies among the Vietnamese.
Trang had just heard from
friends in Dinh Tuong, a delta
province southwest of Saigon,

that American defoliation chem
icals were killing many crops.
"Even though it is dropped over
Viet Cong areas, the wind blows
it. In some areas near My Tho
(the second largest delta town)
orange production is only one
third of last year's crop."
These problems are not new,
nor are they easy to solve. Basic
ally, they are the same problems
that faced the late President
Ngo Dinh Diem and John F.
Kennedy. Promises and pro
grams have come and gone for
six years, making cynics out of
thousands of Vietnamese and
hundreds of Americans serving
in Viet Nam. But the problems
are still here.
Some of Trang's details may
be inaccurate. The graft stories
would be virtually impossible to
verify, and an American might
even have trouble checking the
report of defoliation in Dinh
Tuong.

icals were killing many crops.
"Even though it is dropped over
Viet Cong areas, the wind blows
it. In some areas near My Tho
(the second largest delta town)
orange production is only one
third of last year's crop."
These problems are not new,
nor are they easy to solve. Basic
ally, they are the same problems
that faced the late President
Ngo Dinh Diem and John F.
Kennedy. Promises and pro
grams have come and gone for
six years, making cynics out of
thousands of Vietnamese and
hundreds of Americans serving
in Viet Nam. But the problems
are still here.
Some of Trang's details may
be inaccurate. The graft stories
would be virtually impossible to
verify, and an American might
even have trouble checking the
report of defoliation in Dinh
Tuong.
See To Believe
But that's not the point. Polit
ically what Trang said is just as
true as if he had made it all
up. Because hundreds of thou
sands of Vietnamese believe it.
They have seen enough of what
he was talking about, enough
promises and programs turned
into pork barrels, that they will
believe nothing else until they
see massive evidence to the con
trary.
The picture Trang painted is
perhaps too bleak. There are
non-communist Vietnamese na
tionalists who believe progress
is being made, however slowly.
By and large they are the ones
who work or deal with Ameri
cans.
I don't know if Trang is more
right than they are. I don't
know how many Vietnamese
Trang speaks for. But I tend to
think it is many, many more
than most of the Americans
realize.
(CPS)—Trang, which is not
his real name, came to see me
this morning. He's been on vaca
tion since the government shut
down his newspaper in Decem
ber. The Guardian had always
been critical of Ky and the
junta, but its pointed coverage of
Tran Van Van's assassination—
specifically its refusal to assume
he was murdered by the Viet
Cong—brought the lid down.
Trang is soft-spoken, but cap
able of bitter invective. He's
fond of imported cigarettes, and
reads both Maugham and Balzac
in the originals. He led a Viet
Minh company in the war
against the French. Withal he
is one of the most charming and
loyal men I know.
U.S. Cannot Win
He had nothing particular on
his mind. We talked about Op
eration Cedar Falls, Ky, the as
sembly, the price of rice, the
prospects for civilian govern
ment. What he had to say
wouldn't have made Mr. John
son any happier. For example:
Item: American soldiers will
never beat the Viet Cong.
We had been talking about
the U. S. attempt to raze the
Viet Cong jungle stronghold
known as tho Iron Triangle, 30
miles north of Saigon. "Ameri
cans can't defeat the Viet Cong;
only the Vietnamese can do
that," he said. But Trang, I pro
tested, the ARVN sure isn't do
ing it now. (The Army of the
Republic of Viet Nam, except
for a few commanders and a
handful of units, is notorious
for low morale, inflexibility,
sluggishness and devastating
public relations.)
"Don't blame the ARVN," he
replied. "They are good soldiers,
but they must be led. They must
have something to fight for.
They must be animated by a
good example." ARVN soldiers
get fed on 20 cents a day. Most
of them have little conception of
what they are defending (pre
sumably the Vietnamese na
tion). Most of their officers are
still French-trained fat cat
hacks.
Ky's Credibility Gap
Item: Prime Minister Ky's
credibility gap is almost as wide
as President Johnson's.
"Nobody believes him," Trang
said. "One day he announces
that press censorship will be
lifted, the next days the papers
are full of white spaces. (This

is true. It happened just last
week.) He shouldn't say things
that he knows will never be
done."
"The same thing with prices.
He says he will do everything
to keep prices down. Last month
first grade rice was 2100 piastres
per hundred kilos. Now it's 3300.
(Prices traditionally go up for
Tet, the Vietnamese New Year,
but a 50 percent rise cannot be
explained that way.) Just a
couple of months ago the Econ
omy Minister announced that
imported USAID rice would be
sold at 900 p's. It's 1600 now."
And going up.
Government Corruption
Item: When the people think
of the government, they think of
two things—American influence
and corruption.
I had asked him what kind of
government might expect to win
the support of the people.
"There will bo no solution that
is not a nationalist solution,"
Trang said. (Is that so hard to
understand, Mr. Johnson, Mr.
Rusk, Mr. McNamara?)
He was not optimistic about
the chances of Ky and the mili
tary stepping aside to allow a
transfer of power to a constitu
tionally elected civilian govern
ment: "If Ky wants to stay in
power, there is no reason for the
Americans to ailow anyone else
to replace him. He's easy to han
dle. He has no training, no edu
cation, no independent char
acter. His government is full of
corruption." But Trang, I said,
I have never heard any of his
critics call him personally cor
rupt.
"He has his own kind of cor
ruption. One of his Air Force
pilots just came back from the
Philippines and Hong Kong
with 600 transistor radios. Do
you think he doesn't know about
that? Have you ever been in the
houses of the army staff? (I
hadn't) They have everything—
cars, television, refrigerators,
air conditioners—and no papers
for any of it. It's all illegal. Or
the new police chief in Rach
Gia (a delta town on the Gulf
of Thailand): he made 25 mil
lion piasters in his first month.
Do you expect the people to
love their government?"
Item: American technological
warfare is continuing to make
enemies among the Vietnamese.
Trang had just heard from
friends in Dinh Tuong, a delta
province southwest of Saigon,

that American defoliation chem
icals were killing many crops.
"Even though it is dropped over
Viet Cong areas, the wind blows
it. In some areas near My Tho
(the second largest delta town)

ruption. One of his Air Force
pilots just came back from the
Philippines and Hong Kong
with 600 transistor radios. Do
you think he doesn't know about
that? Have you ever been in the
houses of the army staff? (I
hadn't) They have everything—
cars, television, refrigerators,
air conditioners—and no papers
for any of it. It's all illegal. Or

Trang had just heard from
friends in Dinh Tuong, a delta
province southwest of Saigon,

that American defoliation chem
icals were killing many crops.
"Even though it is dropped over
Viet Cong areas, the wind blows
it. In some areas near My Tho
(the second largest delta town)
orange production is only one
third of last year's crop."
These problems are not new,
nor are they easy to solve. Basic
ally, they are the same problems
that faced the late President
Ngo Dinh Diem and John F.
Kennedy. Promises and pro
grams have come and gone for
six years, making cynics out of
thousands of Vietnamese and
hundreds of Americans serving
in Viet Nam. But the problems
are still here.
Some of Trang's details may
be inaccurate. The graft stories
would be virtually impossible to
verify, and an American might
even have trouble checking the
report of defoliation in Dinh
Tuong.
See To Believe
But that's not the point. Polit
ically what Trang said is just as
true as if he had made it all
up. Because hundreds of thou
sands of Vietnamese believe it.
They have seen enough of what
he was talking about, enough
promises and programs turned
into pork barrels, that they will
believe nothing else until they
see massive evidence to the con
trary.
The picture Trang painted is
perhaps too bleak. There are
non-communist Vietnamese na
tionalists who believe progress
is being made, however slowly.
By and large they are the ones
who work or deal with Ameri
cans.
I don't know if Trang is more
right than they are. I don't
know how many Vietnamese
Trang speaks for. But I tend to
think it is many, many more
than most of the Americans
realize.
(CPS)—Trang, which is not
his real name, came to see me
this morning. He's been on vaca
tion since the government shut
down his newspaper in Decem
ber. The Guardian had always
been critical of Ky and the
junta, but its pointed coverage of
Tran Van Van's assassination—
specifically its refusal to assume
he was murdered by the Viet
Cong—brought the lid down.
Trang is soft-spoken, but cap
able of bitter invective. He's
fond of imported cigarettes, and
reads both Maugham and Balzac
in the originals. He led a Viet
Minh company in the war
against the French. Withal he
is one of the most charming and
loyal men I know.
U.S. Cannot Win
He had nothing particular on
his mind. We talked about Op
eration Cedar Falls, Ky, the as
sembly, the price of rice, the
prospects for civilian govern
ment. What he had to say
wouldn't have made Mr. John
son any happier. For example:
Item: American soldiers will
never beat the Viet Cong.
We had been talking about
the U. S. attempt to raze the
Viet Cong jungle stronghold
known as tho Iron Triangle, 30
miles north of Saigon. "Ameri
cans can't defeat the Viet Cong;
only the Vietnamese can do
that," he said. But Trang, I pro
tested, the ARVN sure isn't do
ing it now. (The Army of the
Republic of Viet Nam, except
for a few commanders and a
handful of units, is notorious
for low morale, inflexibility,
sluggishness and devastating
public relations.)
"Don't blame the ARVN," he
replied. "They are good soldiers,
but they must be led. They must
have something to fight for.
They must be animated by a
good example." ARVN soldiers
get fed on 20 cents a day. Most
of them have little conception of
what they are defending (pre
sumably the Vietnamese na
tion). Most of their officers are
still French-trained fat cat
hacks.
Ky's Credibility Gap
Item: Prime Minister Ky's
credibility gap is almost as wide
as President Johnson's.
"Nobody believes him," Trang
said. "One day he announces
that press censorship will be
lifted, the next days the papers
are full of white spaces. (This

is true. It happened just last
week.) He shouldn't say things
that he knows will never be
done."
"The same thing with prices.
He says he will do everything
to keep prices down. Last month
first grade rice was 2100 piastres
per hundred kilos. Now it's 3300.
(Prices traditionally go up for
Tet, the Vietnamese New Year,
but a 50 percent rise cannot be
explained that way.) Just a
couple of months ago the Econ
omy Minister announced that
imported USAID rice would be
sold at 900 p's. It's 1600 now."
And going up.
Government Corruption
Item: When the people think
of the government, they think of
two things—American influence
and corruption.
I had asked him what kind of
government might expect to win
the support of the people.
"There will bo no solution that
is not a nationalist solution,"
Trang said. (Is that so hard to
understand, Mr. Johnson, Mr.
Rusk, Mr. McNamara?)
He was not optimistic about
the chances of Ky and the mili
tary stepping aside to allow a
transfer of power to a constitu
tionally elected civilian govern
ment: "If Ky wants to stay in
power, there is no reason for the
Americans to ailow anyone else
to replace him. He's easy to han
dle. He has no training, no edu
cation, no independent char
acter. His government is full of
corruption." But Trang, I said,
I have never heard any of his
critics call him personally cor
rupt.
"He has his own kind of cor
ruption. One of his Air Force
pilots just came back from the
Philippines and Hong Kong
with 600 transistor radios. Do
you think he doesn't know about
that? Have you ever been in the
