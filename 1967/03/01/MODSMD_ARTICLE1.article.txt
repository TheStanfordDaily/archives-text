# Upward Bound Future Uncertain
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Upward Bound, a War on Poverty
program designed to aid underprivi
leged high school students, may not be
sponsored by Stanford this year.
Six of the nine Upward Bound staff
members have voted to discontinue
the program due to insufficient funds.
The Office of Economic Opportunity
(OEO), a government agency which
had originally promised a program for
60 students, notified the Upward
Bound staff during fall quarter that
the program could not be expanded.
The OEO did, however, provide funds
for 45 students.

Upward Bound has been sponsored
by Stanford for the last two years
and last year, 40 students, mainly
from the East Palo Alto area, par
ticipated.
At a press conference yesterday,
the six staff members who voted
against the program said they could
not justify having less than 60 stu
dents in Upward Bound. Having
fewer than 60 would not have a
sufficient impact on East Palo Alto
and Ravenswood High School, they
said.

A press release issued by the six
staffers said, "What would be funded

is a non residential program for 45
students which both the majority of
the staff and the local community
leaders believe would not only be
ineffective but would also harm the
community efforts for educational im
provement by providing an excuse for
the local high school (Ravenswood)
to remain in its current static condi
tion."
Dr. Bernadene Allen, a psychological
consultant for Upward Bound, said
Ravenswood High School is presently
claiming the program as one of its
contributions to East Palo Alto. She
said that whenever the school's prin
ciple is asked what Ravenswood has
done for the community, he uses Up
ward Bound and similar programs
as examples.
"We have helped a lot of students,
but we have also harmed a lot of stu
dents by allowing the school to use us
as a weapon against the community,"
Dr. Allen said.
There was general agreement
among the staffers that Ravenswood
High School is doing an inadequate
job in educating East Palo Alto stu
dents. During the fall, a "sneak-out"
program was organized in which
Ravenswood students were encour
aged to live in other school districts
with friends or relatives.

A press release issued by the three
staff members who voted against clos
ing down Upward Bound said they
were disappointed that the funds were
not available, but they were willing
to go through with a program for 45
students.
Another group from the Medical
School has applied for the OEO grant
to run Upward Bound.
OEO had planned to increase all of
its Upward Bound programs, which
operated at 202 universities and col
leges last year, but did not due to
increased spending for Vietnam.
Dr- Lawrence Ryan, head of Up
ward Bound last summer, said he con
tacted University officials, and at
tempted to raise the $18,000 necessary
to increase the program from 45 to
60 students, but was turned down.
The University was willing to contrib
ute approximately $3000 more, he
said, but not the full amount. In the
past, Stanford has matched every $9
of OEO funds with $1 of its owa
Last year's budget for the entire pro
gram was $57,000.
Upward Bound may be partially re
placed by expanding the East Palo
Alto Day School, which now operates
mainly on Saturdays. The Day School
is independent of the public school
system and is staffed by volunteers.


Of several propositi alterations, priority has been given to a building (b)
between Bowman Alumni House and the Union and an addition fa) >ver the
deck of Tresidder.
