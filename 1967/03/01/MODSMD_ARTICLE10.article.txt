# KZSU Surveys Humphrey Visit
## 
### 
KZSU will conduct a survey
this evening about the events
surrounding the departure of
Vice President Humphrey from
Stanford last Monday. The re
sults of the survey will be broad
cast Thursday evening at 7 p.m.
As accounts in the national
press and on campus have var
ied considerably, controversy has
arisen as to exactly what occured
as the Vice President left Me
morial Hall, proceeded to his
car, and left the campus.
All persons who were within
sight of the Vice Presdent or his
car at the time of his departure
are urged to call KZSU (321-2300
ext 4003) between 7 and 10 this
evening. They will be asked sev
eral questions pertinent to the
issues.
