# Cards Play Teammates In Net Tourney Finals Today
## 
### 
Stanford goes against Stan
ford at 3 p.m. today on the Stan
ford tennis courts. Brian Leek
and Craif Baise play Jamie Car
roll and Chuck Alloo in the finals
of the Northern Intercollegiate
Tennis Tournament doubles.
Stanford, obviously, will win
the finals to seal a mop-up vic
tory in the tournament. Cal, with
20 points, finished closest to
the Indians' 32.
The Stanford frosh have an
analagous "problem," as Bobby

Rippner and John Shepherd
play John Spiegel and Ron Kahn
in the frosh division finals. The
inevitable Papoose win will
break a 20-20 deadlock with the
Cal frosh.
This Saturday, Stanford net
ters face the Nor Cal All-Stars,
who in coach Dick Gould's opin
ion, may be tougher than either
USC or UCLA. The All-Stars
feature several Davis Cup vet
erans.
