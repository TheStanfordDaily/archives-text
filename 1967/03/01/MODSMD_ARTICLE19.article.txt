## Katzenbach, CIA: The Real Question 
### Walter Lippmann 
Speaking for the three-man
committee appointed by the
President to inquire into the
CIA affairs, Nicholas Katzen
bach said last week that the
committee would be able to re
port its conclusions and recom
mendations early in March .
He went on to say that in the
interval it should be realized
that the CIA has been acting ac
cording to the law and has been
following national policies laid
down by the highest officials of
the Truman, Eisenhower, Ken
nedy and Johnson administra
tions.
Although in the first moment
of panic some members of the
administration disasso c i a t e d
themselves from the secret op
eration, there was never any
question that it was authorized.
Katzenbach said also that the
men directing the program have
been farsighted and courageous
Americans.
I believe this to be true. I
regard Richard N. Helms as an
admirable director of the CIA-
Many of the men working these
programs have been and still
are my personal friends, and
for me at least there is no ques
tion about their character or
their motives.
What I find somewhat disturb
ing in Katzenbach's letter is the
last paragraph. There he sounds
as if he thought that the issue
is whether the Central Intelli
gence Agency is "indispensable
to the security of the nation."
That is not the issue at all.
No one in his senses who
knows anything about interna
tional politics and intelligence
work can have any doubt that
in a world of armed powers it is
most necessary to know as much
as possible about their plans,
capabilities and intentions.
The question before us today
is whether the activities of the
CIA, which are outside genuine
intelligence, that is to say its
black propaganda, its interven
tionist operations, its "dirty

tricks," are truly in the national
interest.
The question is not an
swered by crying out that the
CIA is an organization of pa
triots who are on our side in the
conflict with foreign powers.
That is a good way to decide
which football team to cheer,
but it is no way to think and
talk about the most serious ac
tivities of the U.S. government.
In the real world, rather than
in that of patriotic slogans and
emotions, the CIA has carried on
a number of secret activities
which, once they were uncov
ered, have had a disastrous out
come. Instead of enabling some
students, some scholars, some
journalists to argue the Ameri
can case abroad, the disclosure
of the secret payments to some
has cast suspicion on any Amer
ican who goes abroad. Can there
be any doubt that an activity
which has such a result is a
great failure?
What Katzenbach's committee
of three should not fail to con
sider is why these actions, car
ried on by able and patriotic
men, have been self-defeating.
The reason, I venture to argue,
is that black propaganda, secret
interventions, intrigue and sub
ordination are incompatible with
our open society.
They are the methods of a
totalitarian state, and without
a totalitarian environment of
secrecy and terror they are un
workable. This most unpleasant
and embarrassing affair is the
proof that an open society can
not act successfully like a total
itarian society.
If, instead of fighting the prob
lem presented by the disclosures,
the Katzenbach committee seeks
to solve the problem, it will be
gin with the demonstrated fact
that the totalitarian method has
not worked here at home. Then
the committee will have a foun
dation on which to build in or
der to restore the international
credit of the United States.
