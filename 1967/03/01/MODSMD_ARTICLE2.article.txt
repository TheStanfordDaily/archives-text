# Several Additions Recommended
## Tresidder Expansion 'Tentative' 
### MIKE MORTON 
In an effort to alleviate Tresidder
Union's dual problems of overcrowd
ing and impersonality, Union Director
Chester A. Berry in 1965 proposed a
50 per cent expansion of the Union.
Yesterday Dr. Berry gave a progress
report on his suggested project.
At this stage planning is still "ten
tative." An architect was originally re
tained to study the proposal and to
work out general plans for its imple
mentation, and in February of 1965
a report was submitted to the Union
Committee, the Union Board and divi
sions, the staff of the Union, and the
Offices of the Provost, Vice President
of Finance, the Conference and Plan
ning Offices.
Reactions from those receiving the
report and surveys by the Union divi
sions were used to determine the
priorities listed in a second report
prepared in October, 1965. This report
President, the Committee on Univer
sity Policy, and the University Plan
ning Committee.
From several possibilities indicated
by the architect, top priority was giv

en to a "single, free-standing struc
ture between Bowman Alumni House
and Tresidder" This building would
house a Rathskeller basement, creat
ing a "cellar atmosphere," the Union
store, a Travel Service, a waiting-ser
vice dining room providing more for
mal dining facilities than are now
feasible in the Union, increased stor
age spaces, a lounge, and an arts and
crafts center.
Second Proposal
A second recommended addition
would be a two-story wing constructed
over the deck of the Union to house
ASSU offices. Besides expanding the
space allotted to the Associated Stu
dents, such a building would "also
free the prime space now occupied
by ASSU for more extensive browsing
and music facilities. Such a move
also will provide badly needed Union
Board and administrative spaces in
the existing reading-browsing area,"
the report stated.
In a partial overhaul of present
Union facilities, the program lounges
on the second floor would become
meeting and social facilities, adapt

able to the needs of a banquet or a
dance.
The report explained the desirability
of an arts and crafts center. "The
general acceptance of the student Cul
tural Arts Division. . . , the popularity
of the circulating library of art prints;
the demands on music listening and
playing facilities â€”suggest that the
arts have an important place in the
Union program.
"Unfortunately, current faci'ities
provide little possibility for creative
work and the inclusion of an arts and
crafts center in the Union is urged."
The report also recommended dou
bling the size of the Union store, trip
ling the size of the travel service, dou
bling the lounges, and adding a large
and a small rehearsal room
Positive Action
Dr. Berry believes that positive ac
tion on the proposal is virtually "cer
tain," and that the question now is
merely one of "how long?" Approval
by several offices is still required, fi
nancial arrangements have yet to be
made, and detailed plans must be
drawn up.

In the financial realm, the report
stated that both building and operat
ing costs for the addition should be
less than those of the present struc
ture. Dr. Berry surmised that the pro
gram could conceivably be financed
as part of another PACE Program,
but nothing is really certain as yet.
