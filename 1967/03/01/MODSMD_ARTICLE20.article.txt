## An Apple For Enlightenment 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Apple of Segregationist
has been tossed in among the
fair young intellects of Stan
fordland. And, although I doubt
that anyone here will react
strongly enough to cause an In
dian uprising, do I detect a few
fair faces blushing to their hair
roots?
I read Mr. Gruber's article
(2-23-67) with much interest:
"Negroes at Stanford" sounds
like a social disease. Ah, "One
Per Cent"; well, it isn't yet an
epidemic. Statistically speaking
—and an article on the Stan
ford Negro should oh most defi
nitely be statistically speaking—
there aren't a heck of a lot of
Negroes here. True.
Ron Miller urges the fair
young intellects of Stanfordland
to "accept the Negro for what
he really is instead of what they
want him to be." What does that
mean? Different form of behav
ior: e.g. yellow shoes. Yellow
shoes??? Mr. Miller, what about
caring—I mean really crying in
side—about the too many places
where Being Negro means Being
Kicked in the Face, and about
the feeling that if you were
there, you'd Be Kicked Just As
Hard. lisn't that what different
behavior means? Or reacting to
everyday situations in Stanford
land just a little bit differently
because of a synthesis of Little
Things that you remember from
oh so very long ago. Or even re
membering the aromas of foods
that the fair young intellects of
Stanfordland have never even
tasted. Yellow shoes???
How about, Mr. Gruber, if
we take the American Negro
and put him under a watch
glass . . . well, look! He does
think a little differently; he docs
know songs and sayings that
the fair young intellect of Stan
fordland has never heard. But
my, my, his appendages pro
vide him with a mode of locomo
tion not unlike Everybody Else
in Stanfordland. Step right up,
folks, and observe the "approxi
mately 80 Negroes at Stanford"!
Forget the fact that Stanford
land's population of fair young
Intellects is also unblemished by
other—but less noticeable—mi
nority groups. Thumb through
the Quad sometime and count

the Garcias and Lopezes. Oh,
don't bother, use the time to re
cruit some Negroes for Stan
fordland, because They make
big news; and we like Them.
O.K. fair young intellects, let's
all go buy and wear and tell
each other how much we like
our yellow shoes. Because we
know that we are not segrega
tionists, because we are going
to Let In more Negroes—pro
vided They are qualified, oh but
of course. We won't have the
Outside thinking of us as Segre
gationists. We are Open-Minded,
you better believe it. And if we
can prove our coolness (after
all, to be cool is to be open
minded, everybody knows that)
simply by letting in a few more
Negroes . . . Then wc can all
gain Much Knowledge by under
standing our Dark - Skinned
Brother. And everyone from
Outside can look at Stanford
land and count (it's easy) the
number of Negroes. 107, 108,
109 .. .
Then we will be cool. I mean,
then we can say we really Know
What's Happening. The doors
and minds of Stanfordland are
always open. And all the fair
young intellects know that So
Much of one's education comes
from outside the classroom, and
Stanfordland has So Much to
offer.
So There, all you people out
side. Our dead Daily has report
ed to us the Error of Our Ways.
Now you can't call us Segrega
tionists. So tell Mr. Gruber that
he has Enlightened us. Then
pick up your apple and go back
to reality where you came from.

Editor, The Dally:
Amidst the kudos of the fine,
upstanding David Harris, we
found few references to what
appears to us to be the rather
obvious failure of said Mr. Har
ris to fulfill the responsibility
inherent in the office which he
accepted.
Does not an elected student
body representative have some
greater obligation than to ex
press his views, and then quit?
We say yes! We feel that when
an official is duly elected he in
curs a responsibility to the elec
torate to fulfill that position for
the entire term stated, to the
best of his ability, under initial
constraints of that office.
To avoid this responsiblity for
reasons other than poor health
can only be considered to be
both selfish and cowardly.

• More Questions
Editor, The Daily:
The questions submitted to
Vice President Humphrey on
Monday were rather tame, and
even so the questioners accepted
rather evasive answers to some
of them. There are some addi
tional questions to be answered
by some supporter of the gov
ernment's position.
1. The U.S. government once
expected to win in Vietnam
much more easily than it now
expects to, and presumably also
did not expect to kill so many
noncombatant civilians as it has.
How many Vietnamese do you
think it worthwhile to kill to
save the rest from Commun
ism? 1 per cent, 10 per cent, 90

per cent, 100 per cent?
2. The U.S. government says it
wants the Vietnamese to be able
to decide their future free of
coercion. As part of this pro
gram Vietnamese are being
driven from their villages which
are burned and forcibly settled
in what you call refugee camps
and we call concentration camps.
How many can you treat this
way without making meaning
less all talk of an uncoerced
choice.
3. Rusk says that the Vietnam
war is a simple case of North-
Vietnamese aggression and not
at all a civil war. We read in
the U.S. papers a few months
ago about a 14-year-old Viet
namese boy who led a platoon
of Marines into a mine field he
laid himself. Was this boy a
North Vietnamese aggressor?
Does he have any right to any
say in the future of his country?
Is he still alive?
4. Must any settlement of the
Vietnam war be acceptable to
General Ky?
5. How is the government of
Ky morally superior to the Na
tional Liberation Front?
6. Did the ADA receive CIA
funds when Humphrey led it?
We ask this question about his
previous role as one of the sub
verted rather than his present
role as one of the subverters.

Editor, The Daily:
Who could possibly accept the
narrow-minded traditionalism
and classicism advocated by Rob
ert Saint-Loup in his review of
the ACT production of Six Char
acters in Search of an Author?
Saint-Loup will be offended,
no doubt, by the ribaldry in the
Stanford Repertory Theater
production of Chekhov's Cherry
Orchard. Stanford students must
learn to indulge themselves.

don't bother, use the time to re
cruit some Negroes for Stan
fordland, because They make
big news; and we like Them.
O.K. fair young intellects, let's
all go buy and wear and tell
each other how much we like
our yellow shoes. Because we
know that we are not segrega
tionists, because we are going
to Let In more Negroes—pro
vided They are qualified, oh but
of course. We won't have the
Outside thinking of us as Segre
gationists. We are Open-Minded,
you better believe it. And if we
can prove our coolness (after
all, to be cool is to be open
minded, everybody knows that)
simply by letting in a few more
Negroes . . . Then wc can all
gain Much Knowledge by under
standing our Dark - Skinned
Brother. And everyone from
Outside can look at Stanford
land and count (it's easy) the
number of Negroes. 107, 108,
109 .. .
Then we will be cool. I mean,
then we can say we really Know
What's Happening. The doors
and minds of Stanfordland are
always open. And all the fair
young intellects know that So
Much of one's education comes
from outside the classroom, and
Stanfordland has So Much to
offer.
So There, all you people out
side. Our dead Daily has report
ed to us the Error of Our Ways.
Now you can't call us Segrega
tionists. So tell Mr. Gruber that
he has Enlightened us. Then
pick up your apple and go back
to reality where you came from.

Editor, The Dally:
Amidst the kudos of the fine,
upstanding David Harris, we
found few references to what
appears to us to be the rather
obvious failure of said Mr. Har
ris to fulfill the responsibility
inherent in the office which he
accepted.
Does not an elected student
body representative have some
greater obligation than to ex
press his views, and then quit?
We say yes! We feel that when
an official is duly elected he in
curs a responsibility to the elec
torate to fulfill that position for
the entire term stated, to the
best of his ability, under initial
constraints of that office.
To avoid this responsiblity for
reasons other than poor health
can only be considered to be
both selfish and cowardly.

• More Questions
Editor, The Daily:
The questions submitted to
Vice President Humphrey on
Monday were rather tame, and
even so the questioners accepted
rather evasive answers to some
of them. There are some addi
tional questions to be answered
by some supporter of the gov
ernment's position.
1. The U.S. government once
expected to win in Vietnam
much more easily than it now
expects to, and presumably also
did not expect to kill so many
noncombatant civilians as it has.
How many Vietnamese do you
think it worthwhile to kill to
save the rest from Commun
ism? 1 per cent, 10 per cent, 90

per cent, 100 per cent?
2. The U.S. government says it
wants the Vietnamese to be able
to decide their future free of
coercion. As part of this pro
gram Vietnamese are being
driven from their villages which
are burned and forcibly settled
in what you call refugee camps
and we call concentration camps.
How many can you treat this
way without making meaning
less all talk of an uncoerced
choice.
3. Rusk says that the Vietnam
war is a simple case of North-
Vietnamese aggression and not
at all a civil war. We read in
the U.S. papers a few months
ago about a 14-year-old Viet
namese boy who led a platoon
of Marines into a mine field he
laid himself. Was this boy a
North Vietnamese aggressor?
Does he have any right to any
say in the future of his country?
Is he still alive?
4. Must any settlement of the
Vietnam war be acceptable to
General Ky?
5. How is the government of
Ky morally superior to the Na
tional Liberation Front?
6. Did the ADA receive CIA
funds when Humphrey led it?
We ask this question about his
previous role as one of the sub
verted rather than his present
role as one of the subverters.

The Apple of Segregationist
has been tossed in among the
fair young intellects of Stan
fordland. And, although I doubt
that anyone here will react
strongly enough to cause an In
dian uprising, do I detect a few
fair faces blushing to their hair
roots?
I read Mr. Gruber's article
(2-23-67) with much interest:
"Negroes at Stanford" sounds
like a social disease. Ah, "One
Per Cent"; well, it isn't yet an
epidemic. Statistically speaking
—and an article on the Stan
ford Negro should oh most defi
nitely be statistically speaking—
there aren't a heck of a lot of
Negroes here. True.
Ron Miller urges the fair
young intellects of Stanfordland
to "accept the Negro for what
he really is instead of what they
want him to be." What does that
mean? Different form of behav
ior: e.g. yellow shoes. Yellow
shoes??? Mr. Miller, what about
caring—I mean really crying in
side—about the too many places
where Being Negro means Being
Kicked in the Face, and about
the feeling that if you were
there, you'd Be Kicked Just As
Hard. lisn't that what different
behavior means? Or reacting to
everyday situations in Stanford
land just a little bit differently
because of a synthesis of Little
Things that you remember from
oh so very long ago. Or even re
membering the aromas of foods
that the fair young intellects of
Stanfordland have never even
tasted. Yellow shoes???
How about, Mr. Gruber, if
we take the American Negro
and put him under a watch
glass . . . well, look! He does
think a little differently; he docs
know songs and sayings that
the fair young intellect of Stan
fordland has never heard. But
my, my, his appendages pro
vide him with a mode of locomo
tion not unlike Everybody Else
in Stanfordland. Step right up,
folks, and observe the "approxi
mately 80 Negroes at Stanford"!
Forget the fact that Stanford
land's population of fair young
Intellects is also unblemished by
other—but less noticeable—mi
nority groups. Thumb through
the Quad sometime and count

the Garcias and Lopezes. Oh,
don't bother, use the time to re

• More Questions
Editor, The Daily:
The questions submitted to
Vice President Humphrey on
Monday were rather tame, and
even so the questioners accepted
rather evasive answers to some
of them. There are some addi
tional questions to be answered
by some supporter of the gov
ernment's position.
1. The U.S. government once
expected to win in Vietnam
much more easily than it now
expects to, and presumably also
did not expect to kill so many
noncombatant civilians as it has.
How many Vietnamese do you
think it worthwhile to kill to
save the rest from Commun
ism? 1 per cent, 10 per cent, 90

per cent, 100 per cent?
2. The U.S. government says it
wants the Vietnamese to be able
to decide their future free of
coercion. As part of this pro
gram Vietnamese are being
driven from their villages which
are burned and forcibly settled
in what you call refugee camps
and we call concentration camps.
How many can you treat this
way without making meaning
less all talk of an uncoerced
choice.
3. Rusk says that the Vietnam
war is a simple case of North-
Vietnamese aggression and not
at all a civil war. We read in
the U.S. papers a few months
ago about a 14-year-old Viet
namese boy who led a platoon
of Marines into a mine field he
laid himself. Was this boy a
North Vietnamese aggressor?
Does he have any right to any
say in the future of his country?
Is he still alive?
4. Must any settlement of the
Vietnam war be acceptable to
General Ky?
5. How is the government of
Ky morally superior to the Na
tional Liberation Front?
6. Did the ADA receive CIA
funds when Humphrey led it?
We ask this question about his
previous role as one of the sub
verted rather than his present
role as one of the subverters.

The Apple of Segregationist
has been tossed in among the
fair young intellects of Stan
fordland. And, although I doubt
that anyone here will react
strongly enough to cause an In
dian uprising, do I detect a few
fair faces blushing to their hair
roots?
I read Mr. Gruber's article
(2-23-67) with much interest:
"Negroes at Stanford" sounds
like a social disease. Ah, "One
Per Cent"; well, it isn't yet an
epidemic. Statistically speaking
—and an article on the Stan
ford Negro should oh most defi
nitely be statistically speaking—
there aren't a heck of a lot of
Negroes here. True.
Ron Miller urges the fair
young intellects of Stanfordland
to "accept the Negro for what
he really is instead of what they
want him to be." What does that
mean? Different form of behav
ior: e.g. yellow shoes. Yellow
shoes??? Mr. Miller, what about
caring—I mean really crying in
side—about the too many places
where Being Negro means Being
Kicked in the Face, and about
the feeling that if you were
there, you'd Be Kicked Just As
Hard. lisn't that what different
behavior means? Or reacting to
everyday situations in Stanford
land just a little bit differently
because of a synthesis of Little
Things that you remember from
oh so very long ago. Or even re
membering the aromas of foods
that the fair young intellects of
Stanfordland have never even
tasted. Yellow shoes???
How about, Mr. Gruber, if
we take the American Negro
and put him under a watch
glass . . . well, look! He does
think a little differently; he docs
know songs and sayings that
the fair young intellect of Stan
fordland has never heard. But
my, my, his appendages pro
vide him with a mode of locomo
tion not unlike Everybody Else
in Stanfordland. Step right up,
folks, and observe the "approxi
mately 80 Negroes at Stanford"!
Forget the fact that Stanford
land's population of fair young
Intellects is also unblemished by
other—but less noticeable—mi
nority groups. Thumb through
the Quad sometime and count

the Garcias and Lopezes. Oh,
don't bother, use the time to re
cruit some Negroes for Stan
fordland, because They make
big news; and we like Them.
O.K. fair young intellects, let's
all go buy and wear and tell
each other how much we like
our yellow shoes. Because we
know that we are not segrega
tionists, because we are going
to Let In more Negroes—pro
vided They are qualified, oh but
of course. We won't have the
Outside thinking of us as Segre
gationists. We are Open-Minded,
you better believe it. And if we
can prove our coolness (after
all, to be cool is to be open
minded, everybody knows that)
simply by letting in a few more
Negroes . . . Then wc can all
gain Much Knowledge by under
standing our Dark - Skinned
Brother. And everyone from
Outside can look at Stanford
land and count (it's easy) the
number of Negroes. 107, 108,
109 .. .
Then we will be cool. I mean,
then we can say we really Know
What's Happening. The doors
and minds of Stanfordland are
always open. And all the fair
young intellects know that So
Much of one's education comes
from outside the classroom, and
Stanfordland has So Much to
offer.
So There, all you people out
side. Our dead Daily has report
ed to us the Error of Our Ways.
Now you can't call us Segrega
tionists. So tell Mr. Gruber that
he has Enlightened us. Then
pick up your apple and go back
to reality where you came from.

Who could possibly accept the
narrow-minded traditionalism
and classicism advocated by Rob
ert Saint-Loup in his review of
the ACT production of Six Char
acters in Search of an Author?
Saint-Loup will be offended,
no doubt, by the ribaldry in the
Stanford Repertory Theater
production of Chekhov's Cherry
Orchard. Stanford students must
learn to indulge themselves.

Editor, The Daily:
The Apple of Segregationist
has been tossed in among the
fair young intellects of Stan
fordland. And, although I doubt
that anyone here will react
strongly enough to cause an In
dian uprising, do I detect a few
fair faces blushing to their hair
roots?
I read Mr. Gruber's article
(2-23-67) with much interest:
"Negroes at Stanford" sounds
like a social disease. Ah, "One
Per Cent"; well, it isn't yet an
epidemic. Statistically speaking
—and an article on the Stan
ford Negro should oh most defi
nitely be statistically speaking—
there aren't a heck of a lot of
Negroes here. True.
Ron Miller urges the fair
young intellects of Stanfordland
to "accept the Negro for what
he really is instead of what they
want him to be." What does that
mean? Different form of behav
ior: e.g. yellow shoes. Yellow
shoes??? Mr. Miller, what about
caring—I mean really crying in
side—about the too many places
where Being Negro means Being
Kicked in the Face, and about
the feeling that if you were
there, you'd Be Kicked Just As
Hard. lisn't that what different
behavior means? Or reacting to
everyday situations in Stanford
land just a little bit differently
because of a synthesis of Little
Things that you remember from
oh so very long ago. Or even re
membering the aromas of foods
that the fair young intellects of
Stanfordland have never even
tasted. Yellow shoes???
How about, Mr. Gruber, if
we take the American Negro
and put him under a watch
glass . . . well, look! He does
think a little differently; he docs
know songs and sayings that
the fair young intellect of Stan
fordland has never heard. But
my, my, his appendages pro
vide him with a mode of locomo
tion not unlike Everybody Else
in Stanfordland. Step right up,
folks, and observe the "approxi
mately 80 Negroes at Stanford"!
Forget the fact that Stanford
land's population of fair young
Intellects is also unblemished by
other—but less noticeable—mi
nority groups. Thumb through
the Quad sometime and count

the Garcias and Lopezes. Oh,
don't bother, use the time to re
cruit some Negroes for Stan
fordland, because They make
big news; and we like Them.
O.K. fair young intellects, let's
all go buy and wear and tell
each other how much we like
our yellow shoes. Because we
know that we are not segrega
tionists, because we are going
to Let In more Negroes—pro
vided They are qualified, oh but
of course. We won't have the
Outside thinking of us as Segre
gationists. We are Open-Minded,
you better believe it. And if we
can prove our coolness (after
all, to be cool is to be open
minded, everybody knows that)
simply by letting in a few more
Negroes . . . Then wc can all
gain Much Knowledge by under
standing our Dark - Skinned
Brother. And everyone from
Outside can look at Stanford
land and count (it's easy) the
number of Negroes. 107, 108,
109 .. .
Then we will be cool. I mean,
then we can say we really Know
What's Happening. The doors
and minds of Stanfordland are
always open. And all the fair
young intellects know that So
Much of one's education comes
from outside the classroom, and
Stanfordland has So Much to
offer.
So There, all you people out
side. Our dead Daily has report
ed to us the Error of Our Ways.
Now you can't call us Segrega
tionists. So tell Mr. Gruber that
he has Enlightened us. Then
pick up your apple and go back
to reality where you came from.

• Cowardly Lion?
Editor, The Dally:
Amidst the kudos of the fine,
upstanding David Harris, we
found few references to what
appears to us to be the rather
obvious failure of said Mr. Har
ris to fulfill the responsibility
inherent in the office which he
accepted.
Does not an elected student
body representative have some
greater obligation than to ex
press his views, and then quit?
We say yes! We feel that when
an official is duly elected he in
curs a responsibility to the elec
torate to fulfill that position for
the entire term stated, to the
best of his ability, under initial
constraints of that office.
To avoid this responsiblity for
reasons other than poor health
can only be considered to be
both selfish and cowardly.

• More Questions
Editor, The Daily:
The questions submitted to
Vice President Humphrey on
Monday were rather tame, and
even so the questioners accepted
rather evasive answers to some
of them. There are some addi
tional questions to be answered
by some supporter of the gov
ernment's position.
1. The U.S. government once
expected to win in Vietnam
much more easily than it now
expects to, and presumably also
did not expect to kill so many
noncombatant civilians as it has.
How many Vietnamese do you
think it worthwhile to kill to
save the rest from Commun
ism? 1 per cent, 10 per cent, 90

per cent, 100 per cent?
2. The U.S. government says it
wants the Vietnamese to be able
to decide their future free of
coercion. As part of this pro
gram Vietnamese are being
driven from their villages which
are burned and forcibly settled
in what you call refugee camps
and we call concentration camps.
How many can you treat this
way without making meaning
less all talk of an uncoerced
choice.
3. Rusk says that the Vietnam
war is a simple case of North-
Vietnamese aggression and not
at all a civil war. We read in
the U.S. papers a few months
ago about a 14-year-old Viet
namese boy who led a platoon
of Marines into a mine field he
laid himself. Was this boy a
North Vietnamese aggressor?
Does he have any right to any
say in the future of his country?
Is he still alive?
4. Must any settlement of the
Vietnam war be acceptable to
General Ky?
5. How is the government of
Ky morally superior to the Na
tional Liberation Front?
6. Did the ADA receive CIA
funds when Humphrey led it?
We ask this question about his
previous role as one of the sub
verted rather than his present
role as one of the subverters.
