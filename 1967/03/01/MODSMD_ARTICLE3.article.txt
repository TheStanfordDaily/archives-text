# ROTC Leaders Outline Campus Military Program
## 
### MIRE MORTON 
The heads of the three ROTC units
at Stanford led a panel discussion on
the Reserve Officer Training Corps
programs in the Donner Lounge last
night. Capt. Brigham of the Navy,
Col. Nanney of the Army, and Major
Dorrs of the Air Force explained fac
ets of their own programs and ans
wered questions on the general na
ture of and reasons for ROTC.
Capt. Brigham explained that the
purpose of the Navy program is to
"provide a system of instruction at
civilian institutions for potential line
officers; to supplement the academic
course of study of the student such
that, after completion of his course
of study, he may be ready to assume
the responsibilities and duties of a
naval junior officer."
There are two basic NROTC pro
grams: the Regular and the Contract.
The Regular program is designed
specifically for producing career offi
cers. The student receives a full tui
tion scholarship and $50 per month
retainer; he is obligated to take 36
units of Naval Science, to participate
in three summer cruises, and to serve
four years of active duty. He is
selected only after a rigorously com
petitive scries of aptitude tests, phy
sical examinations, and interviews.
Contract Program
The second possibility, the Contract
Program, has two subdivisions. The
four year program involves no schol
arship, but a $40 per month retainer
In the final two years; the student is
obligated to one summer cruise and
three years active duty. The Two-Year
Contract Program also involves no
scholarship and an identical retainer
stipend. Obligations incumbent upon
the student in this program are com
mensurately less.

Four year students may also ex
ercise an option after the first two
years to take training in their final
two years leading to commission as
a Marine Corps officer.
The Captain stated that the stu
dents in this program are "represen
tive cross-section of the University."
Most of the 125 students in the unit
are majors in engineering, math, or
science.
Army Programs
Col. Nanney explained that the
Army's four year scholarship pro
gram is identical to the Navy's. The
four year non-scholarship program is
roughly equivalent to the Navy's
four year contract program, but with
the lesser requirements of 24 units
of Military Science and two years of
active duty. The Army is allowed to
recruit only for the four year pro
grams.
The Army ROTC unit is the largest
on campus, comprised of some 400
students. Col. Nanney explained the
large emphasis the Army places on
its campus programs, stating that the
Army obtains 85 per cent of its new
officers from ROTC programs.
The Colonel also explained the
"mandatory" ROTC programs on
many campuses. These were land
grant colleges required by the govern
ment to instruct all students in mili
tary fundamentals. This requirement
was abolished in a recent Supreme
Court decision, but many of the
schools elected to continue the man
datory programs.
Progress
Major Dodds opened his presenta
tion with the Air Force Academy mot
to, "progress unhindered by tradi
tion," which he characterized as the
motto of the university AFROTC
units. He stated that these "air uni
versities" are part of a separate com
mand developed to allow for free
questioning and exchange of ideas in
the training of Air Force officers.
The Stanford AFROTC program is
two years in duration. The student
takes a six-week summer course to
prepare for his two years in the uni
versity program. The qualifications
are similar to those of the other ser
vices, combining tests, physical, and
interviews.
Dialogue Method
Instruction in the Air Force pro
gram is according to the "dialogue
method": the subjects taught are of
"general value to anybody." Indoc
trination is left primarily to the sum
mer field camps with the University
courses designed as forums for the
testing of ideas by free dialogue.
Classes are conducted for the most
part by the students, and the courses
are "based on the students' needs."
There is no scholarship involved in
the program, but a $-10 per month re
tainer is provided. Enrollment in the
Air Force program is limited to about
14 students.
When asked to provide a justifica

tion for their existence on the Stan
ford campus, the three replied that
ROTC is the "democratic way," de
cided upon by Congress, to obtain
military officers; the University in
vites a military service to establish
an ROTC unit on campus.

ets of their own programs and ans
wered questions on the general na
ture of and reasons for ROTC.
Capt. Brigham explained that the
purpose of the Navy program is to
"provide a system of instruction at
civilian institutions for potential line
officers; to supplement the academic
course of study of the student such
that, after completion of his course
of study, he may be ready to assume
the responsibilities and duties of a
naval junior officer."
There are two basic NROTC pro
grams: the Regular and the Contract.
The Regular program is designed
specifically for producing career offi
cers. The student receives a full tui
tion scholarship and $50 per month
retainer; he is obligated to take 36
units of Naval Science, to participate
in three summer cruises, and to serve
four years of active duty. He is
selected only after a rigorously com
petitive scries of aptitude tests, phy
sical examinations, and interviews.
Contract Program
The second possibility, the Contract
Program, has two subdivisions. The
four year program involves no schol
arship, but a $40 per month retainer
In the final two years; the student is
obligated to one summer cruise and
three years active duty. The Two-Year
Contract Program also involves no
scholarship and an identical retainer
stipend. Obligations incumbent upon
the student in this program are com
mensurately less.

Four year students may also ex
ercise an option after the first two
years to take training in their final
two years leading to commission as
a Marine Corps officer.
The Captain stated that the stu
dents in this program are "represen
tive cross-section of the University."
Most of the 125 students in the unit
are majors in engineering, math, or
science.
Army Programs
Col. Nanney explained that the
Army's four year scholarship pro
gram is identical to the Navy's. The
four year non-scholarship program is
roughly equivalent to the Navy's
four year contract program, but with
the lesser requirements of 24 units
of Military Science and two years of
active duty. The Army is allowed to
recruit only for the four year pro
grams.
The Army ROTC unit is the largest
on campus, comprised of some 400
students. Col. Nanney explained the
large emphasis the Army places on
its campus programs, stating that the
Army obtains 85 per cent of its new
officers from ROTC programs.
The Colonel also explained the
"mandatory" ROTC programs on
many campuses. These were land
grant colleges required by the govern
ment to instruct all students in mili
tary fundamentals. This requirement
was abolished in a recent Supreme
Court decision, but many of the
schools elected to continue the man
datory programs.
Progress
Major Dodds opened his presenta
tion with the Air Force Academy mot
to, "progress unhindered by tradi
tion," which he characterized as the
motto of the university AFROTC
units. He stated that these "air uni
versities" are part of a separate com
mand developed to allow for free
questioning and exchange of ideas in
the training of Air Force officers.
The Stanford AFROTC program is
two years in duration. The student
takes a six-week summer course to
prepare for his two years in the uni
versity program. The qualifications
are similar to those of the other ser
vices, combining tests, physical, and
interviews.
Dialogue Method
Instruction in the Air Force pro
gram is according to the "dialogue
method": the subjects taught are of
"general value to anybody." Indoc
trination is left primarily to the sum
mer field camps with the University
courses designed as forums for the
testing of ideas by free dialogue.
Classes are conducted for the most
part by the students, and the courses
are "based on the students' needs."
There is no scholarship involved in
the program, but a $-10 per month re
tainer is provided. Enrollment in the
Air Force program is limited to about
14 students.
When asked to provide a justifica

tion for their existence on the Stan
ford campus, the three replied that
ROTC is the "democratic way," de
cided upon by Congress, to obtain
military officers; the University in
vites a military service to establish
an ROTC unit on campus.
The heads of the three ROTC units
at Stanford led a panel discussion on
the Reserve Officer Training Corps
programs in the Donner Lounge last
night. Capt. Brigham of the Navy,

course of study of the student such
that, after completion of his course
of study, he may be ready to assume
the responsibilities and duties of a
naval junior officer."
There are two basic NROTC pro
grams: the Regular and the Contract.
The Regular program is designed
specifically for producing career offi
cers. The student receives a full tui
tion scholarship and $50 per month
retainer; he is obligated to take 36
units of Naval Science, to participate
in three summer cruises, and to serve
four years of active duty. He is
selected only after a rigorously com
petitive scries of aptitude tests, phy
sical examinations, and interviews.
Contract Program
The second possibility, the Contract
Program, has two subdivisions. The
four year program involves no schol
arship, but a $40 per month retainer
In the final two years; the student is
obligated to one summer cruise and
three years active duty. The Two-Year
Contract Program also involves no
scholarship and an identical retainer
stipend. Obligations incumbent upon
the student in this program are com
mensurately less.

Four year students may also ex
ercise an option after the first two
years to take training in their final
two years leading to commission as
a Marine Corps officer.
The Captain stated that the stu
dents in this program are "represen
tive cross-section of the University."
Most of the 125 students in the unit
are majors in engineering, math, or
science.
Army Programs
Col. Nanney explained that the
Army's four year scholarship pro
gram is identical to the Navy's. The
four year non-scholarship program is
roughly equivalent to the Navy's
four year contract program, but with
the lesser requirements of 24 units
of Military Science and two years of
active duty. The Army is allowed to
recruit only for the four year pro
grams.
The Army ROTC unit is the largest
on campus, comprised of some 400
students. Col. Nanney explained the
large emphasis the Army places on
its campus programs, stating that the
Army obtains 85 per cent of its new
officers from ROTC programs.
The Colonel also explained the
"mandatory" ROTC programs on
many campuses. These were land
grant colleges required by the govern
ment to instruct all students in mili
tary fundamentals. This requirement
was abolished in a recent Supreme
Court decision, but many of the
schools elected to continue the man
datory programs.
Progress
Major Dodds opened his presenta
tion with the Air Force Academy mot
to, "progress unhindered by tradi
tion," which he characterized as the
motto of the university AFROTC
units. He stated that these "air uni
versities" are part of a separate com
mand developed to allow for free
questioning and exchange of ideas in
the training of Air Force officers.
The Stanford AFROTC program is
two years in duration. The student
takes a six-week summer course to
prepare for his two years in the uni
versity program. The qualifications
are similar to those of the other ser
vices, combining tests, physical, and
interviews.
Dialogue Method
Instruction in the Air Force pro
gram is according to the "dialogue
method": the subjects taught are of
"general value to anybody." Indoc
trination is left primarily to the sum
mer field camps with the University
courses designed as forums for the
testing of ideas by free dialogue.
Classes are conducted for the most
part by the students, and the courses
are "based on the students' needs."
There is no scholarship involved in
the program, but a $-10 per month re
tainer is provided. Enrollment in the
Air Force program is limited to about
14 students.
When asked to provide a justifica

tion for their existence on the Stan
ford campus, the three replied that
ROTC is the "democratic way," de
cided upon by Congress, to obtain
military officers; the University in
vites a military service to establish
an ROTC unit on campus.
