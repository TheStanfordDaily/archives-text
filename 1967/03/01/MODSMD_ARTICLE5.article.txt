# Socialist Leader Norman Thomas Presents Four Steps For Peace
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
"Unless peace is obtained within
your lifetime, there will be no Great
Society. While that war goes on in
South Vietnam, there vvill be no basis
for peace."
With these remarks, Norman Thom
as opened his speech to a capacity
crowd in Cubberley Auditorium yes
terday afternoon. Despite his state
ment that "I am a decrepit old man,"
the 82-year-old leader of the American
Socialist Party was interrupted fre
quently by applause and received two
standing ovations.
Thomas outlined what he felt are
the four prerequisites for peace:
First is the need for "universal dis
armament." Thomas insisted, "It is
incredible to think that you will pile
up thermonuclear weapons and never
use them."
The second task is "to build a strong
er UN and associated agencies." It
would be the purpose of these groups
"to supervise disarmament and police
brush-fire wars."
As a third step toward peace, Thom

as urged more world-wide "coopera
tion in the struggle to conquer pov
erty."
Finally, Thomas urged the United
States to "abandon the notion that
God or the devil has called on us to
police the world."
Turning to the subject of demon
strations, Thomas said, "Demonstra
tions have to be examined in terms of
their effect and not just as a means
of releasing our emotions."
Letter To Ho Chi Minh
Thomas admitted that he had, along
with other people, sent a letter to
Ho Chi Minh urging him to seriously
consider any United States attempts
at attaining peace.
He went on to urge students to "to
convey the message to Ho Chi Hinh."
He added that "our main effort should
be in the direction of our public of
ficials."
"I should like the President to
take the lead in obtaining peace in
Vietnam. We want action, and we have
to get it through him."
As part of this effort to implement

a peace program, Thomas said the stu
dents' position should be "explained
even to Vice President Humphrey."
Victims Of Power
"I don't think that you can say that
our governmental officials are im
perialistic in any sense of the word.
I think they are victims of the in
herited influence of power "
"We are toying with the ideal of
forming a permanent lobby in Wash
ington where representatives from
the 50 states are continuously coming
through." This would allow for the
continual release of information on
South Vietnam as it was obtained.
Thomas also mentioned plans for
"a petition to be passed throughout
the country to obtain an enormous
number of signatures."
The main stress of Thomas' refer
ences tÂ» obtaining peace, was his state
ment, "There are better ways of gain
ing peace than we are employing in
dividually."
Thomas concluded, "Your education
is really not of much value unless you
can deal with these problems."
