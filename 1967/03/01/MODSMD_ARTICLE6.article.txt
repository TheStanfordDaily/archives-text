### SANDY SHAPIRO 
"Out of the 3 x 2 million Jews in Rus
sia, the groat majority may be con
scious of their ethnical background,
but that is all. They have inter-mar
ried, assimilated, and arc completely
uninterested in whether they are
Jewish or not," stated Dr. Lilli Rahn
who has recently returned from a mis
sion to the Soviet Union.
She continued, "If it comes to the
test—as it sometimes does in their
professional lives—they are Russian.
And they negate everything Jewish
because it doesn't mean anything to
them. They are communist first, and
everything else second.
"However, there is a significant
minority, I would say about a mil
lion, who are conscious Jews—who to
some degree would like to continue
being Jewish identified in a broad
sense. We have to make it possible
for them to keep their spirit alive at

least until the time when they can
more positively identify as a Jew
in Russia," she said in an interview
yesterday.
Dr. Rahn with 23 other national
leaders of Hadassah, a Zionist wom
en's organization, traveled to the So
viet Union for several reasons. Dr.
Rahn explained that since Hadassah
is one of the major sponsors of the
American Committee on Soviet Jewry,
they wanted to gain first-hand knowl
edge of the conditions in that coun
try. They felt their visit would boost
the morale of the Jews within Russia
and impress upon the Soviet people
their interest in the problem.
According to Dr Rahn, the group
was treated extremely well by State
officials. The women wore Stars of
David on their clothing so they could
be easily identified as they toured
the country.

"There are no school for rabbis, no
Yiddish newspapers, no theater, no
schools for children—the equivalent
of a Hebrew school or Sunday school
doesn't exist anymore," Dr. Rahn
said. "What used to be the Jewish
community structure is completely
gone; there is no inter-city organiza
tion or communication in Russia." In
addition, she said there were no books
on Israel or Judaism available in any
language.
Dr. Rahn felt that the most de
plorable fact about the Russian Jew
ish plight is the lack of development
of Jewish thought. "This has t en
destroyed during the last 60 or 70
years. Russia was once the great
source of Talmudic learning, of in
terpretation, of writing; from there
came the most learned Jewish schol
ars.

When asked what can be done to
improve the environment of the Jews
in Russia, Dr. Rahn replied: "We
cannot ask the Russian government
to be happy about the revival of a
religious group—that's unrealistic in
a country with atheistic doctrines. We
can ask, however, that the Jews be
treated as every other nationality
group within Russia "
"The old say 'I cannot teach my
children because they don't want to
be taught — they don't want to know;
they want to forget.' The young tell
us 'My parents told mo Jewish educa
tion was forbidden by the State.' The
whole cycle ends up with assimilation,
obliteration, or what we call cultural
and religious genocide. If this goes
on for another 20 or 25 years, there
will be nothing left. The old ones will
be gone, and the young ones won't
know," she concluded.
