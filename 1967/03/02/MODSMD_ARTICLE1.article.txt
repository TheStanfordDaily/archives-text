# National To Local: Problems For Lambda Nu, ATO
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS (Second in a series of articles about local fraternities) 
Clashes between local chapters of fraternities
and the national organizations may have a
variety of results—for the Beta chapter of
Alpha Kappa Lambda it meant 90-day sus
pension; for Alpha Tau Omicron it meant re
vocation of its national charter.
The Beta Psi chapter of ATO was Stanford's
first fraternity to go local, and the only one
which couldn't call the choice its own.
In the summer of 1960 the chapter had re
fused to comply with an ultimatum issued by
the national that the chapter drop four Jewish
pledges, three of them having entered the
house the preceding spring. The national con
stitution required that all members "must be
male, must be white and must have accepted
the Christian faith."
Constitutional Violations
In January of 1961 the national formally
charged the fraternity with disregard of the
national constitutional membership require
ments, refusal to depledge those who had not
fulfilled the requirements, and failure to make
a report of those pledged and initiated.

For two months the fraternity walked a
tightrope between threats from the national
and possible action by the University. (Be
cause of the University's anti-discrimination
policy approved in 1957, depledging of the
four Jews would probably have resulted In
disciplinary action.)
According to Doug Garner, a member of the
1960 pledge class and house president in 1962-
63, chapter representatives had at the 1960
summer convention tried to "feel out the pos
sibility of getting things changed" in regard
to the discriminatory clauses, but had been
unsuccessful.
While strongly backed in its stand by LASSU
and the administration, the fraternity de
clined the offer of California Attorney Gen
eral Stanley Mosk to take legal action and
file a brief as a friend of the court following
the January threat.
On March 8, 1961, the chapter had its char
ter lifted by a five-man high council following
an unanimous decision which overruled pleas
on behalf of the chapter by over 100 chapter
members and alumni
According to Garner, and present house pres
ident Dick Meyers, alumni support had a

strong influence in helping the fraternity ad
just to its new status.
Rush Success
Spring rush in 1961 was an apparent suc
cess, and according to Meyers, "a vote of
confidence for the fraternity's decision." Gar
ner said that there is no conclusive evidence
that the fraternity's move actually aided rush
that spring, but it "didn't hurt it noticeably."
He added that some freshmen weren't even
aware of what had happened.
Garner said that within the house itself,
there has been "no significant change" that
the admission is still selective as far as indivi
duals are concerned with "standards essen
tially the same." Since the chapter's ouster,
Negroes have also pledged the fraternity.
Immediately following the break the chap
ter sought some means of reconciling with
the national and even considered affiliating
with another national fraternity. At present
though, there are no such plans and, accord
ing to Meyers, "being in a national means
nothing—except having a place to sleep when
traveling across the country."
Unlike the other three fraternities going
local, Alpha Kappa Lambda, now Lambda Nu,

did not base it's action on a discriminatory
membership policy.
In the summer of 1965 a survey regarding
a disaffiliation proposal was sent to the chap
ter's 389 alumni with the results of a 3-1 mar
gin favoring the move. For some time the
chapter had been re-evaluating its ties with
the national and felt that the group could
generally operate better autonomously.
In October of 1965, Stanford's Beta chapter
of Alpha Kappa Lambda, second oldest in the
country, was suspended for "deliberate Viola
tion of pledge education procedures and fi
nancial responsibility."
John Quinn, Lambda Nu president, cites
the extensive alumni support as a positive
factor in encouraging the fraternity's move.
The dependence of the local on alumni sup
port was evidence in the 1965 resolution which
called for disaffiliation "provided we are given
the necessary alumni support."
Quinn said that it was "ironic" that while
some of the national's primary aims are to
aid local chapters financially and with pledge
indoctrination, several chapters have been
suspended because of inability to meet fi
nancial responsibilities and difficulties in carry

ing through pledge training rules.
"AKL is very expansionists," said Quinn.
He added that one basis lor the chapter's
move was a feeling that national ties were a
hardship on the Stanford chapter, as dues and
other fees paid were being spent largely to
help open new chapters rather than being
put back into improvement funds for the
existing local chapters.
According to Quinn, the good response in
1966 spring rush was due partly to the pub
licity of the house's decision and "to the man
ner in which we went local."
This year, in an effort to boost a more low
keyed r ,,r .h, Lambda Nu has eliminated the
ding s; _Aem and has established a positive
vote system. Each active member will have a
maximum of 15 votes, one vote to be used
for one rushee.
According to Quinn, this plan should elim
inate required voting on every rushee by each
active and encourage selection on the basis
of acquaintance with the individual rushee.
Such procedures would probably not have
been possible under national ties, said Quinn,
as the national had set procedures for rush—
"though we weren't following them anyway."
