# Soviet Jews Face Identity Loss—Rahn
## 
### 
'"The tragic thing is that the
kind of Judaism youngsters see
in a Russian synagogue they
cannot identify with—it has no
meaning to them," Dr. Lilli Rahn
told an audience of about forty
persons in Tresidder Union last
night
"These youngsters have no
concept of the development of
Jewish thought, of Jewish phi
losophy" in the last forty or fifty
years, she continued. "Not only
do they not know about this,
they don't even know about the
older traditions.
"I think the greatest prob
lem is, really, that unless some
thing changes, in twenty-five
years there won't be anyone left
who knows."
Dr. Rahn stated that "anti
semitism in Russia is not ethnic
or racial," at least as far as the
Soviet government is concerned,
and she feels that people should
"forget Hitler" when trying to
understand the Soviet govern
ment's attitude. "What is ex
pected of the Jew is total assimi
lation, and then he is accepted,"
but "total assimilation" for

Jews means being "willing to
sell their souls completely."
However, those who resist as
similation—and a surprisingly
large number retain their sense
of Jewish identity—are perce
cuted. "We cannot expect the
Jews in Russia to have religious
freedom, because no one else
does," she added, "but we can ex
pect them to have their civil
rights as a 'nationality' " —which
they do not have, although leg
ally classified as one.
What is important, Dr. Rahn
stressed, is that Jews in other
countries make known their con
cern for the Russian Jews
through protests and petitions
to the Soviet and other govern
ments and through visits such
as her group made.
