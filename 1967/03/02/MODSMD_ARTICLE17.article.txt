The University has made a wise decision in
postponing its plans to build Robert Moore
Hall. We hope this delay will give it an op
portunity to consider its plans more carefully,
to insure that the next dormitory built at Stan
ford will be more than a coeducational Stern
Hall.
The intended design for Robert Moore Hall
did not fulfill the requirements expected of a
residence in which a fusion of education and
housing is sought. In fact, it did not even in
corporate a number of the features outlined
when plans for its construction were first an
nounced in 1965. Robert Moore Hall was not
going to have any faculty residences, seminar
rooms, or tutor suites. No academic program
had been formulated, nor had any faculty
members who might live in the dormitory and
participate in an educational program been
found. And the exact nature of the so-called
"educational input" for Robert Moore Hall had
not yet been determined, either. It appears that,
had this residence been built according to
present plans, the search for education would
have continued to be confined to the Quad.
Reconsideration of the design for Robert
Moore Hall will allow the administration to
take into account the recommendations of the
ASSU Housing Commission. It will, for in
stance, permit them to consider construction

of faculty residences and seminar rooms, both
of which were recommended by the Housing
Commission. The postponement will also give
the University the opportunity to decide on
such questions as off-campus living for women
and the Wilbur Experiment before making a
commitment as major as the construction of
another dormitory.
Financial problems have been plaguing the
plans of Robert Moore Hall since they were
first announced two years ago. The shortage of
funds available is in great part responsible
for the fact that the residence, if built now,
could not fulfill many of the ideals expected of a
dormitory which is supposed to provide an edu
cational environment. It is our hope that the
delay in construction of Robert Moore Hall will
allow the University to continue looking for
either new sources of financing or other areas
in which to cut back its expenses. It would
Ix 3 a tragedy for a plan as bold as the con
struction of a dormitory based on a totally new
concept of residence to fail only because suf
ficient funds were not available.
Provost Lyman has said that the postpone
ment of construction of Robert Moore Hall
is "indefinite." We applaud the delay, but hope
that it is only temporary and that an acceptable
solution to the problem of new residences can
be found soon.
