## The 						Farm...Remember When? 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Good morning friends. Have
you ever wondered what happens
to all of those fine Stanford
students who up and graduate?
I'll bet you have. I'll bet you
think that they just go out into
the big world and seek their for

tune and disappear. Well, I
guess that's pretty much true.
But, no sir, that needn't be the
case, No-sir-ree bob, no-sir-ree
bob.
Now I'll bet you're wondering
what the dickens I'm talking
about. I'm talking about the won
derful think called the Alumni
Reunion. I'm talking about the
wonderful reunion planned for
the Class of 1962.
I'm talking about the fact that
"Dr. Sterling has invited us to
use the University facilities and
to live in friendly ol' Wilbur
Hall at a nominal charge (and re
live the great RF's of the past.)"
I'm talking about what goes on
at this University.
They'll Find Out
"There'll be an entire weekend
for you to visit old spots, mar
vel at all of the new PACE bulid
ings, look up old profs, have a
few drinks (on campus?), and
even attend a couple of lec
tures."
Now some of you may be sur
prised that the President of the
University has invited alumni
to "relive the great RF." But
you shouldn't be, no-sir-ree bob.
You may be surprise ' that the
alumni are going to come back
and find out "what all those new
buildings are for, what are the
University's long-range academic
goals, why can't our football
team beat USC."
You may think that Alumni
don't want this kind of fun. No
sir-ree bob. "Those alums who
have been to the first two Jurv?
reunion programs run out of
superlatives when they describe
their experiences—and these are
alums who've been used to Big
Game reunions for 30 years or
more."
You may be thinking of all

those alums who complained
when Big Game was canceled
because the President of the
United States was killed. But
you shouldn't be. Because "not
only has The Farm acquired a
new look since June of '62, but
so have reunions."
There is just one thing which
worries me, new look or not. I
wonder whether the Alumni
plans really do recapture the
great times at Wilbur, the splen
did courses, the weltschmertz of
a close football game. So, in an
effort to be constructive, let's
make some suggestions.
First, let's bring back those
wonderful days at Wilbur. The
tasteful food produced from
cardboard boxes. The cozy little
rooms where on Saturday night
freshmen yell with frustration
and loneliness. Those wonder
ful reinforced concrete walls
that never need mending. Those
long, rich hours spent studying
Western Civ ("will you please
have finished the Plato and Aris
totle by next meeting—we are
already behind").
Golden Past
Let's bring back those lovely
times at Lag. "Will you please
take your foot out of our lovely
fountain. Stanford women should
not do such things."
Let's bring back those inter
esting controversies. Like the
time a track star couldn't run
because of long hair, but no
one bothered the ball players
who had been arrested in Palo
Alto for disorderly conduct.
Let's bring back Admissions,
and the time one of their officers
confided privately that "if I had
my way, there wouldn't be any
Negroes at Stanford."
Yahoo, alumni. Welcome back
to the Animal Farm.

You may be thinking of all

those alums who complained
when Big Game was canceled
because the President of the
United States was killed. But
you shouldn't be. Because "not
only has The Farm acquired a
new look since June of '62, but
so have reunions."
There is just one thing which
worries me, new look or not. I
wonder whether the Alumni
plans really do recapture the
great times at Wilbur, the splen
did courses, the weltschmertz of
a close football game. So, in an
effort to be constructive, let's
make some suggestions.
First, let's bring back those
wonderful days at Wilbur. The
tasteful food produced from
cardboard boxes. The cozy little
rooms where on Saturday night
freshmen yell with frustration
and loneliness. Those wonder
ful reinforced concrete walls
that never need mending. Those
long, rich hours spent studying
Western Civ ("will you please
have finished the Plato and Aris
totle by next meeting—we are
already behind").
Golden Past
Let's bring back those lovely
times at Lag. "Will you please
take your foot out of our lovely
fountain. Stanford women should
not do such things."
Let's bring back those inter
esting controversies. Like the
time a track star couldn't run
because of long hair, but no
one bothered the ball players
who had been arrested in Palo
Alto for disorderly conduct.
Let's bring back Admissions,
and the time one of their officers
confided privately that "if I had
my way, there wouldn't be any
Negroes at Stanford."
Yahoo, alumni. Welcome back
to the Animal Farm.
Good morning friends. Have
you ever wondered what happens
to all of those fine Stanford
students who up and graduate?
I'll bet you have. I'll bet you
think that they just go out into
the big world and seek their for

tune and disappear. Well, I
guess that's pretty much true.
But, no sir, that needn't be the
case, No-sir-ree bob, no-sir-ree
bob.
Now I'll bet you're wondering
what the dickens I'm talking
about. I'm talking about the won
derful think called the Alumni
Reunion. I'm talking about the
wonderful reunion planned for
the Class of 1962.
I'm talking about the fact that
"Dr. Sterling has invited us to
use the University facilities and
to live in friendly ol' Wilbur
Hall at a nominal charge (and re
live the great RF's of the past.)"
I'm talking about what goes on
at this University.
They'll Find Out
"There'll be an entire weekend
for you to visit old spots, mar
vel at all of the new PACE bulid
ings, look up old profs, have a
few drinks (on campus?), and
even attend a couple of lec
tures."
Now some of you may be sur
prised that the President of the
University has invited alumni
to "relive the great RF." But
you shouldn't be, no-sir-ree bob.
You may be surprise ' that the
alumni are going to come back
and find out "what all those new
buildings are for, what are the
University's long-range academic
goals, why can't our football
team beat USC."
You may think that Alumni
don't want this kind of fun. No
sir-ree bob. "Those alums who
have been to the first two Jurv?
reunion programs run out of
superlatives when they describe
their experiences—and these are
alums who've been used to Big
Game reunions for 30 years or
more."
You may be thinking of all
