# Open Letter To VP
## 
### 
Mr. Vice President:
Do not be misled. This aca
demic community is deeply di
vided and your remarks on the
campus last week and the events
that followed only deepened the
division. Do not misread the ap
plause you received nor Presi
dent Sterling's appropriate apol
ogy for the purposeless and vio
lent attempt on the part of a few
frustrated students to delay
your departure.
The vehement division of opin
ion in this community reflects I
believe a growing division of
opinion in the country as a
whole. You and your adminis
tration must take this into ac
count. We, of the opposition to
our government's present Viet
namese policy, are growing in
our determination to do what
we may to force a change. No
agile words, no deceptions, no
call to patriotism, no optimistic
reporting of enemy "body
counts" and military achieve
ments, no predictions of an im
pending military victory, no
charge of equally abominable
cruelty on the part of the enemy
will eradicate the shame and the
dismay and anger that many of
us feel towards our present
policies.
I am, Mr. Vice President, one
of those faculty members who
"walked out" on your address
last week. Perhaps this was un
wise and foolish. But I trust that
you are astute enough not to be
misguided by your own words
(now widely being quoted in the
press): "The first sign of im
maturity and dogma and doc
trine and intellectual tryanny is
when a person is unwilling to
stay and listen." You must real
ize, Mr. Vice President, that
those who walked out to em
phasize our disapproval, without
exception, stayed to listen to
your words outside the hall
where they were being broad
cast. I assure you further, that
this group has read and anal
yzed and discussed your address
since that day. (A tape recording
was even made and studied.)
Those who stayed in the hall
enjoyed your quick wit and your
adroitness ... as I confess I
did myself. Your showmanship
is artistic and I ruefully admit
some envy, when I consider
how hard it is to keep my own
students' attention during a lec
ture. But I suspect that those
who stayed did not listen as

carefully as those who left. It
remains therefore but clever
rhetoric to imply that we of the
opposition "refused to listen."
We "took a walk" to empha
size the intensity of our opposi
tion. It is difficult for silence to
compete with the applause (re
ported in local papers as "thun
derous") which arose from about
half the audience. We of the op
position had agreed to be cour
teous, to al'ow you to present
your plea, without disruption or
heckling. There was left no im
pressive manner to emphasize
our opposition except to walk
out.
It would be folly to expect you
to change your convictions or
even to repeat arguments.
(There are many among my rel
atives and friends whom I can
not persuade regarding the
shame, the inhumanity and the
stupidity of the Vietnamese
war.) My purpose is to accent
the vehemence and the thought
fulness of the opposition. Ulti
mate judgment must rest with
the future regarding the wis
dom and the humanity of our
country's present policies and
actions.
I can only declare openly that
I join with those who are utter
ly dismayed and outraged by
this military venture and the
failure of the administration to
listen to Humanity. (Where is
our "decent respect for the opin
ion of mankind"?) I do not
know the legal definition of trea
son. Whether it be treason or
no, I shall applaud and encour
age those young men who are
presently defying the draft. I
shall do what little I can to
raise my voice in opposition to
the present military policies and
to the cruel and indiscriminate
manner in which weapons are
being used with careless regard
to civilian casualties. I am willing
to face the possibility that op
position such as mine may "en
courage the enemy" and hence
postpone a quick military vic
tory and surrender. Frankly I
hope we cannot achieve a mili
tary victory in the manner that
we now are pursuing. Victory
on this basis would, in my opin
ion, be disastrous to the honor,
traditions, and moral prestige of
our country.
"If this be treason. . .
