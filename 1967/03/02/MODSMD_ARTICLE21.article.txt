## 'Edge Of Stagnation' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
For nearly four years, I have
watched the members of the
'Stanford family' seek their in
dividual and collective salvations.
The members of this putative
'community of scholars' have,
generally, little interest in the
life of the mind, the supposed
first purpose of the university.
Most often, they are transfixed
by the search for minimal ma
terial comforts.
Because they are unwilling to
face intellectual challenges, they
are largely bored with life. Yes,
bored. They seem content to slip
along, eating, sleeping, and for
nicating to the best of their abil
ity. Few things can rouse them
from their torpor, and those that
do only serve to illustrate my
point about the boredom which
is the quintessence of their ex
istence.

Dave Harris occasionally
roused people somewhat. (In
fact, I am convinced that a de
sire to see whether Harris could
stir things up was what got him
so many votes last Spring.) But,
in the end, Harris proved to be
not 'of the community for which
he purported to speak. He was
never truly 'one of us.' As 'Chip'
Martin (hopefully a fictitious
character) said in yesterday's
Daily: "The first time I heard
him I thought he was well
spoken and had good ideas.
When I got to talk to him later
I thought his appearance was
revolting and some of the things
he said were ridiculous.'" (my
emphasis).
And when they are roused,
what do people do? Conserva
tives usually end up by throw
ing peaceniks in the fountain
or shaving people's heads; lib
erals and 'lefties' sit-in, walk
out, lie down, or turn on.
But where, oh where, In all of
this, is intellect? We have, in
this student body of past student
body presidents and valedictor
ians, History majors who take
no courses from Gordon Craig
and Political Science majors who
take none from Charles Drek
meier (to offer two prominent
examples) because these men
might be capable of straining a
little new knowledge, or a new
approach to learning into their
little heads.
Grove House and the Experi
ment to the contrary notwith
standing, this university Is much
closer to the edge of compla
cency and stagnation than it is
to 'greatness' in any form.
