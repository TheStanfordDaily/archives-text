# Sanford Blames Apathetic Faculty For Lack Of Educational Reforms
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
Much reform is necessary at most
colleges and universities in the U.S.,
including Stanford, according to Ne
vitt Sanford, Director of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems.
And, he said, faculty members are
often partly responsible for the lack
of such reform.
Speaking before a Graduate Semi
nar in Higher Education at Columbia
University on January 3, Sanford
said many faculty members feel "col
lege would be a fine place if it weren't
for the students." He holds college
faculty members responsible for much
of the unrest and rioting on campus
because of their reluctance to insti
tute changes in the present system
of higher education.
"Stanford is among those colleges
that offer a fairly conventional type
of education. There is nothing radical
or off the main stream here and it is

taken for granted that this is what
college education should be, few com
plain," Sanford said. He feels that
movement in the right direction has
occured at Stanford, however, and
cited freshman seminars, the Grove
Project, the Experiment, pass-fail,
and more liberal liquor and social reg
ulations. "Enough has happened to
take the heat off," making riots like
those that occured in Berkeley in
1965 "unlikely."
Several experimental colleges, nota
bly Antoch have instituted many of
the reforms Sanford advocates. An
tioch is experimental in that it can
put into effect a new educational pro
gram worked out by faculty and
students at any time. Students are
members of all committees and have
a voice in all decisions including those
on admissions policy, selection and
tenure of faculty members, financial
aid, forms of instruction, and overall
goals of the college. Sanford notes
that when students are so incorp
orated into a university, then they
find that "participation of this kind
is not so romantic as they thought.
Others Experiment
"Other such experimental colleges
exist, but these are new and poorly
financed for the most part. It is ob
viously easier to bring about such
reform in a new college than in an
older, tradtional, well-endowed univer
sity," said Sanford. He continued,
"Stanford always does things to be
like Antiock."
Another type of experiment with
the college curriculum is being car
ried on at St. John's, where selected
students read the classics with fac
ulty members. In this method the
teacher is really the great book while
the professor is not an expert in any
thing but reading books.
After the riots at Berkeley, the
Chancellor proposed several experi
mental colleges. These failed to ma
terialize due to a lack of faculty sup
port, according to Sanford.
Faculty Apathy Responsible
He believes that faculty apathy is
responsible for the failure of many
new proposals. "There is very little
to prevent the faculty from innovat
ing," Sanford points out. In the past
the only source of pressure has been
the students and although he feels stu
dent support is essential to any major
change, Sanford does not think stu

dents are in a good position to know
which objectives to support or how
to achieve them. He calls this rather
quick exstablishment of "The Ex
periment," surprising.
In his recent book Where Colleges
Fail, Sanford expresses concern over
the "rather narrow view of educa
tion that exists in the minds of most
citizens." The positions of these peo
ple are made clear in their letters to
the editors of newspapers complain
ing about "rioting students at Berke
ley disrupting education." Sanford
denies the conventional view of the
student as one who goes to class,
accumulates facts, but does not ques
tion the framework of his institution.
He claims this view of education
must have emminated from the aca
demic people since the personal ex
perience of individuals would con
tradict it.
Sanford concluded that "new pro
grams in which we integrate action
with intellectual pursuits are neces
sary."
