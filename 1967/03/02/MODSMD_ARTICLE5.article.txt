# LASSU May Change Constituency System
## 
### 
The Legislature will consider two
bills tonight to reconstruct LASSU by
enlarging the constituencies from
which representatives are elected.
The first bill provides that all mem
bers of fraternities and eating clubs
and residents of Stern, Florence
Moore, Lagunita, Roble, Branner, and
the Row houses elect representatives
as one constituency.
Off-campus undergraduates would

comprise the second constituency,
and graduate students would elect
representatives according to field of
study.
The second bill, a by-laws change,
specifies these graduate student con
stituencies. Some are composed of a
single school, such as law or medicine,
while others are combinations of de
partments within Humanities and
Sciences, such as anthropology, psy
chology, and sociology or philosophy
and political science.
According to Speaker Tom For
stenzer, "lots of similar ideas are
floating around," and the new pro
posals are bound to stimulate discus
sion and possibly additional resolu
tions. He added that the two bills will
probably be referred to the Rules
Committee.
Another bill to be presented will
schedule elections for ASSU Vice
President for March 13-14. and for off
campus representatives to LASSU.
The Consttiution requires that the
vacant Vice President's office be filled.
The Legislature will meet at 7:30
tonight in room 370, across from the
Physics Tank.
