# Administration Postpones Moore Hall Construction
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Construction of Robert S. Moore
Hall, a complex of co ed dormitories,
has been postponed indefinitely, Pro
vost Richard Lyman announced yes
terday. The buildings were to house
140 men and 140 women, and were to
be located on Mayfield Avenue near
the fraternity clusters.
Lyman gave two reasons for the
suspension of plans. Government loan
money has been frozen for the time
being, and new considerations of the
role of dormitories have been stimu

lated recently by the report of the
ASSU Housing Commission.
One month ago it was announced
that construction of David and Mar
garet Jacks had been postponed for
substantially the same reasons.
Lyman emphasized that the post
ponement in no way alters the com
mitment to the concept of co-ed dorm
itories. Other proposals contained in
the ASSU housing report will be taken
up by the Study of Education, headed
by Vice Provost Herbert Packer.
Loans Frozen
Moore and Jacks were first proposed
two years ago. At the present time,
however, the Home and House Finance
Agency of the federal government
has put a freeze on all loans, and al
though the freeze might be lifted
sometime this year, it would be a fi
nancial gamble to go ahead with con
struction now.
Plans for Robert Moore omitted
some recommendations made by the
ASSU Housing Committee, including
faculty residences and seminar rooms.
These and other more general pro
posals on the philosophy of residential
education were partly responsible
for the decision to postpone building
new dormitories.
It is possible, Lyman said, that the
opening of new dormitories would
force discontinuation of women's
apartment living in Hoskins House. It

would depend, he added, on the de
mand for such accommodations and
would be affected by a decilsion yet to
be made on whether to allow women
to live off campus. "A variety of op
tions is the most desirable policy,"
he said.
Reasons For Postponement
The reasons for '* poning con
struction of Robert were, ac
cording to Lyman, by and large the
same as those applying to Jacks Hall.
Aside from the difficulty of obtaining
federal loans and the new evaluation
of residential education, little pro
gress was made on the academic pro
grams for the houses. At the time it
was decided that Jacks would not be
built yet, it was announced also that
no faculty members has been re
cruited yet for an educational pro
gram nor had the nature of any edu
cational programs yet been developed.
It was originally intended that
Moore and Jacks Houses would be fi
nished by autumn 1968, with facilities
for 560 men and women. Since con
struction has been delayed now, it
would be at the earliest 1969 before
any new dormitories were occupied.
The third fraternity cluster, to be
built on Campus Drive behind Wilbur
Hall, is in the final stages of plan
ning now. It is expected to be ready
for occupancy by autoumn 1968. Con
struction should begin in May or June.
