# Stanford Team Finds
## Radiation May Be Hodgkin's Disease Cure 
### 
Hodgkin's disease, a potentially
lethal form of cancer, is no longer in
curable. Dr. Henry S. Kaplan and
Saul A. Rosenberg, two leading can
cer investigators at the Stanford
School of Medicine, contest the popu
lar belief that the disease is fatal.
The doctors said. "A very consid
erable proportion of all patients with
regionally localized disease can be
offered a chance of permanent cure
with radiotherapy, and patients with
more advanced disease can be offered
prolonged periods of comfortable and
productive life with use of drugs and
radio therapy."
Hodgkin's disease, a maligancy of
the lymph nodes that kills 3500 per
sons a year, was thought to be fatal
because it .spreads in an unpredictable
manner and recurs in treated areas.
Instances of apparent cure have been
discounted as errors in diagnosis in
the past.

Kaplan and Rosenberg attributed
these "deeply pessimistic" views to
"crude diagnostic methods and primi
tive radiation equipment."
According to the doctors, the most
effective treatment" is inextricably
linked to the meticulous and thorough
evaluation of the extent of disease
prior to treatment. Unless all areas of
disease that can possibly be detected
by present methods are identified and
treated intensively, it is not reason
able to expect treatment to be success
ful."
The patient's physician, an experi
enced radio-therapist, and an internist
qualified in cancer chemotherapy
should all take part in diagnosing the
disease.
Cure By Radiation
The two investigators have found
that if diagnosed correctly, 80 to 90
percent of the victims "can be offered
apparently permanent cure" with in
tensive radiation. The doctors believe

that a great many of the previous
failures in curing Hodgkin's disease
with radiation have resulted from
using x-ray beams of too low fre
quency. Such weak dosages of x-ray
therapy are only effective on patients
who have localized diseases in the
early stages.
"Recent analysis of data from a
number of radiotherapeutic centers
ship between recurrence rate and
radiotherapeutic dose," state Drs.
Kaplan and Rosenberg.
They have found that as the radia
tion dose increases the recurrence
rate falls rapidly and eventually ap
proaches zero when a dose level of
4,000 rads (units of radiation dose) is
reached. When localized to avoid vital
structures, this high dosage can be
given safely if delivered in divided
doses.
Not Unpredictable
Kaplan and Rosenberg dispute the
theory that the disease spreads ran

domly and unpredictably. This would
mean that patients treated for the
localized disease could eventually be
affected by Hodgkin's in other sites
and permanent cure would be ex
tremely rare.
Research, however, has shown that
a high proportion of patients survive
five years after intensive radiotherapy
for localized disease, and many sur
vive ten to fifteen years or more. Most
survivors have no recurrence after
the initial treatment. Autopsies per
formed on patients who underwent
radiotherapy and who later died of
other diseases show no trace of Hodg
kin's disease in the treated sites or
elsewhere.
Kaplan and Rosenberg foresee even
further improvement in cure rates as
a result of information gained from
epidemilogical studies, routine appli
cation of the newest diagnostic tech
niques, controlled clinical studies, and
immunological research.
