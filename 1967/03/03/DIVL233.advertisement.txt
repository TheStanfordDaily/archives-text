"Bill.
Evans is
one of the very tiny group of
real poets we have: a sensitive,
intuitive and imaginative genius
in his medium." Jazz Magazine
"The delicate probing lingers
are like tendrils of sound that
curl around the melodies with
a wispy ethereal quality...Such
music wears well. The more one
listens, the more there is to
hear." Down Beat Magazine
That's what the jazz critics say
about him. But even people who
don't like jazz respond to Bill
Evans.
His music is tender, lyrical, pas
sionate. It's
A SIMPLE MATTER
OF CONVICTION,
and that's the title of his new
est album, with Shelly Manne
and Eddie Gomez (V/V6-8675).
Treat yourself also to these two
recent releases:
INTERMODULATION
with Jim Hall, guitar
(V/V6-8655)
"The sustained interplay of the
two musicians is of a quality
rarely found in jazz."
John S. Wilson
BILL EVANS TRIO WITH
SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
(V/V6-8640)
"So perfect it's hard to dis
tinguish between Bach. Chopin
and Evans." Leonard Feather
