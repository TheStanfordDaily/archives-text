"At TRW, we are young enough
not to be afraid of change."
George Harter, Manager, Space Vehicles Engineering Operations, TRW Systems
We encourage young engineers and scientists to go with us and to grow with us. There
is no end to the technical capabilities of the systems TRW is developing for NASA and
DOD. Our programs include manufacture of a global communications satellite system
for Comsat, building the LEM descent engine, NASA's Interplanetary Pioneers, the Air
Force's Nuclear Detection Satellite system, Gemini, Apollo, and post-Apollo programs.
Our biggest need is still for people who are able to think for
themselves and who want to get ahead. —mmmm
