# PACE Program Inaugurated 'Second Stone Age'
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER (First in a series) 
Since the original Quad was built at
the turn of the century, Stanford's
physical plant has been sorely ne
glected. The University is now, how
ever, in the midst of a "second stone
age" that will allow the physical en
vironment to "catch up" to the Uni
versity's educational needs by 1976.
The University inaugurated this
"second stone age" with the PACE
program in 1960. Building expansion
worth $67 million was financed by the
program, which ended in 1965. An ad
ditional $70 million, however, will be
needed for plant additions by 1970 and
another $70 million by 1976.
"The "first stone age," which saw
the Inner Quadrangle completed in
1890 and the Outer Quad in 1900,
"put Stanford's academic plant at the
top of American universities," accord
ing to Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, Vice-
President for Finance.
The turn-of-the-century buildings

remained adequate until the years
immediately following World War II
when enrollment took a big jump.
Since no construction took place dur
ing the war, by 1950 "the "University
found itself in a critical position,"
Cuthbertson stated. With enrollment
far above the 1930 figures and no
large-scale building since 1900, today
there is only 70 percent of the space
per student that there was in the 19-
30-1940 period.
Earthquake
The Quad was practically unchang
ed from the time of the 1906 earth
quake until the war. Partial remodel
ing of the Business School, Jordan
Hall, Earth Sciences, and Engineering
Corner did not solve the problem.
Likewise, the addition of Memorial
Auditorium and Frost Amphitheater
in 1937, the School of Education in
1938, and Hoover Tower in 1941, did
little to satisfy the sudden demand for
classroom and laboratory space. The
need for more room was clear.

By 1950, President Wallace Sterling
and the Board of Trustees outlined a
plan of concentration in specific areas
to put Stanford "back among the top
universities:"
• The Fifties — improvement of
faculty;
• The Sixties — improvement of
facilities;
• The Seventies — increased endow
ments.
Catching Up
Cuthbertson explains: "This plan is
essentially a catching up. The post
war years were concentrated on build
ing a first-rate faculty. We now have
the type of faculty we envisioned, in
cluding the top handful from many
fields." Cuthbertson cited that the
faculty grew from 600 to 800 during
the fifties and that salaries are among
the "top rank."
As University funds were concen
trated on faculty salaries, physical
growth during the Fifties hardly

equalled the explosion that was to
come during the early Sixties. The
Physics Lecture Hall, Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, and the Medical School were
the main additions in the Fifties.
The PACE years began the "second
stone age." In academic areas, the
Engineering additions, Stauffer Chem
ical buildings, Varian Laboratory, the
Computation Center, the Graduate
School of Business, Meyer Undergrad
uate Library, the Clinical Sciences Re
search Buildings, and the Sloan Math
Corner renovation have all been fi
nanced and completed since 1960.
Non-Academic
In non-academic areas, the Tresid
der • Bookstore - Faculty Club com
plex, Cowell Student Health Center,
the Storke Student Publications Build
ing, and fraternity cluster houses
were finished.
In addition, several other building
projects were either partially or to
tally financed under PACE, but are as
yet uncompleted. Among these are

the Herrin Biological Science build
ings, Lou Henry Hoover addition to
the Hoover Institution, and the
Maples Pavilion.
To finance its current educational
expenditures, including sponsored re
search and self-supporting activities,
Stanford relies on gifts from private
sources to account for 32 per cent of
its funds. Tuition provides only 42
per cent, while endowment covers 17
per cent. The other nine per cent
comes from miscellaneous sources.
Capital Costs
Beyond operating costs are capital
costs such as those for buildings and
the improvement of the University's
endowment. Here the reliance on
gifts is heavier; gift receipts account
for almost the entire cost, except for
matching grants from the federal
government.
Several additional buildings have
been finished since the end of the
PACE campaign: the Bechtel Student
International Center, Bing Nursery

School, Escondido Village 111, and the
StaufTer Laboratory for Chemical En
gineering.
For 1967 alone, Stanford needs $27.5
million from private donors — $13.5
million for current expenditures, $7
million for buildings, and $7 million
for endowment additions. University
expenditures including building have
risen 130 per cent since 1961.
"Much of our building plans depend
on what funds come in," commented
Willian McCammon of the Grants and
Facilities Administration. "With
building costs going up one-half per
cent per month, the faster we can
get started, the cheaper our costs
are."
With a background of two waves
of building activity interspersed with
a long period of lethargy, Stanford is
putting forth an all-out effort to meet
its growing needs. The "second stone
age" is an attempt to meet this de
mand.
