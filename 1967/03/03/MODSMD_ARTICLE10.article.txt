# Ed Study May Tackle OFF
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The steering committee for
The Study of Education at Stan
ford will meet tonight to discuss
agenda alterations, priorities,
and possibly the issue of wom
en's off-campus living.
Herbert L. Packer, commit
tee chairman, emphasized that
the meeting's primary goals are
to deal with the agenda and to
establish a set of priorities for
issues to be examined. If the
committee decides "Off" should
have highest priority, it may
then be discussed. Packer
noted, however, that the com
mittee will not be searching for
an immediate answer tonight,
but rather, "will discuss how to
go about tackling the issue."
Tonight's meeting follows two
weeks of open hearings at which
committee members heard stu
dent proposals concerning agen
da modifications and issues such
as "Off" and Freshman hous
ing.

Janet Howell, head of the
"Off" drive, urged the steering
committee to deal with "Off"
immediately. She also requested
they examine the overall ques
tion of a "double standard for
women at Stanford "
Members of the freshman
