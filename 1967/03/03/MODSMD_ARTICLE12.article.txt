# New Political Group Creates 'Alternative To The New Left'
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
A new political education or
ganization at Stanford Univer
sity, the Stanford Western Po
litica Society, was formally or
ganized on January 25, 1967.
According to the Society's
chairman, Dennis Wilson, the
group seeks to provide "a broad
er based intellectual alternative
to the New Left."
Wilson adds that Western Po
litica Society is unique among
campus organizations in that its
membership includes faculty and
alumni as well as students. All
three groups are represented on
the Executive Committee of the
Society.
Statement Of Purpose
In a statement of purposes of
the organization, the group de
clared, "Rather than imposing
any narrow political program on
anyone, we are attempting to
awaken those who do not believe
that there is something rotten
at the core of American society
to the fact that they are natural
allies."
The activities of the Society
dates back to last spring when a
small group of students and fac
ulty members published a new
journal, Western Politica. The

second edition of the magazine
appeared this fall, and the third
will appear sometime this quar
ter.
In order to form an organiza
tion to carry out the aims of the
journal in other spheres several
meetings were held at the homes
of students, faculty, and staff
members.
"The meetings arose," said
Wilson, "out of a concern for a
situation that gave the New
Left a seeming monopoly of the
intellectual spokesmen on this
campus."
No Political Party
In its statement of purposes,
the group insists, "The Society
does not plan to become a po
litical party on campus, nor does
it intend to placidly accept the
status quo."
"It does intend to provide a
forum through which the vari
ous components of the univer
sity community can meet to dis
cuss our common problems,
those of the university, the
United States, and the interna
tional society in which we are
inextricably involved."
The Society is currently hold
ing a series of panel discussions
to probe the three basic com

ponents of its preamble: the
meaning of Western Civilization
in the 20th Century, the role of
the United States in the world,
and the place of the academic
institution in American society.
The first panel was held in
Tresidder last Monday night and
discussed the subject "West
ern Civilization: A Guilty So
ciety?" The panel included Pro
fessor William Bark of the His
tory Department, Roger Mag
nuson, a senior in Economics,
and John Lucas, a senior in His
tory.
Panuel Discussion
A panel consisting of Profes
sor Milorad Drachkovitch, of the
Hoover Institution, John Wil
kinson, a second year law stu
dent, and Bob Walker, a grad
uate student in history, will dis
cuss the role of the United
States in the world this Monday
evening.
After the first meeting, one
member of the Society said, "I
would hope that we could have
as wide a range of political opin
ions as possible at these meet
ings."
"It isn't going to do us any
good at all to sit here in our
little room and convince our
selves of our Tightness."
