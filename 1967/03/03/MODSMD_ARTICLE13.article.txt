# 'Tiny Alice' Praised
## 
### ROBERT SAINT LOUP 
Of Tiny Alice ACT has created
a theatrical masterpiece. The
current San Francisco produc
tion is a dazzling, evil interpreta
tion of a play which was only
two years old in December.
Everything about it is gray;
gray and fetid. The piece pullu
lates with a rarefied homosexual
symbolism, of which Salvador
Dali's pictorial fetishism makes
a striking parallel-
Oh yes, it was deified by
some; dismissed as sinister rub
bish by others. ACT has crossed
this tight-rope into a no man's
land, half - respectable, half - ob
scene, where every dimension of
melodrama is dramatically ex
ploited.
Fabulously Rich
Alice, ostensibly, is a fabulous
ly rich woman who exists in the
topmost room of a rambling
Gothic mansion. She will give
he Catholic Church (which is
mercilessly flailed throughout
the play) a nameless bequest of
two billion. The currency, no
tice, is unspecified.
Brother Julian is to negotiate
the grant on behalf of the local
Cardinal. He stumbles into the
castle, innocent and ingenuous,
iike to fly into a 4 - dimensional
cobweb.
Paul Shenar takes hold of this
part and beats the audience
with it: naive, fumbling, at first
uncorrupt but gradually shying
away from his piety into the ex
pert embrace of Alice, he dis
plays a tempered brilliance that
can still grow into the awesome
crescendo of the finale.
Butler and Lawyer
Alice is served by a butler and
a lawyer; having had carnal
knowledge with both of them,

she fastens on healthy, ruddy
Julian as her next partner.
DeAnn Mears plays Alice with
a hideously effective simplicity:
from flirtatious lechery she
moves to a sadistic detachment.
"I dreaded once, when I was in
my teens, that I would fc 'row
old, look back, over the precipice,
and discover that I had not lived
my life." She certainly lives
it in this play.
A 1 Alu, as Butler, is vapid and
rotten to the core. Having care
fully underplayed his part in the
first act (as all the characters
did) he had room to degenerate
formidably in the second and
third.
Degeneration
This degeneration becomes
the theme of the play, over and
above the financial grant, which
is there for the asking. The lan
guage is rich in pauses and in
nuendo. It has the eccentricity
of Beckett with a dash of sus
tained nastyness that was new
in Absurdist drama: "God the
scoutleader . . . Gingerbread
God with the raisin eyes."

If the acting is superb, the
staging is nothing less than sen
sational. A wide velvet stairway
leads up from the center to the
back of the stage, dominated at
the top by heavy oak doors.
When the chapel Is burning,
the doors open to a crash of
organ fortissimos and billowing
smoke from the hall behind
them. Julian staggers down
coughing out the news that the
fire in the chapel is extinguished.
Climax
At the climax of the play, in
his manic-divine soliloquy, She
nar marches up the stairs to
the thunder of Poulenc and
Bach. On either side is dark
ness; spotlights from the roof
follow his crucifixion progress
up to the door.
Red and white streamers of
silk catch him up in the white
brilliance of the open gateway.
As the organ swells and the
heart - beats thump closer, he
cries out his last frenzy, a reli
gious self-offering indistinguish
able from orgasm-
