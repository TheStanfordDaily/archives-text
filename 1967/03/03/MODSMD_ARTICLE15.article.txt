# Freshman Drama To Produce Dylan Thomas Play 'Milkwood'
## 
### MARTHA HUMPHREY 
A production of Dylan Thom
as' Under Milkwood, acted and
directed by Stanford freshmen,
will be presented Sunday at 8:30
p.m. and Monday at 9:30 p.m.
in the Branner Hall dining room.
Under Milkwood, directed by
Matthew Schneiderman, is the
first of a series of plays under
the sponsorship of the freshman
drama group. Others in the
series are This Property is Con
demned by Tennessee Williams,
Riders to the Sea by John Syn
ge, and The Lesson by lanesco.
The remaining two are origi
nal dramatizations of the poems
"The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock" by T. S. Eliot and
Robert Frost's "Death of the
Hired Man." The setting of the
former has Prufrock at a cock
tail party.

The six directors chose and
cast their plays at the begin
ning of Winter Quarter as a
project for the freshman semi
nar "English Drama on the
Stage" taught by Mark Mirsky
of the Voice Project. About 30
freshmen are involved in the
six plays.
As well as separately rehears
ing these plays, the drama
group meets on Sunday nights
in Otero lounge. With the help
of Mirsky and of Larry Fried
lander of the English depart
ment, they criticize the coming
productions and give improvisa
tions.
"The reason we formed this
group is because there is very
little we as freshmen could do
in drama besides Gaities and
walk-on parts in the Stanford
Repertory Theater. This group
gives us drama on a more in

formal basis," said Ken King,
president of the drama group.
The problem of finding re
hearsal times may have causftd
some delay in the production
of the six play si.
Explained King, "Many of the
actors, as well as the directors
themselves, are in more than
one play. So it gets a bit con
fusing."
Although Uivier Milkwood is
the only production scheduled
right now, King; hopes that the
remaining five will be ready
soon after spr'.ng break.
The freshman drama group
also presented two English mys
tery plays before Christmas in
front of Memorial Church. Ten
tative plans arc for an outdoor
production in the spring.
Admission tc Under Milkwood
is free.

Repertory Theater. This group
gives us drama on a more in

formal basis," said Ken King,
president of the drama group.
The problem of finding re
hearsal times may have causftd
some delay in the production
of the six play si.
Explained King, "Many of the
actors, as well as the directors
themselves, are in more than
one play. So it gets a bit con
fusing."
Although Uivier Milkwood is
the only production scheduled
right now, King; hopes that the
remaining five will be ready
soon after spr'.ng break.
The freshman drama group
also presented two English mys
tery plays before Christmas in
front of Memorial Church. Ten
tative plans arc for an outdoor
production in the spring.
Admission tc Under Milkwood
is free.
A production of Dylan Thom
as' Under Milkwood, acted and
directed by Stanford freshmen,
will be presented Sunday at 8:30
p.m. and Monday at 9:30 p.m.
in the Branner Hall dining room.
Under Milkwood, directed by
Matthew Schneiderman, is the
first of a series of plays under
the sponsorship of the freshman
drama group. Others in the
series are This Property is Con
demned by Tennessee Williams,
Riders to the Sea by John Syn
ge, and The Lesson by lanesco.
The remaining two are origi
nal dramatizations of the poems
"The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock" by T. S. Eliot and
Robert Frost's "Death of the
Hired Man." The setting of the
former has Prufrock at a cock
tail party.

The six directors chose and
cast their plays at the begin
ning of Winter Quarter as a
project for the freshman semi
nar "English Drama on the
Stage" taught by Mark Mirsky
of the Voice Project. About 30
freshmen are involved in the
six plays.
As well as separately rehears
ing these plays, the drama
group meets on Sunday nights
in Otero lounge. With the help
of Mirsky and of Larry Fried
lander of the English depart
ment, they criticize the coming
productions and give improvisa
tions.
"The reason we formed this
group is because there is very
little we as freshmen could do
in drama besides Gaities and
walk-on parts in the Stanford
Repertory Theater. This group
gives us drama on a more in

formal basis," said Ken King,
president of the drama group.
