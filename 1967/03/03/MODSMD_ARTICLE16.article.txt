# Diplomat-In-Residence Views Japan, Orient Political Future
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Stanford's diplomat - in • resi
dence, John K. Emmerson, has
served during his 31 years in the
Foreign Service in a variety of
posts, but his specialty is Japan.
As diplomat-in-residence, Em
merson teaches no classes
though he will teach a colloqu
ium next quarter. He has been
speaking to classes about Jap
anese history and to student
groups; he also has a busy
schedule of speaking engage
ments most of which are off
campus.
Mr. Emmersson, who speaks
fluent Japanese and French as
well as some .Russian and Span
ish, was first assigned to Japan
in 1935. He f.aid this pre-war
period was "a very interesting
time to live in Japan, what with
the growing tension between the
Japanese and American govern
ments." Emmerson was trans
ferred out of Japan in October,
1941, and so escaped being In

terned with other American dip
lomats after Pearl Harbor.
Having been with Admiral
Nimitz's headquarters for part
of the war, Emmerson returned
to Japan with the occupation
and served as a political adviser
to General Mac Arthur. Emmer
son has just returned from an
other assignment, this one of
four and a half years, in Japan
as Minister and Deputy Chief
of Mission.
Served In Moscow
Besides his work in Japan
Emmerson has served as First
Secretary to the U.S. Embassy
in Moscow. He also has worked
in Karachi, Beirut, Paris, Lagos
in Nigeria, and Salisbury in the
Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland.
During World War Two Em
merson was for a time political
adviser to General Stillwell in
the China-India-Burma theater
of conflict.
Studied In France
He first became interested in
a Foreign Service career when
he won a scholarship to spend
his junior year of college in
France, where he studied at the
Sorbonne.
Emmerson believes that
though many Americans view
China as the new rising power
in the Far East, Japan has great
er potential for world leader
ship "over the long haul." He
pointed out that Japan is the
only industrialized nation in that
part of Asia. "With a population
of 100 million Japan now has a
greater gross national product

than China, whose population is
700 million," Emmerson said.
In the future Japan is likely
to remain a close friend of the
United States, according to Em
merson. He mentioned that in
recent elections for the lower
house of the Japanese Diet Pre
mier Sato's Liberal Democratic
Party had maintained control
of the legislature. The Japanese
left wing has demanded that
the 1960 security treaty with the
United States be abrogated in
1960, the earliest time either
party to the treaty can with
draw. But Premier Sato sup
ports the treaty, and his control
over the legislature is fairly cer
tain to continue for the next
four years since 1971 is the date
for the next election. The
treaty limits Japan's military
establishment to a defensive pos
ture while guaranteeing that the
United States will protect Japan
from foreign powers.
China Trade No Threat
Emmerson does not view Ja

pan's increased trade with China
as a threat to Nippo-American
friendship. Premier Sato insists
that in Japan "politics are sep
arated from economics," at least
in this instance, according to
Emmerson. Though Japanese
trade with China has increased
to $620 million last year, there
are no diplomatic relations be
tween the two countries.
The State Department's dip
lomat-in-residence program, ini
tiated in 1964, gives a chance for
veteran Foreign Service officers
to study and to live in a uni
versity environment in the
United States for an academic
year.
Emmerson, who has been at
Stanford only a month, declined
comment on Vietnam and on stu
dent activism for this article,
but he said he wants "to ex
change views with students on
the implementation of our for
eign policy." His office is room
21D in the Political Science
Building, and his extension is
2613.

as a threat to Nippo-American
friendship. Premier Sato insists
that in Japan "politics are sep

in this instance, according to
Emmerson. Though Japanese
trade with China has increased
to $620 million last year, there
are no diplomatic relations be

Mr. Emmersson, who speaks

in 1935. He f.aid this pre-war
