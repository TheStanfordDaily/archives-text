# SRT Blossoms With 'Cherry Orchard'
## 
### CURTISS B. KECK 
As of Wednesday evening,
Stanford Repertory Theater
came into its own right in the
world of theater. I say this with
no hesitation, for surely SRT
must be considered one of Amer
ica's great professional com
panies when it can stage such
an all-round, splendid produc
tion of Chekov's last and most
notable play, "The Cherry Or
chard."
Using the particularly gratify
ing, "modernized" translation of
"The Cherry Orchard" by Rob
ert Corrigan, Director Mel Sha
piro and his troupe of outstand
ing actors were able to keep
Chekov's play vibrant through
out. And yet never did they tip
Chekov's delicate balance of
tragedy and comedy, pathos and
ethos.
As Chekuv's plays are so sim
ple and his caricatures so hu
man, any production runs the
risk of slipping into tedium if
the director cannot make small
touches to keep the play alive
and if the actors cannot muster
enough warmth and emotion to
portray their full-bodied roles.
An Enrapt Chekov?
With small comic reliefs, such
as Yasha's odious cigar, and
with highly effective additives
like the dance at the beginning
of Act 111 and then, throughout
the act, the party atmosphere
backstage as a canvas for the
tragedy in the front-stage. The

acting was uniformly excellent
and, as one might imagine,
would have enraptured Chekov
himself.
Written on the eve of the
Russian Revolution in 1905, "The
Cherry Orchard" depicts the dis
placement of the Russian aris
tocracy by an emerging capital
ist bourgeoisie. Tsarist Russia
had given way under the forces
of change and the aristocracy
found itself helpless to cope
with the new, middle class world.
After five years living in Paris,
the aristocratic Ranevsky fam
ily returns to Russia and faces
eviction and auction of its es
tate as payment for overdue
mortgage. Out of blind hope
for some miracle, they cling to
the past and refuse to confront
the real world around them.
Madame Ranevsky's estate,
with its heritage, its fond me
mories, and its magnificent
cherry orchard, is auctioned off
and cleared to make lots for
the vacationing middle class.
The cherry orchard is an old in
situation, chronicled even in
the Encyclopedia, which, by
needs of destiny, is replaced by
a new enterprise.
Hoffman Successful
In the lead role of Madame
Ranevsky, Jane Hoffman scored
a resounding success. Miss Hoff
man articulately captured the
presence of a great and noble
woman who was too inured to
the past to cope with the pres

ent. Slowly, but ever so slowly,
from her first grand entrance
with her family onto the stage,
we saw the mounting helpless
ness with which she related to
the strange world around her.
Miss Hoffman commanded
throughout the dignity and re
gality of her role; and yet, as the
play progressed inevitably to the
loss of her beloved estate and
cherry orchard, she evoked a
pity that truly tapped the heart.
Paul E. Richards was burn
to play Lopahin, the peasant
turned wealthy merchant who
eventually buys the estate of
Madame Ranevsky. Throughout
the play, Richards projected a
vivacity and a kinetic anima
tion which stood in sharp and
delightful contrast to Chekov's
meeker characters. He was awe
somely captivating as he strode
about the stage making wild,
erratic gestures and whacking
his arms against his sides in
despair of one thing or another.
In Act 111, the scene where the
celebrous Lopahin announces to
the Ranevsky family that he has
just outbid everyone at the auc
tion and is the new master of the
estate, Richards played Lo
pahin's delirious jubilation to
the hilt.
Hiken A Delight
As Gaev, Madame Renevsky's
ineffectual brother and arch-type
of the decadent middle-class,
Hiken was a delight to watch.
When his nieces (Astrid Wills

rud and Ruth Silveira) hushed
him in the midst of ofto of his
florid and flowing orations on
some inane topic, Hiken looked
as if he had invented the ex
pression of the boy caught with
his hand in the cookie jar.
Whenever Hiken went, his an
cient vallet, Feers (Glenn Can
non), was not far behind to
scold him for not dressing
warmly enough or for having
put on the wrong pair of trou
sers. Cannon, who was remark
ably feeble and decrepit many
times over his years in portray
ing the octogenerian Feers, and
Hiken were always a laugh when
they would fuss with one an
other.
Paul E. Winfield was exact in
the role of Tro'amov, "profes
sional" student at Moscow Uni
versity. He exuded such an un
daunted idealism that his excite
ment over the rights of man and
hisscorn for a c.ipitalist-orient
ed society was el'petrifying. The
part of a 26 year old student
would seem a di:Ticult role for
Winfield to portray because of
the tremendous confidence and
force of elocution and character
he naturally exhibits on stage.
But as Trofimov, Winfield kept
much of his powi?r at bay; and
with his touches of adolescent
awkwardness and fumbling
hands looking .somewhere to
hide, he was enti rely believable.
No Bad Performances
Notably, there were no bad
performances. Gilbert Green, as
the landowner Pishchik, strode
the boards with his usual thun
der and aplomb. Playing the cad
dish servant Yas ha, Stephen D.
Newman turned in an excel
lent performance as did SRT
newcomer Astrid Willsrud in the
role of Varya, Madame Ranev
sky's adopted daughter, and
Carol Androsky, as Dunyasha
the maid, and pert, nubile Ruth
Silveira, as Anya.
Richard Hay's sets were in the
style of Chekov: simple yet
evocative. In Ac: I, the snowy
cherry blossc ms, as seen

through latticed windows
against the blue canvas of the
sky, were striking. It was su
prising how a flickering candle
in the middle of the stage gave
a cheeriness and a warmth to
the stage as Madame Ranevsky
entertained guests at the start of
Act I. Then, when the guests
had departed and the candle
was extinguished, the stage be
came cold and frosty dawn air
fairly gushed across the auditor
ium.
The set in Act II was a fasci
nating study in the illusion of
depth. The pathway down the
center of the stage seemed to
wander back indefinitely.
Special Effects
The special effects of Derek
Hunt were handled well and
added much realism to the pro
duction; birds chirping at dawn,
Morgan Sterne's creaky boots,
the sound of a string snapping

as old, forgotten Feers lies
down to die on the steps of the
deserted estate, and the cadenced
thunking of the axes in the end
as the cherry orchard is chopped
down.
Stanford theater goers, if no
thing else, have been loyal. They
forgive and forget easily; per
haps because, whether out of
magnanimity or a discerning
eye for embryonic genius, they
have kept the faith gently that
some day SRT would break out
of the confines of mediocrity.
With "The Cherry Orchard,"
SRT rewarded the Stanford
Theater • goers many • fold for
their unflaging support. No
longer is SRT indebted to the
campus; but rather, we are
greatly in debt to SRT for what
Director Mel Shapiro and his
troupe of actors and stage crew
have given to the Stanford cam
pus.
