# 'Zoo Story' Cages Students

### ANDREW B. WILSON Entertainment Editor 
Performances of Edward Al
bee's "The Zoo Story," which
this reviewer saw previewed on
Wednesday, opens 8:30 tonight
at the Experiment, site of the
late dearly beloved Western
Civ library.
Undergraduate drama students
Bill Clebsch and John Stahlin
alternated roles in dual perform
ances of the two character one
act, and made an ambitious, sin
cere, and sometimes imaginative
effort to come to grips with the
play.
That they did not in fact come
to grips with it, however, was
hardly surprising (though both
are competent actors, having
performed admirably in several
Speech and Drama Department
plays), and simply reflects the
extreme degree of professional
sophistication demanded for a
proper handling of a good Albee
play.
Pitfalls For Young Actors
Clebsch and Stahlin stumbled
into the basic pitfalls which one
might expect young actors to
encounter with Albee. For one
thing, they were unable to con
vincingly portray the weary de
genercy and cynism of the char
acters. And for another, they
were wholly unable to master
the play's language, which is
extraordinarily intricate and
crucial to the very nature of the
play.
Like his other plays, "The Zoo
Story" contains a minimum of
plot and action, with its move
ment deriving almost exclusively
from subtle, continual transi
tions of mood and tenor, occa
sioned most frequently by what
first appear insignificant twists
in the conversation. Thus a petty
quibble over the use of a word
might lead into a slashing ha
rangue against a character's
values.
Along similar lines, Albee has
an Ingenious talent for spinning
out speeches of unbroken fluid
ity which may successively be
come, by deftly realized strokes:
sad, absurd, tragic, ludicrous,
sincere, malicious, whatever.
Anything goes, or might go, and
bathos abounds.
Different Interpretations
While Clebsch and Stahlin
gave widely different impres

sions of the dominant character
(Jerry), both showed the same
damning tendency to wade sin
gle-mindedly through the long
speeches, varying their intensity
but seldom or inadequately
transforming their mood and
tone. The monotony was such
that, among other faults, the
great humor of Albee's sharp,
pungent lines was lost.
After the play Clebsch and
Stahlin related that they had
been experimenting with wide
range of interpretations of the
characters. The particular vice
of the previewed performances,
though, was that their interpre
tations were far too obvious
and inflexible. The magic of Al

bee's characters often lies in
their very inscruitibleness. It
could be said, with some truth,
that a well-performed Albee
plays leaves you not quite know
ing what the hell to think of his
characters (of his heroes, any
way).
Kudos
Perhaps the fact of this pro
duction of "The Zoo Story" will
prove moie significant than its
occurrence. Undergraduate
drama students have seldom
been able to work with contem
porary drama. The Experiment
may change this. And Clesch
and Stahlin, though out of their
depth, are to be commended for
their effort, fitfully quite good.
