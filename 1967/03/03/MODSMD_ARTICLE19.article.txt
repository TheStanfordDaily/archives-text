IVfIDNIGHT AT THE MaFIA, at the Nitery 11:30 Saturday night,
offers a lively melange of skits, improvisations, peanut-butter-and
jelly sandwiches, and the like.
MOVIES
Those who wish to flick-out at Tresidder tonight can see Kan
Ichikawa's THE BURMESE HARP. The movie concerns a Japanese
soldier of weary mind and troubled conscience who decides during
the Burma campaign that he can no longer go on killing. A movie
of some topical interest.
Neither Marlon Brando nor the Hell's Angels seem terribly In
these days, but Tresidder's Saturday nighter, THE WILD ONE, may
be expected to attract a large audience. An all-time fifties juvenile
delinquent picture about raw youth and callow adolescence.
MUSIC
One of the world's truly great guitar players, LAURINDO AL
MEIDA, will play at 8 Tuesday night at Memorial Auditorium. The
benefit performance has been arranged by the Stanford Lacrosse
Club. Tickets available at the Tresidder box office.
WE FIVE at Mem Aud at 4:30 this afternoon. Roll call at
Rats 6:00.
The sweet sounds of South African jazz pianist, DOLLAR
BRAND, will grace Dinkelspiel, 2 p.m. Sunday.
