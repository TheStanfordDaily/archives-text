RUGBY
Riding an eight-point lead the
Stanford Rugby team will at
tempt to wrest the Big Game
Scrum Axe from the California
Bears for the first time in three
years tomorrow at 1:30 on the
Stanford home field.
Stanford won the first game
of the annual home-and-home
series at Berkeley last week, 22-
14.
The victory ran Stanford's
season record to 7-0-1, with the
only non-victory being a 12-12
tie with USC.
The Kieldng Game
Last week's game could have
been termed a battle of the toes
as, despite the horrendous play
ing conditions of the muddy Cal
stadium, Stanford's Mike Grace
outpointed Cal's Randy Thaman
13-8 in the kicking scoring.
Though once again this week
kicking may prove decisive, the
Stanford Rugby field's condition
is fast and the playing surface
is wider than that at Cal. Both
factors should help the Stanford
backfield.
In the scrum, Stanford will be
without the services of Blaine
Nye. Nye, a key figure in Stan
ford's front line scrum, was in
jured in last week's match and
will not play.
Nye Leaves a Gap
Other strong scrum men such
as Joel Neal, Eric De Gooyer,
and Peter Hogg will have to
take up the slack in the scrums,
while Gene Moffett and Tim Wil
son hope to take Cal's measure
in the lineouts.
Besides Grace, other scoring
threats for Stanford are Bob
Blunt, Dick Ragsdale and Bob
Newberry.
Blunt and Ragsdale are both
speedy and always threats to go
all the way. Newberry, after a
slow start this season, has now
scored in each of the last three
games.
Two previously injured rug
gers, Frank Pattitucci and Eric
Sutcliffe, may return to action
this week, though their playing
status was still a question mark
yesterday afternoon.
FENCING
Stanford will host the Men's
Western Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships today and to
morrow.
Competition will be from 9:00
a.m. to 6:00 on both days and
will take place in the Women's
gym-
There will be three types of
events. Sabre events will be
fenced with standard equip
ment, while the exciting Foil
and Epee events will be scored
with electric equipment.
Admission is free and the host
team, the Stanford Fencing
Club, invites all interested to
come and observe fencing at its
agile and sometimes swash
buckling best.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Eucalypto house has won the
women's intramural basketball
crown for the 1967 season.
Tuesday's final game saw the
Eucalypto roundballers edge the
Roble Sponsors 18-16 in the last
minute of play.
The previous six weeks had
seen round-robin play among six
teams: Roble, Mirlo, Eucalypto,
Stillman, Roble Sponsors, and
Gavilandra.
In intercollegiate action, the
Stanford Women's basketball
All-Stars were defeated by Cali
fornia 51-21 Tuesday afternoon.

ford athletic endeavors was a

BASEBALL
The Indian baseball team only
managed three hits against USF
Tuesday, but they made the
i

most of them defeating the
Dons, 3-0.
Two of the hits were home
runs which accounted for all
three of Stanford's runs. One
home run would have been
enough, however as three Tribe
pitchers shut out USF on three
widely scattered hits. Rod Po
teete picked up the win.
With two out in the third,
pitcher Daro Quiring got aboard
on an error by the third base
man. Frank Duffy came to the
plate and let the count get to
3-1. He then knocked a high fast
ball over the fence in left half
way up on the bank in Sunken
Diamond.
Two For Two
Dick Swan followed suit in the
fourth. Swan was the first man
up and he hit the first pitch over
the same part of the left field
fence for Stanford's third run.
Swan also hit a home run in
Saturday's contest with Sacra
mento State.
Quiring pitched the first three
frames and the only hit off of
him was a cue ball hit by the
lead off batter. The ball took a
couple of odd hops and wound
up behind third for a single. In
his last inning, the third, Quir
ing struck out the side.
Don Rose threw the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings for the In
dians. He also suffered a fate
similar to Quiring's. The first
batter he faced looped a single
over first base, but Rose got out
of trouble easily. He struck out
four men.
No Trouble
Rod Poteete handled the last
three innings with enviable ease
striking out four and allowing
only one man to get as far as
first.
This weekend the Indians play
a home and home series with
tough Santa Clara.
Friday Stanford travels to
Santa Clara for a 3 p.m. game.
Saturday afternoon the Broncos
will invade Sunken Diamond at
2 p.m. Winter Sports Schedules
have the Saturday game set for
3 p.m., but it has been changed
to 2 p.m.
BOXING
Though represented in only
two of the thirteen-match card
at the Eleventh Annual Navy
Collegiate Boxing Festival, Stan
ford was well represented in
Tuesday night's bouts at Mare
Island Naval Base.
Dave Hibbitts scored well

throughout his match at 145
with Donald Krible of Mare Is
land. He opened up in the third
round of his bout with an im
presive series of jabs and hooks.
The weakened Navy opponent
was fading fast as Hibbitts won
the third round and the decision
going away.
Moffett AU The Way
Against Marian Jones of the
Hunter's Point Naval Installa
tion, Gene Moffett had actually
little chance to show his mettale.
Moffett, in his first match ever,
staggered his opponent with a
left in the opening seconds.
It began to be clear that the
bout was Moffett's all the way,
if only he could catch his be
leaguered opponent long enough
to floor him.
This took 52 seconds with the
referee stopping the bout with
Jones down in the middle of the
ring.
Two other Stanford boxers
were slated to see action in the
popular festival, attended this
year by a standing room crowd
of over a thousand.

However, no suitable opponent
in Tom Steiner's division, 172,
was entered; and Bill Thomas,
147, had suffered an injured
hand in a Monday workout.
Most of Coach Ray Lunny's
time between Stanford bouts at
the meet was spent in sizing up
the entrants from Chico State
College.
Next — Chico State
Stanford will face Chico State
in the final dual meet of the sea
son this Saturday night in Chico.
Stanford is 2-2 for the dual
meet season and will travel to
Chico with high hopes and a full
contingent of boxers.
LACROSSE
Stanford's lacrossmen kick off
the official Northern California
Association season Saturday,
hosting the University of Cali
fornia in the first game of the
annual home and home series in
the battle for the Aberchrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick Trophy.

The winner of the trophy each
year Is decided on the basis of
the total scores of the ancient
rivals in the two games.
After tying the Bears 3-3 up
at Berkeley last year the In
dians smothered them 11-0 on
their visit to the farm to wrest
from them not only the game
trophy but also the Pacific Coast
Collegiate Championship.
The real question mark in the
Indian alignment lies in the mid
field.
If the midfleld jells Saturday
and meshes with the attack,
Berkeley will find the going
rough. Otherwise, they will have
to beat a victory out of the
Bears, relying on their solid de
fense.
WRESTLING
Stanford's wrestling team has
an important opportunity to
measure its progress this season
when it journeys to UCLA to
morrow for the AAWU cham
pionships. Coach Jerry Hudzik
plans to enter seven wrestlers.
They are: John Tam at 115

pounds, Gerry Beaudoin at 137,
Brian Smith at 145, Captain Len
Borchers at 152, Doug Gunesch
at 160, Burt Ambler at 167, Bud
Hollingbery at 177, and Terry
Crenshaw at 191.
Borchers: Best Shot
Budzik feels that his two best
chances for conference titles lie
with Borchers and Crenshaw.
Borchers, undefeated in all
competition throughout the
year, will have to face last
year's 152 pound champ, Lee
Ehrler, at some point in the
competition.
Crenshaw, who has been
wrestling heavyweight during
the season, will drop down to a
very difficult 191 pound class
that contains Bob Beuhler, who
earlier this year defeated Cren
shaw 6-5, and Don Kauffman of
Oregon State.
UCLA vs Oregwn State
The contest for tournament
first place is hard to peg this
year because the two top teams,

Oregon State and UCLA, did not
face each other in dual meet
competition.
Stanford appears to have an
outside chance at a third place
in the eight team tournament.
Despite poor season records,
• Doug Gunesch, Burt Amb
ler, and Bud Hollingbery were
never far from their opponents
and "good days" may earn them
places.
GYMNASTICS
Stanford's gymnasts take on
San Francisco State tonight at
7:30 in Encina Gym in their last
meet of the season.
The Cards, who are hoping for
a victory to give them a winning
6-5 season, will still be operating
without the services of all
around man Jim Petersen. He
aggravated his wrist injury last
week in San Jose and as a result
hasn't worked out this week.
Petersen Will Go In Three
Petersen will work a short
ened high bar routine and also
in the rings and floor exercise.
His injury hurts the team main
ly in the long horse and also in
limiting him in the high bar.
John Rinderknecht, John
Marks and Jim Snyder have
jelled into a strong parallel bar
team. The rings team has also
come along well.
Marks has been the team
leader and has consistently
score in the high B's recently.
Jim Napoleon, who joined the
team at mid-season, has im
proved each week and has bol
stered the ring squad.
Other bright spots for the
Indians have been the return
of Jim Snyder to the long horse
and parallel bars after an in
jury, John Rinderknecht's im
provement on the high bar and
Brad Pearson's improvement of
one whole point in his floor ex
ercise routine.

Borchers at 152, Doug Gunesch
at 160, Burt Ambler at 167, Bud
Hollingbery at 177, and Terry
Crenshaw at 191.
Borchers: Best Shot
Budzik feels that his two best
chances for conference titles lie
with Borchers and Crenshaw.
Borchers, undefeated in all
competition throughout the
year, will have to face last
year's 152 pound champ, Lee
Ehrler, at some point in the
competition.
Crenshaw, who has been
wrestling heavyweight during
the season, will drop down to a
very difficult 191 pound class
that contains Bob Beuhler, who
earlier this year defeated Cren
shaw 6-5, and Don Kauffman of
Oregon State.
UCLA vs Oregwn State
The contest for tournament
first place is hard to peg this
year because the two top teams,

Oregon State and UCLA, did not
face each other in dual meet
competition.
Stanford appears to have an
outside chance at a third place
in the eight team tournament.
Despite poor season records,
• Doug Gunesch, Burt Amb
ler, and Bud Hollingbery were
never far from their opponents
and "good days" may earn them
places.
GYMNASTICS
Stanford's gymnasts take on
San Francisco State tonight at
7:30 in Encina Gym in their last
meet of the season.
The Cards, who are hoping for
a victory to give them a winning
6-5 season, will still be operating
without the services of all
around man Jim Petersen. He
aggravated his wrist injury last
week in San Jose and as a result
hasn't worked out this week.
Petersen Will Go In Three
Petersen will work a short
ened high bar routine and also
in the rings and floor exercise.
His injury hurts the team main
ly in the long horse and also in
limiting him in the high bar.
John Rinderknecht, John
Marks and Jim Snyder have
jelled into a strong parallel bar
team. The rings team has also
come along well.
Marks has been the team
leader and has consistently
score in the high B's recently.
Jim Napoleon, who joined the
team at mid-season, has im
proved each week and has bol
stered the ring squad.
Other bright spots for the
Indians have been the return
of Jim Snyder to the long horse
and parallel bars after an in
jury, John Rinderknecht's im
provement on the high bar and
Brad Pearson's improvement of
one whole point in his floor ex
ercise routine.

RUGBY
Riding an eight-point lead the
Stanford Rugby team will at
tempt to wrest the Big Game
Scrum Axe from the California
Bears for the first time in three
years tomorrow at 1:30 on the
Stanford home field.
Stanford won the first game
of the annual home-and-home
series at Berkeley last week, 22-
14.
The victory ran Stanford's
season record to 7-0-1, with the
only non-victory being a 12-12
tie with USC.
The Kieldng Game
Last week's game could have
been termed a battle of the toes
as, despite the horrendous play
ing conditions of the muddy Cal
stadium, Stanford's Mike Grace
outpointed Cal's Randy Thaman
13-8 in the kicking scoring.
Though once again this week
kicking may prove decisive, the
Stanford Rugby field's condition
is fast and the playing surface
is wider than that at Cal. Both
factors should help the Stanford
backfield.
In the scrum, Stanford will be
without the services of Blaine
Nye. Nye, a key figure in Stan
ford's front line scrum, was in
jured in last week's match and
will not play.
Nye Leaves a Gap
Other strong scrum men such
as Joel Neal, Eric De Gooyer,
and Peter Hogg will have to
take up the slack in the scrums,
while Gene Moffett and Tim Wil
son hope to take Cal's measure
in the lineouts.
Besides Grace, other scoring
threats for Stanford are Bob
Blunt, Dick Ragsdale and Bob
Newberry.
Blunt and Ragsdale are both
speedy and always threats to go
all the way. Newberry, after a
slow start this season, has now
scored in each of the last three
games.
Two previously injured rug
gers, Frank Pattitucci and Eric
Sutcliffe, may return to action
this week, though their playing
status was still a question mark
yesterday afternoon.
FENCING
Stanford will host the Men's
Western Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships today and to
morrow.
Competition will be from 9:00
a.m. to 6:00 on both days and
will take place in the Women's
gym-
There will be three types of
events. Sabre events will be
fenced with standard equip
ment, while the exciting Foil
and Epee events will be scored
with electric equipment.
Admission is free and the host
team, the Stanford Fencing
Club, invites all interested to
come and observe fencing at its
agile and sometimes swash
buckling best.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Eucalypto house has won the
women's intramural basketball
crown for the 1967 season.
Tuesday's final game saw the
Eucalypto roundballers edge the
Roble Sponsors 18-16 in the last
minute of play.
The previous six weeks had
seen round-robin play among six
teams: Roble, Mirlo, Eucalypto,
Stillman, Roble Sponsors, and
Gavilandra.
In intercollegiate action, the
Stanford Women's basketball
All-Stars were defeated by Cali
fornia 51-21 Tuesday afternoon.

BASEBALL
The Indian baseball team only
managed three hits against USF
Tuesday, but they made the
i

most of them defeating the
Dons, 3-0.
Two of the hits were home
runs which accounted for all
three of Stanford's runs. One
home run would have been
enough, however as three Tribe
pitchers shut out USF on three
widely scattered hits. Rod Po
teete picked up the win.
With two out in the third,
pitcher Daro Quiring got aboard
on an error by the third base
man. Frank Duffy came to the
plate and let the count get to
3-1. He then knocked a high fast
ball over the fence in left half
way up on the bank in Sunken
Diamond.
Two For Two
Dick Swan followed suit in the
fourth. Swan was the first man
up and he hit the first pitch over
the same part of the left field
fence for Stanford's third run.
Swan also hit a home run in
Saturday's contest with Sacra
mento State.
Quiring pitched the first three
frames and the only hit off of
him was a cue ball hit by the
lead off batter. The ball took a
couple of odd hops and wound
up behind third for a single. In
his last inning, the third, Quir
ing struck out the side.
Don Rose threw the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings for the In
dians. He also suffered a fate
similar to Quiring's. The first
batter he faced looped a single
over first base, but Rose got out
of trouble easily. He struck out
four men.
No Trouble
Rod Poteete handled the last
three innings with enviable ease
striking out four and allowing
only one man to get as far as
first.
This weekend the Indians play
a home and home series with
tough Santa Clara.
Friday Stanford travels to
Santa Clara for a 3 p.m. game.
Saturday afternoon the Broncos
will invade Sunken Diamond at
2 p.m. Winter Sports Schedules
have the Saturday game set for
3 p.m., but it has been changed
to 2 p.m.
BOXING
Though represented in only
two of the thirteen-match card
at the Eleventh Annual Navy
Collegiate Boxing Festival, Stan
ford was well represented in
Tuesday night's bouts at Mare
Island Naval Base.
Dave Hibbitts scored well

throughout his match at 145
with Donald Krible of Mare Is
land. He opened up in the third
round of his bout with an im
presive series of jabs and hooks.
The weakened Navy opponent
was fading fast as Hibbitts won
the third round and the decision
going away.
Moffett AU The Way
Against Marian Jones of the
Hunter's Point Naval Installa
tion, Gene Moffett had actually
little chance to show his mettale.
Moffett, in his first match ever,
staggered his opponent with a
left in the opening seconds.
It began to be clear that the
bout was Moffett's all the way,
if only he could catch his be
leaguered opponent long enough
to floor him.
This took 52 seconds with the
referee stopping the bout with
Jones down in the middle of the
ring.
Two other Stanford boxers
were slated to see action in the
popular festival, attended this
year by a standing room crowd
of over a thousand.

However, no suitable opponent
in Tom Steiner's division, 172,
was entered; and Bill Thomas,
147, had suffered an injured
hand in a Monday workout.
Most of Coach Ray Lunny's
time between Stanford bouts at
the meet was spent in sizing up
the entrants from Chico State
College.
Next — Chico State
Stanford will face Chico State
in the final dual meet of the sea
son this Saturday night in Chico.
Stanford is 2-2 for the dual
meet season and will travel to
Chico with high hopes and a full
contingent of boxers.
LACROSSE
Stanford's lacrossmen kick off
the official Northern California
Association season Saturday,
hosting the University of Cali
fornia in the first game of the
annual home and home series in
the battle for the Aberchrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick Trophy.

The winner of the trophy each
year Is decided on the basis of
the total scores of the ancient
rivals in the two games.
After tying the Bears 3-3 up
at Berkeley last year the In
dians smothered them 11-0 on
their visit to the farm to wrest
from them not only the game
trophy but also the Pacific Coast
Collegiate Championship.
The real question mark in the
Indian alignment lies in the mid
field.
If the midfleld jells Saturday
and meshes with the attack,
Berkeley will find the going
rough. Otherwise, they will have
to beat a victory out of the
Bears, relying on their solid de
fense.
WRESTLING
Stanford's wrestling team has
an important opportunity to
measure its progress this season
when it journeys to UCLA to
morrow for the AAWU cham
pionships. Coach Jerry Hudzik
plans to enter seven wrestlers.
They are: John Tam at 115

pounds, Gerry Beaudoin at 137,
Brian Smith at 145, Captain Len
Borchers at 152, Doug Gunesch
at 160, Burt Ambler at 167, Bud

the third round and the decision
going away.
Moffett AU The Way
Against Marian Jones of the
Hunter's Point Naval Installa
tion, Gene Moffett had actually
little chance to show his mettale.
Moffett, in his first match ever,
staggered his opponent with a
left in the opening seconds.
It began to be clear that the
bout was Moffett's all the way,
if only he could catch his be
leaguered opponent long enough
to floor him.
This took 52 seconds with the
referee stopping the bout with
Jones down in the middle of the
ring.
Two other Stanford boxers
were slated to see action in the
popular festival, attended this
year by a standing room crowd
of over a thousand.

However, no suitable opponent
in Tom Steiner's division, 172,
was entered; and Bill Thomas,
147, had suffered an injured
hand in a Monday workout.
Most of Coach Ray Lunny's
time between Stanford bouts at
the meet was spent in sizing up
the entrants from Chico State
College.
Next — Chico State
Stanford will face Chico State
in the final dual meet of the sea
son this Saturday night in Chico.
Stanford is 2-2 for the dual
meet season and will travel to
Chico with high hopes and a full
contingent of boxers.
LACROSSE
Stanford's lacrossmen kick off
the official Northern California
Association season Saturday,
hosting the University of Cali
fornia in the first game of the
annual home and home series in
the battle for the Aberchrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick Trophy.

The winner of the trophy each
year Is decided on the basis of
the total scores of the ancient
rivals in the two games.
After tying the Bears 3-3 up
at Berkeley last year the In
dians smothered them 11-0 on
their visit to the farm to wrest
from them not only the game
trophy but also the Pacific Coast
Collegiate Championship.
The real question mark in the
Indian alignment lies in the mid
field.
If the midfleld jells Saturday
and meshes with the attack,
Berkeley will find the going
rough. Otherwise, they will have
to beat a victory out of the
Bears, relying on their solid de
fense.
WRESTLING
Stanford's wrestling team has
an important opportunity to
measure its progress this season
when it journeys to UCLA to
morrow for the AAWU cham
pionships. Coach Jerry Hudzik
plans to enter seven wrestlers.
They are: John Tam at 115

pounds, Gerry Beaudoin at 137,
Brian Smith at 145, Captain Len
Borchers at 152, Doug Gunesch
at 160, Burt Ambler at 167, Bud
Hollingbery at 177, and Terry
Crenshaw at 191.
Borchers: Best Shot
Budzik feels that his two best
chances for conference titles lie
with Borchers and Crenshaw.
Borchers, undefeated in all
competition throughout the
year, will have to face last
year's 152 pound champ, Lee
Ehrler, at some point in the
competition.
Crenshaw, who has been
wrestling heavyweight during
the season, will drop down to a
very difficult 191 pound class
that contains Bob Beuhler, who
earlier this year defeated Cren
shaw 6-5, and Don Kauffman of
Oregon State.
UCLA vs Oregwn State
The contest for tournament
first place is hard to peg this
year because the two top teams,

Oregon State and UCLA, did not
face each other in dual meet
competition.
Stanford appears to have an
outside chance at a third place
in the eight team tournament.
Despite poor season records,
• Doug Gunesch, Burt Amb
ler, and Bud Hollingbery were
never far from their opponents
and "good days" may earn them
places.
GYMNASTICS
Stanford's gymnasts take on
San Francisco State tonight at
7:30 in Encina Gym in their last
meet of the season.
The Cards, who are hoping for
a victory to give them a winning
6-5 season, will still be operating
without the services of all
around man Jim Petersen. He
aggravated his wrist injury last
week in San Jose and as a result
hasn't worked out this week.
Petersen Will Go In Three
Petersen will work a short
ened high bar routine and also
in the rings and floor exercise.
His injury hurts the team main
ly in the long horse and also in
limiting him in the high bar.
John Rinderknecht, John
Marks and Jim Snyder have
jelled into a strong parallel bar
team. The rings team has also
come along well.
Marks has been the team
leader and has consistently
score in the high B's recently.
Jim Napoleon, who joined the
team at mid-season, has im
proved each week and has bol
stered the ring squad.
Other bright spots for the
Indians have been the return
of Jim Snyder to the long horse
and parallel bars after an in
jury, John Rinderknecht's im
provement on the high bar and
Brad Pearson's improvement of
one whole point in his floor ex
ercise routine.

RUGBY
Riding an eight-point lead the
Stanford Rugby team will at
tempt to wrest the Big Game
Scrum Axe from the California
Bears for the first time in three
years tomorrow at 1:30 on the
Stanford home field.
Stanford won the first game
of the annual home-and-home
series at Berkeley last week, 22-
14.
The victory ran Stanford's
season record to 7-0-1, with the
only non-victory being a 12-12
tie with USC.
The Kieldng Game
Last week's game could have
been termed a battle of the toes
as, despite the horrendous play
ing conditions of the muddy Cal
stadium, Stanford's Mike Grace
outpointed Cal's Randy Thaman
13-8 in the kicking scoring.
Though once again this week
kicking may prove decisive, the
Stanford Rugby field's condition
is fast and the playing surface
is wider than that at Cal. Both
factors should help the Stanford
backfield.
In the scrum, Stanford will be
without the services of Blaine
Nye. Nye, a key figure in Stan
ford's front line scrum, was in
jured in last week's match and
will not play.
Nye Leaves a Gap
Other strong scrum men such
as Joel Neal, Eric De Gooyer,
and Peter Hogg will have to
take up the slack in the scrums,
while Gene Moffett and Tim Wil
son hope to take Cal's measure
in the lineouts.
Besides Grace, other scoring
threats for Stanford are Bob
Blunt, Dick Ragsdale and Bob
Newberry.
Blunt and Ragsdale are both
speedy and always threats to go
all the way. Newberry, after a
slow start this season, has now
scored in each of the last three
games.
Two previously injured rug
gers, Frank Pattitucci and Eric
Sutcliffe, may return to action
this week, though their playing
status was still a question mark
yesterday afternoon.
FENCING
Stanford will host the Men's
Western Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships today and to
morrow.
Competition will be from 9:00
a.m. to 6:00 on both days and
will take place in the Women's
gym-
There will be three types of
events. Sabre events will be
fenced with standard equip
ment, while the exciting Foil
and Epee events will be scored
with electric equipment.
Admission is free and the host
team, the Stanford Fencing
Club, invites all interested to
come and observe fencing at its
agile and sometimes swash
buckling best.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Eucalypto house has won the
women's intramural basketball
crown for the 1967 season.
Tuesday's final game saw the
Eucalypto roundballers edge the
Roble Sponsors 18-16 in the last
minute of play.
The previous six weeks had
seen round-robin play among six
teams: Roble, Mirlo, Eucalypto,
Stillman, Roble Sponsors, and
Gavilandra.
In intercollegiate action, the
Stanford Women's basketball
All-Stars were defeated by Cali
fornia 51-21 Tuesday afternoon.

BASEBALL
The Indian baseball team only
managed three hits against USF
Tuesday, but they made the
i

most of them defeating the
Dons, 3-0.
Two of the hits were home
runs which accounted for all
three of Stanford's runs. One
home run would have been
enough, however as three Tribe
pitchers shut out USF on three
widely scattered hits. Rod Po
teete picked up the win.
With two out in the third,
pitcher Daro Quiring got aboard
on an error by the third base
man. Frank Duffy came to the
plate and let the count get to
3-1. He then knocked a high fast
ball over the fence in left half
way up on the bank in Sunken
Diamond.
Two For Two
Dick Swan followed suit in the
fourth. Swan was the first man
up and he hit the first pitch over
the same part of the left field
fence for Stanford's third run.
Swan also hit a home run in
Saturday's contest with Sacra
mento State.
Quiring pitched the first three
frames and the only hit off of
him was a cue ball hit by the
lead off batter. The ball took a
couple of odd hops and wound
up behind third for a single. In
his last inning, the third, Quir
ing struck out the side.
Don Rose threw the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings for the In
dians. He also suffered a fate
similar to Quiring's. The first
batter he faced looped a single
over first base, but Rose got out
of trouble easily. He struck out
four men.
No Trouble
Rod Poteete handled the last
three innings with enviable ease
striking out four and allowing
only one man to get as far as
first.
This weekend the Indians play
a home and home series with
tough Santa Clara.
Friday Stanford travels to
Santa Clara for a 3 p.m. game.
Saturday afternoon the Broncos
will invade Sunken Diamond at
2 p.m. Winter Sports Schedules
have the Saturday game set for
3 p.m., but it has been changed
to 2 p.m.
BOXING
Though represented in only
two of the thirteen-match card
at the Eleventh Annual Navy
Collegiate Boxing Festival, Stan
ford was well represented in
Tuesday night's bouts at Mare
Island Naval Base.
Dave Hibbitts scored well

throughout his match at 145
with Donald Krible of Mare Is
land. He opened up in the third
round of his bout with an im
presive series of jabs and hooks.
The weakened Navy opponent
was fading fast as Hibbitts won
the third round and the decision
going away.

BASEBALL
The Indian baseball team only
managed three hits against USF
Tuesday, but they made the
i

most of them defeating the
Dons, 3-0.
Two of the hits were home
runs which accounted for all
three of Stanford's runs. One
home run would have been
enough, however as three Tribe
pitchers shut out USF on three
widely scattered hits. Rod Po
teete picked up the win.
With two out in the third,
pitcher Daro Quiring got aboard
on an error by the third base
man. Frank Duffy came to the
plate and let the count get to
3-1. He then knocked a high fast
ball over the fence in left half
way up on the bank in Sunken
Diamond.
Two For Two
Dick Swan followed suit in the
fourth. Swan was the first man
up and he hit the first pitch over
the same part of the left field
fence for Stanford's third run.
Swan also hit a home run in
Saturday's contest with Sacra
mento State.
Quiring pitched the first three
frames and the only hit off of
him was a cue ball hit by the
lead off batter. The ball took a
couple of odd hops and wound
up behind third for a single. In
his last inning, the third, Quir
ing struck out the side.
Don Rose threw the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings for the In
dians. He also suffered a fate
similar to Quiring's. The first
batter he faced looped a single
over first base, but Rose got out
of trouble easily. He struck out
four men.
No Trouble
Rod Poteete handled the last
three innings with enviable ease
striking out four and allowing
only one man to get as far as
first.
This weekend the Indians play
a home and home series with
tough Santa Clara.
Friday Stanford travels to
Santa Clara for a 3 p.m. game.
Saturday afternoon the Broncos
will invade Sunken Diamond at
2 p.m. Winter Sports Schedules
have the Saturday game set for
3 p.m., but it has been changed
to 2 p.m.
BOXING
Though represented in only
two of the thirteen-match card
at the Eleventh Annual Navy
Collegiate Boxing Festival, Stan
ford was well represented in
Tuesday night's bouts at Mare
Island Naval Base.
Dave Hibbitts scored well

throughout his match at 145
with Donald Krible of Mare Is
land. He opened up in the third
round of his bout with an im
presive series of jabs and hooks.
The weakened Navy opponent
was fading fast as Hibbitts won
the third round and the decision
going away.
Moffett AU The Way
Against Marian Jones of the
Hunter's Point Naval Installa
tion, Gene Moffett had actually
little chance to show his mettale.
Moffett, in his first match ever,
staggered his opponent with a
left in the opening seconds.
It began to be clear that the
bout was Moffett's all the way,
if only he could catch his be
leaguered opponent long enough
to floor him.
This took 52 seconds with the
referee stopping the bout with
Jones down in the middle of the
ring.
Two other Stanford boxers
were slated to see action in the
popular festival, attended this
year by a standing room crowd
of over a thousand.

However, no suitable opponent
in Tom Steiner's division, 172,
was entered; and Bill Thomas,
147, had suffered an injured
hand in a Monday workout.
Most of Coach Ray Lunny's
time between Stanford bouts at
the meet was spent in sizing up
the entrants from Chico State
College.
Next — Chico State
Stanford will face Chico State
in the final dual meet of the sea
son this Saturday night in Chico.
Stanford is 2-2 for the dual
meet season and will travel to
Chico with high hopes and a full
contingent of boxers.
LACROSSE
Stanford's lacrossmen kick off
the official Northern California
Association season Saturday,
hosting the University of Cali
fornia in the first game of the
annual home and home series in
the battle for the Aberchrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick Trophy.

The winner of the trophy each
year Is decided on the basis of
the total scores of the ancient
rivals in the two games.
After tying the Bears 3-3 up
at Berkeley last year the In
dians smothered them 11-0 on
their visit to the farm to wrest
from them not only the game
trophy but also the Pacific Coast
Collegiate Championship.
The real question mark in the
Indian alignment lies in the mid
field.
If the midfleld jells Saturday
and meshes with the attack,
Berkeley will find the going
rough. Otherwise, they will have
to beat a victory out of the
Bears, relying on their solid de
fense.
WRESTLING
Stanford's wrestling team has
an important opportunity to
measure its progress this season
when it journeys to UCLA to
morrow for the AAWU cham
pionships. Coach Jerry Hudzik
plans to enter seven wrestlers.
They are: John Tam at 115

pounds, Gerry Beaudoin at 137,
Brian Smith at 145, Captain Len
Borchers at 152, Doug Gunesch
at 160, Burt Ambler at 167, Bud
Hollingbery at 177, and Terry
Crenshaw at 191.
Borchers: Best Shot
Budzik feels that his two best
chances for conference titles lie
with Borchers and Crenshaw.
Borchers, undefeated in all
competition throughout the
year, will have to face last
year's 152 pound champ, Lee
Ehrler, at some point in the
competition.
Crenshaw, who has been
wrestling heavyweight during
the season, will drop down to a
very difficult 191 pound class
that contains Bob Beuhler, who
earlier this year defeated Cren
shaw 6-5, and Don Kauffman of
Oregon State.
UCLA vs Oregwn State
The contest for tournament
first place is hard to peg this
year because the two top teams,

Oregon State and UCLA, did not
face each other in dual meet
competition.
Stanford appears to have an
outside chance at a third place
in the eight team tournament.
Despite poor season records,
• Doug Gunesch, Burt Amb
ler, and Bud Hollingbery were
never far from their opponents
and "good days" may earn them
places.
GYMNASTICS
Stanford's gymnasts take on
San Francisco State tonight at
7:30 in Encina Gym in their last
meet of the season.
The Cards, who are hoping for
a victory to give them a winning
6-5 season, will still be operating
without the services of all
around man Jim Petersen. He
aggravated his wrist injury last
week in San Jose and as a result
hasn't worked out this week.
Petersen Will Go In Three
Petersen will work a short
ened high bar routine and also
in the rings and floor exercise.
His injury hurts the team main
ly in the long horse and also in
limiting him in the high bar.
John Rinderknecht, John
Marks and Jim Snyder have
jelled into a strong parallel bar
team. The rings team has also
come along well.
Marks has been the team
leader and has consistently
score in the high B's recently.
Jim Napoleon, who joined the
team at mid-season, has im
proved each week and has bol
stered the ring squad.
Other bright spots for the
Indians have been the return
of Jim Snyder to the long horse
and parallel bars after an in
jury, John Rinderknecht's im
provement on the high bar and
Brad Pearson's improvement of
one whole point in his floor ex
ercise routine.

RUGBY
Riding an eight-point lead the
Stanford Rugby team will at
tempt to wrest the Big Game
Scrum Axe from the California
Bears for the first time in three
years tomorrow at 1:30 on the
Stanford home field.
Stanford won the first game
of the annual home-and-home
series at Berkeley last week, 22-
14.
The victory ran Stanford's
season record to 7-0-1, with the
only non-victory being a 12-12
tie with USC.
The Kieldng Game
Last week's game could have
been termed a battle of the toes
as, despite the horrendous play
ing conditions of the muddy Cal
stadium, Stanford's Mike Grace
outpointed Cal's Randy Thaman
13-8 in the kicking scoring.
Though once again this week
kicking may prove decisive, the
Stanford Rugby field's condition
is fast and the playing surface
is wider than that at Cal. Both
factors should help the Stanford
backfield.
In the scrum, Stanford will be
without the services of Blaine
Nye. Nye, a key figure in Stan
ford's front line scrum, was in
jured in last week's match and
will not play.
Nye Leaves a Gap
Other strong scrum men such
as Joel Neal, Eric De Gooyer,
and Peter Hogg will have to
take up the slack in the scrums,
while Gene Moffett and Tim Wil
son hope to take Cal's measure
in the lineouts.
Besides Grace, other scoring
threats for Stanford are Bob
Blunt, Dick Ragsdale and Bob
Newberry.
Blunt and Ragsdale are both
speedy and always threats to go
all the way. Newberry, after a
slow start this season, has now
scored in each of the last three
games.
Two previously injured rug
gers, Frank Pattitucci and Eric
Sutcliffe, may return to action
this week, though their playing
status was still a question mark
yesterday afternoon.
FENCING
Stanford will host the Men's
Western Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships today and to
morrow.
Competition will be from 9:00
a.m. to 6:00 on both days and
will take place in the Women's
gym-
There will be three types of
events. Sabre events will be
fenced with standard equip
ment, while the exciting Foil
and Epee events will be scored
with electric equipment.
Admission is free and the host
team, the Stanford Fencing
Club, invites all interested to
come and observe fencing at its
agile and sometimes swash
buckling best.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Eucalypto house has won the
women's intramural basketball
crown for the 1967 season.
Tuesday's final game saw the
Eucalypto roundballers edge the
Roble Sponsors 18-16 in the last
minute of play.
The previous six weeks had
seen round-robin play among six
teams: Roble, Mirlo, Eucalypto,
Stillman, Roble Sponsors, and
Gavilandra.
In intercollegiate action, the
Stanford Women's basketball
All-Stars were defeated by Cali
fornia 51-21 Tuesday afternoon.

is wider than that at Cal. Both
factors should help the Stanford
backfield.
In the scrum, Stanford will be
without the services of Blaine
Nye. Nye, a key figure in Stan
ford's front line scrum, was in
jured in last week's match and
will not play.
Nye Leaves a Gap
Other strong scrum men such
as Joel Neal, Eric De Gooyer,
and Peter Hogg will have to
take up the slack in the scrums,
while Gene Moffett and Tim Wil
son hope to take Cal's measure
in the lineouts.
Besides Grace, other scoring
threats for Stanford are Bob
Blunt, Dick Ragsdale and Bob
Newberry.
Blunt and Ragsdale are both
speedy and always threats to go
all the way. Newberry, after a
slow start this season, has now
scored in each of the last three
games.
Two previously injured rug
gers, Frank Pattitucci and Eric
Sutcliffe, may return to action
this week, though their playing
status was still a question mark
yesterday afternoon.
FENCING
Stanford will host the Men's
Western Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships today and to
morrow.
Competition will be from 9:00
a.m. to 6:00 on both days and
will take place in the Women's
gym-
There will be three types of
events. Sabre events will be
fenced with standard equip
ment, while the exciting Foil
and Epee events will be scored
with electric equipment.
Admission is free and the host
team, the Stanford Fencing
Club, invites all interested to
come and observe fencing at its
agile and sometimes swash
buckling best.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Eucalypto house has won the
women's intramural basketball
crown for the 1967 season.
Tuesday's final game saw the
Eucalypto roundballers edge the
Roble Sponsors 18-16 in the last
minute of play.
The previous six weeks had
seen round-robin play among six
teams: Roble, Mirlo, Eucalypto,
Stillman, Roble Sponsors, and
Gavilandra.
In intercollegiate action, the
Stanford Women's basketball
All-Stars were defeated by Cali
fornia 51-21 Tuesday afternoon.

BASEBALL
The Indian baseball team only
managed three hits against USF
Tuesday, but they made the
i

most of them defeating the
Dons, 3-0.
Two of the hits were home
runs which accounted for all
three of Stanford's runs. One
home run would have been
enough, however as three Tribe
pitchers shut out USF on three
widely scattered hits. Rod Po
teete picked up the win.
With two out in the third,
pitcher Daro Quiring got aboard
on an error by the third base
man. Frank Duffy came to the
plate and let the count get to
3-1. He then knocked a high fast
ball over the fence in left half
way up on the bank in Sunken
Diamond.
Two For Two
Dick Swan followed suit in the
fourth. Swan was the first man
up and he hit the first pitch over
the same part of the left field
fence for Stanford's third run.
Swan also hit a home run in
Saturday's contest with Sacra
mento State.
Quiring pitched the first three
frames and the only hit off of
him was a cue ball hit by the
lead off batter. The ball took a
couple of odd hops and wound
up behind third for a single. In
his last inning, the third, Quir
ing struck out the side.
Don Rose threw the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings for the In
dians. He also suffered a fate
similar to Quiring's. The first
batter he faced looped a single
over first base, but Rose got out
of trouble easily. He struck out
four men.
No Trouble
Rod Poteete handled the last
three innings with enviable ease
striking out four and allowing
only one man to get as far as
first.
This weekend the Indians play
a home and home series with
tough Santa Clara.
Friday Stanford travels to
Santa Clara for a 3 p.m. game.
Saturday afternoon the Broncos
will invade Sunken Diamond at
2 p.m. Winter Sports Schedules
have the Saturday game set for
3 p.m., but it has been changed
to 2 p.m.
BOXING
Though represented in only
two of the thirteen-match card
at the Eleventh Annual Navy
Collegiate Boxing Festival, Stan
ford was well represented in
Tuesday night's bouts at Mare
Island Naval Base.
Dave Hibbitts scored well

throughout his match at 145
with Donald Krible of Mare Is
land. He opened up in the third
round of his bout with an im
presive series of jabs and hooks.
The weakened Navy opponent
was fading fast as Hibbitts won
the third round and the decision
going away.
Moffett AU The Way
Against Marian Jones of the
Hunter's Point Naval Installa
tion, Gene Moffett had actually
little chance to show his mettale.
Moffett, in his first match ever,
staggered his opponent with a
left in the opening seconds.
It began to be clear that the
bout was Moffett's all the way,
if only he could catch his be
leaguered opponent long enough
to floor him.
This took 52 seconds with the
referee stopping the bout with
Jones down in the middle of the
ring.
Two other Stanford boxers
were slated to see action in the
popular festival, attended this
year by a standing room crowd
of over a thousand.

However, no suitable opponent
in Tom Steiner's division, 172,
was entered; and Bill Thomas,
147, had suffered an injured
hand in a Monday workout.
Most of Coach Ray Lunny's
time between Stanford bouts at
the meet was spent in sizing up
the entrants from Chico State
College.
Next — Chico State
Stanford will face Chico State
in the final dual meet of the sea
son this Saturday night in Chico.
Stanford is 2-2 for the dual
meet season and will travel to
Chico with high hopes and a full
contingent of boxers.
LACROSSE
Stanford's lacrossmen kick off
the official Northern California
Association season Saturday,
hosting the University of Cali
fornia in the first game of the
annual home and home series in
the battle for the Aberchrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick Trophy.

The winner of the trophy each
year Is decided on the basis of
the total scores of the ancient
rivals in the two games.
After tying the Bears 3-3 up
at Berkeley last year the In
dians smothered them 11-0 on
their visit to the farm to wrest
from them not only the game
trophy but also the Pacific Coast
Collegiate Championship.
The real question mark in the
Indian alignment lies in the mid
field.
If the midfleld jells Saturday
and meshes with the attack,
Berkeley will find the going
rough. Otherwise, they will have
to beat a victory out of the
Bears, relying on their solid de
fense.
WRESTLING
Stanford's wrestling team has
an important opportunity to
measure its progress this season
when it journeys to UCLA to
morrow for the AAWU cham
pionships. Coach Jerry Hudzik
plans to enter seven wrestlers.
They are: John Tam at 115

pounds, Gerry Beaudoin at 137,
Brian Smith at 145, Captain Len
Borchers at 152, Doug Gunesch
at 160, Burt Ambler at 167, Bud
Hollingbery at 177, and Terry
Crenshaw at 191.
Borchers: Best Shot
Budzik feels that his two best
chances for conference titles lie
with Borchers and Crenshaw.
Borchers, undefeated in all
competition throughout the
year, will have to face last
year's 152 pound champ, Lee
Ehrler, at some point in the
competition.
Crenshaw, who has been
wrestling heavyweight during
the season, will drop down to a
very difficult 191 pound class
that contains Bob Beuhler, who
earlier this year defeated Cren
shaw 6-5, and Don Kauffman of
Oregon State.
UCLA vs Oregwn State
The contest for tournament
first place is hard to peg this
year because the two top teams,

Oregon State and UCLA, did not
face each other in dual meet
competition.
Stanford appears to have an
outside chance at a third place
in the eight team tournament.
Despite poor season records,
• Doug Gunesch, Burt Amb
ler, and Bud Hollingbery were
never far from their opponents
and "good days" may earn them
places.
GYMNASTICS
Stanford's gymnasts take on
San Francisco State tonight at
7:30 in Encina Gym in their last
meet of the season.
The Cards, who are hoping for
a victory to give them a winning
6-5 season, will still be operating
without the services of all
around man Jim Petersen. He
aggravated his wrist injury last
week in San Jose and as a result
hasn't worked out this week.
Petersen Will Go In Three
Petersen will work a short
ened high bar routine and also
in the rings and floor exercise.
His injury hurts the team main
ly in the long horse and also in
limiting him in the high bar.
John Rinderknecht, John
Marks and Jim Snyder have
jelled into a strong parallel bar
team. The rings team has also
come along well.
Marks has been the team
leader and has consistently
score in the high B's recently.
Jim Napoleon, who joined the
team at mid-season, has im
proved each week and has bol
stered the ring squad.
Other bright spots for the
Indians have been the return
of Jim Snyder to the long horse
and parallel bars after an in
jury, John Rinderknecht's im
provement on the high bar and
Brad Pearson's improvement of
one whole point in his floor ex
ercise routine.

RUGBY
Riding an eight-point lead the
Stanford Rugby team will at
tempt to wrest the Big Game
Scrum Axe from the California
Bears for the first time in three
years tomorrow at 1:30 on the
Stanford home field.
Stanford won the first game
of the annual home-and-home
series at Berkeley last week, 22-
14.
The victory ran Stanford's
season record to 7-0-1, with the
only non-victory being a 12-12
tie with USC.
The Kieldng Game
Last week's game could have
been termed a battle of the toes
as, despite the horrendous play
ing conditions of the muddy Cal
stadium, Stanford's Mike Grace
outpointed Cal's Randy Thaman
13-8 in the kicking scoring.
Though once again this week
kicking may prove decisive, the
Stanford Rugby field's condition
is fast and the playing surface
is wider than that at Cal. Both
factors should help the Stanford
backfield.
In the scrum, Stanford will be
without the services of Blaine
Nye. Nye, a key figure in Stan

competition.
Stanford appears to have an
outside chance at a third place
in the eight team tournament.
Despite poor season records,
• Doug Gunesch, Burt Amb
ler, and Bud Hollingbery were
never far from their opponents
and "good days" may earn them
places.
GYMNASTICS
Stanford's gymnasts take on
San Francisco State tonight at
7:30 in Encina Gym in their last
meet of the season.
The Cards, who are hoping for
a victory to give them a winning
6-5 season, will still be operating
without the services of all
around man Jim Petersen. He
aggravated his wrist injury last
week in San Jose and as a result
hasn't worked out this week.
Petersen Will Go In Three
Petersen will work a short
ened high bar routine and also
in the rings and floor exercise.
His injury hurts the team main
ly in the long horse and also in
limiting him in the high bar.
John Rinderknecht, John
Marks and Jim Snyder have
jelled into a strong parallel bar
team. The rings team has also
come along well.
Marks has been the team
leader and has consistently
score in the high B's recently.
Jim Napoleon, who joined the
team at mid-season, has im
proved each week and has bol
stered the ring squad.
Other bright spots for the
Indians have been the return
of Jim Snyder to the long horse
and parallel bars after an in
jury, John Rinderknecht's im
provement on the high bar and
Brad Pearson's improvement of
one whole point in his floor ex
ercise routine.

RUGBY
Riding an eight-point lead the
Stanford Rugby team will at
tempt to wrest the Big Game
Scrum Axe from the California
Bears for the first time in three
years tomorrow at 1:30 on the
Stanford home field.
Stanford won the first game
of the annual home-and-home
series at Berkeley last week, 22-
14.
The victory ran Stanford's
season record to 7-0-1, with the
only non-victory being a 12-12
tie with USC.
The Kieldng Game
Last week's game could have
been termed a battle of the toes
as, despite the horrendous play
ing conditions of the muddy Cal
stadium, Stanford's Mike Grace
outpointed Cal's Randy Thaman
13-8 in the kicking scoring.
Though once again this week
kicking may prove decisive, the
Stanford Rugby field's condition
is fast and the playing surface
is wider than that at Cal. Both
factors should help the Stanford
backfield.
In the scrum, Stanford will be
without the services of Blaine
Nye. Nye, a key figure in Stan
ford's front line scrum, was in
jured in last week's match and
will not play.
Nye Leaves a Gap
Other strong scrum men such
as Joel Neal, Eric De Gooyer,
and Peter Hogg will have to
take up the slack in the scrums,
while Gene Moffett and Tim Wil
son hope to take Cal's measure
in the lineouts.
Besides Grace, other scoring
threats for Stanford are Bob
Blunt, Dick Ragsdale and Bob
Newberry.
Blunt and Ragsdale are both
speedy and always threats to go
all the way. Newberry, after a
slow start this season, has now
scored in each of the last three
games.
Two previously injured rug
gers, Frank Pattitucci and Eric
Sutcliffe, may return to action
this week, though their playing
status was still a question mark
yesterday afternoon.
FENCING
Stanford will host the Men's
Western Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships today and to
morrow.
Competition will be from 9:00
a.m. to 6:00 on both days and
will take place in the Women's
gym-
There will be three types of
events. Sabre events will be
fenced with standard equip
ment, while the exciting Foil
and Epee events will be scored
with electric equipment.
Admission is free and the host
team, the Stanford Fencing
Club, invites all interested to
come and observe fencing at its
agile and sometimes swash
buckling best.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Eucalypto house has won the
women's intramural basketball
crown for the 1967 season.
Tuesday's final game saw the
Eucalypto roundballers edge the
Roble Sponsors 18-16 in the last
minute of play.
The previous six weeks had
seen round-robin play among six
teams: Roble, Mirlo, Eucalypto,
Stillman, Roble Sponsors, and
Gavilandra.
In intercollegiate action, the
Stanford Women's basketball
All-Stars were defeated by Cali
fornia 51-21 Tuesday afternoon.

ford athletic endeavors was a

BASEBALL
The Indian baseball team only
managed three hits against USF
Tuesday, but they made the
i

most of them defeating the
Dons, 3-0.
Two of the hits were home
runs which accounted for all
three of Stanford's runs. One
home run would have been
enough, however as three Tribe
pitchers shut out USF on three
widely scattered hits. Rod Po
teete picked up the win.
With two out in the third,
pitcher Daro Quiring got aboard
on an error by the third base
man. Frank Duffy came to the
plate and let the count get to
3-1. He then knocked a high fast
ball over the fence in left half
way up on the bank in Sunken
Diamond.
Two For Two
Dick Swan followed suit in the
fourth. Swan was the first man
up and he hit the first pitch over
the same part of the left field
fence for Stanford's third run.
Swan also hit a home run in
Saturday's contest with Sacra
mento State.
Quiring pitched the first three
frames and the only hit off of
him was a cue ball hit by the
lead off batter. The ball took a
couple of odd hops and wound
up behind third for a single. In
his last inning, the third, Quir
ing struck out the side.
Don Rose threw the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings for the In
dians. He also suffered a fate
similar to Quiring's. The first
batter he faced looped a single
over first base, but Rose got out
of trouble easily. He struck out
four men.
No Trouble
Rod Poteete handled the last
three innings with enviable ease
striking out four and allowing
only one man to get as far as
first.
This weekend the Indians play
a home and home series with
tough Santa Clara.
Friday Stanford travels to
Santa Clara for a 3 p.m. game.
Saturday afternoon the Broncos
will invade Sunken Diamond at
2 p.m. Winter Sports Schedules
have the Saturday game set for
3 p.m., but it has been changed
to 2 p.m.
BOXING
Though represented in only
two of the thirteen-match card
at the Eleventh Annual Navy
Collegiate Boxing Festival, Stan
ford was well represented in
Tuesday night's bouts at Mare
Island Naval Base.
Dave Hibbitts scored well

throughout his match at 145
with Donald Krible of Mare Is
land. He opened up in the third
round of his bout with an im
presive series of jabs and hooks.
The weakened Navy opponent
was fading fast as Hibbitts won
the third round and the decision
going away.
Moffett AU The Way
Against Marian Jones of the
Hunter's Point Naval Installa
tion, Gene Moffett had actually
little chance to show his mettale.
Moffett, in his first match ever,
staggered his opponent with a
left in the opening seconds.
It began to be clear that the
bout was Moffett's all the way,
if only he could catch his be
leaguered opponent long enough
to floor him.
This took 52 seconds with the
referee stopping the bout with
Jones down in the middle of the
ring.
Two other Stanford boxers
were slated to see action in the
popular festival, attended this
year by a standing room crowd
of over a thousand.

However, no suitable opponent
in Tom Steiner's division, 172,
was entered; and Bill Thomas,
147, had suffered an injured
hand in a Monday workout.
Most of Coach Ray Lunny's
time between Stanford bouts at
the meet was spent in sizing up
the entrants from Chico State
College.
Next — Chico State
Stanford will face Chico State
in the final dual meet of the sea
son this Saturday night in Chico.
Stanford is 2-2 for the dual
meet season and will travel to
Chico with high hopes and a full
contingent of boxers.
LACROSSE
Stanford's lacrossmen kick off
the official Northern California
Association season Saturday,
hosting the University of Cali
fornia in the first game of the
annual home and home series in
the battle for the Aberchrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick Trophy.

The winner of the trophy each
year Is decided on the basis of
the total scores of the ancient
rivals in the two games.
After tying the Bears 3-3 up
at Berkeley last year the In
dians smothered them 11-0 on
their visit to the farm to wrest
from them not only the game
trophy but also the Pacific Coast
Collegiate Championship.
The real question mark in the
Indian alignment lies in the mid
field.
If the midfleld jells Saturday
and meshes with the attack,
Berkeley will find the going
rough. Otherwise, they will have
to beat a victory out of the
Bears, relying on their solid de
fense.
WRESTLING
Stanford's wrestling team has
an important opportunity to
measure its progress this season
when it journeys to UCLA to
morrow for the AAWU cham
pionships. Coach Jerry Hudzik
plans to enter seven wrestlers.
They are: John Tam at 115

pounds, Gerry Beaudoin at 137,
Brian Smith at 145, Captain Len
Borchers at 152, Doug Gunesch
at 160, Burt Ambler at 167, Bud
Hollingbery at 177, and Terry
Crenshaw at 191.
Borchers: Best Shot
Budzik feels that his two best
chances for conference titles lie
with Borchers and Crenshaw.
Borchers, undefeated in all
competition throughout the
year, will have to face last
year's 152 pound champ, Lee
Ehrler, at some point in the
competition.
Crenshaw, who has been
wrestling heavyweight during
the season, will drop down to a
very difficult 191 pound class
that contains Bob Beuhler, who
earlier this year defeated Cren
shaw 6-5, and Don Kauffman of
Oregon State.
UCLA vs Oregwn State
The contest for tournament
first place is hard to peg this
year because the two top teams,

Oregon State and UCLA, did not
face each other in dual meet
competition.
Stanford appears to have an
outside chance at a third place
in the eight team tournament.
Despite poor season records,
• Doug Gunesch, Burt Amb
ler, and Bud Hollingbery were
never far from their opponents
and "good days" may earn them
places.
