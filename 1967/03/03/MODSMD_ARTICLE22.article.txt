# More Closed Doors
## 
### 
It is ironic that a major part of the business
of a University which prides itself on offering
free and open discussion should be conducted
behind closed doors. Most of the important de
cisions here are made at meetings which stu
dents may neither attend nor get any informa
tion about.
The most important offenders are the Presi
dential Advisory Committees, the Committees of
the Academic Council, including its Executive
Committee, the Committee on Undergraduate
Education, the Committee of Fifteen, and the
Board of Trustees. The only information avail
able on the proceedings of these bodies is that
which is officially released. It is generally not
possible to find out what matters were dis
cussed nor under what light they were con
sidered.
The argument most frequently presented in
favor of keeping important meetings closed is
that it allows for freer discussion among the
members and does not subject them to external
political influences or the problems of constit
uency representation. One cannot help but
wonder, however, whether all the points of
view are being considered and whether those
excluded might not reflect the opinion of a

significant segment of the community. It is also
disconcerting to think that committee decisions
are perhaps based on arguments which cannot
be made public.
Opening all meetings to the general public
would be foolish. But a mechanism should exist
whereby the substance of these meetings, in
cluding votes and major arguments on both
sides of an issue, would become available. It
is important for the community to know how
decisions are made and which factors con
tributed to their formulation.
The Committee of Fifteen presently works
under a system in which only "positive" ac
tions are made public. No onr> knows when the
Committee either refuses to take up an issue
or rejects one. The greatest irony, however, oc
curs in that the secrecy of the Committee is
not even maintained consistently; there are al
ways leaks to all three constituencies, but the
public is still denied knowledge of what the
body does.
How can there be equitable and effective
goverment in this University when the com
munity does not even know how decision are
made? Faculty and administrators must open
a few doors.
