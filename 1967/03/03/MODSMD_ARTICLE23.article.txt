# Letters To The Editor
## Request For Vietnam Petition 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations, Prof e s so r
Ripley, on your articulate open
letter to HH.H. You've done an
excellent job of expressing the
feelings of many of us. I thought
the last paragraph was espe
cially a propos.
Would you consider circulat
ing your letter to obtain the sig
natures of those members of the
Stanford Community who en
dorse your statements? With a
little time and effort, I'm sure
several hundred, and possibly
a few thousand signatures could
be obtained. Such a show of sup
port will have little immediate
effect upon the Administration,
but it will certainly end the spec
ulation as to just how much of
the community opposes present
policy.

• No Choice
Editor, The Daily:
It is very discouraging to be
in a situation where whatever
choice you make will be in some
sense wrong. As a person op
posed to the war I recognize
that such was the case the day
of Humphrey's speech.
Recent letters to The Daily
seem to take the position that
the right course of action is al
ways the polite, decorous one.
My reply to this is: politeness is
naturally desirable, but in sit
uations where its effect is to
make you look as though you
are supporting what in fact you
oppose strongly, it has to be
forfeited.
Granted, that an auditorium
full of silent protestors would
have conveyed dignified opposi
tion to the war. Fact: the Palo
Alto Times reported that only
a small and ineffectual minority
did not join the warm reception
given Humphrey.
Granted, that it would have
been reassuring to have been
able to believe that the govern
ment really was doing every
thing possible to end the war.
Fact: Humphrey spoke in an
evasive and propagandizing
manner that offered no basis
for trust.
Granted, that our "free and
open dissent" ought to result in
some mitigation of the war's

violence. Fact: We who oppose
the war are not acknowledged
by its defenders as human be
ings, but are dismissed as "fa
natics." The violence increases.
Granted, that the action of
blocking a man's path is a last
resort that a human being ought
not to be reduced to taking.
Fact: If students had quietly
watched Humphrey leave with
out his having even acknowl
edged them, if they had quietly
and passively watched his back
as he smiled at the two or three
immobilized students in his line
of vision, their politeness would
have been reported in the news
papers as support of or neutral
ity toward him. (Incidentally,
students did not threaten group
assault on Humphrey, but ran
to block the path of his car,
which they did not succeed in
doing One person risked ar
rest for technical assault by try
ing to get too close to Hum
phrey; he, not the group, is re
sponsible for his action.)
In conclusion, I agree that it
is disturbing to see people re
duced to running and shouting
in frustration and anger, and
more disturbing to be one of
them yourself by choice. The
choice was to run or to stand
still and watch a man who had
lied to you walk away with a vic
torious smile on his face.
If "free and open dissent" ever
comes to exist in this "democ
racy," it will not be by politely
and passively covering over
moral conflicts, not by respect
ing an "order" that is based
upon intimidation. Maybe we
ought to bow our heads, not out
of shame but out of dismay at
the condition we are reduced to.

• Pressure?
Editor, The Daily:
The circular urging students
to wear white arm-bands affirms
a belief that is difficult to ac
cept, namely that responsible ex
pression of dissent is the life
blood of democracy. It seems to
me the life-blood of democracy
is not the expression of either
dissent or agreement, but the
freedom from undue external in
fluences as to what one ex

presses. Organized group pres
sure in either direction can
easily hamper both freedom and
democracy.

• Faster PACE?
Editor, The Daily:
Those of the Stanford com
munity accustomed to seeing the
very best shall have another op
portunity this Friday—if they
are very, very lucky. The PACE
program, six-years-old now, has
done nothing more than broken
ground for the long-awaited new
basketball gymnasium. The uni
versity is thus seeing fit to host
the mighty UCLA Bruins and the
spectacular Lew Alcindor in the
dingy, 2700-seat pavilion, thus
barring thousands from seeing
this extraordinary team and sub
jecting those lucky few to out
landish fire hazards.
Efforts to move the game to

a more accessible site have been
completely stymied. The athletic
department, who claims that
such a move to SF.'s Cow
Palace would be an inconven
ience to the students, has surely
forgotten that thousands drove
all the way to Berkeley last No
vember to witness two midgets
of the gridiron battle it out in a
driving rain. And to those who
say the game shouldn't be moved
just because of Alcindor, let it
be known .that the present
Bruins may be the best team
ever to set foot on a college
floor, and might still be No. 1
with no center at all.
It is unfortunate that the
students, fans, and UCLA team
have to bear such accom
modations. Let this be the last
year that we are subjected to
such humiliation. Let's step up
the PACE!

Editor, The Daily:
Those of the Stanford com
munity accustomed to seeing the
very best shall have another op
portunity this Friday—if they
are very, very lucky. The PACE
program, six-years-old now, has
done nothing more than broken
ground for the long-awaited new
basketball gymnasium. The uni
versity is thus seeing fit to host
the mighty UCLA Bruins and the
spectacular Lew Alcindor in the
dingy, 2700-seat pavilion, thus
barring thousands from seeing
this extraordinary team and sub
jecting those lucky few to out
landish fire hazards.
Efforts to move the game to

a more accessible site have been
completely stymied. The athletic
department, who claims that
such a move to SF.'s Cow
Palace would be an inconven
ience to the students, has surely
forgotten that thousands drove
all the way to Berkeley last No
vember to witness two midgets
of the gridiron battle it out in a
driving rain. And to those who
say the game shouldn't be moved
just because of Alcindor, let it
be known .that the present
Bruins may be the best team
ever to set foot on a college
floor, and might still be No. 1
with no center at all.
It is unfortunate that the

such humiliation. Let's step up

Congratulations, Prof e s so r

letter to HH.H. You've done an
excellent job of expressing the
feelings of many of us. I thought
the last paragraph was espe
cially a propos.
Would you consider circulat
ing your letter to obtain the sig
natures of those members of the
Stanford Community who en
dorse your statements? With a
little time and effort, I'm sure
several hundred, and possibly
a few thousand signatures could
be obtained. Such a show of sup

Editor, The Daily:
It is very discouraging to be
in a situation where whatever
choice you make will be in some
sense wrong. As a person op
posed to the war I recognize
that such was the case the day
of Humphrey's speech.
Recent letters to The Daily
seem to take the position that
the right course of action is al
ways the polite, decorous one.
My reply to this is: politeness is
naturally desirable, but in sit
uations where its effect is to
make you look as though you
are supporting what in fact you
oppose strongly, it has to be
forfeited.
Granted, that an auditorium
full of silent protestors would
have conveyed dignified opposi
tion to the war. Fact: the Palo
Alto Times reported that only
a small and ineffectual minority
did not join the warm reception
given Humphrey.
Granted, that it would have
been reassuring to have been
able to believe that the govern
ment really was doing every
thing possible to end the war.
Fact: Humphrey spoke in an
evasive and propagandizing
manner that offered no basis
for trust.
Granted, that our "free and
open dissent" ought to result in
some mitigation of the war's

violence. Fact: We who oppose
the war are not acknowledged
by its defenders as human be
ings, but are dismissed as "fa
natics." The violence increases.
Granted, that the action of
blocking a man's path is a last
resort that a human being ought
not to be reduced to taking.
Fact: If students had quietly
watched Humphrey leave with
out his having even acknowl
edged them, if they had quietly
and passively watched his back
as he smiled at the two or three
immobilized students in his line
of vision, their politeness would
have been reported in the news
papers as support of or neutral
ity toward him. (Incidentally,
students did not threaten group
assault on Humphrey, but ran
to block the path of his car,
which they did not succeed in
doing One person risked ar
rest for technical assault by try
ing to get too close to Hum
phrey; he, not the group, is re
sponsible for his action.)
In conclusion, I agree that it
is disturbing to see people re
duced to running and shouting
in frustration and anger, and
more disturbing to be one of
them yourself by choice. The
choice was to run or to stand
still and watch a man who had
lied to you walk away with a vic
torious smile on his face.

• No Choice
Editor, The Daily:
It is very discouraging to be
in a situation where whatever
choice you make will be in some
sense wrong. As a person op
posed to the war I recognize
that such was the case the day
of Humphrey's speech.
Recent letters to The Daily
seem to take the position that
the right course of action is al
ways the polite, decorous one.
My reply to this is: politeness is
naturally desirable, but in sit
uations where its effect is to
make you look as though you
are supporting what in fact you
oppose strongly, it has to be
forfeited.
Granted, that an auditorium
full of silent protestors would
have conveyed dignified opposi
tion to the war. Fact: the Palo
Alto Times reported that only
a small and ineffectual minority
did not join the warm reception
given Humphrey.
Granted, that it would have
been reassuring to have been
able to believe that the govern
ment really was doing every
thing possible to end the war.
Fact: Humphrey spoke in an
evasive and propagandizing
manner that offered no basis
for trust.
Granted, that our "free and
open dissent" ought to result in
some mitigation of the war's

violence. Fact: We who oppose
the war are not acknowledged
by its defenders as human be
ings, but are dismissed as "fa
natics." The violence increases.
Granted, that the action of
blocking a man's path is a last
resort that a human being ought
not to be reduced to taking.
Fact: If students had quietly
watched Humphrey leave with
out his having even acknowl
edged them, if they had quietly
and passively watched his back
as he smiled at the two or three
immobilized students in his line
of vision, their politeness would
have been reported in the news
papers as support of or neutral
ity toward him. (Incidentally,
students did not threaten group
assault on Humphrey, but ran
to block the path of his car,
which they did not succeed in
doing One person risked ar
rest for technical assault by try
ing to get too close to Hum
phrey; he, not the group, is re
sponsible for his action.)
In conclusion, I agree that it
is disturbing to see people re
duced to running and shouting
in frustration and anger, and
more disturbing to be one of
them yourself by choice. The
choice was to run or to stand
still and watch a man who had
lied to you walk away with a vic
torious smile on his face.
If "free and open dissent" ever
comes to exist in this "democ
racy," it will not be by politely
and passively covering over
moral conflicts, not by respect
ing an "order" that is based
upon intimidation. Maybe we
ought to bow our heads, not out
of shame but out of dismay at
the condition we are reduced to.

• Pressure?
Editor, The Daily:
The circular urging students
to wear white arm-bands affirms
a belief that is difficult to ac
cept, namely that responsible ex
pression of dissent is the life
blood of democracy. It seems to
me the life-blood of democracy
is not the expression of either
dissent or agreement, but the
freedom from undue external in
fluences as to what one ex

presses. Organized group pres
sure in either direction can
easily hamper both freedom and
democracy.

• Faster PACE?
Editor, The Daily:
Those of the Stanford com
munity accustomed to seeing the
very best shall have another op
portunity this Friday—if they
are very, very lucky. The PACE
program, six-years-old now, has
done nothing more than broken
ground for the long-awaited new
basketball gymnasium. The uni
versity is thus seeing fit to host
the mighty UCLA Bruins and the
spectacular Lew Alcindor in the
dingy, 2700-seat pavilion, thus
barring thousands from seeing
this extraordinary team and sub
jecting those lucky few to out
landish fire hazards.
Efforts to move the game to

a more accessible site have been
completely stymied. The athletic
department, who claims that
such a move to SF.'s Cow
Palace would be an inconven
ience to the students, has surely
forgotten that thousands drove
all the way to Berkeley last No
vember to witness two midgets
of the gridiron battle it out in a
driving rain. And to those who
say the game shouldn't be moved
just because of Alcindor, let it
be known .that the present
Bruins may be the best team
ever to set foot on a college
floor, and might still be No. 1
with no center at all.
It is unfortunate that the
students, fans, and UCLA team
have to bear such accom
modations. Let this be the last
year that we are subjected to
such humiliation. Let's step up
the PACE!
