## Successful Society: What Went Wrong? 
### Tim Haight 
She will not be chained
To a life where notliing's
gained.
Nothings lost,
But such a cost.
—The Rolling Stones'
"Ruby Tuesday"
The struggle for a comfort
able material standard of living
has been won. Now the problem
is how to live in the society of
capitalism's frightening success.
For somewhere along the way
something went wrong. The aim
of society switched from human
happiness to the production of
material goods.
Larry D. Spence puts it this
way in "The One-Dimensional
Left" in Steps, the Journal of
the Free University of Berkeley,
"The development of society ac
cording to the exploitative
image is nearly complete. Thus,
the one-dimensional society
where our best humanitarian im
pulses feed the social cannibal
ization of bureaucracy, where
rationality leads to megaton
gibberish and calculations of
self-interest to self-indoctrina
tion in the bland ways of the or
ganization man.
"Here evil has lost its sting
and become banal along with
love, hope, and creativity. This
is the society that kills, yet
never lets you die.
"The modern image of ex
ploitation and its mechanistic
paradigms of science and poli
tics must be rejected because
its work is finished. This image,
in practice, has transformed the
world, and the problems to
which its various mechanisms
and techniques applied have
vanished. Success has made it
not only superfluous but sui
cidal.

"The world of today presents
us with a new set of vaguely
felt, but unnamed and unrecog
nizable problems. The phenom
ena of daily experience have be
come anomalies deviating from
the old norms. There exists no
sense or meaning in existence
below the level of obsolete ab
straction
"For the failures of our ex
ploitative society we have no
names—that is, no public or
political names by which they
can be recognized as failures.
From the beginning of the mod
ern epoch, these failures have
been categorized in the image
of exploitation as human, not
social defects. They will remain
defined in this way so long as
exploitative society prevails or
they are lobotomized out of ex
istence.
"While we do recognize the
loneliness, alienation, inhuman
ity, and passivity we must live,
and while we know the frighten
ing lack of ability to sensuously
touch each other or the sub
stance of our environment as a
gnawing emptiness, these things
are experienced as fate.
"There is no way to translate
them into the formal vocabulary
of our Locke-Madison political
paradigm. They remain forever
private troubles and hang-ups
for which no social means of re
lief are available. Instead, we
search, via the social sciences,
for new ways to ignore them by
improving our techniques of in
doctrination and manipulation.
"We do have some sense that
a five-figure salary doesn't cure
our loneliness or that a new
Mustang doesn't mean a full
participation in life. But this
only deepens our despair so long
as we try to be rational within
the logic of the exploitative
image.
"We can cling to such ration
ality only by blaming demons
for the empty success which sur
rounds us. We look for sick and
demented men, or evil and per
verted men, or even men of dif
ferent colored skins or other
languages. We find plenty of ex
amples in all categories.
"To remain reasonable and
rescue rationality from doubt
we are led to systematically de
stroy these categories and, ulti
mately, to self-destruction. In
terms of image of exploitation,
we must lose our minds or face
this doom."
Congratulations, United States
of America. You've made it.
Here is your gold watch. You
have brought more wealth to
the firm than any other em
ployee. Enjoy your retirement.
Watch out, though. So many
of you ball-of-fire executives find
that you can't stand to live once
you retire from the rat-race.
We'd keep you on, but there's
nothing left to do. You're just
going to have to think up new
ways of filling your time. Cheer
up, old man. You've made it.
