# Sapir Will Only Go Halfway
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following
is an open letter from Mark
Sapir, whose acquittal by the
Judicial Council has been ap
pealed to the IJB.)
I am certain)y pleased by the
decision of the Judicial Council,
particularly because the decision
is based upon the notion that
legality is only meaningful in
the context of morality, and be
cause the Council implicitly just
ifies the position that last year's
sit-in was an attempt to open
dialogue with those in high
places who have refused to ent
er dialogue or justify their posi
tions on many issues of critical
importance to the student body.
In discussions with the Coun
cil it became clear to me that
what had been construed initial
ly by both the Council and my
self as reciprocal impropriety
and lack of integrity, was indeed
a misunderstanding: though not
a chance misunderstanding: I
think it fair to say that at least
one Administrator effectively
played the Council and myself
off against each other, manipu
lating the situation to the disad
vantage of student harmony.
In lieu of my discussions with

Council and the decision it is
clear that the integrity of Coun
cil was inappropriately question
ed (due to facts offered me by
a Dean) in my open letter of
January 13 which appeared in
The Daily. Now, as a result of
the decision, I believe that a
common purpose for students at
the University, regardless of po
litical persuasion, has been set
forth.
What remains to be said, of
course, is that the first 3 points
of my open letter which attack
ed 1) the legal jurisdiction 2)
the applicability of a Funda
mental Standard by one part of
a community (Administration —
itself exempt) upon another
(students) particularly when
the former has final say 3) the
Administration as the group re
sponsible for the sit-in and for
important violations of basic
morality (Fundamental Stan
dard), remain intact.
Indeed, the decision of the
Council has only served to point
out the relevance of my accusa
tion that in such cases Judge
equals prosecutor (equals Ad
ministration) for I will, in the
final analysis, be found guilty
even though my peers have

found me innocent. In addition
the issue of double jeopardy has
been introduced; even Stanford's
formalistic legal system is faul
ty in this respect as I will be
tried again for a crime which I
have been acquired of a fourth
point of objection.
Although I still insist that the
legal jurisdiction over non-stu
dents is at best questionable, I
would be willing to appear be
fore the IJB to answer the
charges of the Administration
regarding a Fundamental Stan
dard of Morality which it claims
I have violated on the condition
that Dean Smith, former Dean
Winbigler and President Sterl
ing, or his representative agree
to appear before an open meet
ing of the Judiical Council and
answer charges brought against
them by any members of the
Academic comunity. I can think
of no reason why I as a human
being should go more than half
way across the road and extend
my hand; to appear before IJB
under the present circumstances
would be a betrayal of myself,
my friends, and my responsi
bility to the University.

even though my peers have

found me innocent. In addition
the issue of double jeopardy has
been introduced; even Stanford's
formalistic legal system is faul
ty in this respect as I will be
tried again for a crime which I
have been acquired of a fourth
point of objection.
Although I still insist that the
legal jurisdiction over non-stu
dents is at best questionable, I
would be willing to appear be
fore the IJB to answer the
charges of the Administration
regarding a Fundamental Stan
dard of Morality which it claims
I have violated on the condition
that Dean Smith, former Dean
Winbigler and President Sterl
ing, or his representative agree
to appear before an open meet
ing of the Judiical Council and
answer charges brought against
them by any members of the
Academic comunity. I can think
of no reason why I as a human
being should go more than half
way across the road and extend
my hand; to appear before IJB
under the present circumstances
would be a betrayal of myself,
my friends, and my responsi
bility to the University.

(Editor's Note: The following
is an open letter from Mark
Sapir, whose acquittal by the
Judicial Council has been ap
pealed to the IJB.)
I am certain)y pleased by the
decision of the Judicial Council,
particularly because the decision
is based upon the notion that
legality is only meaningful in
the context of morality, and be
cause the Council implicitly just
ifies the position that last year's
sit-in was an attempt to open
dialogue with those in high
places who have refused to ent
er dialogue or justify their posi
tions on many issues of critical
importance to the student body.
In discussions with the Coun
cil it became clear to me that
what had been construed initial
ly by both the Council and my
self as reciprocal impropriety
and lack of integrity, was indeed
a misunderstanding: though not
a chance misunderstanding: I
think it fair to say that at least
one Administrator effectively
played the Council and myself
off against each other, manipu
lating the situation to the disad
vantage of student harmony.
In lieu of my discussions with

Council and the decision it is
clear that the integrity of Coun
cil was inappropriately question
ed (due to facts offered me by
a Dean) in my open letter of
January 13 which appeared in
The Daily. Now, as a result of
the decision, I believe that a
common purpose for students at
the University, regardless of po
litical persuasion, has been set
forth.
What remains to be said, of
course, is that the first 3 points
of my open letter which attack
ed 1) the legal jurisdiction 2)
the applicability of a Funda
mental Standard by one part of
a community (Administration —
itself exempt) upon another
(students) particularly when
the former has final say 3) the
Administration as the group re
sponsible for the sit-in and for
important violations of basic
morality (Fundamental Stan
dard), remain intact.
Indeed, the decision of the
Council has only served to point
out the relevance of my accusa
tion that in such cases Judge
equals prosecutor (equals Ad
ministration) for I will, in the
final analysis, be found guilty
even though my peers have

found me innocent. In addition
the issue of double jeopardy has
been introduced; even Stanford's
formalistic legal system is faul

tried again for a crime which I
