# Dean Smith Appeals Sapir Sit-In Acquittal
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
The Judicial Council has acquited
Marc Sapir of a violation of the Fun
damental Standard for his participa
tion in the sit-in last spring in Presi
dent Sterling's office. Sapir was not a
registered student at the time. Dean
Joel B. Smith is appealing the de
cision to the Interim Judicial Body.
The Judicial Council ruling differs
from the Alan Traister ruling given
last quarter in a similar case, when
Judicial Council decided it lacked jur
isdiction to act against students who
were not registered at the time al
leged violations occured.
The Traister case was also appealed
to the Interim Judicial Body, a group
of five faculty members appointed by
President Sterling. The Body over
ruled Judicial Council, and placed
Traister, who has since graduated, on
probation.
Leave Of Absence
Sapir, like Traister, returned to his
studies after a leave of absence.
Last spring, Traister and Sapir asked
to be tried with the other protesters,
but the administration did not in
clude their names on the list sub
mitted to Judicial Council.
When Sapir returned to school this

quarter he was informed by Dean
Winbigler that he would be prose
cuted. Sapir noted that he first met
the Judicial Council through the
Dean's office, and that prior to that
meeting he had been led to believe the
Judicial Council was not showing in
tegrity.
Sapir has said in a statement, "In
discussions with the Council, it be
came clear to me that what had been
construed initially by both the Coun
cil and myself as reciprocal pro
priety and lack of integrity was in
deed a misunderstanding: though not
a chance misunderstanding."
Manipulation
He explained, "I think it is fair to
say that at least one Administrator
effectively played the Council and
myself off against each other, ma
nipulating the situation to the dis
advantage of student harmony."
This misunderstanding between Ju
dicial Council and Sapir resulted in
Sapir writing an open letter to The
Daily on January 16. Part of that
letter "inapropriately questioned" the
Judicial Council's integrity, Sapir now
says.
"Indeed, the decision of the Coun
cil has only served to point out the

relevance of my accusation that in
such cases judge equals prosecutor
equals Administration, for I will, in
the final analysis, be found guilty
even though my peers have found
me innocent," said Sapir.
Medical School
Sapir observed he was notified of
the Judicial Council decision through
the Dean's office with a copy of the ap
peal notice attached. Sapir described
this as typical of the way the "prose
cutor" constantly is involved in "neu
tral" areas of the judicial process.
Sapir is a medical student, and the
case has caused concern in the medi
cal school. Dr. Leroy A. Pesch, Dean
of the Medical School, commented,
"Several medical students are inter
ested in forming a separate judicial
body for medical students. I have
talked to a few students who are con
cerned"
Pesch noted that the law school al
ready has its own judicial system.
LASSU action would be necessary-
Some Medical School faculty mem
bers have suggested that the Medi
cal School should have autonomous
control over its students, but Pesch
feels the University administration
does have jurisdiction in this area.

nipulating the situation to the dis
advantage of student harmony."
This misunderstanding between Ju
dicial Council and Sapir resulted in
Sapir writing an open letter to The
Daily on January 16. Part of that
letter "inapropriately questioned" the
Judicial Council's integrity, Sapir now
says.
"Indeed, the decision of the Coun
cil has only served to point out the

relevance of my accusation that in
such cases judge equals prosecutor
equals Administration, for I will, in
the final analysis, be found guilty
even though my peers have found
me innocent," said Sapir.
Medical School
Sapir observed he was notified of
the Judicial Council decision through
the Dean's office with a copy of the ap
peal notice attached. Sapir described
this as typical of the way the "prose
cutor" constantly is involved in "neu
tral" areas of the judicial process.
Sapir is a medical student, and the
case has caused concern in the medi
cal school. Dr. Leroy A. Pesch, Dean
of the Medical School, commented,
"Several medical students are inter
ested in forming a separate judicial
body for medical students. I have
talked to a few students who are con
cerned"
Pesch noted that the law school al
ready has its own judicial system.
LASSU action would be necessary-
Some Medical School faculty mem
bers have suggested that the Medi
cal School should have autonomous
control over its students, but Pesch
feels the University administration
does have jurisdiction in this area.
The Judicial Council has acquited
Marc Sapir of a violation of the Fun
damental Standard for his participa
tion in the sit-in last spring in Presi
dent Sterling's office. Sapir was not a
registered student at the time. Dean
Joel B. Smith is appealing the de
cision to the Interim Judicial Body.
The Judicial Council ruling differs
from the Alan Traister ruling given
last quarter in a similar case, when
Judicial Council decided it lacked jur
isdiction to act against students who
were not registered at the time al
leged violations occured.
The Traister case was also appealed
to the Interim Judicial Body, a group
of five faculty members appointed by
President Sterling. The Body over
ruled Judicial Council, and placed
Traister, who has since graduated, on
probation.
Leave Of Absence
Sapir, like Traister, returned to his
studies after a leave of absence.
Last spring, Traister and Sapir asked
to be tried with the other protesters,
but the administration did not in
clude their names on the list sub
mitted to Judicial Council.
When Sapir returned to school this

quarter he was informed by Dean
Winbigler that he would be prose
cuted. Sapir noted that he first met
the Judicial Council through the
Dean's office, and that prior to that
meeting he had been led to believe the
Judicial Council was not showing in
tegrity.
Sapir has said in a statement, "In
discussions with the Council, it be
came clear to me that what had been
construed initially by both the Coun
cil and myself as reciprocal pro
priety and lack of integrity was in
deed a misunderstanding: though not
a chance misunderstanding."
Manipulation
He explained, "I think it is fair to
say that at least one Administrator
effectively played the Council and
myself off against each other, ma
nipulating the situation to the dis
advantage of student harmony."
