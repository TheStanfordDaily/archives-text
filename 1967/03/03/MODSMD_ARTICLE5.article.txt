# English Requirements Revised—Offer More Choice
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
The English Department has made
all undergraduate English courses
worth five academic units and added
a new senior independent study pro
gram.
These changes are part of the over
all revision of English major require
ments announced this week. Accord
ing to department head Thomas
Moser, the alterations are the result
of over two years of study by the
English Curriculum Committee chair
ed by Professor Claude Simpson.
Simpson stressed that increasing
the class units from 4 to 5 does not
mean an increase in course work.
"Our feeling has been that in a de
partment like this where all the

courses have heavy reading loads,
units should be based on the amount
of work not the number of class meet
ings. We wanted to bring the math in
line with reality; hopefully the stu
dent's whole schedule should reflect
this," Simpson said.
Independent Study
The independent study program,
English 199, will be open to 50 seniors
majoring in English who wish to
work throughout the year on a "cri
tical or scholarly" essay of approxi
mately 10,000 words.
Professor David Levin who will be
supervising the program next year
explained that the plan was devised to
give students not enrolled in Honors
English "a chance to pursue their in

terests and write a long paper in con
sultation with a member of the
faculty.
Because of staff limitations, only 50
seniors can be admitted to English
199. Levin said interested students
should submit a sample of their ex
pository prose and a possible topic
for study to the secretary of the de
partment before pre-registration in
May of their junior year. Volunteer
professors and graduate students if
needed will be assisting majors in the
year-long, 10 unit project. /
Six Categories
English courses have now been
grouped into six categories: Langu
age, Medieval, Renaissance, Neoclas
sic, Romantic and Modern, and Amer

ican. Students choose at least one
course from each division, including
one previously required class from
four of these. The remainder of the
45 units for A.B. candidates may be
selected from either the general sec
tions or from a list of electives. The
minor requirement has been abandon
ed. Present majors may continue in
the old program or switch to the new
schedule.
The new requirements for English
majors were based on two assump
tions, Simpson said. "First, there is
a general body of literature with
which every student should have
some acquaintance. Second, there are
different ways of becoming acquaint
ed with this."

Assistant Professor W. Bliss Car
nochan noted that the revisions are
not "change for the sake of change.
Among undergraduates and faculty
we sensed a desire for variety of ap
proaches to meet increasing needs
which perhaps were not represented
by the old structure." He added that
in evaluating the old English program
the committee considered a report
submitted by Tim Haight, an English
major who conducted a survey of En
glish students last spring.
"These changes will offer the stu
dent a greater degree of choice. There
are fewer requirements and these are
worked out in areas. It represents a
nice compromise between total free
dom and total direction," said J. M.
Evans who is in charge of the English
Honors Program which has also been
revised.
Students admitted to the new pro
gram will participate in a series of
seminars in their junior year which
replace the old special discussion
groups held in conjunction with the
English and American literature sur
vey courses. Evans felt this new ap
proach would attract "good English
students while providing an extra

challenge."
Many English majors were enthu
siastic about the department changes.
Sophomore Dave Hibbard commented,
"The new system allows one to es
cape the traditionally required cour
ses which can become rather burden
some." A senior in Honors English
expressed regret that he wouldn't be
able to participate in the new pro
gram "because you can take more
courses, and it's easier to study with
the professors of your choice."
Some of those questioned felt the
requirements were basically the same,
but, as one junior noted, "psychologic
ally more pleasing because on the sur
face there's less coercion."
Professor Simpson pointed out
some basic problems still are unre
solved — the matter of future staffing
and the basic theory of the lecture
system itself. "The men in our depart
ment are almost superhuman, but
they can't always divide themselves
as talented young men are asked to
do."
He expressed the hope that the new
program would enable majors to take
smaller classes and have more mean
ingful contact with their professors.
