# Sigma Chi Battles Discrimination
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS (Last in a series of articles about local fraternities) 
Sigma Chi's withdrawal from the
national organization last fall ended
a bitter struggle over racial discrim
ination which was echoed at other
Sigma Chi chapters across the nation.
Stanford's local chapter of Sigma
Chi, Alpha Omega, had its first serious
run-in with the national in spring of
1965 when it was suspended shortly
after the chapter pledged a Negro
student. While the national organiza
tion had abolished its "white clause"
in 1961, this had been replaced by a
"social acceptability" clause which re
quires all applicants to be acceptable
to all members in the country.
According to Grand Consul Harry
Wade, the suspension was the result
of nonconformity to ritual practice
and general "contempt" of the na
tional organization- Wade called the
"young men at Palo Alto ... a little
bit too small for the size of their
pants."
Alunini Support
Prior to suspension, Alpha Omega
had made efforts to change the de
facto discriminatory clause, but had
been unable to influence the national.
In a survey prior to suspension the
chapter's alumni showed strong sup
port for change of the restrictive
membership requirement. Of the 150
responding, 125 favored changing the
social acceptability clause.
Despite the suspension, the local
chapter attracted a large pledge class
and retained strong alumni support
that year. Despite the fraternity's
right of appeal at the national's an
nual convention in June of 1965, the

national voted to maintain the sus
pension by a 3-to-l margin.
Brock Gowdy, president of Sigma
Chi Omega, the house's new name,
said that the "liberal atmosphere of
Stanford," combined with strong
alumni support, was a strong influence
in helping the fraternity maintain its
anti-discrimination position through
out the period of suspension.
Sigma Chi's position was supported
by the University in light of the policy
adopted in 1957 by the Board of
Trustees which stated that the Uni
versity "is opposed to discriminatory
racial and religious clauses or prac
tices. Insofar as such clauses or
practices exist, the University will
work actively with student groups to
eliminate them at the earliest possi
ble date."
Colorado Case
While the University had also given
support in the cases of ATO and Sig
ma Nu chapters which went local, the
administration has never enforced the
anti-discrimination policy where de
facto discrimination exists.
Other universities across the nation,
however, have not boon so lenient to
ward the national's discrimination
practices. On September 15, 1965, the
University of Colorado refused to lift
the probationary status imposed on
Sigma Chi earlier that year despite a
notice from the chapter to the na
tional to "be autonomous in the selec
tion of members."
On October 25, 1965, Brown Univer
sity directed its Sigma Chi chapter to
server its ties with the national by
January 29, 1966, because of the de
facto discrimination.
And, the LaFayette College chapter

left the national early in 1966 after
the national refused to accept a La-
Fayette pledge of Korean ancestry.
Though Alpha Omega was rein
stated in April of 1966 on a strict pro
bationary status, the conflict with the
national was by no means settled, de
spite the fact that by that time the
Negro pledge was no longer eligible
for affiliation because of academic
deficiencies.
According to Gowdy, the chapter
was placed under supervision of a
five-man group headed by a non-Stan
ford alumnus. Neither the University
nor the local alumni were informed of
the existence of the committee.
The local chapter was not allowed
to communicate with its own alumni
by order of the national. Gowdy said
the committee continually interfered
with internal operations of the house
and insisted that a representative be
present at all house meetings. The
committee also insisted that all vot
ing on selection of new members
be by secret ballot, contrary to house
procedures.
Before the final decision to go local,
the fraternity not only re-evaluated
its relations with the national but also
"thought about all the things about
the chapter we didn't like and tried to
start from scratch," said Gowdy.
Disaffiliation
On November 10, 1966, Gowdy an
nounced the decision to disaffiliate
before a meeting of chapter alumni in
Los Angeles. At that time Gowdy
pointed out that while the chapter
had tried to work within the national
framework and reconcile differences,
they felt that continued affiliation
would be a compromise of principles.

How have these conflicts and the
fraternity's stand affected the internal
structure of the house?
Sigma Chi Omega has yet to initiate
a Negro student, yet the fraternity
will continue to rush on a non-dis
criminatory basis. Gowdy says that
the fraternity still rushes "selective
ly" in the belief that persons want to
select those with whom they will be
living.
In regard to the recent rash of
criticism of the value of fraternity
living, Gowdy said that those Univer
sity housing groups operating on a
non-selective basis, such as Wilbur
and Stern houses, should also be ques
tioned as to their "real contribution"
to the University beyond their func
tion as dormitories.
"The Boy Scout image is gone,"
Gowdy said, referring to the purpose
of fraternities. "We aren't pretending
to be 'do-gooders', but rather simply a
group of people who enjoy living to
gether."
Gowyd sees the fraternity as a place
to "break down walls between peo
ple" and a possible alleviation of the
"alienated" atmosphere of the im
personal University structure.
