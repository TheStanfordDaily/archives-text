# Polhemus To Head Frosh English
## 
### 
Robert Polhemus, Assistant Profes
sor of English, has been appointed
chairman of the Freshman English
Program. The specialist in Victorian
literature will assume his new position
beginning next quarter.
Polhemus replaces Professor Al
bert Guerard who chaired the program
this year and served as co-chairman
with Alfred Appel during the last
academic year. Guerard will be tour
ing the country next quarter deliver
ing lectures as part of the Phi Beta
Kappa Visiting Scholar Program and
then will begin a year long sabbatical
leave followed by a term at overseas
campuses.
Less Rhetorical
Polhemus said that he doesn't an
ticipate any major changes in the pres
ent Freshman program. He and Guer
ard explained that for the past two
years the department has been experi
menting with a less rhetorical ap
proach to teaching English which will
be evaluated at the end of next year.
Recent innovations in Freshman
English include:
• English 4, creative writing semin
ars open to a limited number of Fresh
men third quarter.
• Regular English classes divided
into seminar discussion groups.

• Student-determined reading lists
for third quarter classes.
• Participation of qualified seniors
in Freshmen classes to aid discussion
and Freshman integration.
• The Freshman Residence Pro
gram which has sponsored films,
drama groups, play and poetry read
ings, creative writing publications and
various cultural activities in Fresh
man dorms.
Voice Project
In addition, one hundred Freshmen,
chosen at random, are now participat
ing in the experimental Voice Project
taught by visiting writers assisted by
graduate students. In this program
students are encouraged to identify
their own "voice," the natural person
ality and rhythmic elements present in
their speaking voices, and to project
these into their writing.
Students have been working with
Palo Alto school children, tape record
ings of their own work, and "talking
out" sessions in order to identify
these "human" aspects of expression.
Polhemus stressed that "the heart of
Freshman English is still helping stu
dents to improve their own writing.
There is no getting away from the fact
that this is necessary and requires
hard work—there's no sugar coating."
