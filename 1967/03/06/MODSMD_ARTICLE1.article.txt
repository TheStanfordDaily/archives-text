# 10 Year Plan Outlined For Academic Housing
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER (Second In a series) 
"Only a handful of departments are proper
ly housed," reports Vice President for Finance
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson. For that reason, ef
forts over the past six years and for the next
ten are being concentrated on bringing the
University's academic and service spaces up
to "acceptable" standards.
Cutherbertson cites Physics, with the Varian
lab, lecture and seminar rooms; Mathematics,
with the newly renovated northwest corner
of the Quad; and Biology, with its as yet un
completed buildings as the only Humanities
and Sciences departments that are "properly
housed."
Examples of poorly housed departments,
according to Cuthbertson, are the Psychology
Department, which is scattered in seven loca
tions on campus, including several old .Row
Houses and the already overcrowded Educa
tion building, and the History and Economics
Departments, which have been crowded into
the History Corner.
Campus growth in the next ten years will
see a mall built on Lomita Street, the fire
house relocated, and expansion or relocation
of virtually every department.
Large Donations
With a first-rate faculty—developed during
the Fifties—and large donations from the
PACE program and other private sources, the

University is ready to "catch up" to the needs
of a modern educational operation.
Within the next year, over $26 million in
building expansion will be begun, with ground
breaking to occur in the following approximate
order:
• Space Engineering. Begun last month ad
jacant to the McCullough building, the $4.5
million construction project received a $2.2 mil
lion grant from NASA. When completed, it
will not only concentrate on Aeronautics and
Astronautics, but will be open for interdis
ciplinary research
• Maples Athletic Pavilion. To be totally
financed from gifts, construction will begin on
the $3.3 million pavilion within the next month.
It will be located on a practice field near the
tennis courts.
New Art Galley
• Art. Art's new location will be between the
Main Library and the Art Gallery. One-third
of the $2.4 million cost will be financed from a
government grant. Building will start this
spring.
• Third Fraternity Cluster. Five new fra
ternity houses, to be located next to Cowell
Health Center, will be built, beginning this
spring. A fund-raising effort, begun in 1957,
has collected $1.25 million of the $2.75 million
cost. The rest, to be borrowed, will be repaid
in the next 40 years from fraternity rent
charges.

• High Energy Physics Lab. This $5.9 mil
lion operation to put the existing Mark II ac
celerator underground will begin this spring
but will take several years to complete. The
accelerator is being relocated for low tempera
ture physics experimentation. The project will
be totally financed by the federal government.
Food Institute
• Renovation of Encina Hall. The $1.7 mil
lion renovation of Encina's West Wing will
provide a permanent residence for the Food
Research Institute, which is now primarily
housed in Humanities and Sciences space in
the inner Quad. The English Department will
take over the vacated Quad space.
• Fire-Police Station. Trapped by the growth
around it, the fire and police services will move
into a new $.8 million structure near the cam
pus Shell station. Construction will begin next
summer.
Biology Move
• Jordan Hall Renovation. Renovation for
the Psychology Department will begin as soon
as the Biology Department moves into its
new buildings next summer The cost, $4.7
million, of renovating Jordan Hall is approxi
mately the same as would be the cost of an
entirely new building without the "shell" of
the Biology Building.
• Inner Quad Renovation. When the stu
dent services—Admissions, Registrar, Dean of
Students, Financial Aids—move to the reno

vated Old Union, the space will be open for
Humanities and Sciences occupancy. Anthro
pology, presently in five different locations,
will move in after a $200,000 renovation.
These additions, all to be begun within the
next year, are only a start. By 1970, another
$40 million worth of construction will be
started. Expected expansion between 1968
and 1970—again depending heavily on gifts—
would include;
• Moore and Jacks Residences. Although
Moore House construction was indefinitely de
layed, the $7.5 million buildings were orig
inally planned to house 560 undergraduate
men and women by September 1968. David and
Margaret Jacks House is planned for the
space between the Row and Florence Moore,
while Robert S. Moore House was to be built
between the two existing fraternity clusters.
Plans call for each residence to have two
houses for men and two for women.
• A new Law School to be built in the area
of the present old Row houses adjacent to
the Undergraduate Library. The new $7 mil
lion structure will be part of the movement
of most graduate professional activity away
from the Quad.
Block Off Lomita
• A $3 6 million Earth Sciences building that
will extend across and block off Lomita Drive
at Panama Street.
• A least five million dollars worth of addi

tions to the Main Library. After construction,
it will stretch out to Galvez Street.
• A building for Preclinical Sciences in
Medicine .The $6 million structure—which will
house Anatomy, Physiology, and Medical
Microbiology—will bring together previously
spread out departments.
• An inter departmental International Stud
ies building, to be located adjacent to Hoover
Tower and the Main Library.
Stanford Hospital
• Several renovations and additions, includ
ing: Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital, at least $5
million of additions; Computer Science, $1 mil
lion; undergraduate Chemistry, $2 million;
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, $5
million; a research and development building
for the School of Education; further renova
tion of Engineering Buildings behind the Quad.
Many other departmental recommendations
and requests are being studied. Those build
ing requests termed "urgent needs" by Cuth
bertson should begin construction within the
next ten years.
Among the requests currently under dis
cussion are: graduate student residences,
Tresidder Union expansion, Eating Club ex
pansion and renovation, a fourth fraternity
cluster, an Applied Physics building, a drama
rehearsal hall theater adjoining Memorial
