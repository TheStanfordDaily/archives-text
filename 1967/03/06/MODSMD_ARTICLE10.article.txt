# CUE Turns Down Coed Living Plan
## 
### WYNNE FURTH 
A student proposal for limited
coeducational living in Stern and
Florence Moore next quarter
has been turned down by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education. According to Associ
ate Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert Hind, "in view of
the insurmountable legal ob
stacles to coed arrangements
at this time, the project could
not be recommended."
The plan called for the con
version of the second floor of
Loro in Moore to men's housing
and of the second floor of Holla
day in Stern to women's hous
ing. Also proposed was the ap
pointment of both a faculty resi
dent and an R.A. to each house
and the establishment of option
al house seminars.
Similar Plans Successful
Citing the success of similar
arrangements at overseas cam
puses, a letter submitted to
CUE and the Office of the Dean
of Students contended that "co
educational houses would pro
vide association far more bene
ficial than the limited mealtime
contact of coeducational dorms"
such as the proposed Moore-
Jacks complex. As an aid to de
termining future housing policy,
the "proposal would include a
much more representative cross
section of the university com
munity (than the Grove Proj
ect), namely the necessarily
heterogenous constituencies of
two present dormitory houses."
The letter, written by Mark
Fogelman, a junior in Holla
day, was accompanied by a peti
tion signed by all residents of
Holladay and fifty of the fifty
one women in Loro. Those sign
ing the petition indicated both
their support of the proposed
experiment and their willingness
to participate in it Spring Quar
ter.
Little Action
Fogelman drew up the pro
posal fall quarter following a
discussion with Holladay Resi
dent Robert Funk to the effect
that there was "a great deal of
talk but little attempt at action
on the part of most students
with regard to University prob
lems." Fogelman "wanted to see
what could be done by a group
of students, without any intimi
dation from The Daily or LAS
SU, both of which tend to be
hostile to the administration."
In addition to the petitions,
letters supporting the plan were
sent by CUE to Funk, Dean B.
Davie Napier, Stern Director
William Leland, Stern Resident
Douglas Wilde, and others. The
Stern Housing Committee and
members of the ASSU Housing
Commission also indicated their
support.
Investigation revealed two
legal difficulties. First, a court
ruling is necessary before Moore
can legally be used by men's
housing. In addition, permission
to house women in Stern must
be obtained from Walter Haas,
trustee of the Stern estate. On
the advice of University lawyers,
CUE decided not to take the mat
ter to court, and no attempt has
been made to get Haas' approval.
Previous Refusals
According to Fogelman, Haas
has been approached at least
twice by the University adminis
tration about the change. Two
years ago the answer was "no,"
but over Christmas vacation this
year he expressed interest in
the Grove project and possible
coeducation in Stern.
Due to the absence of Chair
man Robert Wert, CUE did not
meet until three weeks after
the proposal was submitted.

Wert told Fogelman before that
meeting that the University
would not take the Moore case
to court.
In a statement made after
CUE met, Fogelman had two
comments on the decision. "I'm
sure the legal difficulties do
exist. However, my proposal
was addressed to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, not Dean Wert, who in
formed me of the decision not
to take the matter to court sev
eral days before the Committee
had even seen the proposal.
Also, whether or not the legal
problems are insurmountable is
open to debate."
Possible Court Action
According to Funk, a lawyer
currently writing a dissertation
on university law, "similar cases
have been taken to court and
won, although the outcome of
this one is open to conjecture
Such restrictions are anachron
isms, but a private university
cannot appear to misuse donated
funds. If the Packer Report
finds that a large number of
coed houses are called for, the
University will very probably
take it to court, win, lose, or
whatever."
Dean Hind felt that the case
could probably be won "after
four or five years, if coed living
is the rule. Florence Moore can
not house men until not only the
desire, but the urgent need, to
do so can be demonstrated."
There are no legal restrictions
as to the sex of the occupants
of Wilbur, Toyon, Roble, Bran
ner, Lagunita, or the Row. Hoi
laday house turned to Florence
Moore after the Lagunita Execu
tive Committee expressed no
desire for a coed living experi
ment. The Florence Moore floor
plan also appeared best suited
to the plan. Currently, discus
sions are being held about the
possibility of a Muir-Magnolia
exchange, but no further pro
posals have been submitted to
CUE.

tion signed by all residents of
Holladay and fifty of the fifty
one women in Loro. Those sign
ing the petition indicated both
their support of the proposed
experiment and their willingness
to participate in it Spring Quar
ter.
Little Action
Fogelman drew up the pro
posal fall quarter following a
discussion with Holladay Resi
dent Robert Funk to the effect
that there was "a great deal of
talk but little attempt at action
on the part of most students
with regard to University prob
lems." Fogelman "wanted to see
what could be done by a group
of students, without any intimi
dation from The Daily or LAS
SU, both of which tend to be
hostile to the administration."
In addition to the petitions,
letters supporting the plan were
sent by CUE to Funk, Dean B.
Davie Napier, Stern Director
William Leland, Stern Resident
Douglas Wilde, and others. The
Stern Housing Committee and
members of the ASSU Housing
Commission also indicated their
support.
Investigation revealed two
legal difficulties. First, a court
ruling is necessary before Moore
can legally be used by men's
housing. In addition, permission
to house women in Stern must
be obtained from Walter Haas,
trustee of the Stern estate. On
the advice of University lawyers,
CUE decided not to take the mat
ter to court, and no attempt has
been made to get Haas' approval.
Previous Refusals
According to Fogelman, Haas
has been approached at least
twice by the University adminis
tration about the change. Two
years ago the answer was "no,"
but over Christmas vacation this
year he expressed interest in
the Grove project and possible
coeducation in Stern.
Due to the absence of Chair
man Robert Wert, CUE did not
meet until three weeks after
the proposal was submitted.

Wert told Fogelman before that
meeting that the University
would not take the Moore case
to court.
In a statement made after
CUE met, Fogelman had two
comments on the decision. "I'm
sure the legal difficulties do
exist. However, my proposal
was addressed to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, not Dean Wert, who in
formed me of the decision not
to take the matter to court sev
eral days before the Committee
had even seen the proposal.
Also, whether or not the legal
problems are insurmountable is
open to debate."
Possible Court Action
According to Funk, a lawyer
currently writing a dissertation
on university law, "similar cases
have been taken to court and
won, although the outcome of
this one is open to conjecture
Such restrictions are anachron
isms, but a private university
cannot appear to misuse donated
funds. If the Packer Report
finds that a large number of
coed houses are called for, the
University will very probably
take it to court, win, lose, or
whatever."
Dean Hind felt that the case
could probably be won "after
four or five years, if coed living
is the rule. Florence Moore can
not house men until not only the
desire, but the urgent need, to
do so can be demonstrated."
There are no legal restrictions
as to the sex of the occupants
of Wilbur, Toyon, Roble, Bran
ner, Lagunita, or the Row. Hoi
laday house turned to Florence
Moore after the Lagunita Execu
tive Committee expressed no
desire for a coed living experi
ment. The Florence Moore floor
plan also appeared best suited
to the plan. Currently, discus
sions are being held about the
possibility of a Muir-Magnolia
exchange, but no further pro
posals have been submitted to
CUE.
A student proposal for limited
coeducational living in Stern and
Florence Moore next quarter
has been turned down by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education. According to Associ
ate Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert Hind, "in view of
the insurmountable legal ob
stacles to coed arrangements
at this time, the project could
not be recommended."
The plan called for the con
version of the second floor of
Loro in Moore to men's housing
and of the second floor of Holla
day in Stern to women's hous
ing. Also proposed was the ap
pointment of both a faculty resi
dent and an R.A. to each house
and the establishment of option
al house seminars.
Similar Plans Successful
Citing the success of similar
arrangements at overseas cam
puses, a letter submitted to
CUE and the Office of the Dean
of Students contended that "co
educational houses would pro
vide association far more bene
ficial than the limited mealtime
contact of coeducational dorms"
such as the proposed Moore-
Jacks complex. As an aid to de
termining future housing policy,
the "proposal would include a
much more representative cross
section of the university com
munity (than the Grove Proj
ect), namely the necessarily
heterogenous constituencies of
two present dormitory houses."

Previous Refusals
According to Fogelman, Haas
has been approached at least
twice by the University adminis
tration about the change. Two
years ago the answer was "no,"
but over Christmas vacation this
year he expressed interest in
the Grove project and possible
coeducation in Stern.
Due to the absence of Chair
man Robert Wert, CUE did not
meet until three weeks after
the proposal was submitted.

Wert told Fogelman before that
meeting that the University
would not take the Moore case
to court.
In a statement made after
CUE met, Fogelman had two
comments on the decision. "I'm
sure the legal difficulties do
exist. However, my proposal
was addressed to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, not Dean Wert, who in
formed me of the decision not
to take the matter to court sev
eral days before the Committee
had even seen the proposal.
Also, whether or not the legal
problems are insurmountable is
open to debate."
Possible Court Action
According to Funk, a lawyer
currently writing a dissertation
on university law, "similar cases
have been taken to court and
won, although the outcome of
this one is open to conjecture
Such restrictions are anachron
isms, but a private university
cannot appear to misuse donated
funds. If the Packer Report
finds that a large number of
coed houses are called for, the
University will very probably
take it to court, win, lose, or
whatever."
Dean Hind felt that the case
could probably be won "after
four or five years, if coed living
is the rule. Florence Moore can
not house men until not only the
desire, but the urgent need, to
do so can be demonstrated."
There are no legal restrictions
as to the sex of the occupants
of Wilbur, Toyon, Roble, Bran
ner, Lagunita, or the Row. Hoi
laday house turned to Florence
Moore after the Lagunita Execu
tive Committee expressed no
desire for a coed living experi
ment. The Florence Moore floor
plan also appeared best suited
to the plan. Currently, discus
sions are being held about the
possibility of a Muir-Magnolia
exchange, but no further pro
posals have been submitted to
CUE.
A student proposal for limited
coeducational living in Stern and
Florence Moore next quarter
has been turned down by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education. According to Associ
ate Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert Hind, "in view of
the insurmountable legal ob
stacles to coed arrangements
at this time, the project could
not be recommended."
The plan called for the con
version of the second floor of
Loro in Moore to men's housing
and of the second floor of Holla
day in Stern to women's hous
ing. Also proposed was the ap
pointment of both a faculty resi
dent and an R.A. to each house
and the establishment of option
al house seminars.
Similar Plans Successful
Citing the success of similar
arrangements at overseas cam
puses, a letter submitted to
CUE and the Office of the Dean
of Students contended that "co
educational houses would pro
vide association far more bene
ficial than the limited mealtime
contact of coeducational dorms"
such as the proposed Moore-
Jacks complex. As an aid to de
termining future housing policy,
the "proposal would include a
much more representative cross
section of the university com
munity (than the Grove Proj
ect), namely the necessarily
heterogenous constituencies of
two present dormitory houses."
The letter, written by Mark
Fogelman, a junior in Holla
day, was accompanied by a peti
tion signed by all residents of
Holladay and fifty of the fifty
one women in Loro. Those sign
ing the petition indicated both
their support of the proposed
experiment and their willingness
to participate in it Spring Quar
ter.
Little Action
Fogelman drew up the pro
posal fall quarter following a
discussion with Holladay Resi
dent Robert Funk to the effect
that there was "a great deal of
talk but little attempt at action
on the part of most students
with regard to University prob
lems." Fogelman "wanted to see
what could be done by a group
of students, without any intimi
dation from The Daily or LAS
SU, both of which tend to be
hostile to the administration."
In addition to the petitions,
letters supporting the plan were
sent by CUE to Funk, Dean B.
Davie Napier, Stern Director
William Leland, Stern Resident
Douglas Wilde, and others. The
Stern Housing Committee and
members of the ASSU Housing
Commission also indicated their
support.
Investigation revealed two
legal difficulties. First, a court
ruling is necessary before Moore
can legally be used by men's
housing. In addition, permission
to house women in Stern must
be obtained from Walter Haas,
trustee of the Stern estate. On
the advice of University lawyers,
CUE decided not to take the mat
ter to court, and no attempt has
been made to get Haas' approval.
