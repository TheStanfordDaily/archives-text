# CU Students Demand Role In Faculty Tenure
## 
### 
BOULDER (CPS) â€” Denial
of tenure to an assistant profes
sor of English has precipitated
a "publish or perish" contro
versy at the University of Colo
rado and led to student demands
for increased involvement in de
cisions involving promotion of
faculty members.
At a rally this week sponsored
by the Associated Students of
the University of Colorado (AS
UC), nearly 3500 students heard
student body president John Bil
orusky propose the establish
ment of a joint student-faculty
Board on Academic Affairs to
give students a voice in curricu
lum and faculty decisions.
The Board would design and
implement a plan for student
evaluations of all teachers in
every department of the univer
sity; design and implement a
plan for the use of these student
evaluations in promotion and
tenure decisions, review all pro
motion and tenure decisions,
and aid in setting academic
policy.
Bilorusky also asked that in
creased emphasis in tenure, pro
motion and salary decisions be
placed on teaching ability and
that recent tenure decisions be
reconsidered in light of student
concern.
He emphasized student inter

est in the area of quality of un
dergraduate teaching and said
that over-valuation of research
and publication is only one as
pect of the problem.
The controversy began with
the discovery that Professor
Alan Jackson had been refused
tenure by the English depart
ment. He has taught at the uni
versity for more than five years
and was rated very highly by
students in last fall's ASUC
course evaluation.
According to Bilorsuky, Jack
son was refused tenure because
he had not published and had
done research only for the pur
pose of improving his classroom
teaching.
University administrators,
while impressed with student
spirit and concern with teaching,
were skeptical of Bilorusky's
proposal that students be in
volved formally in reviewing
promotion and tenure decisions.
Associate Dean of Faculty
John R. Little said he "doubted
that students could make wise
and reasonable decisions."
University Vice-President
Thurston E. Manning added that
students are already involved in
promotion decisions through
such agencies as the Deans Ad
visory Committee in the College
of Arts and Sciences.
