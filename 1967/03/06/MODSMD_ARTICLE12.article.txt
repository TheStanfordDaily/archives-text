## 
### ERIC PROKOSCH 
Friday about ten Stanford stu
dents picketed a Mayfair super
market in Palo Alto in support
of the Delano grape-workers'
strike. They returned over the
weekend and will continue pick
eting this week.
The Mayfair chain sells Elev
en Cellars Port, A. R. Murrow
brandy and other Perelli-Mi
netti products. Perelli-Minetti
has refused to deal with a union
organized by the farmworkers.
A Mayfair store in San Jose is
also being picketed.
The students arrived Friday
afternoon at Mayfair market,
3922 Middlefield, together with
some local "non-students" and
Elizer Risco, a former Stanford
student who has been working
with the strikers in Delano. Ris
co spoke to the store manager,
who told him the decision what
to sell rested with his superiors.
The students began handing out
leaflets and walking up and
down with signs.
'Back To Mexico'
A crowd of teenage boys
watched the picketers from a
distance. "Go back to Mexico!'
they yelled.
When this had no effect they
came over to talk. Then severa
of them offered to carry signs.
A hostile Mayfair customei
looked at a teenager with sign
"Is he a farmworker?" he asked.
"No." — "What difference does
it make?" said one of the pick
eters.
"He's not old enough to buy
brandy," the man said and
stalked off.
A sub-teenager on a bike
looked at a sign reading "May
fair Is Unfair to Farm Work
ers."
"Mayfair is unfair to every
one," he said.
"They take ten-cent candy
bars and sell them for 15 cents,"
one of the children said.
The teenagers chanted: "May
lair is unfair!"

At 4:15 p.m. a yellow Volvo
pulled up at the front entrance.
The driver was a man who
looked as though he was fresh
out of business school—green
ish brown suit and glasses with
thick black rims that were the
height of fashion on Madison
Avenue a few years back. On
the seat of the car was a pam
phlet "Is intelligence looking for
you?"
The man said he was man
ager of the shopping center
"Do you know this is private
property," he said.
Risco spoke about the right
to picket.
"There have been complaints
about the pickets blocking door
ways," the man said.
(Actually the teenagers had
partly blocked a door by stand
ing near it and parking their
bikes there.)
The manager went into the
store for a few minutes, then
drove off and parked a short
distance away.
Police Arrive
At 5:10 two policemen ar
rived in separate cars.
The shopping center manager

went over to meet them and
shook their hands.
After consultation they came
over to Risco. They said the
shopping center owner had
called them and was willing to
sign a warrant for the arrest
of picketers.
Risco explained the laws about
informational picketing. 'If you
arrest us and you are mistaken
we can sue you for false arrest,"
he said.
The police sergeant said he
would have to consult the City
Attorney. But it was after 5 p.m.
So the cops turned their atten
tion to the crowd of teenagers
who were watching nearby.
After some discussion the
teenagers dispersed.
The picket continued. Many
customers sympathized with the
boycott. But one woman seemed
shocked. Stanford students?!"
she said.
At 5:30 the picketers ran out
of leaflets and decided to go
home. Risco plans to continue
picketing Mayfair until the
chain gives in. Picketing will be
4:30-6:30 p.m. every day this
week.

to sell rested with his superiors.
The students began handing out
leaflets and walking up and
down with signs.
'Back To Mexico'
A crowd of teenage boys
watched the picketers from a
distance. "Go back to Mexico!'
they yelled.
When this had no effect they
came over to talk. Then severa
of them offered to carry signs.
A hostile Mayfair customei
looked at a teenager with sign
"Is he a farmworker?" he asked.
"No." — "What difference does
it make?" said one of the pick
eters.
"He's not old enough to buy
brandy," the man said and
stalked off.
A sub-teenager on a bike
looked at a sign reading "May
fair Is Unfair to Farm Work
ers."
"Mayfair is unfair to every
one," he said.
"They take ten-cent candy
bars and sell them for 15 cents,"
one of the children said.
The teenagers chanted: "May
lair is unfair!"

At 4:15 p.m. a yellow Volvo
pulled up at the front entrance.
The driver was a man who
looked as though he was fresh
out of business school—green
ish brown suit and glasses with
thick black rims that were the
height of fashion on Madison
Avenue a few years back. On
the seat of the car was a pam
phlet "Is intelligence looking for
you?"
The man said he was man
ager of the shopping center
"Do you know this is private
property," he said.
Risco spoke about the right
to picket.
"There have been complaints
about the pickets blocking door
ways," the man said.
(Actually the teenagers had
partly blocked a door by stand
ing near it and parking their
bikes there.)
The manager went into the
store for a few minutes, then
drove off and parked a short
distance away.
Police Arrive
At 5:10 two policemen ar
rived in separate cars.
The shopping center manager

went over to meet them and
shook their hands.
After consultation they came
over to Risco. They said the
shopping center owner had
called them and was willing to
sign a warrant for the arrest
of picketers.
Risco explained the laws about
informational picketing. 'If you
arrest us and you are mistaken
we can sue you for false arrest,"
he said.
The police sergeant said he
would have to consult the City
Attorney. But it was after 5 p.m.
So the cops turned their atten
tion to the crowd of teenagers
who were watching nearby.
After some discussion the
teenagers dispersed.
The picket continued. Many
customers sympathized with the
boycott. But one woman seemed
shocked. Stanford students?!"
she said.
At 5:30 the picketers ran out
of leaflets and decided to go
home. Risco plans to continue
picketing Mayfair until the
chain gives in. Picketing will be
4:30-6:30 p.m. every day this
week.
Friday about ten Stanford stu
dents picketed a Mayfair super
market in Palo Alto in support
of the Delano grape-workers'
strike. They returned over the
weekend and will continue pick
eting this week.
The Mayfair chain sells Elev
en Cellars Port, A. R. Murrow
brandy and other Perelli-Mi
netti products. Perelli-Minetti
has refused to deal with a union
organized by the farmworkers.
A Mayfair store in San Jose is
also being picketed.
The students arrived Friday
afternoon at Mayfair market,
3922 Middlefield, together with
some local "non-students" and
Elizer Risco, a former Stanford
student who has been working
with the strikers in Delano. Ris
