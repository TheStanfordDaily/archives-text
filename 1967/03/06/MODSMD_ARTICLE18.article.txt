# Baseballers Continue Undefeated
## Cards Top Broncos Twice 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The powerful Stanford base
ball team soothed one very sore
spot in their history by thrash
ing Santa Clara twice last week
end, 7-2 and 8-1.
The Broncos took four of four
games last year to dash any
first place hopes the Indians
might have harbored.
Going in Friday's game at
Santa Clara neither squad had
been defeated, but Tribe slug
gers soon changed that. Bill
Holt and Ron Shotts led the
way with a combined total of
three singles, two doubles, and
two home runs over the week
end to smash any Santa Clara
chance for an undefeated sea
son.
Stanford plays UOP tomorrow
at Stockton.
Stingy Throwers
Although their team got them
20 hits for the two game series,
Stanford pitchers weren't lax.

Daro Quiring went all the way
Friday scattering seven hits.
Sandy Vance, who got strong
er as the game went along to put
Santa Clara down 1-2-3 in the
ninth, allowed only five hits.
Slow Start
The Indians didn't make much
noise against Bronco ace Jan
Dukes in the first five innings
Friday, but in the sixth they
scored five runs with four sin
gles and two doubles to finish
Dukes.
Quiring started it off with a
clean single up the middle. He
was sacrificed to second by
Frank Duffy and scored on a
stand up double into the left
field corner by Dick Swan. Bob
Boone singled to left, but Swan
slipped going around third and
held at third. However, Shotts
beat out a hit behind the bag at
third to score Swan. Marty Erck
then singled in Boone and Holt
hit his first double of the day to

drive in Shotts and move Erck
over to third.
Rhubarb
In the eighth, the Cards em
barrassed the Broncos complete
ly. The Broncos pitcher dusted
Schomaker with a fast ball un
der the chin. Schomaker made
a menacing move towards the
mound, and it took the umpires
to restore calm.
Schomaker returned to the
plate, and blasted the next pitch
over the left field fence. The
usually noisy Santa Clara fans
were noticeably silenced. The
pitcher saw his brushback back
fire.
The Indians didn't waste any
time Saturday. Swan singled to
center in the first and scored
when the right fielder dropped
Boone's high fly against the
fence in right field. Shotts then
hit a home run over the right
center field fence. It traveled
375 feet.

With a 3-0 lead Stanford add
ed some insurance in the third.
Swan got his second hit of the
day and moved to second on a
sharp single to left by Shotts.
Holt watched a strike and two
balls go by before he blasted a
400 foot drive that hit at the
base of the rugby stands behind
the left center field fence.
More Icing
Two Santa Clara errors, a
stolen base by Mark Marquess
and a force play gave Stanford
two more runs in the seventh.

stand up double into the left
field corner by Dick Swan. Bob
Boone singled to left, but Swan
slipped going around third and
held at third. However, Shotts
beat out a hit behind the bag at
third to score Swan. Marty Erck

drive in Shotts and move Erck
over to third.
Rhubarb
In the eighth, the Cards em
barrassed the Broncos complete
ly. The Broncos pitcher dusted
Schomaker with a fast ball un
der the chin. Schomaker made
a menacing move towards the
mound, and it took the umpires
to restore calm.
Schomaker returned to the
plate, and blasted the next pitch
over the left field fence. The
usually noisy Santa Clara fans
were noticeably silenced. The
pitcher saw his brushback back
fire.
The Indians didn't waste any
time Saturday. Swan singled to
center in the first and scored
when the right fielder dropped
Boone's high fly against the
fence in right field. Shotts then
hit a home run over the right
center field fence. It traveled
375 feet.

With a 3-0 lead Stanford add
ed some insurance in the third.
Swan got his second hit of the
day and moved to second on a
sharp single to left by Shotts.
Holt watched a strike and two
balls go by before he blasted a
400 foot drive that hit at the
base of the rugby stands behind
the left center field fence.
More Icing
Two Santa Clara errors, a
stolen base by Mark Marquess
and a force play gave Stanford
two more runs in the seventh.
The powerful Stanford base
ball team soothed one very sore
spot in their history by thrash
ing Santa Clara twice last week
end, 7-2 and 8-1.
The Broncos took four of four
games last year to dash any
first place hopes the Indians
might have harbored.
Going in Friday's game at
Santa Clara neither squad had
been defeated, but Tribe slug
gers soon changed that. Bill
Holt and Ron Shotts led the
way with a combined total of
three singles, two doubles, and
two home runs over the week
end to smash any Santa Clara
chance for an undefeated sea
son.
Stanford plays UOP tomorrow
at Stockton.
Stingy Throwers

20 hits for the two game series,
Stanford pitchers weren't lax.

ninth, allowed only five hits.

clean single up the middle. He
was sacrificed to second by
Frank Duffy and scored on a

held at third. However, Shotts
beat out a hit behind the bag at
third to score Swan. Marty Erck
