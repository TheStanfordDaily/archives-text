# Cards Bow To Bruins 75-47; Griffin Runs Down USC 81-79
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
Stanford shrugged off a 75-47
drubbing by UCLA Friday night
and came back to defeat USC
in a 81-79 thriller Saturday.
The Bruins had little trouble
handling Stanford's stall tactics
in the first half. A combination
of Stanford not hitting their few
shots and UCLA scoring nearly
every time they got the ball
spelled an early doom for the
Cards.
The stall, which was once ef
fective against the Bruins, was
useless as soon as they went
into a zone defense. Once in it,
Alcindor was able to maintain
his throne under the basket and
intimidate anyone who dared to
take a shot within ten feet of
him.
The Cards seemed unable to
relax against the number one
team in the nation. They failed
to score a field goal for the first
13 minutes of play, and ended
the first half trailing, 32-13.
Part of the reason for the low
score was the Indians' reluc
tance to shoot. Several times in
the first half they had what
seemed to be open shots, but
passed the ball back out away
from the dangerous reach of big
Lew.

In the second half Stanford
changed tactics, abandoning the
stall and starting a free shoot
ing attack. However UCLA's 19
point halftime lead was too
much for the Tribe to over
come.
Harris vs. Alcindor
Some of the most exciting ac
tion came in the last quarter,
when Art Harris dared to score
around Alcindor. Twice he
looped hook shots over and
through the towering, out
stretched arms.
Harris was high scorer for
Stanford with 13 points, and Mai
McElwain and Don Griffin
chipped in 10 points apiece.
The hot-shooting Bruins end
ed the game shooting 57 per
cent, while the Cards hit only
38 per cent from the floor.
Griffin Stomps Trojans
Don Griffin had the hot hand
Saturday night as he scored 30
points against USC. Eight of
those points came on fast
breaks started by Art Harris.
Four times in the second half
Harris lofted full court passes
to the springing Griffin, who
caught them in stride and layed
them up.
With the score tied 55-55 in

the second half, Griffin scored
8 straight points on three field
goals and a pair of free throws.
The Cards were never headed
after that, though things got
closer before the contest ended.
Leading 71-64 with 3:10 left
to play, Stanford went into a
stall. With the Trojans fouling
in an attempt to get the ball,
the Cards missed only one of
their free throws and were able
to keep their seven point lead
until only 36 seconds remained
to play.
Trojans Pull Within Two Points
Then Bill Hewitt was fouled
while making a lay-up and
scored 3 points to close the gap
to four points. The Indians then
lost the ball on a turnover, and
SC scored again with 18 seconds
left to make the score 79-77.
Gary Petersmeyer was fouled
the next time down the court
insured the victory with a pair
of free throws. Hewitt dropped
in another basket as the buzzer
sounded to make the margin of
victory only two points.
Mai McElwain was second in
scoring for Stanford with 13
points, 8 of which were collect
ed in the first half. Art Harris
followed with 12 points.

Alcindor was able to maintain
his throne under the basket and
intimidate anyone who dared to
take a shot within ten feet of
him.
The Cards seemed unable to
relax against the number one
team in the nation. They failed
to score a field goal for the first
13 minutes of play, and ended
the first half trailing, 32-13.
Part of the reason for the low
score was the Indians' reluc
tance to shoot. Several times in
the first half they had what
seemed to be open shots, but
passed the ball back out away
from the dangerous reach of big
Lew.

In the second half Stanford
changed tactics, abandoning the
stall and starting a free shoot
ing attack. However UCLA's 19
point halftime lead was too
much for the Tribe to over
come.
Harris vs. Alcindor
Some of the most exciting ac
tion came in the last quarter,
when Art Harris dared to score
around Alcindor. Twice he
looped hook shots over and
through the towering, out
stretched arms.
Harris was high scorer for
Stanford with 13 points, and Mai
McElwain and Don Griffin
chipped in 10 points apiece.
The hot-shooting Bruins end
ed the game shooting 57 per
cent, while the Cards hit only
38 per cent from the floor.
Griffin Stomps Trojans
Don Griffin had the hot hand
Saturday night as he scored 30
points against USC. Eight of
those points came on fast
breaks started by Art Harris.
Four times in the second half
Harris lofted full court passes
to the springing Griffin, who
caught them in stride and layed
them up.
With the score tied 55-55 in

the second half, Griffin scored
8 straight points on three field
goals and a pair of free throws.
The Cards were never headed
after that, though things got
closer before the contest ended.
Leading 71-64 with 3:10 left
to play, Stanford went into a
stall. With the Trojans fouling
in an attempt to get the ball,
the Cards missed only one of
their free throws and were able
to keep their seven point lead
until only 36 seconds remained
to play.
Trojans Pull Within Two Points
Then Bill Hewitt was fouled
while making a lay-up and
scored 3 points to close the gap
to four points. The Indians then
lost the ball on a turnover, and
SC scored again with 18 seconds
left to make the score 79-77.
Gary Petersmeyer was fouled
the next time down the court
insured the victory with a pair
of free throws. Hewitt dropped
in another basket as the buzzer
sounded to make the margin of
victory only two points.
Mai McElwain was second in
scoring for Stanford with 13
points, 8 of which were collect
ed in the first half. Art Harris
followed with 12 points.
Stanford shrugged off a 75-47
drubbing by UCLA Friday night
and came back to defeat USC
in a 81-79 thriller Saturday.
The Bruins had little trouble
handling Stanford's stall tactics
in the first half. A combination
of Stanford not hitting their few
shots and UCLA scoring nearly
every time they got the ball
spelled an early doom for the
Cards.
The stall, which was once ef
fective against the Bruins, was
useless as soon as they went
into a zone defense. Once in it,
Alcindor was able to maintain
his throne under the basket and
intimidate anyone who dared to
take a shot within ten feet of
him.
