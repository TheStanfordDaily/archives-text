# Trojan Depth Washes Out Indian AAWU Title Hopes
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Southern Cal's depth posted
the Trojans to their eighth con
secutive AAWU swimming
championship last weekend in
Eugene, Ore. Stanford finished
second with 229 points to USC's
295. UCLA wound up third with
138, Oregon fourth with 111.
Stanford won 8 of the 18
events in the meet, with Dick
Roth and Greg Buckingham in
the lead. The Trojans won only
five, but saturated the finals in
nearly every event to pile up de
cisive points.
Roth, the only triple gold
medal winner of the meet, set
AAWU records on the way to
victories in the 200 IM (1:58.8),
400 IM (4:18.4), and 200 back
stroke (1:59.5). Buckingham
lowered his NCAA record for
500 free to 4:42.3 and won the
200 free in 1.43.4.
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton won the 200 fly
and set an NCAA record 16:33.8
for the 1650 as he upset Buck
ingham.

Oregon's Bob Boyer hit the
fastest 50 so far in the country,
21.1, for a new conference rec
ord. USC's Don Havens swept
away the 100 free in a confer
ence record 46.7. Rick McDer
mott of USC won both the 1-me
ter and 3-meter diving.
UCLA, USC Win Relays
UCLA took the medley relay
in 3:35.7, and USC won both
freestyle relays. The Trojans'
3:09.1 400 free relay stood for a
conference record and their
7:05.1 800 free relay also set an
AAWU meet record.
Bob Momsen took the 200
breaststroke in 2:16.0. Luis Nic
olao won the 100 fly easily in
51.7. Bill Kee tied for the 100
backstroke crown in 55.6.
Pete Siebert placed second be
hind Roth in the 200 IM (2:00.9)
and took third in both the 200
back (2:02.6) and the 400 IM
(4:23.0).
Hart Grabs Third
Bob Hart came up with con
sistent efforts, taking third in
the 100 back .1 second out of

first, fourth in the 200 back
(2:04.2) and eighth in the 200
IM (2:04.3). Morgan Manning's
third place in the 100 breast
(1:03.0) came as a surprise.
Stanford performances, with
several exceptions, were slower
than times of the USC-UCLA
weekend. Stanford did not peak
for the meet or "shave down"
as did a number of USC swim
mers.
Gamble That Failed
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
felt that a prolonged "sprint
down" period before the
AAWU's would have seriously
jeopardized the Cards' perform
ances in the NCAA's three
weeks from now.
Gaughran stated that, though
the disappointing results of the
AAWU's definitely do not elimi
nate the Indians from NCAA
title contention, "we will have
to get considerably better ef
forts, especially from our sec
ond and third men, if we hope
to compete with Indiana, Yale,
and USC."

third place in the 100 breast
(1:03.0) came as a surprise.
Stanford performances, with
several exceptions, were slower
than times of the USC-UCLA
weekend. Stanford did not peak
for the meet or "shave down"
as did a number of USC swim
mers.
Gamble That Failed
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
felt that a prolonged "sprint
down" period before the
AAWU's would have seriously
jeopardized the Cards' perform
ances in the NCAA's three
weeks from now.
Gaughran stated that, though
the disappointing results of the
AAWU's definitely do not elimi
nate the Indians from NCAA
title contention, "we will have
to get considerably better ef
forts, especially from our sec
ond and third men, if we hope
to compete with Indiana, Yale,
and USC."

secutive AAWU swimming

AAWU records on the way to
victories in the 200 IM (1:58.8),
400 IM (4:18.4), and 200 back

lowered his NCAA record for

mott of USC won both the 1-me
ter and 3-meter diving.
UCLA, USC Win Relays
UCLA took the medley relay
in 3:35.7, and USC won both
freestyle relays. The Trojans'

AAWU meet record.
Bob Momsen took the 200
breaststroke in 2:16.0. Luis Nic
