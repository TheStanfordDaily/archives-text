### JOHN MERRILL 
Stanford's attempt to regain
the Big Game Scrum Axe from
California after three years fail
ed Saturday as the Indians were
swamped by a second-half surge
that led Cal to a 28-6 victory
over the Cards.
Stanford had an eight point
buffer in the series going into
the game having defeated Cal at
Berkeley last week in the open
ing game of the series, 22-14.
Cal scored 22 points in the
second period to Stanford's 0

and won both the game and the
scrum axe handily.
Stanford opened the scoring
as Mike Grace booted a pair of
25 yard penalty kicks to put
Stanford in an early 6-0 lead.
Cal countered with two tries.
Lloyd Reist scored on a recover
ed fumble for the Bears and
Jerry Bradley blocked a Stan
ford kick and ran in for the
score.
Randy Thaman, Cal's kicking
star raised Stanford's hopes,
having no success for Cal in two

conversions and three penalty
attempts in the first half.
That Other Half
The second half was a differ
ent story for Stanford, Cal, and
Thaman. The Indians, already
without Blaine Nye, had lost
Mike Grace in the first half, and
let down.
But Cal's Thaman went wild,
scoring on 25, 35, and 40 yard
kicks to secure a 14-8 lead. Tha
man scored 16 points in the
second half. Cal's Jim Boyce
also scored a try.
