The steering committee of the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford took its first action Friday
night when it gave ill-defined approval to the
right of women to live off campus and referred
other pressing residence problems, including
the Wilbur Experiment, to a subcommittee. We
commend the committee's promptness in consid
ering these issues, but feel many questions are
left unanswered.
When the committee states that it "sees no
basis for discriminating between men and wom
en, especially those over twenty-one," we won
der whether it is endorsing a completely new
residence policy or simply opting for superficial
modifications. Either the committee sees a basis
for discriminating against women under 21 or it
does not, and its statement leaves us no choice
but to guess at the answer. If it does indeed sup
port limitation of the off-campus option to wom
en over 21, it is approving a continuation, albeit
slightly modified of a wholly unacceptable dou
ble standard. If it does not support this limita
tion, it should have left no doubt as to its inten
tions, because its present statement could lead
to an administration ruling that, because of
"practical considerations," only women over 21
will be allowed to live off campus.
The decision to refer other residence prob
lems to subcommittee was not unexpected.
Stanford's residence program needs immediate
attention and this quick start is promising. But
we trust the referral is not intended to prevent
implementation of the Wilbur Experiment for
next year. The work of the Housing Commis
sion offers ample evidence that this proposal
has already undergone careful consideration,

and its institution next year demands immed
iate action. The steering committee's arguments
for not submitting the "Off" issue to subcommit
tee, that it had been carefully considered and
demanded quick action, seem to apply at least
as well to the Wilbur Experiment. The experi
ment would be an invaluable guide to the com
mittee as it attempts to define the goals of a
residence university, and as such should be
quickly implemented.
The establishment of the subcommittee resur
rects the distasteful issue of selection. Accord
ing to the steering committee statement, Mr.
Packer has been asked to propose names for
the subcommittee and to "circulate them."
While his choices may be well-qualified individ
uals, we reaffirm our belief that selection by
one member of the community, even after con
sultation with others, implies an impartiality
and intelligence we do not believe any one man
possesses.
The committee is still in the process of re
vising its agenda, and when the final form is
decided, the steering committee must report
each suggestion made to it, with its decision and
the reasons for that decision. When the com
mittee reaches any conclusion it has an obliga
tion to the community to publicize not only the
decision itself, but also the rationale and argu
ments on both sides that led to the decision. We
hope that the thought and deliberation leading
up to these decisions are not, either in their
substance or in the light in which they are pre
sented, such that they cannot be revealed to the
community.
