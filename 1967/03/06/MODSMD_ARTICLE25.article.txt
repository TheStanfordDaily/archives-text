## Keeping A Breast In The War

Dave Van Ronk — formerly
employed painting the eyes on
Mickey Mouse watches, now
turned to city blues — once said:
"I can tell a lie, but I can't sing
one." On a minimum of reflec
tion one is immediately struck
by the intriguing relationship
between government, business,
and the written word; or in other
words, how might we determine
If there by any significant com
ponent of entertainment in our
present war effort?
To sing is not the sole expres
sion of entertainment, which
might — leaving aside wit- and
satire for the moment — be de
fined as "to consider with favor"
or "to show hopsitality to." How
ever shall we know our pursuit
of such noble ends? I suggest
that we let the record speak. We
have only to look to the written
word as the adequate expression
of an off-key government's har
monious crescendoes with the
Great Conductor of American
life — The Entrepreneur.

To disturb the melodic state
ment of the principals would not
only be critically irresponsible; it
would violate the prevalent mode
of paying homage to the sacred
ness of form. One must at times
merely listen, and assume the
ultimate wisdom of the political
platitude: "Speak what words
you will, and let them lie where
they fall."
A debt of thanks to AP for
sending out the following, and to
The Chambers Brothers who
chide: "You can run, honey, but
you sure can't hide!"
"A businessman revealed
plans yesterday to 'bring Ameri
ca to our boys overseas' by open
ing a topless Go-Go discotheque
in Vietnam. 'We think this will
be fun for the Gl's," said Richard
L. Bast of Washington. 'This will
be the sort of club servicemen
are used to at home, but can't
find in Saigon.' "
Only the Best
"He said the firm of Redex-
Vietnam, Inc. is selecting 10 to

25 American girls 'of high cali
ber' to open in the club in about
eight weeks. 'We feel this enter
tainment will be well-received,'
said Bast, a frequent visitor in
Asia.
'The topless idea originally
came from the military itself.
An Army colonel friend pointed
out that servicemen are shipped
from San Francisco and are used
to topless girls. Then they go to
Vietnam and find nothing like
home. This can be a morale prob
lem,' Bast said. 'We want our
girls to contribute to the war ef
fort. During the day they may
visit hospitals."
"Bast said his associate in the
night club is Nguyen Ba Hung of
Saigon. He said a license (empha
sis added) to operate the club has
been approved. Prospective re
cruits are to be given lie detector
tests, he said. 'We'd be out of
business fast if we shipped some
Communists over there. These
are going to be nice, wholesome
American girls.' Newspaper ads

require applicants to be between
21 and 26, single, and willing to
sign a six-month contract which
stipulates they remain unwed.
'We don't want any hard bitten
strippers,' Bast said."
"The Treasury Department
denied today all pending requests
for licenses from Americans to
send money to foreign relief
agencies for medical supplies to
North Vietnam. Neither
Canadian Friends Service Com
mittee nor the International
Committee of the Red Cross has
been permitted to station repre
sentatives in North Vietnam, the
Treasury said.
"Funds in the pending appli
cation were earmarked for those
agencies, especially Canadians
Friends. Last month, the Trea
sury asked banks in Canada to
co-operate in cutting off funds
from Americans to the Canadian
Friends organization for pur
chase of medical supplies for
North Vietnam."
" 'There is no assurance that
the supplies will in fact be de
voted to the nonmilitary pur
poses intended by the donors,
and the U.S. Government does
not, therefore, believe it proper
to issue further licenses under
such circumstances,' the Trea
sury stated." (AP 2-27-67).
An interesting definition of
license: a freedom that allows or
is used with irresponsibility.
