## CIA A Front For Classics 
### Bob Fishman 
Last year, I was the first to re
veal that the Stanford Classics
Department is a front f'>r the
CIA.
But this year, I have even more
startling information to disclose:
The CIA is a front for the Stan
ford Classics Department.
It must be obvious by now that
the CIA is not working for the
United States government. But
only a few have realized that so
called CIA failures are the re
sult of a conspiracy hatched ten
years ago under a palm tree in
Inner Quad.
Desperate for funds, the Clas
sics professors at first rejected
suggestions that they branch out
into real estate speculation or
atomic physics.
The Big Choice
Finally, a young student of
Herodotus suggested that the de
partment infiltrate a govern
mental agency and use it for
scholarly ends. After ruling out
Health, Education, and Welfare
(it was already taken), the De
partment settled on the CIA.
Carefully • selected graduate
students were dispatched to
Washington. They kept apart,
meeting only every other Tues

day for secret instructions and
dramatic readings from the Iliad.
Within five years, they con
trolled the agency.
Remember the U-2 flights?
Even the Russians thought their
purpose was to photograph mis
sile installations. But I can now
divulge that their real target was
Professor Novisbirsky's exca
vations in the southwestern
Ikraine. (The noted Russian clas
sicist had been attempting to
prove that Troy was really a
Slavic trading post.)
Classic Ruses
Thanks to the U-2 photos, Stan
ford authorities were able to pub
lish a brilliant rebuttal six
months before the Russians
made public their findings.
Another brilliant CIA • Stan
ford Classics ruse was the so
called Bay of Pigs "invasion."
Such a ridiculous project was ob
viously never intended to suc
ceed. Its critics were ignorant,
however, of the ancient Roman
legend — first spotted in the mar
gin of a third-year Latin text —
that one of Caesar's legionnaires
discovered America. As any
street urchin can tell you, the
galley was wrecked during an

all-day orgy just outside the Bay
of Pigs.
While the Cubans created a
diversion on the beach, classics
trained scuba divers searched for
the wreckage. Although all their
findings have not examined
yet, it looks as if Italians discov
ered America after all.
The American public still be
lieves that the CIA subsidized
the National Student Association
to encourage student spying. But
the "spies" were really traveling
classics students in disguise.
I know what you're thinking:
The Classics Department has
shamefully violated the Funda
mental Standard. But before you
condemn, remember this: The
Stanford Classics Department
has to compete with hundreds of
others for the hearts and minds
of classicists throughout the
world. Many of the other depart
ments are subsidized by their
governments for proaganda pur
poses. How can a department
which believes in free enterprise
hold its own without secret gov
ernment subsidies?
Yes, gentlemen, it was a clever
scheme, but I warn you: the Jig
Is up!

into real estate speculation or
atomic physics.
The Big Choice
Finally, a young student of
Herodotus suggested that the de
partment infiltrate a govern
mental agency and use it for
scholarly ends. After ruling out
Health, Education, and Welfare
(it was already taken), the De
partment settled on the CIA.
Carefully • selected graduate
students were dispatched to
Washington. They kept apart,
meeting only every other Tues

day for secret instructions and
dramatic readings from the Iliad.
Within five years, they con
trolled the agency.
Remember the U-2 flights?
Even the Russians thought their
purpose was to photograph mis
sile installations. But I can now
divulge that their real target was
Professor Novisbirsky's exca
vations in the southwestern
Ikraine. (The noted Russian clas
sicist had been attempting to
prove that Troy was really a
Slavic trading post.)
Classic Ruses
Thanks to the U-2 photos, Stan
ford authorities were able to pub
lish a brilliant rebuttal six
months before the Russians
made public their findings.
Another brilliant CIA • Stan
ford Classics ruse was the so
called Bay of Pigs "invasion."
Such a ridiculous project was ob
viously never intended to suc
ceed. Its critics were ignorant,
however, of the ancient Roman
legend — first spotted in the mar
gin of a third-year Latin text —
that one of Caesar's legionnaires
discovered America. As any
street urchin can tell you, the
galley was wrecked during an

all-day orgy just outside the Bay
of Pigs.
While the Cubans created a
diversion on the beach, classics
trained scuba divers searched for
the wreckage. Although all their
findings have not examined
yet, it looks as if Italians discov
ered America after all.
The American public still be
lieves that the CIA subsidized
the National Student Association
to encourage student spying. But
the "spies" were really traveling
classics students in disguise.
I know what you're thinking:
The Classics Department has
shamefully violated the Funda
mental Standard. But before you
condemn, remember this: The
Stanford Classics Department
has to compete with hundreds of
others for the hearts and minds
of classicists throughout the
world. Many of the other depart
ments are subsidized by their
governments for proaganda pur
poses. How can a department
which believes in free enterprise
hold its own without secret gov
ernment subsidies?
Yes, gentlemen, it was a clever
scheme, but I warn you: the Jig
Is up!
Last year, I was the first to re
veal that the Stanford Classics
Department is a front f'>r the
CIA.
But this year, I have even more
startling information to disclose:
The CIA is a front for the Stan
ford Classics Department.
It must be obvious by now that
the CIA is not working for the
United States government. But
only a few have realized that so
called CIA failures are the re
sult of a conspiracy hatched ten
years ago under a palm tree in
Inner Quad.
Desperate for funds, the Clas
sics professors at first rejected
suggestions that they branch out
into real estate speculation or
atomic physics.
