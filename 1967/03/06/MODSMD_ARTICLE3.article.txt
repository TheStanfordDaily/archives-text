# Committee Releases Draft Report
## Panel Faults Draft Proposals 
### DAN SNELL 
Julian Bond, representative in the
Georgia legislature, said in a confer
ence on the draft held in TMU yester
day afternoon, that he opposes the
idea of having "a military of any
form in the United States."
Bond, who was denied his seat in
the legislature three times allegedly
because of his opposition to the draft,
went on to say that for the sake of
argument he would accept the prem
ise that a military was necessary. In
that case, he told the fifty persons
present, "a completely voluntary
army would be the only fair estab
lishment."
Earlier in the conference, which
was sponsored by the Political Union
and the American Friends Service
Committee, Bruce Chapman, author
of The Wrong Man in Uniform and
adviser to Michigan's Governor
George Romney, tried to show that a
voluntary army could meet the pres
ent military needs of the country.
Chapman said that the Pentagon is
ignoring basic changes that have
come about recently in its require
ments for manpower. Among these
are the surfeit of men who are now
of draft age and the diminuation of
the need for the common foot sol
dier.
Terrence Cullinan, a manpower
economist in the Stanford Research
Institute, the third member of the
panel, said that the report of the
President's commission on the se
lective service released Saturday was
"essentially a farce" because commis
sion members did not seriously con
sider any changes in the present sys
tem. Cullinan advocated replacing the
draft with a lottery to take place
when young men were 18 or 19.
If a person did not want to partici
pate in the lottery, he could volun
teer for the armed services or for a
government - approved non - military
service of comparable duration like
the Peace Corps. Cullinan does not
see this as a final answer to the
problems of the inequities of the pres
ent draft laws, but he said he felt this

proposal might practically be adopted
when the Selective Service Act comes
up for renewal in June of this year.
Bond opposed Secretary of Defense
McNamara's proposal for universal
military training as being much too
expensive. lie also said that Cullinan's
national service proposal was "invol
untary servitude" and said he believed
it would be in violation of the thir
teenth amendment to the Constitu
tion.
Chapman emphasized that the draft
costs much more than it is worth in
psychological problems engendered in
draftees and in those who escape the
draft. As well, he said, the draft costs
the economy much money that is lost
because of the high turnover in the
armed forces and in the consequent
increase in the number of veterans
who are eligible for veterans' bene
fits.
Cullinan felt that the lottery aspect
of his system would help combat the
predominance of lower class men in
the lower ranks of the military and
would give everyone a more equal
chance to escape being drafted. His
system also would eliminate the "sev
en-year period of uncertainty"
through which young men now go
since they would participate in the
lottery only once. He said arguments
against alternative service in the
Peace Corps that no one could equate
military with non-military service
were invalid because no one could
equate combat with non-combat ser
vice within the military.
After the three made their presen
tations, the conference split into dis
cussion groups to talk about the vari
ous aspects of the draft.

From the Associated Press
A limited lottery system and a
crack-down on student deferments
from the draft were among two of the
draft revision proposals recommended
by a Presidential commission over the
weekend.
The recommendations, the result
of a 20-man study of the Selective Ser
vice system, have been sent to Presi
dent Johnson for consideration before
the expiration of the present draft
law on June 30.
Included in the report are proposals
which would:
• Abolish the system of local draft
boards.
• Use more women in volunteer
non-combat military assignments to
reduce the draft of men for these
jobs.
• Correct inequities existing
among Negroes in the armed forces.
• Reject the idea of an all-volunteer
military service, system of universal
training, and either compulsory or
voluntary national service.

Headed by the former assistant At
torney General Burke Marshall, the
216-page document reported a "sub
stantial difference of opinion" on
student deferments, but presented
that the view that "deferments should
never be allowed to become, in effect
exemptions."
"All commission members agreed
that one of the gravest inequities in
the present system of deferments is
that what starts out as a temporary
deferment for college enrollment is
easily extended into a de facto exemp
tion — by graduate school, by occu
pation, by fatherhood, and ultimately
by the passage of time and advanced
age."
The report continued that, with
some exceptions "no new student de
ferments should be granted in the
future."
Students already in school, or men
in recognized apprentice training,
would be permitted to get their de
grees or finish the training, and then
they would go into the draft pool.
