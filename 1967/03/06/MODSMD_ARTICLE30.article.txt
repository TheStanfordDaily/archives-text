## Handling Of New Dorms Arouses Student Dismay 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As the two undergraduate
members of the Residence Pro
gram Sub-committee of CUE
which advised the architects and
planned the programs of the
Moore and Jacks Halls last year,
we would like to comment on
the recent decision to postpone
indefinitely the construction of
the two new dormitories.
We find we must endorse the
decision, but with considerable
reluctance, even though the rea
sons provided by the adminis
tration seem quite rational. Due
to a general tightening of the
economy because of the Viet
nam war, adequate federal finan
cing is not available, at least
for Jacks.
Also we are told that the
planning of the educational pro
gram of the two houses, includ
ing the recruitment of faculty
associates, had not progressed
as far as the structural design
of the buildings.
With the general review of
housing being undertaken by
the Packer Committee, includ
ing an evaluation of the ASSU

Housing Commission's report
and of the Grove House experi
ment, the whole picture of hous
ing at Stanford has altered
somewhat, and we are told thnt
the University must proceed
with caution in making new
housing policy because of all the
mistakes of the past.
We accept the postponement
because we could not, after all,
be aware of the financial prob
lems. We would, however, have
liked to have seen at least one
of the new dorms built, sincp
we are sure that they would
have provided the best housing
now available on campus, no
matter what.
We are extremely dismayed
that the many hours we spent
in committee meetings last year
working with the architects and
doing our best to interpret stu
dent opinion to them seem tt>
have been wasted.
Even more dismaying-, how
ever, is the patent attempt o!
the administration to cover u]
one of the greater boondoggle?
in Stanford's history. Time an'l
again last year, we as students
asked the committee to begin
thinking ahead about some of
the broader educational issuer
involved with the new dorm~
such as selection of students
and faculty, what kind of aon
demic program they should
have, and how to keep Stem.
Wilbur, Flo Mo, and the res*
from becoming third-class dorm?
instead of merely second-class
ones.
Instead were were told tint
these issues would be
in detail next year (i.e., this
year). When we joined the com
mittee, most of the basic deci
sions about size, coeducation
and location had already been
made, without consultation of
students, as far as we know. We
could only accept these deci
sions.
But to our horror we found
the great majority of our time
in committee meetings taken uo
with the discussion of such
items as the size of the closets,
the number of sinks in the bath
rooms, and whether girls likÂ°
showers more than bathtubs!
This academic year our sub
committee has had one meeting,
on Friday of dead week autumn
quarter, which was not very
convenient for the student mem
bers. We went over the latest
designs of the Jacks House,
which was shelved a month
later. Again we tried to bring
up some of these other issues,
and again we were reassured
that there would be plenty of
time for that later on.
Needless to say, the priorities
of our sub-committee were poor
ly chosen. We trust our experi
ence is not representative of the
general administration of the
University. We know for a fact
that the parent Committee on
Undergraduate Education had
spent a great deal of time on
the educational program for
Moore-Jacks, and we can only
wonder why, if the Grove House
can be set up in a weekend,
Moore House can't be planned
in eighteen months.
Lest this letter be misinter
preted, we want to make it clear
that we are not trying to blame
any individuals for what has
happened. We ourselves are
somewhat to blame for not be
ing more aggressive about as
serting our prerogatives; we
have greatly enjoyed our hon
est relationships with men such
as Dean Hind, who have gen
erally tried to tell us the
straight story.
But we are bitter about at
tempts to rationalize mistakes
through distortion of fact. It
would indeed be ironic if the
Housing Commission's Report,
on which we both worked, and
which was intended to encour
age innovations in housing at
Stanford, instead becomes a ra
tionale for "proceeding cautious
ly" because "We no longer are
sure of what the students
want." Did you ever?
