# SES Steering Committee Approves 'OFF' Principle
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Undergraduate women who want
to move off campus have the blessing
of the steering committee of the Study
of Education at Stanford.
A statement issued after the com
mittee's Friday night meeting said
"With respect to "OFF," the commit
tee sees no basis for discriminating
between men and women, especially
those over twenty-one. The commit
tee expresses its interest to the Pro
vost's office in allowing experimenta

tion in the direction of making options
presently available to men equally
available to women beginning in the
fall of 1967."
Student Leaders Comment
Reactions of student leaders were
varied. "In a couple of years, Stan
ford may be human," commented ex-
President Dave Harris, referring to
the favorable attitude of the Packer
committee toward the OFF move
ment. Harris feels that the commit
tee is "the wrong mechanism doing
the right thing; that kind of decision
shouldn't have been taken from stu
dents in the first place."
Janet Howell, OFF leader, expressed
concern that the committee faces the
danger of making a "temporary" ar
rangement for the fall of '67 which
will continue the philosophical dilem
ma with different rules: the same
basic discrimination will exist with a
few exceptions being made on new
criteria, such as GPA, thus still allow
ing only a few to live off campus.
Herbert L. Packer, committee chair
man, indicated the committee would
not offer specifics on how to imple
ment "OFF." He added that the issue
had not gone through subcommittee
first because it needed quick action
and had already been thoroughly
hashed over by other groups.
In a second statement, the commit
tee announced it has given high prior
ity to a study of residence policies.
The statement reads, "The committee
endorsed assigning high priority to
this topic and asked the chairman to
propose names for membership on a
subcommittee on residence policies,
after consultation with interested
groups.
"Names will be circulated next week
and the subcommittee will be consti
tuted either during this week or at
the next meeting of the steering com

mittee on Monday evening, March
13."
Harris and Tom Forstenzer, Speak
er of the Legislature, strongly favor
inclusion of members of the ASSU
Housing Commission in the Packer
subcommittee, as they are the "fac
ulty and students with the most ex
pertise."
Packer noted that proposals for
freshmen living next year, including
that of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion, will be carefully considered by
this subcommittee.
Hostels' Values Debated
A third specific issue which the
steering committee examined on Fri
day was Mike Collins' suggestion that
Spring hostels be organized for stu
dents to meet members of the steer
ing committee.
Packer said the committee is in
general agreement with the student
body president's idea for greater in
teraction, but feels off-campus hostels
are not the correct approach. They
feel such meetings should be on-cam
pus since it is here that the study is
being made. It would also be easier
than traveling away for a whole week
end, Packer added.
Forstenzer, although generally in
favor of the hostels as a means of
creating good "ambience," fears that
the focus may be misplaced: "the
real problem is in getting a real say
in what goes on," and not in the
hostels' existence per se.
The steering committee met for
over three and a half hours Friday.
President Sterling attended the begin
ning of the meeting. Packer described
the gathering as, "a long and fruit
ful meeting devoted to general issues
of educational policy."
During the next week, the commit
tee will continue to revise the agenda
and its office in Meyer Library is open
for students who wish to make sug
gestions.
