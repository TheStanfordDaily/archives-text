foreign intentions and capabilities.
Then an historical survey of Chinese
foreign policy from 1949 to 1966 will
be given. Next, analysis will be made
of China's views and uses of different
instruments of foreign policy, mili
tary force, foreign aid, international
law and organization, and propaganda.
Finally, an attempt will be made to
relate China's foreign policy to her
domestic conditions and policies.
