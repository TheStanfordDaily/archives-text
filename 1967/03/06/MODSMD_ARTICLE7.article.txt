# Sen. Hatfield On Students â€”- 'They're Great'
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily 
"Student activism is great." The
speaker was Senator Mark Hatfield of
Oregon, standing in the San Francisco
Airport parking lot. He will speak at
4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel this afternoon.
The Senator hastened to add that
he doesn't condone violence in ac
tivism but does feel "one of the press
ing issues of our time is to provide
channels for constructive utilization of
student energy."
These comments were just the be
ginning, as the Senator addressed
himself to student issues on his jour
ney from the airport to Stanford last
night.
As he entered a waiting Cadillac, he
noted that, "in politics there is a great
difference between theory and in
volvement. In the past, students have
not found normal chances to contrib

ute actively in politics. One of the
great responsibilities of my party is
to give students channels for this pur
pose."
Hatfield continued by saying that
present political structures are out
dated. He said facts are difficult to
obtain from the government, calling
this problem the "Constant Contradic
tion" or "The Crisis is Confusion."
On this subject, the Senator said,
"There is a subtle yet sinister policy
being followed by the Administration.
They claim that things are too com
plex for the laymen to deal with, caus
ing people to simply look to the gov
ernment for answers instead of ex
amining things themselves. I think
George Orwell should be required
reading for all Americans so they
can see where we're headed."
As the car sped down the Bayshore
Freeway, Hatfield turned back to stu
dent activism. He said that students

are activated in the right directions.
"The Civil flights Movement will be
looked back on as the golden hour for
students. That and the Peace Corps
has shown they have idealism and are
not just concerned with material gain
or prestige. I wish adults had as much
concern as students."
Asked whether students carried any
weight, Hatfield said very much so.
He cited last summer's Governor's
Conference as a time when students
were listened to. He added that he has
suggested to Senator Fulbright that
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee invite students and faculty to
testify on the effect of the war on
University campuses.
As the car passed a munition plant,
the Senator spoke about the draft.
"The present system is unworkable; it
must be abolished. The President's
committee is just tinkering with the
problem. They're just going to doctor

it up. I'm presenting a bill tomorrow
that calls for a professional army.
This is the only way to solve the man
powei turn-over problem. The lottery
is too dehuman. And those exams are
ridiculous."
A special gleam entered the Sena
tor's eyes as the car turned down
Palm Drive. He pointed to the left,
saying, "Hoo Tow is over there, isn't
it?"
He noted that the present is a time
of patience for universities. He said
that students and administrations
shouldn't be separated antagonists,
but should work together to exploit
student ideas for the well being of
both.
The trip was over. The father of
four, 7, 6 ,2, and 1, ("that's planned
parenthood") was back at Stanford
after six year's absence. He had cov
ered a lot coming from the airport, but.
as he said, "I like to hear my ideas."
