# Johnson Names Stanford Law Prof. To Head Labor Arbitration Committee
## 
### 
Last Friday President John
son named a Stanford professor
to head an emergency board
created under the Taft-Hartley
law in an effort to end the four
rnonths-old strike by electrical
workers against 13 major West
Coast shipyards.
The Stanford man is J. Keith
Mann, an associate dean and pro
fessor of law.
Other members of the board
are George E Reedy, Johnson's
former press secretary and now
president of the Struthers Re
search and Development Corp
oration, and Paul D. Han? -Â»n, an
attorney-arbitrator.
Possible Injunction
The emergency board will con
vene in San Francisco Monday
to hear the parties in the dis
pute, and "report to the Presi
dent shortly thereafter."
If the board recommends,
Johnson can direct the Justice
Department to seek a federal
court injunction ordering the
strikers back to work for 80
days.
According to reports from the
Texas White House, Johnson
acted after Defense Secretary

Robert S. McNamara "informed
the President that critical con
struction and repair work involv
ing ships needed for the Vietnam
sealift are being delayed by the
strike."
Fourth Invocation
This was the fourth time John
son has invoked the Taft-Hartley
Law to seek termination of
strikes held to affect the na
tion's security. In the current
case, the White House said, he
acted on recommendation of
McNamara, Labor Secretary W.
Willard Wirtz, and Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark.
