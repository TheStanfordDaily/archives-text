# Westward Move Part Of A Changing Quad
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER (Third in a series) 
With educational methods and departmental
specificatio: ns in constant flux, the School of
Humanities and Sciences, with its 24 diversified
department s, must face the never ending task
of preparing itself for the future.
To provide for that future, the School has
put into opv' 'ration a plan that will eventually
alleviate the already crowded quadrangle area:
Within te. ii to twenty years, all laboiatory
sciences, performing and visual arts, and
nearly all g i *aduate professional schools will
be housed in buildings independent of the
Quad area, t Only humanities and social and
behavioral sciences departments of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Schools of Engi
neering and I "arth Sciences, and the offices of
the President will remain on the Quad.
Renovate Or Relocate
This exodus from the Quad will permit here
tofore divided Humanities and Sciences de
partment to ur. ite under one roof in renovated
Quad buildings .
One such reh ocation will begin this summer
when the Biolo| ;y Department vacates decrepit
Jordan Hall for its new $4 9 million buildings
across the stre* ?t. Jordan Hall will then be
renovated for ui Je by the Psychology Depart
ment, presently inhabiting seven different
locations.
Jordan Hall 1 ias been termed "the least
efficient building in the university" by Donald
R. Price, Assista nt Dean of the School of
Humanities and S :iences and specialist on the
School's future hi Dusing needs. The building

will therefore undergo the same rejuvena
tion that modernized the old Physics Cor
ner into a modern Mathematics Center in
1964.
After the insides of the building are stripped
to the sandstone front, it will be rebuilt with
six modern floors of psychology classrooms,
laboratories, and offices. "Present plans call
for two large lecture halls as well as several
classrooms and seminar rooms," Price re
ports. Construction will last two years.
Nearly all Quad buildings will undergo a
similar renovation within the next few decades.
As funds become available, "we will make
more modern buildings with a more efficient
use of space," according to Price. Plans in
clude improved lighting, air conditioning, and
earthquake-proofing for all buildings to re
place "very high ceilings, poor stairways, and
a general uneconomic use of space."
Westward Movement
The School is in the midst of its renovation
and relocation plans. All three Humanities
and Sciences laboratory sciences — Physics,
Chemistry, Biology—will soon be in permanent
off-Quad residences. Communication, Compu
ter Science, and Statistics will be housed in
new or renovated buildings to the west of the
Quad
In addition, the performing and visual arts
—Music, Art and Architecture, and Speech and
Drama—have studios and theaters planned for
construction within ten years. And finally,
the graduate professional schools—Education,
Business, Medicine, Law — will all be inde
pendent of the Quad as soon as a new Law

School is built near the Undergraduate Li
brary.
Depending on the exact construction sched
ules for the above off-Quad structures, reno
vation of vacated Quad buildings should con
tinue constantly for at least ten years.
After the Jordan Hall refurbishing, the
Physiology Department —which will move into
a Pre clinical Sciences building near the Medi
cal School—will leave its sixty-year-old build
ing to the Sociology and Economics Depart
ments, who will share the space.
'Musical Chairs'
This move will greatly relieve the frustrat
ingly overcrowded History Corner which now
houses both History and Economics. "History
Corner should be for one of the departments,
certainly not both," claims Kenneth Cuth
bertson, University Vice President for Fi
nance. "They're having real trouble squeezing
in."
In another move, the Political Science De
partment will transfer from its inner Quad
position to the former Graduate School of
Business building. Linguistics, presently with
out a permanent home, will take Political Sci
ence's former position.
Political Science's next door neighbor on
the inner Quad, the Food Research Institute,
will relinquish its building to the nearby En
glish Department when the Institute moves
into its renovated Encina quarters in about
two years. The Institute's present building will
be remodeled into a two-story structure, giving
English needed offices and classrooms.
In addition, when the student services now
located on the inner Quad move to the Old

Union, two buildings will be open for academic
use. Anthropology will move into the build
ings and Philosophy will eventually take a
few classrooms after they are renovated.
Beyond Ten Years
Anthropology is now spread out among five
separate locations. The Humanities Special
Programs will move into Anthropology's main
building next to the church, thus relieving the
English Department's overcrowding.
Looking beyond the next ten years, the Law
School will leave Quad space when it moves
to its planned building. The present Law
building has already been designated the fu
ture home of the Modern European Languages
Department, French and Italian, and language
labs. When Modern European Languages
moves from its space across from the Main
Library, the Asian Language and Classics De
partments will take the room presently oc
cupied by all three.
Although no plans have been finalized, Price
indicated that those buildings on the Quad
occupied by the Engineering and Earth Sci
ences Schools may some day be turned over to
Humanities and Sciences. A new major build
ing for the School of Engineering may be con
structed at the present site of the police
station and fire house.
Even the vacation of this space—a large
part of the Quad area—may be inadequate
for future growth. Present plans, then, may
have to be amended with "a substantial
amount of Humanities and Sciences expan
sion."
"We are planning now for no substantial
increase in enrollment," Price said. "But when

wo look 25 years ahead, no one is at all sure
what demands on our facilities will be."
Possible Discoveries
For that reason, a large amount of land is
reserved near the Undergraduate Library for
future Humanities and Sciences enlargement.
Price is hopeful, however, that the plan
now in operation—the exodus of graduate pro
fessional schools and laboratory sciences and
the "musical chairs" of the Humanities and
Sciences departments on the Quad —will pro
vide expanding room for all departments.
As Cuthbertson points out, however, these
intricate plans for Humanities and Sciences
growth arc subject to invention and discovery.
"Twenty-five years ago," Cuthbertson ex
plains, "no one could have predicted the im
pact that transistors and interplanetary space
craft—to mention only two scientific break
throughs—would have on Stanford."
A discovery in any field, then, may lead to
a sudden need for expansion or even the crea
tion of a completely new school or depart
ment, as was the case with Aeronautics and
Astronautics in the past decade. As another
example, the granting of departmental status
to divisions of existing departments such as
Spanish and Portuguese in the Department of
Modern European Languages could severely
tax available space-
A plan has been developed by the School
of Humanities and Sciences that will prepare
it for the future. How this plan will meet
the educational demands of the Stanford aca
demic community in this unpredictable future
remains the variable factor.

Business building. Linguistics, presently with
out a permanent home, will take Political Sci
ence's former position.
Political Science's next door neighbor on
the inner Quad, the Food Research Institute,
will relinquish its building to the nearby En
glish Department when the Institute moves
into its renovated Encina quarters in about
two years. The Institute's present building will
be remodeled into a two-story structure, giving
English needed offices and classrooms.
In addition, when the student services now
located on the inner Quad move to the Old

Union, two buildings will be open for academic
use. Anthropology will move into the build
ings and Philosophy will eventually take a
few classrooms after they are renovated.
Beyond Ten Years
Anthropology is now spread out among five
separate locations. The Humanities Special
Programs will move into Anthropology's main
building next to the church, thus relieving the
English Department's overcrowding.
Looking beyond the next ten years, the Law
School will leave Quad space when it moves
to its planned building. The present Law
building has already been designated the fu
ture home of the Modern European Languages
Department, French and Italian, and language
labs. When Modern European Languages
moves from its space across from the Main
Library, the Asian Language and Classics De
partments will take the room presently oc
cupied by all three.
Although no plans have been finalized, Price
indicated that those buildings on the Quad
occupied by the Engineering and Earth Sci
ences Schools may some day be turned over to
Humanities and Sciences. A new major build
ing for the School of Engineering may be con
structed at the present site of the police
station and fire house.
Even the vacation of this space—a large
part of the Quad area—may be inadequate
for future growth. Present plans, then, may
have to be amended with "a substantial
amount of Humanities and Sciences expan
sion."
"We are planning now for no substantial
increase in enrollment," Price said. "But when

wo look 25 years ahead, no one is at all sure
what demands on our facilities will be."
Possible Discoveries
For that reason, a large amount of land is
reserved near the Undergraduate Library for
future Humanities and Sciences enlargement.
Price is hopeful, however, that the plan
now in operation—the exodus of graduate pro
fessional schools and laboratory sciences and
the "musical chairs" of the Humanities and
Sciences departments on the Quad —will pro
vide expanding room for all departments.
As Cuthbertson points out, however, these
intricate plans for Humanities and Sciences
growth arc subject to invention and discovery.
"Twenty-five years ago," Cuthbertson ex
plains, "no one could have predicted the im
pact that transistors and interplanetary space
craft—to mention only two scientific break
throughs—would have on Stanford."
A discovery in any field, then, may lead to
a sudden need for expansion or even the crea
tion of a completely new school or depart
ment, as was the case with Aeronautics and
Astronautics in the past decade. As another
example, the granting of departmental status
to divisions of existing departments such as
Spanish and Portuguese in the Department of
Modern European Languages could severely
tax available space-
A plan has been developed by the School
of Humanities and Sciences that will prepare
it for the future. How this plan will meet
the educational demands of the Stanford aca
demic community in this unpredictable future
remains the variable factor.
(Next. An Overall Look)
With educational methods and departmental
specificatio: ns in constant flux, the School of
Humanities and Sciences, with its 24 diversified
department s, must face the never ending task
of preparing itself for the future.
To provide for that future, the School has
put into opv' 'ration a plan that will eventually
alleviate the already crowded quadrangle area:
Within te. ii to twenty years, all laboiatory
sciences, performing and visual arts, and
nearly all g i *aduate professional schools will
be housed in buildings independent of the
Quad area, t Only humanities and social and
behavioral sciences departments of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Schools of Engi
neering and I "arth Sciences, and the offices of
the President will remain on the Quad.
Renovate Or Relocate
This exodus from the Quad will permit here
tofore divided Humanities and Sciences de
partment to ur. ite under one roof in renovated
Quad buildings .
One such reh ocation will begin this summer
when the Biolo| ;y Department vacates decrepit
Jordan Hall for its new $4 9 million buildings
across the stre* ?t. Jordan Hall will then be
renovated for ui Je by the Psychology Depart
ment, presently inhabiting seven different
locations.
Jordan Hall 1 ias been termed "the least
efficient building in the university" by Donald
R. Price, Assista nt Dean of the School of
Humanities and S :iences and specialist on the
School's future hi Dusing needs. The building

will therefore undergo the same rejuvena
tion that modernized the old Physics Cor
ner into a modern Mathematics Center in
1964.
After the insides of the building are stripped
to the sandstone front, it will be rebuilt with
six modern floors of psychology classrooms,
laboratories, and offices. "Present plans call
for two large lecture halls as well as several
classrooms and seminar rooms," Price re
ports. Construction will last two years.
Nearly all Quad buildings will undergo a
similar renovation within the next few decades.
As funds become available, "we will make
more modern buildings with a more efficient
use of space," according to Price. Plans in
clude improved lighting, air conditioning, and
earthquake-proofing for all buildings to re
place "very high ceilings, poor stairways, and
a general uneconomic use of space."
Westward Movement
The School is in the midst of its renovation
and relocation plans. All three Humanities
and Sciences laboratory sciences — Physics,
Chemistry, Biology—will soon be in permanent
off-Quad residences. Communication, Compu
ter Science, and Statistics will be housed in
new or renovated buildings to the west of the
Quad
In addition, the performing and visual arts
—Music, Art and Architecture, and Speech and
Drama—have studios and theaters planned for
construction within ten years. And finally,
the graduate professional schools—Education,
Business, Medicine, Law — will all be inde
pendent of the Quad as soon as a new Law

School is built near the Undergraduate Li
brary.
Depending on the exact construction sched
ules for the above off-Quad structures, reno
vation of vacated Quad buildings should con
tinue constantly for at least ten years.
After the Jordan Hall refurbishing, the
Physiology Department —which will move into
a Pre clinical Sciences building near the Medi
cal School—will leave its sixty-year-old build
ing to the Sociology and Economics Depart
ments, who will share the space.
'Musical Chairs'
This move will greatly relieve the frustrat
ingly overcrowded History Corner which now
houses both History and Economics. "History
Corner should be for one of the departments,
certainly not both," claims Kenneth Cuth
bertson, University Vice President for Fi
nance. "They're having real trouble squeezing
in."

be housed in buildings independent of the
Quad area, t Only humanities and social and
behavioral sciences departments of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Schools of Engi
neering and I "arth Sciences, and the offices of
the President will remain on the Quad.
Renovate Or Relocate
This exodus from the Quad will permit here
tofore divided Humanities and Sciences de
partment to ur. ite under one roof in renovated
Quad buildings .
One such reh ocation will begin this summer
when the Biolo| ;y Department vacates decrepit
Jordan Hall for its new $4 9 million buildings
across the stre* ?t. Jordan Hall will then be
renovated for ui Je by the Psychology Depart
ment, presently inhabiting seven different
locations.
Jordan Hall 1 ias been termed "the least
efficient building in the university" by Donald
R. Price, Assista nt Dean of the School of
Humanities and S :iences and specialist on the
School's future hi Dusing needs. The building

will therefore undergo the same rejuvena
tion that modernized the old Physics Cor
ner into a modern Mathematics Center in
1964.
After the insides of the building are stripped
to the sandstone front, it will be rebuilt with
six modern floors of psychology classrooms,
laboratories, and offices. "Present plans call
for two large lecture halls as well as several
classrooms and seminar rooms," Price re
ports. Construction will last two years.
Nearly all Quad buildings will undergo a
similar renovation within the next few decades.
As funds become available, "we will make
more modern buildings with a more efficient
use of space," according to Price. Plans in
clude improved lighting, air conditioning, and
earthquake-proofing for all buildings to re
place "very high ceilings, poor stairways, and
a general uneconomic use of space."
Westward Movement
The School is in the midst of its renovation
and relocation plans. All three Humanities
and Sciences laboratory sciences — Physics,
Chemistry, Biology—will soon be in permanent
off-Quad residences. Communication, Compu
ter Science, and Statistics will be housed in
new or renovated buildings to the west of the
Quad
In addition, the performing and visual arts
—Music, Art and Architecture, and Speech and
Drama—have studios and theaters planned for
construction within ten years. And finally,
the graduate professional schools—Education,
Business, Medicine, Law — will all be inde
pendent of the Quad as soon as a new Law

School is built near the Undergraduate Li
brary.
Depending on the exact construction sched
ules for the above off-Quad structures, reno
vation of vacated Quad buildings should con
tinue constantly for at least ten years.
After the Jordan Hall refurbishing, the
Physiology Department —which will move into
a Pre clinical Sciences building near the Medi
cal School—will leave its sixty-year-old build
ing to the Sociology and Economics Depart
ments, who will share the space.
'Musical Chairs'
This move will greatly relieve the frustrat
ingly overcrowded History Corner which now
houses both History and Economics. "History
Corner should be for one of the departments,
certainly not both," claims Kenneth Cuth
bertson, University Vice President for Fi
nance. "They're having real trouble squeezing
in."
In another move, the Political Science De
partment will transfer from its inner Quad
position to the former Graduate School of
Business building. Linguistics, presently with
out a permanent home, will take Political Sci
ence's former position.
Political Science's next door neighbor on
the inner Quad, the Food Research Institute,
will relinquish its building to the nearby En
glish Department when the Institute moves
into its renovated Encina quarters in about
two years. The Institute's present building will
be remodeled into a two-story structure, giving
English needed offices and classrooms.
In addition, when the student services now
located on the inner Quad move to the Old

Union, two buildings will be open for academic
use. Anthropology will move into the build
ings and Philosophy will eventually take a
few classrooms after they are renovated.
Beyond Ten Years
Anthropology is now spread out among five
separate locations. The Humanities Special
Programs will move into Anthropology's main
building next to the church, thus relieving the
English Department's overcrowding.
Looking beyond the next ten years, the Law
School will leave Quad space when it moves
to its planned building. The present Law
building has already been designated the fu
ture home of the Modern European Languages
Department, French and Italian, and language
labs. When Modern European Languages
moves from its space across from the Main
Library, the Asian Language and Classics De
partments will take the room presently oc
cupied by all three.
Although no plans have been finalized, Price
indicated that those buildings on the Quad
occupied by the Engineering and Earth Sci
ences Schools may some day be turned over to
Humanities and Sciences. A new major build
ing for the School of Engineering may be con
structed at the present site of the police
station and fire house.
Even the vacation of this space—a large
part of the Quad area—may be inadequate
for future growth. Present plans, then, may
have to be amended with "a substantial
amount of Humanities and Sciences expan
sion."
"We are planning now for no substantial
increase in enrollment," Price said. "But when

wo look 25 years ahead, no one is at all sure
what demands on our facilities will be."
Possible Discoveries
For that reason, a large amount of land is
reserved near the Undergraduate Library for
future Humanities and Sciences enlargement.
Price is hopeful, however, that the plan
now in operation—the exodus of graduate pro
fessional schools and laboratory sciences and
the "musical chairs" of the Humanities and
Sciences departments on the Quad —will pro
vide expanding room for all departments.
As Cuthbertson points out, however, these
intricate plans for Humanities and Sciences
growth arc subject to invention and discovery.
"Twenty-five years ago," Cuthbertson ex
plains, "no one could have predicted the im
pact that transistors and interplanetary space
craft—to mention only two scientific break
throughs—would have on Stanford."
A discovery in any field, then, may lead to
a sudden need for expansion or even the crea
tion of a completely new school or depart
ment, as was the case with Aeronautics and
Astronautics in the past decade. As another
example, the granting of departmental status
to divisions of existing departments such as
Spanish and Portuguese in the Department of
Modern European Languages could severely
tax available space-
A plan has been developed by the School
of Humanities and Sciences that will prepare
it for the future. How this plan will meet
the educational demands of the Stanford aca
demic community in this unpredictable future
remains the variable factor.
(Next. An Overall Look)
With educational methods and departmental
specificatio: ns in constant flux, the School of
Humanities and Sciences, with its 24 diversified
department s, must face the never ending task
of preparing itself for the future.
To provide for that future, the School has
put into opv' 'ration a plan that will eventually
alleviate the already crowded quadrangle area:
Within te. ii to twenty years, all laboiatory
sciences, performing and visual arts, and
nearly all g i *aduate professional schools will
be housed in buildings independent of the
Quad area, t Only humanities and social and
behavioral sciences departments of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Schools of Engi

Union, two buildings will be open for academic
use. Anthropology will move into the build
ings and Philosophy will eventually take a
few classrooms after they are renovated.
Beyond Ten Years
Anthropology is now spread out among five
separate locations. The Humanities Special
Programs will move into Anthropology's main
building next to the church, thus relieving the
English Department's overcrowding.
Looking beyond the next ten years, the Law
School will leave Quad space when it moves
to its planned building. The present Law
building has already been designated the fu
ture home of the Modern European Languages
Department, French and Italian, and language
labs. When Modern European Languages
moves from its space across from the Main
Library, the Asian Language and Classics De
partments will take the room presently oc
cupied by all three.
Although no plans have been finalized, Price
indicated that those buildings on the Quad
occupied by the Engineering and Earth Sci
ences Schools may some day be turned over to
Humanities and Sciences. A new major build
ing for the School of Engineering may be con
structed at the present site of the police
station and fire house.
Even the vacation of this space—a large
part of the Quad area—may be inadequate
for future growth. Present plans, then, may
have to be amended with "a substantial
amount of Humanities and Sciences expan
sion."
"We are planning now for no substantial
increase in enrollment," Price said. "But when

wo look 25 years ahead, no one is at all sure
what demands on our facilities will be."
Possible Discoveries
For that reason, a large amount of land is
reserved near the Undergraduate Library for
future Humanities and Sciences enlargement.
Price is hopeful, however, that the plan
now in operation—the exodus of graduate pro
fessional schools and laboratory sciences and
the "musical chairs" of the Humanities and
Sciences departments on the Quad —will pro
vide expanding room for all departments.
As Cuthbertson points out, however, these
intricate plans for Humanities and Sciences
growth arc subject to invention and discovery.
"Twenty-five years ago," Cuthbertson ex
plains, "no one could have predicted the im
pact that transistors and interplanetary space
craft—to mention only two scientific break
throughs—would have on Stanford."
A discovery in any field, then, may lead to
a sudden need for expansion or even the crea
tion of a completely new school or depart
ment, as was the case with Aeronautics and
Astronautics in the past decade. As another
example, the granting of departmental status
to divisions of existing departments such as
Spanish and Portuguese in the Department of
Modern European Languages could severely
tax available space-
A plan has been developed by the School
of Humanities and Sciences that will prepare
it for the future. How this plan will meet
the educational demands of the Stanford aca
demic community in this unpredictable future
remains the variable factor.

With educational methods and departmental
specificatio: ns in constant flux, the School of
Humanities and Sciences, with its 24 diversified
department s, must face the never ending task
of preparing itself for the future.
To provide for that future, the School has
put into opv' 'ration a plan that will eventually
alleviate the already crowded quadrangle area:
Within te. ii to twenty years, all laboiatory
sciences, performing and visual arts, and
nearly all g i *aduate professional schools will
be housed in buildings independent of the
Quad area, t Only humanities and social and
behavioral sciences departments of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Schools of Engi
neering and I "arth Sciences, and the offices of
the President will remain on the Quad.
Renovate Or Relocate
This exodus from the Quad will permit here
tofore divided Humanities and Sciences de
partment to ur. ite under one roof in renovated
Quad buildings .
One such reh ocation will begin this summer
when the Biolo| ;y Department vacates decrepit
Jordan Hall for its new $4 9 million buildings
across the stre* ?t. Jordan Hall will then be
renovated for ui Je by the Psychology Depart
ment, presently inhabiting seven different
locations.
Jordan Hall 1 ias been termed "the least
efficient building in the university" by Donald
R. Price, Assista nt Dean of the School of
Humanities and S :iences and specialist on the
School's future hi Dusing needs. The building

will therefore undergo the same rejuvena
tion that modernized the old Physics Cor
ner into a modern Mathematics Center in
1964.
After the insides of the building are stripped
to the sandstone front, it will be rebuilt with
six modern floors of psychology classrooms,
laboratories, and offices. "Present plans call
for two large lecture halls as well as several
classrooms and seminar rooms," Price re
ports. Construction will last two years.
Nearly all Quad buildings will undergo a
similar renovation within the next few decades.
As funds become available, "we will make
more modern buildings with a more efficient
use of space," according to Price. Plans in
clude improved lighting, air conditioning, and
earthquake-proofing for all buildings to re
place "very high ceilings, poor stairways, and
a general uneconomic use of space."
Westward Movement
The School is in the midst of its renovation
and relocation plans. All three Humanities
and Sciences laboratory sciences — Physics,
Chemistry, Biology—will soon be in permanent
off-Quad residences. Communication, Compu
ter Science, and Statistics will be housed in
new or renovated buildings to the west of the
Quad
In addition, the performing and visual arts
—Music, Art and Architecture, and Speech and
Drama—have studios and theaters planned for
construction within ten years. And finally,
the graduate professional schools—Education,
Business, Medicine, Law — will all be inde
pendent of the Quad as soon as a new Law

School is built near the Undergraduate Li
brary.
Depending on the exact construction sched
ules for the above off-Quad structures, reno
vation of vacated Quad buildings should con
tinue constantly for at least ten years.
After the Jordan Hall refurbishing, the
Physiology Department —which will move into
a Pre clinical Sciences building near the Medi
cal School—will leave its sixty-year-old build
ing to the Sociology and Economics Depart
ments, who will share the space.
'Musical Chairs'
This move will greatly relieve the frustrat
ingly overcrowded History Corner which now
houses both History and Economics. "History
Corner should be for one of the departments,
certainly not both," claims Kenneth Cuth
bertson, University Vice President for Fi
nance. "They're having real trouble squeezing
in."
In another move, the Political Science De
partment will transfer from its inner Quad
position to the former Graduate School of
Business building. Linguistics, presently with
out a permanent home, will take Political Sci
ence's former position.
Political Science's next door neighbor on
the inner Quad, the Food Research Institute,
will relinquish its building to the nearby En
glish Department when the Institute moves
into its renovated Encina quarters in about
two years. The Institute's present building will
be remodeled into a two-story structure, giving
English needed offices and classrooms.
In addition, when the student services now
located on the inner Quad move to the Old

Union, two buildings will be open for academic
use. Anthropology will move into the build
ings and Philosophy will eventually take a
few classrooms after they are renovated.
