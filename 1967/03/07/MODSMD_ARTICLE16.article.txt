# FOUR FORFEITS COST 5-4 LOSS
## Stanford Boxers Lose Despite 3 KO's 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Plagued by four forfeits, the
Stanford boxing team was de
feated by the Chico State ring
men 5-4 Saturday night in Chico,
though the Indians knocked
down almost everything in
sight.
Stanford has forfeited all 125
and 132 pound matches this sea
son with no entries in either
division.
This meet, due to injuries to

Bill Thomas at 147 and John
Price, Stanford's top 165 pound
er, Stanford was behind 4-0 at
the outset.
The Magnificent Five
This left the Cards with only
five competitors, though they
very nearly pulled the meet out
anyway.
The first bout for Stanford
was in the 139 pound class with
Stanford's Dave Hibbits facing
Joe Talalero of Chico.

Both boxers were strong in
the opening round, but Tavaloro
had taken a lead in points by the
third round.
Hibbitts was staggered with
one good combination by Tav
alero, though was not in trouble,
when the referee stopped the
bout.
A Quick Decision
After the match Stanford
Coach Ray Lunny commented,
"Of course it's always better to
stop matches too early than too
late, but I definitely think this
was a little too quick."
Captain Jim Marlar was next
up for Stanford facing one of
the league's outstanding fight
ers. Jim Ishida of Chico.
The first round was even, with
both men seeking an opening.
In the second Marlar got to his
opponent with a series of sharp
punches.
Down For Fifteen?
Midway through the round,
Marlar put him down for what
seemed like a fifteen count
though the referee called it nine.
This got Ishida through the
round.
Marlar left no question in any
body's mind when, in the follow
ing round he ended it for good,
downing his opponent with a
sharp combination.
In the 172 pound bout, Stan
ford's defending league cham
pion in that division, Tom

Jenks, lost litle time in winning
his match.
Jenks Ends It Quickly
Perhaps worried about an
other long count, Jenks levelled
Steve Byers as he came off the
ropes early in the first round.
Though Byers was up at the
finish of the count, the referee
wisely stopped the bout giving
Jenks his fourth win of the
year against no losses and one
draw.
Boxing in the 180 class Stan
ford's Mike Palmer also left no
question in his bout with Jer
ome Circo of Chico.
Towards the end of the first
round, Palmer rocked Circo with
a left and then blasted him with
a right hand shot that left no
need for a referee's count. The
referee raised Palmer's hand,
giving him his third victory of
the season, for a 3-2-0 record.
In the final bout of the eve
ning, Stanford's Dave Oswald
simply outboxed his opponent,
Rich Penaluna, all the way and
gained a decisive decision.
Displaying an impressive box
ing style, Oswald was in charge
all the way, staggering Pena
luna on several occasions.
