# Lacrosse Romps Bears

### HUGH WEST 
Stanford's Lacrossemen proved
ingracious hosts to visiting Cali
fornia Saturday, crushing the
Bears 11-1, in the first of two
acts in the battle for the Aber
chrombie and Fitch Broken
Stick trophy.
Current possessors of the tro
phy, which goes to the annual
winner of the rivalry, the In
dians appeared well on their
way to keeping not only the
trophy, but also their Pacific
coast collegiate championship.
While the highly-touted Stan
ford defense played up to its
reputation, with Jack Dirman,
Pete "Puddin"' Eakland, Denny
MacNeely, Buck Wales, and Lar
ry Leech giving up only one

clear, the atack and midfields
found the scoring punch that
was a question mark up to game
time.
Atackmen Don Sangrey and
Clay Primrose both turned hat
tricks, attackman George Muser
and midfielder Sandy Saxton got
two goals apiece, and midfielder
Dirk Speas tickled the nets once.
Frustrated in his scoring all
afternoon, but bruising some
bodies in the process, Primrose
exploded for his there goals in
Stanford's six-goal last quarter.
Cal's lone fourth-quarter tally
came off the stick of John Bates,
as Stanford goalies Mel Ellis
and Hugh West had a fairly re
laxed afternoon.
