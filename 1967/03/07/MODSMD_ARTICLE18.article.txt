# Nebillcall Nailed; Otto-'How Boss!'
## 
### 
After a long layoff of mom
than a month, action resumed
tonight in the Western Califor
nia Casino League, as Crane de
stroyed Otto, 58-30, thus tying
the record high score for the
sixth time. The victory gave-
Crane a 133125 lead in the two;
year old series. Otto still leads
in total points by 181.
The lull in action since Jan
uary 31 was precipitated by the
death of the Nebillcal Casino
League. It became defunct be
cause of inaction. Otto never
did like the league, and thus;
was not excited about playing
six games for it each week t
Rook and Marcus,
by their early losses and
obvious dominance of the tv/d
WCCL members, made excusog
for not playing their games. V
"They wimped out," saWlt
Crane. "How boss!" said Otto.^i
