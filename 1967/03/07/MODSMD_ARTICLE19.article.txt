## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's wrestling team end
ed Its season Saturday with a
fifth place in the AAWU tour
nament at UCLA.
Captain Len Borchers, who
carried the Tribe's best hopes
for a title, was upset in the finals
by the winner of the 152 pound
class last year, Lee Ehrler of
UCLA.
Borchers jumped out to a 2-0
lead on a takedown in the first
period, and was trailing only

4-3 at the end of the second pe
riod. But several predicaments
put him far behind in the third,
and in a desperate attempt to
roll through on a cradle, he was
pinned.
Crenshaw Second
Stanford gained one other
second place from Terry Cren
shaw at 191 pounds. Crenshaw
lost to Bob Buhler of UCLA in
an exciting 14-10 decision. Ear
lier this year, Crenshaw dropped
a 6-5 match to Buhler.

Interestingly enough, Cren
shaw defeated the winners of
first and second place in the
heavyweight division, where he
wrestled during the year. Cren
shaw had ten point margins over
both Mark Gartung, of OSU, the
winner, and Larry Lathrop of
Cal.
But Crenshaw admitted he
would have had trouble with
Gartung on Saturday, for the
Beaver big boy cleanly deci
sioned Lathrop 8-1 in the finals.
Two Fourths
Stanford's other place win
ners were John Tam at 115, who
earned a fourth place with a
pin despite being pinned twice,
and 165 pounder Doug Gunesch,
who won fourth also.
Gunesch won two matches
7-6 on riding time, but was
pinned by the winner of the divi
sion, Jim Quinn of OSU, who
won the weight for the third
straight year.
OSU Wins
Oregon State won the tourna
ment with 110 points over
UCLA's 78. Other OSU winners
were: Phil Frey at 147 who won
8-2 in the finals (and whom
Borchers decisioned 2-1 in the
regular season at 152), Bob
Blacford, who won by default in
the finals at 177, and Ron Iwa
saki at 115.

pinned by the winner of the divi
sion, Jim Quinn of OSU, who
won the weight for the third
straight year.
OSU Wins
Oregon State won the tourna
ment with 110 points over
UCLA's 78. Other OSU winners
were: Phil Frey at 147 who won
8-2 in the finals (and whom
Borchers decisioned 2-1 in the
regular season at 152), Bob
Blacford, who won by default in
the finals at 177, and Ron Iwa
saki at 115.
Stanford's wrestling team end
ed Its season Saturday with a
fifth place in the AAWU tour
nament at UCLA.
Captain Len Borchers, who
carried the Tribe's best hopes
for a title, was upset in the finals
by the winner of the 152 pound
class last year, Lee Ehrler of
UCLA.
Borchers jumped out to a 2-0
lead on a takedown in the first
period, and was trailing only

4-3 at the end of the second pe
riod. But several predicaments
put him far behind in the third,
and in a desperate attempt to
roll through on a cradle, he was
pinned.
Crenshaw Second
Stanford gained one other
second place from Terry Cren
shaw at 191 pounds. Crenshaw
lost to Bob Buhler of UCLA in
an exciting 14-10 decision. Ear
lier this year, Crenshaw dropped
a 6-5 match to Buhler.

Interestingly enough, Cren
shaw defeated the winners of
first and second place in the
heavyweight division, where he
wrestled during the year. Cren
shaw had ten point margins over
both Mark Gartung, of OSU, the
winner, and Larry Lathrop of
Cal.
But Crenshaw admitted he
would have had trouble with
Gartung on Saturday, for the
Beaver big boy cleanly deci
sioned Lathrop 8-1 in the finals.
Two Fourths
Stanford's other place win
ners were John Tam at 115, who
earned a fourth place with a
pin despite being pinned twice,
and 165 pounder Doug Gunesch,
who won fourth also.
Gunesch won two matches
7-6 on riding time, but was
pinned by the winner of the divi
sion, Jim Quinn of OSU, who
won the weight for the third
straight year.
