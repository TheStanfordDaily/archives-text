## Sterling; V.P. Deplore "Welcome" 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
The controversy concerning Vice
President Hubert Humphrey's visit
to Stanford has elicited an unprece
dented letter from University Presi
dent J. E. Wallace Sterling to all
members of the student body, faculty
and staff.
The letter attempts to clarify the
events surrounding the Vice Presi
dent's speech and departure and ex
presses "deep concern for the preser
vation of free and civilized debate on
the Stanford campus."
According to Donald Carlson, as
sistant to the Director of University
Relations, the letter resulted from re
cent meetings of the President's and
Provost's staffs. He estimated mailing
costs at $1500 to $2000. He added that
many students had requested copies
of the letter to send to their parents.
One Issue
In a letter to The Daily Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier said: "There
is only one thing at issue in Dr. Ster
ling's letter: what interpretation is to
be given to the actions outside Memo
rial Auditorium between the time Vice
President Humphrey emerged and his
limousine pulled away for the air
port?"
Napier wrote that the facts and
their interpretation and consequences
"remain themselves ground for free
and civilized debate. The attempt to
coerce judgment is unacceptable in
an academic community.
"But so is the arrogance that re
fuses to heed the President's state
ment. The Humphrey affair is a mat

ter of debate, and therefore a proper
matter for diverging judgment."
In still another phase of the Hum
phrey aftermath, The Daily has re
ceived a letter from the Vice President
in answer to a telegram sent by the
paper concerning the coverage of his
visit to Stanford in the U.S. News &
World Report. The magazine article
said that Humphrey described the
demonstrators who confronted him as
"hooligans—just a group of ruffians
who decided to exercise their protest
in a violent and unsavory manner."
Letter From Humphrey
The Vice President is quoted as
saying: "They rushed at us, threw
urine, which they had saved up, on
the police, and called out dirty names."
The story also states that the inci
dent "took place in the wake of re
cent relaxation of school rules on
such matters as student discipline,
drinking and dormitory activities."
University officials are credited with
saying that no disciplinary action was
planned.
The telegram asked the Vice Presi
dent to confirm or deny the state
ments attributed to him, calling them
"blatant factual errors." Humphrey
did not reply directly to the telegram,
but enclosed a copy of a letter he had
written to U.S. News & World Report.
Humphrey's letter to the magazine
editor states:
"In fairness to the vast majority of
students at Stanford and to the ad
ministration of that great University,
it is important to know that the
'hooliganism' during my visit there

was not organized by Stanford stu
dents. There were no students among
the ring leaders."
Humphrey added that the Stanford
incident is part of a "developing pat
tern of off-campus militant irresponsi
bility stirring up legitimate student
concerns." He noted that the 1700
students in the audience were atten
tive, courteous, and "willing to

listen," acknowledging the fact that
President Sterling and his staff "did
everything possible" to insure that
his visit would be "worthy of the best
traditions at Stanford."
The letter concluded, "It is a shame
that the good people of Stanford—
whether they agreed with me or not—
were forgotten in the emphasis on
the excess of outsiders."

to Stanford has elicited an unprece
dented letter from University Presi
dent J. E. Wallace Sterling to all
members of the student body, faculty
and staff.
The letter attempts to clarify the
events surrounding the Vice Presi
dent's speech and departure and ex
presses "deep concern for the preser
vation of free and civilized debate on
the Stanford campus."
According to Donald Carlson, as
sistant to the Director of University
Relations, the letter resulted from re
cent meetings of the President's and
Provost's staffs. He estimated mailing
costs at $1500 to $2000. He added that
many students had requested copies
of the letter to send to their parents.

In a letter to The Daily Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier said: "There
is only one thing at issue in Dr. Ster
ling's letter: what interpretation is to
be given to the actions outside Memo
rial Auditorium between the time Vice
President Humphrey emerged and his
limousine pulled away for the air
port?"
Napier wrote that the facts and
their interpretation and consequences
"remain themselves ground for free
and civilized debate. The attempt to
coerce judgment is unacceptable in
an academic community.
"But so is the arrogance that re
fuses to heed the President's state
ment. The Humphrey affair is a mat

ter of debate, and therefore a proper
matter for diverging judgment."
In still another phase of the Hum
phrey aftermath, The Daily has re
ceived a letter from the Vice President
in answer to a telegram sent by the
paper concerning the coverage of his
visit to Stanford in the U.S. News &
World Report. The magazine article
said that Humphrey described the
demonstrators who confronted him as
"hooligans—just a group of ruffians
who decided to exercise their protest
in a violent and unsavory manner."
Letter From Humphrey
The Vice President is quoted as
saying: "They rushed at us, threw
urine, which they had saved up, on
the police, and called out dirty names."
The story also states that the inci
dent "took place in the wake of re
cent relaxation of school rules on
such matters as student discipline,
drinking and dormitory activities."
University officials are credited with
saying that no disciplinary action was
planned.
The telegram asked the Vice Presi
dent to confirm or deny the state
ments attributed to him, calling them
"blatant factual errors." Humphrey
did not reply directly to the telegram,
but enclosed a copy of a letter he had
written to U.S. News & World Report.
Humphrey's letter to the magazine
editor states:
"In fairness to the vast majority of
students at Stanford and to the ad
ministration of that great University,
it is important to know that the
'hooliganism' during my visit there

was not organized by Stanford stu
dents. There were no students among
the ring leaders."
Humphrey added that the Stanford
incident is part of a "developing pat
tern of off-campus militant irresponsi
bility stirring up legitimate student
concerns." He noted that the 1700
students in the audience were atten
tive, courteous, and "willing to

listen," acknowledging the fact that
President Sterling and his staff "did
everything possible" to insure that
his visit would be "worthy of the best
traditions at Stanford."
The letter concluded, "It is a shame
that the good people of Stanford—
whether they agreed with me or not—
were forgotten in the emphasis on
the excess of outsiders."
