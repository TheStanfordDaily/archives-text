# SDS Urges End To Class Ranking
## 
### 
The Stanford Anti-draft Union
and the Stanford Chapter of
Students for a Democratic So
ciety sent a letter to President
Sterling last Friday, requesting
that Stanford cease supplying
class rank to the Selective Ser
vice System for the purpose of
determining possible draft eligi
ble students.
The letter states "We ask you
to cease computing academic
standing, and to withhold in
formation on students grades
from the local draft boards, as
well as to refuse to administer
selective service examinations."
According to John Saari of
S.DS., "Ranking students for
the draft strikes at the very
heart of the institutional integ
rity of the university. It raises
such questions as: Is Stanford
really an independent educa
tional institution or merely a

necessary adjunct of a society
which is calously killing
sants in Vietnam and elsewhere?
Many universities around the
country send in class ranking to
the Selective Service Bureau
of all male students automatical
ly, but the present system used
here at Stanford is to refrain
from sending in ranking unless
the student requests that it be
done.
In the letter to President Ster
ling the S.D.S. declares that un
der the present system students
are unable to find an atmosphere
of freedom which they feel is
necessary for a good education.
"The University's cooperation
with the Selective Service denies
us these freedoms by making
our work subject to investiga
tion, and possible punishment,
by local draft boards.
