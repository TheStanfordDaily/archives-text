# Experiment Sets Spring Seminars
## 
### 
The Experiment will conduct
registration for spring quarter
membership this week from
Wednesday through Saturday,
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., in The Experi
ment building. Curriculum cata
logues will also be available.
The $10 registration fee en
titles the member to participate
in as many Experiment activi
ties as he wishes, including par
ticipation in one or more of the
28 seminars being offered this
spring.
There are 15 new seminars on
such topics as Vladimir Nabo
kov, T. S. Eliot, Non-violence, Ex
istentialism and Political Com
mitment, The Mystical Approach
to Science, Forming the Human
Society, Kenneth Patchen, and
Seven Wonders of the World.
'This quarter we are trying to
stress membership in The Ex
periment as a whole rather than
in one or more of its seminars,"
says Barry Greenberg, Experi
ment coordinator.


Reverend Hubert Llndsey covered a lot of territory when he came
to Stanford yesterday on a visit from Berkeley. In his informal
afternoon speech at White Plaza he expounded the Scripture, com
mented on the licentiousness of student life, supported the war In
Vietnam debunked the theory of evolution with recent entomologi
cal evidence, and called upon students to give their hearts to God.
