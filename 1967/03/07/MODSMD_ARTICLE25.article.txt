# Concern For What?

President Sterling's message to the members
of this community shows distress over a prob
lem no one will deny is important â€”the preser
vation of an open forum on this campus. But
the letter makes it all too obvious that the pres
sures he has been subjected to in the last two
weeks loom large in his concern.
The news media were very harsh on Stan
ford after Vice President Humphrey's visit.
Distorted reports containing allusions to "vio
lence" and "angry mobs" aroused public opin
ion throughout the country, especially among
alumni, trustees, donors, and parents. Stanford
was being labeled as another Berkeley and it
is no surprise that certain elements should be
come highly concerned about the University's
image. It is, however, disappointing that an
ostensibly sincere letter should, in part, be mo
tivated by a desire to save face in the wake
of recent criticism.
President Sterling has never before written
a letter of this sort to the entire community.
Why, if he is so concerned about "obstruction
and intimidation," did he not make any public
statement when David Harris' head was shaved
by a group of fraternity men? That incident
was a more blantant rejection of "the preserva
tion of free and civilized debate" than anything
that happened to the Vice President. Humphrey
was subjected to no physical harm, as was
David Harris, and we find it inconsistent and
intolerable that concern for maintaining an
open forum in the University should be con
fined to events involving national figures.
The "threatening" anger of the crowd has

been exaggerated. There was no general de
sire to inflict physical harm upon the Vice
President. On the contrary, Humphrey was
faced with a crowd frustrated because it could
not get into the auditorium and angry because
the Vice President failed to provide answers
to their most pressing questions. It is a credit
to Stanford that, given these circumstances,
only two persons in a crowd of 800 should ac
tually try to obstruct Humphrey's path.
The last sentence of President Sterling's
letter reveals a "degree of anger'' more theaten
ing than that of the crowd around Humphrey.
Given that the hostility was precipitated by a
mob and given that a mob's actions are gen
erally neither premeditated nor rational, it is
foolish to assume that rigorous disciplinary
action against those involved two weeks ago will
in any way guarantee the preservation of "civi
lized debate" at Stanford. In fact, there is no
reason to believe disciplinary action against
anyone is warranted. The reception given Sen
ator Hatfield yesterday clearly demonstrates
that fair discussion is not in jeopardy here and,
in particular, that its preservation hinges as
much on the openness of the speaker as on the
attitude of the audience.
The threat of disciplinary action and the
frightening possibility that students might be
coerced into incriminating each other for par
ticipating in a spontaneous reaction against
Humphrey's insulting presentation is itself a
violent obstruction to the open interchange of
ideas in this University.
