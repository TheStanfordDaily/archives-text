## Conflicting Jurisdictions Over Student Conduct 
### Maggie McComas 
In his recent evaluation of the
University's In loco parentis
role, Law Prof. John McDon
ough pointed out that the con
cept may be particularly ana
chronous today when applied to
graduate students.
The bases for such an argu
ment are obvious; most gradu
ate students live off-campus and
in doing so are not concerned
with most social regulations,
open house hours and other
trivia governing student conduct
among undergraduates.
Many graduate students did
not attend Stanford as under
graduates and it is hard to con
ceive easy acceptance of a high
ly impersonal "Big Brother" as
suming the responsibility for
the personal conduct of individ
uals for whom the franchise is
no new novelty.
And because of the nature of
graduate work—intensive study
in one specialized area with lit
tle or no emphasis on the "total
learning experience" of extra
curriculars, residence activities
and other Yahooism stressed so
heavily among the undergradu
ates — it seems that the various
graduate divisions should estab
lish a contractural, rather than
a parental relationship with
their students.
So what gives with the Marc
Sapir case? While Dean Smith's
actions may serve primarily to
draw out the proceedings, it
looks as if the Medical School
is going to be equal to the chal
lenge.
Instead of using this oppor
tunity to re-evaluate the role of
the University (including all
graduate divisions in judging
student conduct and doling out
punitive measures, the adminis

trations of the University and
the Medical School are in for a
struggle which may end in the
establishment of an even more
complicated bureaucracy of ju
dicial bodies, with proceedings
so drawn out as to justify the
publication of a Judicial Court
Journal.
The Medical School, the Grad
uate School of Business, and the
Law School are all professional
schools and, because of the prac
tically autonomous nature of
these divisions, it seems plausi
ble that each should have juris
diction over its students, if for
no other reason than conveni
ence for the rest of the Univer
sity.
The attitude of each such
school might ideally be the con
tractual relationship described
by McDonough. But in the Sa
pir case, it appears that the
contract is less a 50-50 relation
ship than an assumption on the
part of the school that "we take
care of our own."
Mr. Sapir has articulated his
cause and probably would have
done so if the Medical School
spokesman had not stepped in.
There is no need to view with
alarm the possibility of each
graduate division setting up its
own judicial body. As long as the
University continues to claim
jurisdiction over all students the
various student and administra
tive tribunals will, if never
reaching a decision, at least keep
each other busy.
Potential Fun Stan violator?
take note — by the time a judi
cial case finally settles, from
exhaustion if not in a precedent
setting decision, the violator will
be just a name and face in last
year's Quad.

Sapir case? While Dean Smith's
actions may serve primarily to
draw out the proceedings, it
looks as if the Medical School
is going to be equal to the chal
lenge.
Instead of using this oppor
tunity to re-evaluate the role of
the University (including all
graduate divisions in judging
student conduct and doling out
punitive measures, the adminis

trations of the University and
the Medical School are in for a
struggle which may end in the
establishment of an even more
complicated bureaucracy of ju
dicial bodies, with proceedings
so drawn out as to justify the
publication of a Judicial Court
Journal.
The Medical School, the Grad
uate School of Business, and the
Law School are all professional
schools and, because of the prac
tically autonomous nature of
these divisions, it seems plausi
ble that each should have juris
diction over its students, if for
no other reason than conveni
ence for the rest of the Univer
sity.
The attitude of each such
school might ideally be the con
tractual relationship described
by McDonough. But in the Sa
pir case, it appears that the
contract is less a 50-50 relation
ship than an assumption on the
part of the school that "we take
care of our own."
Mr. Sapir has articulated his
cause and probably would have
done so if the Medical School
spokesman had not stepped in.
There is no need to view with
alarm the possibility of each
graduate division setting up its
own judicial body. As long as the
University continues to claim
jurisdiction over all students the
various student and administra
tive tribunals will, if never
reaching a decision, at least keep
each other busy.
Potential Fun Stan violator?
take note — by the time a judi
cial case finally settles, from
exhaustion if not in a precedent
setting decision, the violator will
be just a name and face in last
year's Quad.
In his recent evaluation of the
University's In loco parentis
role, Law Prof. John McDon
ough pointed out that the con
cept may be particularly ana
chronous today when applied to
graduate students.
The bases for such an argu
ment are obvious; most gradu
ate students live off-campus and
in doing so are not concerned
with most social regulations,
open house hours and other
trivia governing student conduct
among undergraduates.
Many graduate students did
not attend Stanford as under
graduates and it is hard to con
ceive easy acceptance of a high
ly impersonal "Big Brother" as
suming the responsibility for
the personal conduct of individ
uals for whom the franchise is
no new novelty.
And because of the nature of
graduate work—intensive study
in one specialized area with lit
tle or no emphasis on the "total
learning experience" of extra
curriculars, residence activities
and other Yahooism stressed so
heavily among the undergradu
ates — it seems that the various
graduate divisions should estab
lish a contractural, rather than
a parental relationship with
their students.
So what gives with the Marc
Sapir case? While Dean Smith's
actions may serve primarily to
draw out the proceedings, it
looks as if the Medical School
is going to be equal to the chal
lenge.
