## Sterling Letter Ignores Paradoxes 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This afternoon I received, as
did presumably all students, fac
ulty, and staff, a letter from the
President of the University. The
President announces the subject
of the letter to be "a deep con
cern for the preservation of free
and civilized debate on the Stan
ford Campus." We all, I am
sure, share this concern.
What I would like to do is
this: I would like to comment on
this letter and the specific event
which precipitated it. The Presi
dent writes that "the over
whelming majority of the Stan
ford Community rejects violence
as a means of argument." Is this
irony? The topic for discussion
that day was war. If the aca
demic personna rejects violence
as a means of argument, should
he not, by extension, find means
other than violence to solve
complicated international prob
lems? Or does he talk dispas
sionately about the war and
only become aroused when some
action thereatens to disrupt the
tranquility of his quiet and lush
academic garden?
The President intimates that
anyone should be allowed to
speak at Stanford University
"no matter how controversial
their subject and opinions." I
agree. What I observe is this:
If Gus Hall had spoken and been
egged, we would not have been
surprised. The elected Vice
President of the United States,
the man who represents us and
our views, comes to defend us
to ourselves and he nearly ig
nites a mob to explosion. The
President (SU not US) ignores
this strange and important para
dox. Humphrey controversial?
Hell, he's our boy! Our turning
on our leader seems to me much
more important a cause for con
cern than the defense of a poli
tician who changed a discussion
table into a stage.
The President expressed con
cern that "we should have fallen
this far from our tradition of
fair and free discussion." I re
member receiving no similar let
ter and statement of concern
when a former Student Body
President fell victim to a gang.
The President feels that having
to question the advisability of
inviting future speakers to cam
pus is intolerable. I agree, as in
tolerable as book burning or
film bans. Now who is it, again,
who is raising this question?
Let me quote out of context
a few words and phrases from
the President's letter: "consider
able discussion," "initial news
accounts were over drawn,"
"evoked exaggerated respons
es," "New York Times," "public
reports." The point I am trying
to make, I hope it has not yet
descended to cliche status, is
this: The concern the President
feels is real; he worries about
the image of Stanford Univers
ity that the mass media projects
upon the vast white public
tabula rasa.
Can I say for certain that the
President acts from a concern
for University revenues, not

University ideals, and that he
clothes his purpose with the
pious robes of academe? Can I
say for certain that administra
tive pressure applies most no
ticeably to leftist, news-making,
activists? Why would anyone
want to say things like that?
The first paragraph of the
President's letter announces his
concern for free and civilized
debate. The final paragraph be
gins with an assertion of the
President's resolution not to tol
erate intimidation. In the last
sentence of this paragraph the
President, speaking for himself,
emphasizes that "public reports
to the effect that no disciplinary
action will be taken . . . are
grossly mistaken both in this
situation and others that may
arise."

• Definition
Editor, The Dally:
. . Violence as a means of
argument . . ." is rejected, Wal
lace Sterling wrote me. Vio
lence, President Sterling? What
about ROTC students who don
uniforms once a week to play
with weapons and march? What
about the draft? What about
Vietnam? A man who possesses
authentic respect for human
life (and not merely the "pres
tige" of power) and honestly
deplores violence in any form,
surely has something to say
about Vietnam! Many students
and faculty made their state
ments. The President had only
apologies. More appropriate
would have been a commend
ation of those who openly, and
without violence, expressed their
deep and compelling moral
anguish to one man whose posi
tion of power would permit him
some action to end this war.
The expression of disgust with
the statements of Humphrey
that prove that he deserves
neither respect nor endorsement
was wholly appropriate. If apol
ogy, or the open leter of March
7, had been necessary, the entire
community should have decided
to take those steps. Had I any
power to vote it would be neces
sary for me to vote for the
resignation of President Ster
ling. His financial and expan
sionist endeavors for Stanford
notwithstanding, he has proven
silent on every issue of major
concern to academic and human
istic import (from Vietnam to
the draft to the problems of
public higher education, and
that silence for me defines his
stature in this university! He
has shown himself to be a "pub
lic man"; but the university is
a place for educators and stu
dents.

• Attack Questioned
Editor, The Dally:
I have questioned several of
the faculty signers of the "Open
Letter to Vice President Hum

phrey", published in the Stan
ford Daily of February 24, as to
the misrepresentations with
which they, without specifica
tion, charge the Vice President. I
have received the following re
plies: (1) That he tried to make
out that the Administration has
done all it could to get peace
in Vietnam. Humphrey did not
say this, and such a statement
would have been an obvious
absurdity, for we could have
stopped fighting, or at least
stopped bombing, and indeed
could have pulled our forces out
of the country. He did state the
offers that the U.S. has made to
get peace negotiations started.
Whether we should have done
more is a matter of opinion. (2)
That we are in Vietnam to stop
an invasion from the north.
Humphrey did not say this ei
ther. He did, of course, say in ef
fect that this was a struggle
against Communist aggression,
as in the case of Greece and Ko
rea. One may of course differ
with him on this point, but one
can hardly say that it is a mis
representation. (3) That Hum
phrey attributed the bombing of
civilian areas and the conse
quent killing of civilians to acci
dent or inability to be accurate
under combat pressure. The
signer in this case continued: "I
simply don't believe him." The
signer considered that his own
sources of information, appar
ently, were superior to those of
the Vice-President. He referred
to Salisbury, but failed to note
that Salisbury has not charged
deliberate civilian bombing. For
this signer, a misrepresentation
is something which he does not
believe, though he has no proof
that Humphrey's position is
wrong. Is it impossible for pro
fessors, whether of religion or
otherwise, to distinguish be
tween matters of opinion, with
which they disagree, and mis
statements of fact? Are they
really prepared to argue that for
the Vice-President to state the
Administration's position on con
troversial matters as to Vietnam
is a "misuse of the platform
given" him?
Finally, in the very letter in
which they charge misrepresen
tations they say: .. we wish
to make clear to you that cur
rent United States policy in
Vietnam does not have the sup
port of the academic communi
ty . . None of those whom I
have approached defend this sen
tence, although they were will
ing to sign the letter. They ad
mit that they have not polled
the academic community and do
not know what a poll would
show. One signer, a professor,
said that if such statements
were qualified, "you'd never get
but a handful of signatures."
He went on to say that he did
not hear the lecture, but he was
prepared to believe that Hum
phrey lied "because Humphrey
has lied in other cases," and he
added: "I do not apply to such
a matter as this letter the same
standards I use in my research
and teaching."

I am not myself a defender of
our war in Vietnam, but I sub
mit that one does not meet the
Administration's position by in
supportable attacks on the Vice-
President. This was not the tac
tic of Prof. Claude Buss in his
excellent but poorly attended ad
dress of last week.

• Still Civilized
Editor, The Dally:
I too "am writing . . . out of a
deep concern for the preserva
tion of free and civilized debate
on the Stanford campus." There
is really only one thing at issue
in Dr. Sterling's letter: what in
terpretation is to be given to the
actions outside of Memorial Aud
torium between the time Vice
President Humphrey emerged
and the time his limousine pulled
away for the airport? President
Sterling and his advisers are
persuaded that this was a crowd
which easily might has "become
transformed into an ugly and
dangerous mob"; and this, he
says, "has apparently been over
looked by a disturbingly large
number of people."
I find it hard to believe that
anybody at Stanford overlooks
the empirical fact that crowds
can and do become mobs. Some
of us, however, are not persuad
ed, on the evidence available to
us, that this particular crowd
was about to become a danger

ous mob. We cannot therefore
repudiate what we do not be
lieve existed. If I were convinced
that the "basic physical safety"
of the Vice President was, or
was about to be, threatened,
then I would join President
Sterling's protest.
The meaning of facts, the pos
sible consequence of facts, and
the interpretation of facts—as
suming full command of "facts"
—remain themselves ground for
free and civilized debate. The at
tempt to coerce judgment is un
acceptable in an academic com
munity.
But so is the arrogance that
refuses to heed the President's
statement. The Humphrey affair
is a matter of debate, and there
fore a proper matter for diverg
ing judgment. President Ster
ling, Provost Lyman, Director of
Public Relations Nelson, Board
Chairman Guggenhime, all of us
at Stanford, have been victim
ized in any case by a sensational
ist press; and almost unbearable
pressures, censure, contempt
have been put on us all (the
brunt of it, of course, on the
President) by persons outside
the University. We who take a
different view can nevertheless
accept in full understanding
Dr. Sterling's rebuke—remark
ably moderate and controlled
and itself "civilized," given his
own interpretation of the facts
in the Humphrey episode.
