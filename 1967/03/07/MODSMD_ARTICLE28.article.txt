# Mud, Mosquitoes, And Me
## 
### 
The following poem was written by Joseph Jacobs, former drama
and Fine Arts Editor for The Daily, before his death in Vietnam two
week ago.
Trekking through the jungle, rifle in my hand
Seeking to find shelter 'neath a tree
Slogging through the swamps of a distant land
The mud, the mosquitoes and me-
Fighting in a war that's not a war
In places that have no name.
Knowing that whatever I was before
I can never be the same.
Standing guard at night time, trying to stay calm
Wanting to make other people see
What's its really like here in Vietnam
The mud, the mosquitoes and me.
Shooting with a camera that's not much good
Writing stories I just don't feel,
Anything I need I build from wood
That I borrow, beg or steal.
Longing for my loved one, wishing for a kiss
Dreaming of all that our life could be
Still I have to fight, have to live like this
The mud, the mosquitoes and me.
Sending daily letters that don't say much,
And hoping I'll soon be home.
Everything I need is in her touch
Never again will I roam.
Hoping to live through it, praying I won't die,
Struggling to preserve democracy.
Always asking questions and wondering why;
The mud, the mosquitoes and me.
Drinking, writing, praying, trying,
Battling so that others can be free.
Thinking, fighting, staying, dying—
The mud, the mosquitoes and me.
—Joseph Jacobs
