WHO'S GOT THE BUTTON?
I'm sure it has not escaped your notice that underlying
the adorable whimsy which has made this column such a
popular favorite among my wife and my little dog Spot,
there is a serious attempt to stay abreast of the problems
that beset the American college student.
Many a trip have I made to many a campus—talking to
undergraduates, listening to their troubles, hearing their
grievances, reading their buttons. (Incidentally, the sec
ond and third most popular buttons I saw on my last trip
were: "WALLACE BEERY LIVES" and "FLUORI
DATE MUSCATEL." The first most popular button was,
as we all know, "SCRAP THE SCRAPE" which is worn,
as we all know, by Personna Super Stainless Steel Blade
users who, as we all know, are proud to proclaim to the
world that they have found a blade which gives them
luxury shave after luxury shave, which comes both in
double-edge style and Injector style, which does indeed
scrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull, and oust
the ouch, which shaves so closely and quickly and truly
and beautifully that my heart leaps to tell of it. (If per
haps you think me too effusive about Personna, I ask you
to remember that to me Personna is more than just a
razor blade ; it is also an employer.)
But I digress. 1 make frequent trips, as I say, to learn
what is currently vexing the American uhdergraduate.
Last week, for example, while visiting a prominent Eas
tern university (Idaho State) I talked to a number of
engineering seniors who posed a serious question. Like
all students, they had come to college burning to fill them
selves with culture, but, alas, because of all their science
requirements, they simply had had no time to take the
liberal arts courses their young souls lusted after. "Are
we doomed," they asked piteously, "to go through life
uncultured?"
I answered with a resounding "No!" I told them the
culture they had missed in college, they would pick up
after graduation. I explained that today's enlightened
corporations are setting up on-the-job liberal arts pro
grams for the newly employed engineering graduate
courses designed to fill his culture gap -for the truly en
lightened corporation realizes that the truly cultured em
ployee is the truly valuable employee.
To illustrate, I cited the well-known case of Champert
Sigafoos of Purdue.

When Champert, having completed his degree in wing
nuts and flanges, reported to the enlightened corporation
where he had accepted employment, he was not rushed
forthwith to a drawing board. He was first installed in
the enlightened corporation's training campus. Here he
was given a beanie, a room-mate, and a copy of the com
pany rouser, and the enlightened corporation proceeded
to fill the gap in his culture.
First he was taught to read, then to print capital let
ters, then capital and small letters. (There was also an
attempt to teach him script, but it was ultimately
abandoned.)
From these fundamentals, Champert progressed slowly
but steadily through the more complex disciplines. He
was diligent, and the corporation was patient, and in the
end they were well rewarded, for when Champert fin
ished, he could play a clavier, parse a sentence, and name
all the Electors of Ravaria.
Poised and cultured, Champert was promptly placed in
an important executive position. I am pleased to report
that he served with immense distinction-not, however,
for long because three days later he reached retirement
age.
Today, still spry, he lives in St. Petersburg, Florida,
where he supplements his pension by parsing sentences
for tourists.

Here's a sentence tlull's easy to parse: Subject—"yon."
Verb —"double."" Object — "your shaving comfort when
you use Iturma-Shave, regular or menthol, along u ith
your Personna Super Stainless Steel liltides."
