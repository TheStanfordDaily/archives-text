# ASSU Plans Weekend Seminars As Supplement To Packer Study
## 
### 
The ASSU will sponsor a series of
six weekend seminar-hostels next
quarter on the subject of "Education
at Stanford." The exact dates have
not yet been set, but it is expected
that each group will involve about
twenty students, faculty and admin
istrators.
The hostels are intended as supple
mental to the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), headed by Vice Pro
vost Herbert Packer. According to
ASSU President Michael Collins, they
are "in line with our policy of actuat
ing the educational reforms we've
been talking about since last spring."
Collins gave three main reasons
for holding the hostels. First, they
will provide a broader range of opin
ions. The SES subcommitees will be
small and this fact will naturally
limit the input of ideas to some de
gree. It is hoped that the seminars
will serve as supplemental sources of
research for Packer's committee.
Impetus To Involvement
Second, says Collins, "we want to
get more people involved .... Just
because there's a Packer committee
is no reason to sit back for the next
two years. You have to get as many
people involved as possible."
A third reason givnn is to provide
an opportunity for an input of expert
opinion that might otherwise be
missed by the Study of Education at
Stanford. Collins adds that one pos
sible result of the seminars would be
an insight into the dynamics of small
education study groups, information
that could prove useful to SES.
The topics for the six seminars, as
now conceived, are:
Residence Programs and Policies;
Campus Environment,
—Undergraduate and Graduate
Education: Institutional Programs
and Practices,

—Overseas Campuses and Pro
grams,
—Admissions and Financial Aid,
—Advising and Counseling,
—Students and Extracurriculum;
Women's Education. It has not yet
been decided in what order these
seminars will be held, except that the
first listed will be held first.
Scope Of Participation
Participants will include some
members of SES subcommitees, some
experts who won't be serving on the
subcommittees and other students
and faculty to form ad-hoc committees
for follow-up research and recom
mendations.
According to Collins, the idea for
the seminars has been received en
thusiastically by Packer and SES
Staff Director, Dean Robert Hind.
The hostels have been funded
anonymously by a Texas foundation,

in addition to which they will receive
funds from the ASSU Education Com
mission and a University educational
study fund.
Interested persons are encouraged
to fill out application forms at the
ASSU office in Tresidder Union, or
contact the project co ordinator, John
Trimbur (327-1717). Applicants may
list three choices of seminars but, if
chosen, will serve on only one.
Some of the hostels will take place
at Asilomar, near Carmel; others will
take place on the Stanford campus;
and there is a possibility of holding
one or more at Fallen Leaf, near
Lake Tahoe.
Collins adds that 'more things are
going to happen. This is just one
part of our program in the spring,
but we need to get these applications
as soon as possible."

Stanford (SES), headed by Vice Pro
vost Herbert Packer. According to
ASSU President Michael Collins, they
are "in line with our policy of actuat
ing the educational reforms we've
been talking about since last spring."
Collins gave three main reasons
for holding the hostels. First, they
will provide a broader range of opin
ions. The SES subcommitees will be
small and this fact will naturally
limit the input of ideas to some de
gree. It is hoped that the seminars
will serve as supplemental sources of
research for Packer's committee.
Impetus To Involvement
Second, says Collins, "we want to
get more people involved .... Just
because there's a Packer committee
is no reason to sit back for the next
two years. You have to get as many
people involved as possible."
A third reason givnn is to provide
an opportunity for an input of expert
opinion that might otherwise be
missed by the Study of Education at
Stanford. Collins adds that one pos
sible result of the seminars would be
an insight into the dynamics of small
education study groups, information
that could prove useful to SES.
The topics for the six seminars, as
now conceived, are:
Residence Programs and Policies;
Campus Environment,
—Undergraduate and Graduate
Education: Institutional Programs
and Practices,

—Overseas Campuses and Pro
grams,
—Admissions and Financial Aid,
—Advising and Counseling,
—Students and Extracurriculum;
Women's Education. It has not yet
been decided in what order these
seminars will be held, except that the
first listed will be held first.
Scope Of Participation
Participants will include some
members of SES subcommitees, some
experts who won't be serving on the
subcommittees and other students
and faculty to form ad-hoc committees
for follow-up research and recom
mendations.
According to Collins, the idea for
the seminars has been received en
thusiastically by Packer and SES
Staff Director, Dean Robert Hind.
The hostels have been funded
anonymously by a Texas foundation,

in addition to which they will receive
funds from the ASSU Education Com
mission and a University educational
study fund.
Interested persons are encouraged
to fill out application forms at the
ASSU office in Tresidder Union, or
contact the project co ordinator, John
Trimbur (327-1717). Applicants may
list three choices of seminars but, if
chosen, will serve on only one.
Some of the hostels will take place
at Asilomar, near Carmel; others will
take place on the Stanford campus;
and there is a possibility of holding
one or more at Fallen Leaf, near
Lake Tahoe.
Collins adds that 'more things are
going to happen. This is just one
part of our program in the spring,
but we need to get these applications
as soon as possible."
The ASSU will sponsor a series of
six weekend seminar-hostels next
quarter on the subject of "Education
at Stanford." The exact dates have
not yet been set, but it is expected
that each group will involve about
twenty students, faculty and admin
istrators.
The hostels are intended as supple
mental to the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), headed by Vice Pro
vost Herbert Packer. According to

are "in line with our policy of actuat
ing the educational reforms we've
