# Hatfield Wants Viet Peace Based On Reality, Facts
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL DAN SNELL 
"The solution for Vietnam is not to
be found in emotional extremes but
in a well-reasoned policy that re
spects historical fact and that accom
modates current realities."
Senator Mark O. Hatfield, as part
of his 1967 Distinguished Alumnus
Lecture "From Farm to Forum," re
viewed his objections to the current
war in Vietnam. He then went on in
his speech before 720 people in Dinkel
spiel and 500 outside to outline some
of his proposals for a settlement of
the crisis.
Before the Senator spoke, fourteen
persons picketed in support of his
refusal to endorse the government's
policy in Vietnam. The pickets were
members of the Stanford Commitee
Concerned About Vietnam, a group
of about 100 faculty members and
students opposed to the war.

Senator Hatfield insisted, "The pres
ent course of our involvement has
been charted on a distorted map. The
map-makers have deliberately misin
terpreted the 20-year history of this
conflict to justify our present involve
ment."

"One of the first historical facts
that must be recognized is that Ho Chi
Minh has been fighting since before
the end of the Second World War
and always under the primary cause
of nationalism—not communism."
The French failure to allow the Viet
namese to exert this "nationalism,"
caused, according to Senator Hatfield,
Ho Chin Minh to turn to Communism.
"Ho Chi Minh's belated recognition
of his Communist leanings was an at
tempt to find an ally against the
French—and against the United States
who supported the French."
With the Geneva Agreement in 1954,
the anti-Ho Chi Minh in the South
elected Diem as their President.
One Of The Landlords
Diem, said Hatfield, "was identified
with the ruling forces in Vietnam who
had cooperated with the French dur
ing the war for independence. He was
a part of the landlord group, with
little interest in vital land-reforms
and was almost totally inept at hold
ing the numerous South Vietnamese
factions together."
To prevent Ho Chi Minh from being
elected, Hatfield feels, "The United
States and the South Vietnamese de
cided to stall on the elections until
the Vietnamese saw the light."
"Opposition to Diem's rule grew,
and from 1958 on this opposition took
on more and more of the form of guer
rilla activity. . . . This was South
Vietnamese fighting South Vietnam

ese Communists fighting non-Com
munists, the landless fighting the land
owners, and it was not until 1960
that North Vietnam publically sup
ported the revolt of the South Viet
namese."
US Steps In
Senator Hatfield added that in con
trast to the North Vietnamese stand,
the United States has inserted itself
"into the lives of the Vietnamese in
the early 1950's when we financed
almost 80 per cent of the French
military action."
In referring to the United States'
increased commitment in Vietnam,
the Senator said, "I believe the last
few years of our involvement in Viet
nam can be called the period of 'Con
stant Contradiction.'"
"There have been a great many
contradictions in statement and action
concerning the nature of the U.S.
role in Vietnam."
"The Administration has trouble
with its statistics in proving the ex
istence of aggression from the North
and it also has trouble with its logic."
Need To Negotiate
In regard to numerous instances of
North Vietnamese interest in a peace
ful settlement that the Senator cited
the United States as rejecting, he said,
"In fighting a war, our position must
naturally be flexible, but this does not
mean that the truth must be flexible,
that the truth must be subservient
to political motives."
In outlining his suggestions for
settlement, Senator Hatfield said, "The
way war can be ended is through ne
gotiated settlement. This must be the
United States' goals."
In addition to calling for a stop in
bombing, the Senator called for an
"All-Asian Conference." This con
ference "would work out plans for
De-Americanizing the war in Viet
nam and for the assumption by Asians
of their responsibility for maintaining
peace in their area of the world."
'We're With You'
The demonstrators, who started
picketing outside Dinkelspiel about
half an hour before the Senator was
to speak, carried signs reading, "Hat
field, Urge LBJ To Stop Bombing,"
"We Are With You Against The War,"
and "Hatfield, Now Is The Time To
Speak Out."
Gator Green, who led the demon
stration, said, "We hope to show Hat
field we support his position, and
we'd like to see him adopt a stand
like Kennedy's and Percy's, in oppo
sition to the bombing."
There were no incidents to disrupt
the demonstration, but those carry
ing signs found that their quiet ac
tivities competed for attention with
a Gospel preachcr who was harangu
ing crowds on White Plaza at the time.
Stand Opposed
The Concerned Community organi
zation also distributed white arm
bands at the door of the auditorium.
The armbands, in the words of a state
ment they gave out as well, were "for
those who wish to express their con
cern about the war."
The statement expressed the hope
that a "strongly enthusiastic welcome
to Hatfield and his anti-war state
ments will be regarded as an indica
tion of the Stanford community's op
position to administration policy in
Vietnam."
Reactions to the demonstration
from those at the speech ranged from
"It's been a long time since there's
been a positive demonstration around
here," to "Why?"
"The solution for Vietnam is not to
be found in emotional extremes but
in a well-reasoned policy that re
spects historical fact and that accom
modates current realities."

North Vietnamese interest in a peace
ful settlement that the Senator cited
the United States as rejecting, he said,
"In fighting a war, our position must
naturally be flexible, but this does not
mean that the truth must be flexible,
that the truth must be subservient
to political motives."
In outlining his suggestions for
settlement, Senator Hatfield said, "The
way war can be ended is through ne
gotiated settlement. This must be the
United States' goals."
In addition to calling for a stop in
bombing, the Senator called for an
"All-Asian Conference." This con
ference "would work out plans for
De-Americanizing the war in Viet
nam and for the assumption by Asians
of their responsibility for maintaining
peace in their area of the world."
'We're With You'
The demonstrators, who started
picketing outside Dinkelspiel about
half an hour before the Senator was
to speak, carried signs reading, "Hat
field, Urge LBJ To Stop Bombing,"
"We Are With You Against The War,"
and "Hatfield, Now Is The Time To
Speak Out."
Gator Green, who led the demon
stration, said, "We hope to show Hat
field we support his position, and
we'd like to see him adopt a stand
like Kennedy's and Percy's, in oppo
sition to the bombing."
There were no incidents to disrupt
the demonstration, but those carry
ing signs found that their quiet ac
tivities competed for attention with
a Gospel preachcr who was harangu
ing crowds on White Plaza at the time.
Stand Opposed
The Concerned Community organi
zation also distributed white arm
bands at the door of the auditorium.
The armbands, in the words of a state
ment they gave out as well, were "for
those who wish to express their con
cern about the war."
The statement expressed the hope
that a "strongly enthusiastic welcome
to Hatfield and his anti-war state
ments will be regarded as an indica
tion of the Stanford community's op
position to administration policy in
Vietnam."
Reactions to the demonstration
from those at the speech ranged from
"It's been a long time since there's
been a positive demonstration around
here," to "Why?"
"The solution for Vietnam is not to
be found in emotional extremes but
in a well-reasoned policy that re
spects historical fact and that accom
modates current realities."
Senator Mark O. Hatfield, as part
of his 1967 Distinguished Alumnus
Lecture "From Farm to Forum," re
viewed his objections to the current
war in Vietnam. He then went on in
his speech before 720 people in Dinkel
spiel and 500 outside to outline some
of his proposals for a settlement of
the crisis.
Before the Senator spoke, fourteen
persons picketed in support of his
refusal to endorse the government's
policy in Vietnam. The pickets were
members of the Stanford Commitee
Concerned About Vietnam, a group
of about 100 faculty members and
students opposed to the war.

Senator Hatfield insisted, "The pres
ent course of our involvement has
been charted on a distorted map. The
map-makers have deliberately misin
terpreted the 20-year history of this
conflict to justify our present involve
ment."

"One of the first historical facts
that must be recognized is that Ho Chi
Minh has been fighting since before
the end of the Second World War
and always under the primary cause
of nationalism—not communism."
The French failure to allow the Viet
namese to exert this "nationalism,"
caused, according to Senator Hatfield,
Ho Chin Minh to turn to Communism.
"Ho Chi Minh's belated recognition
of his Communist leanings was an at
tempt to find an ally against the
French—and against the United States
who supported the French."
With the Geneva Agreement in 1954,
the anti-Ho Chi Minh in the South
elected Diem as their President.
One Of The Landlords
Diem, said Hatfield, "was identified
with the ruling forces in Vietnam who
had cooperated with the French dur
ing the war for independence. He was
a part of the landlord group, with
little interest in vital land-reforms
and was almost totally inept at hold
ing the numerous South Vietnamese
factions together."
To prevent Ho Chi Minh from being
elected, Hatfield feels, "The United
States and the South Vietnamese de
cided to stall on the elections until
the Vietnamese saw the light."
"Opposition to Diem's rule grew,
and from 1958 on this opposition took
on more and more of the form of guer
rilla activity. . . . This was South
Vietnamese fighting South Vietnam

ese Communists fighting non-Com
munists, the landless fighting the land
owners, and it was not until 1960
that North Vietnam publically sup
ported the revolt of the South Viet
namese."
US Steps In
Senator Hatfield added that in con
trast to the North Vietnamese stand,
the United States has inserted itself
"into the lives of the Vietnamese in
the early 1950's when we financed
almost 80 per cent of the French
military action."
In referring to the United States'
increased commitment in Vietnam,
the Senator said, "I believe the last
few years of our involvement in Viet
nam can be called the period of 'Con
stant Contradiction.'"
"There have been a great many
contradictions in statement and action
concerning the nature of the U.S.
role in Vietnam."
"The Administration has trouble
with its statistics in proving the ex
istence of aggression from the North
and it also has trouble with its logic."

namese to exert this "nationalism,"
caused, according to Senator Hatfield,
Ho Chin Minh to turn to Communism.
"Ho Chi Minh's belated recognition
of his Communist leanings was an at
tempt to find an ally against the
French—and against the United States
who supported the French."
With the Geneva Agreement in 1954,
the anti-Ho Chi Minh in the South
elected Diem as their President.
One Of The Landlords
Diem, said Hatfield, "was identified
with the ruling forces in Vietnam who
had cooperated with the French dur
ing the war for independence. He was
a part of the landlord group, with
little interest in vital land-reforms
and was almost totally inept at hold
ing the numerous South Vietnamese
factions together."
To prevent Ho Chi Minh from being
elected, Hatfield feels, "The United
States and the South Vietnamese de
cided to stall on the elections until
the Vietnamese saw the light."
"Opposition to Diem's rule grew,
and from 1958 on this opposition took
on more and more of the form of guer
rilla activity. . . . This was South
Vietnamese fighting South Vietnam

ese Communists fighting non-Com
munists, the landless fighting the land
owners, and it was not until 1960
that North Vietnam publically sup
ported the revolt of the South Viet
namese."
US Steps In
Senator Hatfield added that in con
trast to the North Vietnamese stand,
the United States has inserted itself
"into the lives of the Vietnamese in
the early 1950's when we financed
almost 80 per cent of the French
military action."
In referring to the United States'
increased commitment in Vietnam,
the Senator said, "I believe the last
few years of our involvement in Viet
nam can be called the period of 'Con
stant Contradiction.'"
"There have been a great many
contradictions in statement and action
concerning the nature of the U.S.
role in Vietnam."
"The Administration has trouble
with its statistics in proving the ex
istence of aggression from the North
and it also has trouble with its logic."
Need To Negotiate
In regard to numerous instances of
North Vietnamese interest in a peace
ful settlement that the Senator cited
the United States as rejecting, he said,
"In fighting a war, our position must
naturally be flexible, but this does not
mean that the truth must be flexible,
that the truth must be subservient
to political motives."
In outlining his suggestions for
settlement, Senator Hatfield said, "The
way war can be ended is through ne
gotiated settlement. This must be the
United States' goals."
In addition to calling for a stop in
bombing, the Senator called for an
"All-Asian Conference." This con
ference "would work out plans for
De-Americanizing the war in Viet
nam and for the assumption by Asians
of their responsibility for maintaining
peace in their area of the world."
'We're With You'
The demonstrators, who started
picketing outside Dinkelspiel about
half an hour before the Senator was
to speak, carried signs reading, "Hat
field, Urge LBJ To Stop Bombing,"
"We Are With You Against The War,"
and "Hatfield, Now Is The Time To
Speak Out."
Gator Green, who led the demon
stration, said, "We hope to show Hat
field we support his position, and
we'd like to see him adopt a stand
like Kennedy's and Percy's, in oppo
sition to the bombing."
There were no incidents to disrupt
the demonstration, but those carry
ing signs found that their quiet ac
tivities competed for attention with
a Gospel preachcr who was harangu
ing crowds on White Plaza at the time.
Stand Opposed
The Concerned Community organi
zation also distributed white arm
bands at the door of the auditorium.
The armbands, in the words of a state
ment they gave out as well, were "for
those who wish to express their con
cern about the war."
The statement expressed the hope
that a "strongly enthusiastic welcome
to Hatfield and his anti-war state
ments will be regarded as an indica
tion of the Stanford community's op
position to administration policy in
Vietnam."
Reactions to the demonstration
from those at the speech ranged from
"It's been a long time since there's
been a positive demonstration around
here," to "Why?"
"The solution for Vietnam is not to
be found in emotional extremes but
in a well-reasoned policy that re
spects historical fact and that accom
modates current realities."
Senator Mark O. Hatfield, as part
of his 1967 Distinguished Alumnus
Lecture "From Farm to Forum," re
viewed his objections to the current
war in Vietnam. He then went on in
his speech before 720 people in Dinkel
spiel and 500 outside to outline some
of his proposals for a settlement of
the crisis.
Before the Senator spoke, fourteen
persons picketed in support of his
refusal to endorse the government's
policy in Vietnam. The pickets were
members of the Stanford Commitee
Concerned About Vietnam, a group
of about 100 faculty members and
students opposed to the war.

Senator Hatfield insisted, "The pres
ent course of our involvement has
been charted on a distorted map. The
map-makers have deliberately misin
terpreted the 20-year history of this
conflict to justify our present involve
ment."

"One of the first historical facts
that must be recognized is that Ho Chi
Minh has been fighting since before
the end of the Second World War
and always under the primary cause
of nationalism—not communism."

caused, according to Senator Hatfield,
Ho Chin Minh to turn to Communism.
