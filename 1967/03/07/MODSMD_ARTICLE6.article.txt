# Hilltop Seminars Lauded

### LINDSAY BLACKMAN 
"There is real need and desire lor
an alternative to the approach and
structure of public secondary educa
tion," states Mark Lohman, founder
and prime mover of a new experi
ment in summer education known as
Hilltop Seminars.
A 1965 Stanford graduate, Lohman
conceived the program during his
junior year, when he was tutoring
local high school students. He ob
served that students from affluent
families exhibited a "markedly lim
ited interest in pursuing creative ac
tivities on their own." He felt that
teen agers were spending nonproduc
tive summers filled with camps and
television.
Lohman perceived intellectual po
tential in students who had remained
untouched by public school academ

ics, students who had never been
stimulated to think creatively. He
also felt that many Stanford students
wasted their summers performing
unskilled labor at menial jobs.
The Hilltop program evolved as an
effort to engage the untapped talents
of Stanford students and awaken the
dormant creativity of secondary stu
dents.
Potent Personalities
Last summer, 53 students from the
ages of 9 to 15 participated in the
first session of Hilltop Seminars.
Most students were 12 to 14 years old,
with about an equal number of boys
and girls. Students from a wide range
of backgrounds participated in the
program. A privately-supported schol
arship fund provided about 40 per
cent of the students with financial
aid. Seven Negroes and one Oriental
attended the session.
A variety of subjects were offered
the students. Junior biologists collect
ed insects and butterflies, identified
leaves, and observed bee hives and
soaring among birds. Neophyte ar
tists created a group sculpture and a
free-lance mural- A drama class per
formed skits. And the social science
class produced a magazine, The Out
terrajnean, which served as a critique
of public school education. Other
projects included the making of a
movie and the production of an in
formal play.

The "seminars" were kept small,
usually containing only 6 or 7 stu
dents. Over half the students' time
was purposely unstructured, in an ef
fort to encourage new interests and
individual expression. Most students,
however, were found to depend heav
ily on the stimulation of suggestion
from the teaching staff to start an
activity. Once inspired, the students
proceeded enthusiastically and inde
pendently.
The teaching staff consisted wholly
of Stanford graduates and seniors.
They were allowed to structure their
own courses, without having to cover
a specific amount of material. The
teachers discovered that their own
personalities were more potent in
spirational tools than the ideas they
tried to convey. The effectiveness of
the teachers' appeal was indicated by
parents who reported that for the
first time their children were really
excited about learning. Many parents
were surprised at the sustained en
thusiasm their children showed for
the program.
Host Of Problems
In order to alleviate the boredom
and tediousness associated with pub
lic education, Lohman wanted his
seminars away from regular school
buildings. He sought an outdoor loca
tion in a natural setting.
The attempt to secure facilities for
the program, however, was
stalled by a host of problems.
Official approval was required
from local fire, police, and health
authorities, and securing their
endorsement was no mean task.
But after Lohman had made
two unsuccessful attempts to
find a location, the private Pa
cific High School in Santa Cruz
finally heard about his idea.
Arrangements were completed
for the Hilltop program to use
the Pacific facilities. With that,
Hilltop Seminars leapfrogged
the plethora of regulations im
posed by local ordinances, since
the Pacific facilities had already
obtained approval.
Community Endorsement
Then the real work began.
Lohman sought the endorse
ment of community leaders and
local newspapers. He received
advice from Stanford Profes
sors Margot Drekmeier Larry
Friedlander, and Norrr.an Wes
sells. The Palo Alto ".hues was
instrumental in making Hilltop

Seminars a success. The gen
erous support of the Times es
tablished the program in the
public mind and convinced
many parents that it was a valid
educational enterprise.
The parent-child relationship
was an important factor in the
promotion of the program, Loh
man feels. "The majority of par
ents have a minimum of com
munication with their young
children," Lohman states. For
this reason, he feels, it was dif
ficult for parents to sell the pro
gram to their children. And
teen-agers hearing of the pro
gram found their parents unre
ceptive until the program had
become established.
Recognizing the importance
of making a personal pitch to
students, Lohman made a
"home interview" a requisite
for admission to the program.
He wanted to make sure that
participating students were
really interested in the program
and that it did not become a
"dumping ground" for children

unloaded by parents on a con
venient activity.
Despite the enthusiasm of the
students and their parents, the
program did encounter prob
lems. The teachers lacked ex
perience in teaching, and thus
some of the courses had to be
revised as the session pro
gressed. The Hilltop program is
likely to have a large turnover
of faculty each year; it might
always be facing a first-year
experience from the teaching
standpoint. But hiring a new
group of teachers every sum
mer will sustain the program's
freshness and will enable dif
ferent Stanford students to have
this teaching experience.
In addition, Lohman feels that
Stanford students have lost con
tact with the teen age world. He
feels that they maintain an in
tellectual idealism as teachers
that can infect their approach
to course material with an inap
propriate rigidity. A second
danger is that teachers will
seek to entertain their students
rather than stimulate their crea
tivity. Lohman feels that while
the program is intended to stim
ulate teen-agers, it is also an in
valuable teaching experience for
Stanford students.
Lohman encourages Stanford
students who are interested in
serving as teachers to contact
him at Stanford Box 3663 or at
322-6971. Teaching applications
will also be available at the
Summer Employment Office In
Encina. "We are not worried
whether or not a Stanford stu
dent plans to become a teacher.
But we want to find Stanford
students who are interested in
the subject matter and who
want to convey their feelings
about it," Lohman stated. Each
teacher is paid $500 for six
weeks of instructing.
The summer's session will
take place from July 26 to Aug
ust 6. Course material will in
clude painting, sculpting, crea
tive writing and literature, bio
logy, music, international rela
tions, advanced mathematics, an
thropology, and possibly Rus
sian- Cost of the session is $150.

erous support of the Times es
tablished the program in the
public mind and convinced
many parents that it was a valid
educational enterprise.
The parent-child relationship
was an important factor in the
promotion of the program, Loh
man feels. "The majority of par
ents have a minimum of com
munication with their young
children," Lohman states. For
this reason, he feels, it was dif
ficult for parents to sell the pro
gram to their children. And
teen-agers hearing of the pro
gram found their parents unre
ceptive until the program had
become established.
Recognizing the importance
of making a personal pitch to
students, Lohman made a
"home interview" a requisite
for admission to the program.
He wanted to make sure that
participating students were
really interested in the program
and that it did not become a
"dumping ground" for children

unloaded by parents on a con
venient activity.
Despite the enthusiasm of the
students and their parents, the
program did encounter prob
lems. The teachers lacked ex
perience in teaching, and thus
some of the courses had to be
revised as the session pro
gressed. The Hilltop program is
likely to have a large turnover
of faculty each year; it might
always be facing a first-year
experience from the teaching
standpoint. But hiring a new
group of teachers every sum
mer will sustain the program's
freshness and will enable dif
ferent Stanford students to have
this teaching experience.
In addition, Lohman feels that
Stanford students have lost con
tact with the teen age world. He
feels that they maintain an in
tellectual idealism as teachers
that can infect their approach
to course material with an inap
propriate rigidity. A second
danger is that teachers will
seek to entertain their students
rather than stimulate their crea
tivity. Lohman feels that while
the program is intended to stim
ulate teen-agers, it is also an in
valuable teaching experience for
Stanford students.
Lohman encourages Stanford
students who are interested in
serving as teachers to contact
him at Stanford Box 3663 or at
322-6971. Teaching applications
will also be available at the
Summer Employment Office In
Encina. "We are not worried
whether or not a Stanford stu
dent plans to become a teacher.
But we want to find Stanford
students who are interested in
the subject matter and who
want to convey their feelings
about it," Lohman stated. Each
teacher is paid $500 for six
weeks of instructing.
The summer's session will
take place from July 26 to Aug
ust 6. Course material will in
clude painting, sculpting, crea
tive writing and literature, bio
logy, music, international rela
tions, advanced mathematics, an
thropology, and possibly Rus
sian- Cost of the session is $150.

"There is real need and desire lor
an alternative to the approach and
structure of public secondary educa
tion," states Mark Lohman, founder
and prime mover of a new experi
ment in summer education known as
Hilltop Seminars.
A 1965 Stanford graduate, Lohman
conceived the program during his
junior year, when he was tutoring
local high school students. He ob
served that students from affluent
families exhibited a "markedly lim
ited interest in pursuing creative ac
tivities on their own." He felt that
teen agers were spending nonproduc
tive summers filled with camps and
television.
Lohman perceived intellectual po
tential in students who had remained
untouched by public school academ

ics, students who had never been
stimulated to think creatively. He
also felt that many Stanford students
wasted their summers performing
unskilled labor at menial jobs.
The Hilltop program evolved as an
effort to engage the untapped talents
of Stanford students and awaken the
dormant creativity of secondary stu
dents.
Potent Personalities
Last summer, 53 students from the
ages of 9 to 15 participated in the
first session of Hilltop Seminars.
Most students were 12 to 14 years old,
with about an equal number of boys
and girls. Students from a wide range
of backgrounds participated in the
program. A privately-supported schol
arship fund provided about 40 per
cent of the students with financial
aid. Seven Negroes and one Oriental
attended the session.
A variety of subjects were offered
the students. Junior biologists collect
ed insects and butterflies, identified
leaves, and observed bee hives and
soaring among birds. Neophyte ar
tists created a group sculpture and a
free-lance mural- A drama class per
formed skits. And the social science
class produced a magazine, The Out
terrajnean, which served as a critique
of public school education. Other
projects included the making of a
movie and the production of an in
formal play.

The "seminars" were kept small,
usually containing only 6 or 7 stu
dents. Over half the students' time
was purposely unstructured, in an ef
fort to encourage new interests and
individual expression. Most students,
however, were found to depend heav
ily on the stimulation of suggestion
from the teaching staff to start an
activity. Once inspired, the students
proceeded enthusiastically and inde
pendently.
The teaching staff consisted wholly
of Stanford graduates and seniors.
They were allowed to structure their
own courses, without having to cover
a specific amount of material. The
teachers discovered that their own
personalities were more potent in
spirational tools than the ideas they
tried to convey. The effectiveness of
the teachers' appeal was indicated by
parents who reported that for the
first time their children were really
excited about learning. Many parents
were surprised at the sustained en
thusiasm their children showed for
the program.
Host Of Problems
In order to alleviate the boredom
and tediousness associated with pub
lic education, Lohman wanted his
seminars away from regular school
buildings. He sought an outdoor loca
tion in a natural setting.
The attempt to secure facilities for
the program, however, was
stalled by a host of problems.
Official approval was required
from local fire, police, and health
authorities, and securing their
endorsement was no mean task.
But after Lohman had made
two unsuccessful attempts to
find a location, the private Pa
cific High School in Santa Cruz
finally heard about his idea.
Arrangements were completed
for the Hilltop program to use
the Pacific facilities. With that,
Hilltop Seminars leapfrogged
the plethora of regulations im
posed by local ordinances, since
the Pacific facilities had already
obtained approval.
Community Endorsement
Then the real work began.
Lohman sought the endorse
ment of community leaders and
local newspapers. He received
advice from Stanford Profes
sors Margot Drekmeier Larry
Friedlander, and Norrr.an Wes
sells. The Palo Alto ".hues was
instrumental in making Hilltop

Seminars a success. The gen
erous support of the Times es
tablished the program in the

many parents that it was a valid

ages of 9 to 15 participated in the
first session of Hilltop Seminars.
Most students were 12 to 14 years old,
with about an equal number of boys
and girls. Students from a wide range
of backgrounds participated in the
program. A privately-supported schol
arship fund provided about 40 per
cent of the students with financial
aid. Seven Negroes and one Oriental
attended the session.
A variety of subjects were offered
the students. Junior biologists collect
ed insects and butterflies, identified
leaves, and observed bee hives and
soaring among birds. Neophyte ar
tists created a group sculpture and a
free-lance mural- A drama class per
formed skits. And the social science
class produced a magazine, The Out
terrajnean, which served as a critique
of public school education. Other
projects included the making of a
movie and the production of an in
formal play.

The "seminars" were kept small,
usually containing only 6 or 7 stu
dents. Over half the students' time
was purposely unstructured, in an ef
fort to encourage new interests and
individual expression. Most students,
however, were found to depend heav
ily on the stimulation of suggestion
from the teaching staff to start an
activity. Once inspired, the students
proceeded enthusiastically and inde
pendently.
The teaching staff consisted wholly
of Stanford graduates and seniors.
They were allowed to structure their
own courses, without having to cover
a specific amount of material. The
teachers discovered that their own
personalities were more potent in
spirational tools than the ideas they
tried to convey. The effectiveness of
the teachers' appeal was indicated by
parents who reported that for the
first time their children were really
excited about learning. Many parents
were surprised at the sustained en
thusiasm their children showed for
the program.

"There is real need and desire lor
an alternative to the approach and
structure of public secondary educa
tion," states Mark Lohman, founder
and prime mover of a new experi
ment in summer education known as
Hilltop Seminars.
A 1965 Stanford graduate, Lohman
conceived the program during his
junior year, when he was tutoring
local high school students. He ob
served that students from affluent
families exhibited a "markedly lim
ited interest in pursuing creative ac
tivities on their own." He felt that
teen agers were spending nonproduc
tive summers filled with camps and
television.
Lohman perceived intellectual po
tential in students who had remained
untouched by public school academ

ics, students who had never been
stimulated to think creatively. He
also felt that many Stanford students
wasted their summers performing
unskilled labor at menial jobs.
The Hilltop program evolved as an
effort to engage the untapped talents
of Stanford students and awaken the
dormant creativity of secondary stu
dents.

Host Of Problems
In order to alleviate the boredom
and tediousness associated with pub
lic education, Lohman wanted his
seminars away from regular school
buildings. He sought an outdoor loca
tion in a natural setting.
The attempt to secure facilities for
the program, however, was
stalled by a host of problems.
Official approval was required
from local fire, police, and health
authorities, and securing their
endorsement was no mean task.
But after Lohman had made
two unsuccessful attempts to
find a location, the private Pa
cific High School in Santa Cruz
finally heard about his idea.
Arrangements were completed
for the Hilltop program to use
the Pacific facilities. With that,
Hilltop Seminars leapfrogged
the plethora of regulations im
posed by local ordinances, since
the Pacific facilities had already
obtained approval.
Community Endorsement
Then the real work began.
Lohman sought the endorse
ment of community leaders and
local newspapers. He received
advice from Stanford Profes
sors Margot Drekmeier Larry
Friedlander, and Norrr.an Wes
sells. The Palo Alto ".hues was
instrumental in making Hilltop

Seminars a success. The gen
erous support of the Times es
tablished the program in the
public mind and convinced
many parents that it was a valid
educational enterprise.
The parent-child relationship
was an important factor in the
promotion of the program, Loh
man feels. "The majority of par
ents have a minimum of com
munication with their young
children," Lohman states. For
this reason, he feels, it was dif
ficult for parents to sell the pro
gram to their children. And
teen-agers hearing of the pro
gram found their parents unre
ceptive until the program had
become established.
Recognizing the importance
of making a personal pitch to
students, Lohman made a
"home interview" a requisite
for admission to the program.
He wanted to make sure that
participating students were
really interested in the program
and that it did not become a
"dumping ground" for children

unloaded by parents on a con
venient activity.
Despite the enthusiasm of the
students and their parents, the
program did encounter prob
lems. The teachers lacked ex
perience in teaching, and thus
some of the courses had to be
revised as the session pro
gressed. The Hilltop program is
likely to have a large turnover
of faculty each year; it might
always be facing a first-year
experience from the teaching
standpoint. But hiring a new
group of teachers every sum
mer will sustain the program's
freshness and will enable dif
ferent Stanford students to have
this teaching experience.
In addition, Lohman feels that
Stanford students have lost con
tact with the teen age world. He
feels that they maintain an in
tellectual idealism as teachers
that can infect their approach
to course material with an inap
propriate rigidity. A second
danger is that teachers will
seek to entertain their students
rather than stimulate their crea
tivity. Lohman feels that while
the program is intended to stim
ulate teen-agers, it is also an in
valuable teaching experience for
Stanford students.
Lohman encourages Stanford
students who are interested in
serving as teachers to contact
him at Stanford Box 3663 or at
322-6971. Teaching applications
will also be available at the
Summer Employment Office In
Encina. "We are not worried
whether or not a Stanford stu
dent plans to become a teacher.
But we want to find Stanford
students who are interested in
the subject matter and who
want to convey their feelings
about it," Lohman stated. Each
teacher is paid $500 for six
weeks of instructing.
The summer's session will
take place from July 26 to Aug
ust 6. Course material will in
clude painting, sculpting, crea
tive writing and literature, bio
logy, music, international rela
tions, advanced mathematics, an
thropology, and possibly Rus
sian- Cost of the session is $150.

perience in teaching, and thus
some of the courses had to be
revised as the session pro
gressed. The Hilltop program is
likely to have a large turnover
of faculty each year; it might
always be facing a first-year
experience from the teaching
standpoint. But hiring a new
group of teachers every sum
mer will sustain the program's
freshness and will enable dif
ferent Stanford students to have
this teaching experience.
In addition, Lohman feels that
Stanford students have lost con
tact with the teen age world. He
feels that they maintain an in
tellectual idealism as teachers
that can infect their approach
to course material with an inap
propriate rigidity. A second
danger is that teachers will
seek to entertain their students
rather than stimulate their crea
tivity. Lohman feels that while
the program is intended to stim
ulate teen-agers, it is also an in
valuable teaching experience for
Stanford students.
Lohman encourages Stanford
students who are interested in
serving as teachers to contact
him at Stanford Box 3663 or at
322-6971. Teaching applications
will also be available at the
Summer Employment Office In
Encina. "We are not worried
whether or not a Stanford stu
dent plans to become a teacher.
But we want to find Stanford
students who are interested in
the subject matter and who
want to convey their feelings
about it," Lohman stated. Each
teacher is paid $500 for six
weeks of instructing.
The summer's session will
take place from July 26 to Aug
ust 6. Course material will in
clude painting, sculpting, crea
tive writing and literature, bio
logy, music, international rela
tions, advanced mathematics, an
thropology, and possibly Rus
sian- Cost of the session is $150.

"There is real need and desire lor
an alternative to the approach and
structure of public secondary educa
tion," states Mark Lohman, founder
and prime mover of a new experi
ment in summer education known as
Hilltop Seminars.
A 1965 Stanford graduate, Lohman
conceived the program during his
junior year, when he was tutoring
local high school students. He ob
served that students from affluent
families exhibited a "markedly lim
ited interest in pursuing creative ac
tivities on their own." He felt that
teen agers were spending nonproduc
tive summers filled with camps and
television.
Lohman perceived intellectual po
tential in students who had remained
untouched by public school academ

ics, students who had never been
stimulated to think creatively. He
also felt that many Stanford students
wasted their summers performing
unskilled labor at menial jobs.
The Hilltop program evolved as an
effort to engage the untapped talents
of Stanford students and awaken the
dormant creativity of secondary stu
dents.
Potent Personalities
Last summer, 53 students from the
ages of 9 to 15 participated in the
first session of Hilltop Seminars.
Most students were 12 to 14 years old,
with about an equal number of boys
and girls. Students from a wide range
of backgrounds participated in the
program. A privately-supported schol
arship fund provided about 40 per
cent of the students with financial
aid. Seven Negroes and one Oriental
attended the session.
A variety of subjects were offered
the students. Junior biologists collect
ed insects and butterflies, identified
leaves, and observed bee hives and
soaring among birds. Neophyte ar
tists created a group sculpture and a
free-lance mural- A drama class per
formed skits. And the social science
class produced a magazine, The Out
terrajnean, which served as a critique
of public school education. Other
projects included the making of a
movie and the production of an in
formal play.

The "seminars" were kept small,
usually containing only 6 or 7 stu
dents. Over half the students' time
was purposely unstructured, in an ef
fort to encourage new interests and
individual expression. Most students,
however, were found to depend heav
ily on the stimulation of suggestion
from the teaching staff to start an
activity. Once inspired, the students
proceeded enthusiastically and inde
pendently.
The teaching staff consisted wholly
of Stanford graduates and seniors.
They were allowed to structure their
own courses, without having to cover
a specific amount of material. The
teachers discovered that their own
personalities were more potent in
spirational tools than the ideas they
tried to convey. The effectiveness of
the teachers' appeal was indicated by
parents who reported that for the
first time their children were really
excited about learning. Many parents
were surprised at the sustained en
thusiasm their children showed for
the program.
Host Of Problems
In order to alleviate the boredom
and tediousness associated with pub
lic education, Lohman wanted his
seminars away from regular school
buildings. He sought an outdoor loca
tion in a natural setting.
The attempt to secure facilities for
the program, however, was
stalled by a host of problems.
Official approval was required
from local fire, police, and health
authorities, and securing their
endorsement was no mean task.
But after Lohman had made
two unsuccessful attempts to
find a location, the private Pa
cific High School in Santa Cruz
finally heard about his idea.
Arrangements were completed
for the Hilltop program to use
the Pacific facilities. With that,
Hilltop Seminars leapfrogged
the plethora of regulations im
posed by local ordinances, since
the Pacific facilities had already
obtained approval.
Community Endorsement
Then the real work began.
Lohman sought the endorse
ment of community leaders and
local newspapers. He received
advice from Stanford Profes
sors Margot Drekmeier Larry
Friedlander, and Norrr.an Wes
sells. The Palo Alto ".hues was
instrumental in making Hilltop

Seminars a success. The gen
erous support of the Times es
tablished the program in the
public mind and convinced
many parents that it was a valid
educational enterprise.
The parent-child relationship
was an important factor in the
promotion of the program, Loh
man feels. "The majority of par
ents have a minimum of com
munication with their young
children," Lohman states. For
this reason, he feels, it was dif
ficult for parents to sell the pro
gram to their children. And
teen-agers hearing of the pro
gram found their parents unre
ceptive until the program had
become established.
Recognizing the importance
of making a personal pitch to
students, Lohman made a
"home interview" a requisite
for admission to the program.
He wanted to make sure that
participating students were
really interested in the program
and that it did not become a
"dumping ground" for children

unloaded by parents on a con
venient activity.
Despite the enthusiasm of the
students and their parents, the
program did encounter prob
lems. The teachers lacked ex
perience in teaching, and thus
some of the courses had to be
revised as the session pro
gressed. The Hilltop program is
likely to have a large turnover
of faculty each year; it might
always be facing a first-year
experience from the teaching
standpoint. But hiring a new
group of teachers every sum
mer will sustain the program's
freshness and will enable dif
ferent Stanford students to have
this teaching experience.
In addition, Lohman feels that
