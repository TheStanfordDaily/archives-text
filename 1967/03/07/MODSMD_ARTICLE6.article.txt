"There is real need and desire lor
an alternative to the approach and
structure of public secondary educa
tion," states Mark Lohman, founder
and prime mover of a new experi
ment in summer education known as
Hilltop Seminars.
A 1965 Stanford graduate, Lohman
conceived the program during his
junior year, when he was tutoring
local high school students. He ob
served that students from affluent
families exhibited a "markedly lim
ited interest in pursuing creative ac
tivities on their own." He felt that
teen agers were spending nonproduc
tive summers filled with camps and
television.
Lohman perceived intellectual po
tential in students who had remained
untouched by public school academ

ics, students who had never been
stimulated to think creatively. He
also felt that many Stanford students
wasted their summers performing
unskilled labor at menial jobs.
The Hilltop program evolved as an
effort to engage the untapped talents
of Stanford students and awaken the
dormant creativity of secondary stu
dents.
Potent Personalities
Last summer, 53 students from the
ages of 9 to 15 participated in the
first session of Hilltop Seminars.
Most students were 12 to 14 years old,
with about an equal number of boys
and girls. Students from a wide range
of backgrounds participated in the
program. A privately-supported schol
arship fund provided about 40 per
cent of the students with financial
aid. Seven Negroes and one Oriental
attended the session.
A variety of subjects were offered
the students. Junior biologists collect
ed insects and butterflies, identified
leaves, and observed bee hives and
soaring among birds. Neophyte ar
tists created a group sculpture and a
free-lance mural- A drama class per
formed skits. And the social science
class produced a magazine, The Out
terrajnean, which served as a critique
of public school education. Other
projects included the making of a
movie and the production of an in
formal play.

The "seminars" were kept small,
usually containing only 6 or 7 stu
dents. Over half the students' time
was purposely unstructured, in an ef
fort to encourage new interests and
individual expression. Most students,
however, were found to depend heav
ily on the stimulation of suggestion
from the teaching staff to start an
activity. Once inspired, the students
proceeded enthusiastically and inde
pendently.
The teaching staff consisted wholly
of Stanford graduates and seniors.
They were allowed to structure their
own courses, without having to cover
a specific amount of material. The
teachers discovered that their own
personalities were more potent in
spirational tools than the ideas they
tried to convey. The effectiveness of
the teachers' appeal was indicated by
parents who reported that for the
first time their children were really
excited about learning. Many parents
were surprised at the sustained en
thusiasm their children showed for
the program.
Host Of Problems
In order to alleviate the boredom
and tediousness associated with pub
lic education, Lohman wanted his
seminars away from regular school
buildings. He sought an outdoor loca
tion in a natural setting.
