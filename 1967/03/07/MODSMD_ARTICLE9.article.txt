# Americans At War: Saintly Children
## 
### HOWARD MOFFETT The Collegiate Press Service 
(CPS) — One of Yale's great
courses is Edmund Morgan's re
view of American colonial his
tory. Beginning with the Puritan
fathers, Professor Morgan
teaches that our history has
been deeply influenced by the
early Americans' view of them
selves as a morally pure and
righteous people — by contrast
with the decadent, corrupt sons
of Europe.
I didn't really appreciate what
he was saying until I had been
in Vietnam for several months.
What finally brought the idea
home—and left me depressed
and scared—yvas a series of in
terviews with army and air force
chaplains.
There are over 430 American
chaplains in Vietnam—some 320
protestants, more than 100 Rom
an Catholics, and three Jews.
All are volunteers.
I interviewed thirteen. Almost
to a man, their consciences were
aggressively clear about the
moral rationale for the U.S. mili
tary commitment.
US Against Evil
That might be expected of
chaplains. But what surprised
and depressed me were the glow
ing terms they used to describe
what is basically an agonizing,
dirty business of making many
people suffer in order to prove a
political point. In their view of
the world, Americans are still
the standard bearers of morality
in the battle against evil. Cotton
Mather would have recognized
his descendants instantly.
On the basis of these chap
lains' interviews, a disinterested
observer would have to charac
terize the American approach
to war as (a) saintly and (b)
child-like. Consider the follow
ing four assumptions:
(1) We are here to save the
Vietnamese people from the evils
of Communism. This theme was
sounded by at least ten of the
thirteen chaplains. The follow
ing quotes are representative,
and in my opinion the complete
contexts would not change their
import:
"The Viet Cong are misguided
zealots who have been given the
wrong information all their lives.
What would you believe if you
had been taught all your life
that Americans are the aggres
sors?" — Chaplain Ross C.
Wright, Conservative Baptist
from Los Angeles.
"How can you call this war
immoral? You can't say life is
more important than personal
freedoms, honor, and the dignity
of human beings. The basic
moral issue is: are these things
worth defending?" — Father
•Thomas D. McGrath (known to
;a less bellicose colleague as
Quick Draw'), Roman Catholic
from Worcester, Mass.
"I'm not so concerned about

the democratic process, but I
think the clergy should be on
the side of right. Maybe the
majority of the Vietnamese peo
ple do support the Viet Cong,
but if so they do it out of igno
rance and fear- . . . It's like our
American race riots. The police
at Watts weren't very popular,
but they were right."—Orville
McCormack, Assemblies of God,
Oklahoma City.
McCormack, an air force chap
lain, says some of the men who
come back from bombing mis
sions break down and cry over
mistakes they have made In
hitting the wrong village or
striking innocent civilians. He
concludes, "But to compare these
accidents with cold-blooded Viet
Cong atrocities is to compare a
man who has had a car acci
dent with a killer who goes
downtown and machine guns
twenty people. ... GI Joe is a
healer, not a killer. We're not
here to kill people but to keep
them from being killed, not to
conquer but to free, not to take
but to give our lives in order
that they might have. ... 'Great
er love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life
for his friend.' "
Their Own Enemies
Lest the lighthearted laugh too
loud, it should be said that there
is some ground for the attitudes
of most of these men, some
truth in what they say. But
when all is said and done, in
many parts of this country sav
ing the Vietnamese from the
evils of Communism boils down
to saving them from themselves
—whether or not they are Com
munists.
The Viet Cong may be zealots,
but few Vietnamese would call
them misguided. Personal free
dom and human dignity may be
more important than life to
Americans, but Saigon and
Washington are asking many
Vietnamese to trade their lives
for a freedom and dignity they
never had.
(2) We should be given credit
for our good intentions, for sin
cerely wanting to help the Viet
namese people. Most American
officials in Vietnam like to talk
about how America is helping
the Vietnamese. The chaplains
were no exception; they referred
most frequently to the military's
civic action programs.
It is true, there are a stag
gering number of hopelessly al
truistic Americans running
around Vietnam. By old colonial
standards, they are shedding
much blood and many tears with
little to show for it in the way
of dollar profits. Gl's build
orphanages, support poor fam
ilies, put hundreds of kids
through school, hand out choco
late bars the length and breadth
of Vietnam, and often make con
siderable personal sacrifices in
the process.

But with child-like naivete and
almost total ignorance of what
a century of colonialism has
taught the Vietnamese, they ex
pect to be thanked. They expect
the Vietnamese to take their
good works and good intentions
at face value. Less than a frac
tion speak more than a few
words of Vietnamese, and
many have no idea why their
generosity is often met with
suspicion. In areas where hand
outs have become the rule, some
Americans complain that "the
Vietnamese act like we owe it
to them."
(3) The Viet Cong should not
use sneaky tricks to kill Ameri
can soldiers. The thought carica
tured here runs just below the
surface of many American con
versations. The implications Is
that war ought to be played by
the rules, as defined in the U.S.
Code of Chivalry.
Chaplain Wright told of a
young American captain who
had been killed trying to clean

out an enemy cave in the Cen
tral Highlands. A North Viet
namese soldier had come out of
the cave, pushing a woman and
child in front of him. Not want
ing to hit the human shields, the
American lowered his gun,
whereupon the North Vietnam
ese shot him point blank in the
head.
All's Fair In War
It was a dirty thing to do, and
I like it no better than the young
American's mother would. But
to suggest that it wasn't fair,
and that the North Vietnamese
soldier was an evil ogre because
he took unfair advantage, is to
make war into a child's game.
(Tit for tat: within minutes the
cave had been blown with ex
plosives and one GI estimated
over 100 Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese were buried alive
inside.)
You dear people who say the
Viet Cong should not use sneaky
tricks to kill American soldiers,
have you ever talked with a

Vietnamese who says Americans
should not be here in the first
place, should not bomb and burn
and loose their horrible instru
ments of death on Vietnamese
villages, should not seek to im
pose American solutions on a
people whose problems they do
not understand.
(4) The Vietnamese should
be more responsive to our bene
volent but firm approach to
pacification. I depart from the
chaplains' script at this point
to discuss the American way of
pacification, which refers to
making hostile peasants friend
ly.
The Marines have been pacify
ing villages in I Corps (Central
Vietnam) for a year and a half
now, and their example has been
followed by many other Ameri
can units engaged in civic ac
tion programs. The basic form
ula is to move into a village,
maintain order by intensive pa
trolling and hunt down any stray
guerillas with the left hand,
while setting up medical aid
programs, building dams and
spillways, and giving out candy,
soap and toothpaste with the
right.
Often the Gl's make friends,
especially among the kids. But
observers who live in I Corps
say the hard facts are that most
of these villages are less paci
fied than when the leathernecks
landed.
'Be Good Now'
There are many reasons for
this, but one may be that the
double offer of bullets to bad
Vietnamese and candy to good
ones suggests something of the
father trying to discipline his
child: "Now Nguyen, be a good
Vietnamese and don't throw a
temper tantrum against your
government. If you be good,
Uncle Sam will give you choco
late bars and merthiolate for

your cuts. But If you be bad,
we'll have to cut you down " To
those Vietnamese who are weary
of being treated as children by
great white fathers, this ap
proach misses the heart of the
problem by about 180 degrees.
The lessons we learn from the
American experience in Vietnam
will be largely conditioned by
our own view of ourselves. If
the foregoing is at all to the
point, it suggests there are a lot
of psychological cobwebs that
will have to be cleared away
first.
Some may object that the
chaplains' views are not repre
sentative. Chaplains, after all,
would be bound to come up with
moral reasons for a war. But
the protests of many civilian
clergy suggests that the issue is
not so simple. (Indeed, they
raise the interesting question of
how a single church inspired by
one Lord can produce such dif
ferent answers to such funda
mental problems.)
What It's like
Furthermore, the language of
the chaplains is the language of
many—not all, but many—Amer
ican officers and enlisted men
who have served in Vietnam.
(Would you believe the lan
guage of Dean Rusk?) These
are the men who will go back
and tell their children and their
Lions Clubs what it was really
like in Vietnam.
If, for historical, political and
diplomatic reasons, we must
fight this war—and sometimes I
think we must —then let us do it.
But let's not do it in the ar
rogance of purity. Let's not put
on the whole armor of God in
order to fight Communist Sa
tans. Let's not go to war as little
children. And for the love of
God, let us not treat Nguyen
Charlie as a child.

of Europe.
I didn't really appreciate what
he was saying until I had been
in Vietnam for several months.
What finally brought the idea
home—and left me depressed
and scared—yvas a series of in
terviews with army and air force
chaplains.
There are over 430 American
chaplains in Vietnam—some 320
protestants, more than 100 Rom
an Catholics, and three Jews.
All are volunteers.
I interviewed thirteen. Almost
to a man, their consciences were
aggressively clear about the
moral rationale for the U.S. mili
tary commitment.
US Against Evil
That might be expected of
chaplains. But what surprised
and depressed me were the glow
ing terms they used to describe
what is basically an agonizing,
dirty business of making many
people suffer in order to prove a
political point. In their view of
the world, Americans are still
the standard bearers of morality
in the battle against evil. Cotton
Mather would have recognized
his descendants instantly.
On the basis of these chap
lains' interviews, a disinterested
observer would have to charac
terize the American approach
to war as (a) saintly and (b)
child-like. Consider the follow
ing four assumptions:
(1) We are here to save the
Vietnamese people from the evils
of Communism. This theme was
sounded by at least ten of the
thirteen chaplains. The follow
ing quotes are representative,
and in my opinion the complete
contexts would not change their
import:
"The Viet Cong are misguided
zealots who have been given the
wrong information all their lives.
What would you believe if you
had been taught all your life
that Americans are the aggres
sors?" — Chaplain Ross C.
Wright, Conservative Baptist
from Los Angeles.
"How can you call this war
immoral? You can't say life is
more important than personal
freedoms, honor, and the dignity
of human beings. The basic
moral issue is: are these things
worth defending?" — Father
•Thomas D. McGrath (known to
;a less bellicose colleague as
Quick Draw'), Roman Catholic
from Worcester, Mass.
"I'm not so concerned about

the democratic process, but I
think the clergy should be on
the side of right. Maybe the
majority of the Vietnamese peo
ple do support the Viet Cong,
but if so they do it out of igno
rance and fear- . . . It's like our
American race riots. The police
at Watts weren't very popular,
but they were right."—Orville
McCormack, Assemblies of God,
Oklahoma City.
McCormack, an air force chap
lain, says some of the men who
come back from bombing mis
sions break down and cry over
mistakes they have made In
hitting the wrong village or
striking innocent civilians. He
concludes, "But to compare these
accidents with cold-blooded Viet
Cong atrocities is to compare a
man who has had a car acci
dent with a killer who goes
downtown and machine guns
twenty people. ... GI Joe is a
healer, not a killer. We're not
here to kill people but to keep
them from being killed, not to
conquer but to free, not to take
but to give our lives in order
that they might have. ... 'Great
er love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life
for his friend.' "
Their Own Enemies
Lest the lighthearted laugh too
loud, it should be said that there
is some ground for the attitudes
of most of these men, some
truth in what they say. But
when all is said and done, in
many parts of this country sav
ing the Vietnamese from the
evils of Communism boils down
to saving them from themselves
—whether or not they are Com
munists.
The Viet Cong may be zealots,
but few Vietnamese would call
them misguided. Personal free
dom and human dignity may be
more important than life to
Americans, but Saigon and
Washington are asking many
Vietnamese to trade their lives
for a freedom and dignity they
never had.
(2) We should be given credit
for our good intentions, for sin
cerely wanting to help the Viet
namese people. Most American
officials in Vietnam like to talk
about how America is helping
the Vietnamese. The chaplains
were no exception; they referred
most frequently to the military's
civic action programs.
It is true, there are a stag
gering number of hopelessly al
truistic Americans running
around Vietnam. By old colonial
standards, they are shedding
much blood and many tears with
little to show for it in the way
of dollar profits. Gl's build
orphanages, support poor fam
ilies, put hundreds of kids
through school, hand out choco
late bars the length and breadth
of Vietnam, and often make con
siderable personal sacrifices in
the process.

But with child-like naivete and
almost total ignorance of what
a century of colonialism has
taught the Vietnamese, they ex
pect to be thanked. They expect
the Vietnamese to take their
good works and good intentions
at face value. Less than a frac
tion speak more than a few
words of Vietnamese, and
many have no idea why their
generosity is often met with
suspicion. In areas where hand
outs have become the rule, some
Americans complain that "the
Vietnamese act like we owe it
to them."
(3) The Viet Cong should not
use sneaky tricks to kill Ameri
can soldiers. The thought carica
tured here runs just below the
surface of many American con
versations. The implications Is
that war ought to be played by
the rules, as defined in the U.S.
Code of Chivalry.
Chaplain Wright told of a
young American captain who
had been killed trying to clean

out an enemy cave in the Cen
tral Highlands. A North Viet
namese soldier had come out of
the cave, pushing a woman and
child in front of him. Not want
ing to hit the human shields, the
American lowered his gun,
whereupon the North Vietnam
ese shot him point blank in the
head.
All's Fair In War
It was a dirty thing to do, and
I like it no better than the young
American's mother would. But
to suggest that it wasn't fair,
and that the North Vietnamese
soldier was an evil ogre because
he took unfair advantage, is to
make war into a child's game.
(Tit for tat: within minutes the
cave had been blown with ex
plosives and one GI estimated
over 100 Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese were buried alive
inside.)
You dear people who say the
Viet Cong should not use sneaky
tricks to kill American soldiers,
have you ever talked with a

Vietnamese who says Americans
should not be here in the first
place, should not bomb and burn
and loose their horrible instru
ments of death on Vietnamese
villages, should not seek to im
pose American solutions on a
people whose problems they do
not understand.
(4) The Vietnamese should
be more responsive to our bene
volent but firm approach to
pacification. I depart from the
chaplains' script at this point
to discuss the American way of
pacification, which refers to
making hostile peasants friend
ly.
The Marines have been pacify
ing villages in I Corps (Central
Vietnam) for a year and a half
now, and their example has been
followed by many other Ameri
can units engaged in civic ac
tion programs. The basic form
ula is to move into a village,
maintain order by intensive pa
trolling and hunt down any stray
guerillas with the left hand,
while setting up medical aid
programs, building dams and
spillways, and giving out candy,
soap and toothpaste with the
right.
Often the Gl's make friends,
especially among the kids. But
observers who live in I Corps
say the hard facts are that most
of these villages are less paci
fied than when the leathernecks
landed.
'Be Good Now'
There are many reasons for
this, but one may be that the
double offer of bullets to bad
Vietnamese and candy to good
ones suggests something of the
father trying to discipline his
child: "Now Nguyen, be a good
Vietnamese and don't throw a
temper tantrum against your
government. If you be good,
Uncle Sam will give you choco
late bars and merthiolate for

your cuts. But If you be bad,
we'll have to cut you down " To
those Vietnamese who are weary
of being treated as children by
great white fathers, this ap
proach misses the heart of the
problem by about 180 degrees.
The lessons we learn from the
American experience in Vietnam
will be largely conditioned by
our own view of ourselves. If
the foregoing is at all to the
point, it suggests there are a lot
of psychological cobwebs that
will have to be cleared away
first.
Some may object that the
chaplains' views are not repre
sentative. Chaplains, after all,
would be bound to come up with
moral reasons for a war. But
the protests of many civilian
clergy suggests that the issue is
not so simple. (Indeed, they
raise the interesting question of
how a single church inspired by
one Lord can produce such dif
ferent answers to such funda
mental problems.)
What It's like
Furthermore, the language of
the chaplains is the language of
many—not all, but many—Amer
ican officers and enlisted men
who have served in Vietnam.
(Would you believe the lan
guage of Dean Rusk?) These
are the men who will go back
and tell their children and their
Lions Clubs what it was really
like in Vietnam.
If, for historical, political and
diplomatic reasons, we must
fight this war—and sometimes I
think we must —then let us do it.
But let's not do it in the ar
rogance of purity. Let's not put
on the whole armor of God in
order to fight Communist Sa
tans. Let's not go to war as little
children. And for the love of
God, let us not treat Nguyen
Charlie as a child.

protestants, more than 100 Rom
an Catholics, and three Jews.
All are volunteers.
I interviewed thirteen. Almost
to a man, their consciences were
aggressively clear about the
moral rationale for the U.S. mili
tary commitment.
US Against Evil
That might be expected of
chaplains. But what surprised
and depressed me were the glow
ing terms they used to describe
what is basically an agonizing,
dirty business of making many
people suffer in order to prove a
political point. In their view of
the world, Americans are still
the standard bearers of morality
in the battle against evil. Cotton
Mather would have recognized
his descendants instantly.
On the basis of these chap
lains' interviews, a disinterested
observer would have to charac
terize the American approach
to war as (a) saintly and (b)
child-like. Consider the follow
ing four assumptions:
(1) We are here to save the
Vietnamese people from the evils
of Communism. This theme was
sounded by at least ten of the
thirteen chaplains. The follow
ing quotes are representative,
and in my opinion the complete
contexts would not change their
import:
"The Viet Cong are misguided
zealots who have been given the
wrong information all their lives.
What would you believe if you
had been taught all your life
that Americans are the aggres
sors?" — Chaplain Ross C.
Wright, Conservative Baptist
from Los Angeles.
"How can you call this war
immoral? You can't say life is
more important than personal
freedoms, honor, and the dignity
of human beings. The basic
moral issue is: are these things
worth defending?" — Father
•Thomas D. McGrath (known to
;a less bellicose colleague as
Quick Draw'), Roman Catholic
from Worcester, Mass.
"I'm not so concerned about

the democratic process, but I
think the clergy should be on
the side of right. Maybe the
majority of the Vietnamese peo
ple do support the Viet Cong,
but if so they do it out of igno
rance and fear- . . . It's like our
American race riots. The police
at Watts weren't very popular,
but they were right."—Orville
McCormack, Assemblies of God,
Oklahoma City.
McCormack, an air force chap
lain, says some of the men who
come back from bombing mis
sions break down and cry over
mistakes they have made In
hitting the wrong village or
striking innocent civilians. He
concludes, "But to compare these
accidents with cold-blooded Viet
Cong atrocities is to compare a
man who has had a car acci
dent with a killer who goes
downtown and machine guns
twenty people. ... GI Joe is a
healer, not a killer. We're not
here to kill people but to keep
them from being killed, not to
conquer but to free, not to take
but to give our lives in order
that they might have. ... 'Great
er love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life
for his friend.' "
Their Own Enemies
Lest the lighthearted laugh too
loud, it should be said that there
is some ground for the attitudes
of most of these men, some
truth in what they say. But
when all is said and done, in
many parts of this country sav
ing the Vietnamese from the
evils of Communism boils down
to saving them from themselves
—whether or not they are Com
munists.
The Viet Cong may be zealots,
but few Vietnamese would call
them misguided. Personal free
dom and human dignity may be
more important than life to
Americans, but Saigon and
Washington are asking many
Vietnamese to trade their lives
for a freedom and dignity they
never had.
(2) We should be given credit
for our good intentions, for sin
cerely wanting to help the Viet
namese people. Most American
officials in Vietnam like to talk
about how America is helping
the Vietnamese. The chaplains
were no exception; they referred
most frequently to the military's
civic action programs.
It is true, there are a stag
gering number of hopelessly al
truistic Americans running
around Vietnam. By old colonial
standards, they are shedding
much blood and many tears with
little to show for it in the way
of dollar profits. Gl's build
orphanages, support poor fam
ilies, put hundreds of kids
through school, hand out choco
late bars the length and breadth
of Vietnam, and often make con
siderable personal sacrifices in
the process.

But with child-like naivete and
almost total ignorance of what
a century of colonialism has
taught the Vietnamese, they ex
pect to be thanked. They expect
the Vietnamese to take their
good works and good intentions
at face value. Less than a frac
tion speak more than a few
words of Vietnamese, and
many have no idea why their
generosity is often met with
suspicion. In areas where hand
outs have become the rule, some
Americans complain that "the
Vietnamese act like we owe it
to them."
(3) The Viet Cong should not
use sneaky tricks to kill Ameri
can soldiers. The thought carica
tured here runs just below the
surface of many American con
versations. The implications Is
that war ought to be played by
the rules, as defined in the U.S.
Code of Chivalry.
Chaplain Wright told of a
young American captain who
had been killed trying to clean

out an enemy cave in the Cen
tral Highlands. A North Viet
namese soldier had come out of
the cave, pushing a woman and
child in front of him. Not want
ing to hit the human shields, the
American lowered his gun,
whereupon the North Vietnam
ese shot him point blank in the
head.
All's Fair In War
It was a dirty thing to do, and
I like it no better than the young
American's mother would. But
to suggest that it wasn't fair,
and that the North Vietnamese
soldier was an evil ogre because
he took unfair advantage, is to
make war into a child's game.
(Tit for tat: within minutes the
cave had been blown with ex
plosives and one GI estimated
over 100 Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese were buried alive
inside.)
You dear people who say the
Viet Cong should not use sneaky
tricks to kill American soldiers,
have you ever talked with a

Vietnamese who says Americans
should not be here in the first
place, should not bomb and burn
and loose their horrible instru
ments of death on Vietnamese
villages, should not seek to im
pose American solutions on a
people whose problems they do
not understand.
(4) The Vietnamese should
be more responsive to our bene
volent but firm approach to
pacification. I depart from the
chaplains' script at this point
to discuss the American way of
pacification, which refers to
making hostile peasants friend
ly.
The Marines have been pacify
ing villages in I Corps (Central
Vietnam) for a year and a half
now, and their example has been
followed by many other Ameri
can units engaged in civic ac
tion programs. The basic form
ula is to move into a village,
maintain order by intensive pa
trolling and hunt down any stray
guerillas with the left hand,
while setting up medical aid
programs, building dams and
spillways, and giving out candy,
soap and toothpaste with the
right.
Often the Gl's make friends,
especially among the kids. But
observers who live in I Corps
say the hard facts are that most
of these villages are less paci
fied than when the leathernecks
landed.
'Be Good Now'
There are many reasons for
this, but one may be that the
double offer of bullets to bad
Vietnamese and candy to good
ones suggests something of the
father trying to discipline his
child: "Now Nguyen, be a good
Vietnamese and don't throw a
temper tantrum against your
government. If you be good,
Uncle Sam will give you choco
late bars and merthiolate for

your cuts. But If you be bad,
we'll have to cut you down " To
those Vietnamese who are weary
of being treated as children by
great white fathers, this ap
proach misses the heart of the
problem by about 180 degrees.
The lessons we learn from the
American experience in Vietnam
will be largely conditioned by
our own view of ourselves. If
the foregoing is at all to the
point, it suggests there are a lot
of psychological cobwebs that
will have to be cleared away
first.
Some may object that the
chaplains' views are not repre
sentative. Chaplains, after all,
would be bound to come up with
moral reasons for a war. But
the protests of many civilian
clergy suggests that the issue is
not so simple. (Indeed, they
raise the interesting question of
how a single church inspired by
one Lord can produce such dif
ferent answers to such funda
mental problems.)
What It's like
Furthermore, the language of
the chaplains is the language of
many—not all, but many—Amer
ican officers and enlisted men
who have served in Vietnam.
(Would you believe the lan
guage of Dean Rusk?) These
are the men who will go back
and tell their children and their
Lions Clubs what it was really
like in Vietnam.
If, for historical, political and
diplomatic reasons, we must
fight this war—and sometimes I
think we must —then let us do it.
But let's not do it in the ar
rogance of purity. Let's not put
on the whole armor of God in
order to fight Communist Sa
tans. Let's not go to war as little
children. And for the love of
God, let us not treat Nguyen
Charlie as a child.

and depressed me were the glow
ing terms they used to describe
what is basically an agonizing,
dirty business of making many
people suffer in order to prove a
political point. In their view of
the world, Americans are still
the standard bearers of morality
in the battle against evil. Cotton
Mather would have recognized
his descendants instantly.
On the basis of these chap
lains' interviews, a disinterested
observer would have to charac
terize the American approach
to war as (a) saintly and (b)
child-like. Consider the follow
ing four assumptions:
(1) We are here to save the
Vietnamese people from the evils
of Communism. This theme was
sounded by at least ten of the
thirteen chaplains. The follow
ing quotes are representative,
and in my opinion the complete
contexts would not change their
import:
"The Viet Cong are misguided
zealots who have been given the
wrong information all their lives.
What would you believe if you
had been taught all your life
that Americans are the aggres
sors?" — Chaplain Ross C.
Wright, Conservative Baptist
from Los Angeles.
"How can you call this war
immoral? You can't say life is
more important than personal
freedoms, honor, and the dignity
of human beings. The basic
moral issue is: are these things
worth defending?" — Father
•Thomas D. McGrath (known to
;a less bellicose colleague as
Quick Draw'), Roman Catholic
from Worcester, Mass.
"I'm not so concerned about

the democratic process, but I
think the clergy should be on
the side of right. Maybe the
majority of the Vietnamese peo
ple do support the Viet Cong,
but if so they do it out of igno
rance and fear- . . . It's like our
American race riots. The police
at Watts weren't very popular,
but they were right."—Orville
McCormack, Assemblies of God,
Oklahoma City.
McCormack, an air force chap
lain, says some of the men who
come back from bombing mis
sions break down and cry over
mistakes they have made In
hitting the wrong village or
striking innocent civilians. He
concludes, "But to compare these
accidents with cold-blooded Viet
Cong atrocities is to compare a
man who has had a car acci
dent with a killer who goes
downtown and machine guns
twenty people. ... GI Joe is a
healer, not a killer. We're not
here to kill people but to keep
them from being killed, not to
conquer but to free, not to take
but to give our lives in order
that they might have. ... 'Great
er love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life
for his friend.' "
Their Own Enemies
Lest the lighthearted laugh too
loud, it should be said that there
is some ground for the attitudes
of most of these men, some
truth in what they say. But
when all is said and done, in
many parts of this country sav
ing the Vietnamese from the
evils of Communism boils down
to saving them from themselves
—whether or not they are Com
munists.
The Viet Cong may be zealots,
but few Vietnamese would call
them misguided. Personal free
dom and human dignity may be
more important than life to
Americans, but Saigon and
Washington are asking many
Vietnamese to trade their lives
for a freedom and dignity they
never had.
(2) We should be given credit
for our good intentions, for sin
cerely wanting to help the Viet
namese people. Most American
officials in Vietnam like to talk
about how America is helping
the Vietnamese. The chaplains
were no exception; they referred
most frequently to the military's
civic action programs.
It is true, there are a stag
gering number of hopelessly al
truistic Americans running
around Vietnam. By old colonial
standards, they are shedding
much blood and many tears with
little to show for it in the way
of dollar profits. Gl's build
orphanages, support poor fam
ilies, put hundreds of kids
through school, hand out choco
late bars the length and breadth
of Vietnam, and often make con
siderable personal sacrifices in
the process.

But with child-like naivete and
almost total ignorance of what
a century of colonialism has
taught the Vietnamese, they ex
pect to be thanked. They expect
the Vietnamese to take their
good works and good intentions
at face value. Less than a frac
tion speak more than a few
words of Vietnamese, and
many have no idea why their
generosity is often met with
suspicion. In areas where hand
outs have become the rule, some
Americans complain that "the
Vietnamese act like we owe it
to them."
(3) The Viet Cong should not
use sneaky tricks to kill Ameri
can soldiers. The thought carica
tured here runs just below the
surface of many American con
versations. The implications Is
that war ought to be played by
the rules, as defined in the U.S.
Code of Chivalry.
Chaplain Wright told of a
young American captain who
had been killed trying to clean

out an enemy cave in the Cen
tral Highlands. A North Viet
namese soldier had come out of
the cave, pushing a woman and
child in front of him. Not want
ing to hit the human shields, the
American lowered his gun,
whereupon the North Vietnam
ese shot him point blank in the
head.
All's Fair In War
It was a dirty thing to do, and
I like it no better than the young
American's mother would. But
to suggest that it wasn't fair,
and that the North Vietnamese
soldier was an evil ogre because
he took unfair advantage, is to
make war into a child's game.
(Tit for tat: within minutes the
cave had been blown with ex
plosives and one GI estimated
over 100 Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese were buried alive
inside.)
You dear people who say the
Viet Cong should not use sneaky
tricks to kill American soldiers,
have you ever talked with a

Vietnamese who says Americans
should not be here in the first
place, should not bomb and burn
and loose their horrible instru
ments of death on Vietnamese
villages, should not seek to im
pose American solutions on a
people whose problems they do
not understand.
(4) The Vietnamese should
be more responsive to our bene
volent but firm approach to
pacification. I depart from the
chaplains' script at this point
to discuss the American way of
pacification, which refers to
making hostile peasants friend
ly.
The Marines have been pacify
ing villages in I Corps (Central
Vietnam) for a year and a half
now, and their example has been
followed by many other Ameri
can units engaged in civic ac
tion programs. The basic form
ula is to move into a village,
maintain order by intensive pa
trolling and hunt down any stray
guerillas with the left hand,
while setting up medical aid
programs, building dams and
spillways, and giving out candy,
soap and toothpaste with the
right.
Often the Gl's make friends,
especially among the kids. But
observers who live in I Corps
say the hard facts are that most
of these villages are less paci
fied than when the leathernecks
landed.
'Be Good Now'
There are many reasons for
this, but one may be that the
double offer of bullets to bad
Vietnamese and candy to good
ones suggests something of the
father trying to discipline his
child: "Now Nguyen, be a good
Vietnamese and don't throw a
temper tantrum against your
government. If you be good,
Uncle Sam will give you choco
late bars and merthiolate for

your cuts. But If you be bad,
we'll have to cut you down " To
those Vietnamese who are weary
of being treated as children by
great white fathers, this ap
proach misses the heart of the
problem by about 180 degrees.
The lessons we learn from the
American experience in Vietnam
will be largely conditioned by
our own view of ourselves. If
the foregoing is at all to the
point, it suggests there are a lot
of psychological cobwebs that
will have to be cleared away
first.
Some may object that the
chaplains' views are not repre
sentative. Chaplains, after all,
would be bound to come up with
moral reasons for a war. But
the protests of many civilian
clergy suggests that the issue is
not so simple. (Indeed, they
raise the interesting question of
how a single church inspired by
one Lord can produce such dif
ferent answers to such funda
mental problems.)
What It's like
Furthermore, the language of
the chaplains is the language of
many—not all, but many—Amer
ican officers and enlisted men
who have served in Vietnam.
(Would you believe the lan
guage of Dean Rusk?) These
are the men who will go back
and tell their children and their
Lions Clubs what it was really
like in Vietnam.
If, for historical, political and
diplomatic reasons, we must
fight this war—and sometimes I
think we must —then let us do it.
But let's not do it in the ar
rogance of purity. Let's not put
on the whole armor of God in
order to fight Communist Sa
tans. Let's not go to war as little
children. And for the love of
God, let us not treat Nguyen
Charlie as a child.

I didn't really appreciate what
he was saying until I had been
in Vietnam for several months.
What finally brought the idea
home—and left me depressed
and scared—yvas a series of in

chaplains.
There are over 430 American
chaplains in Vietnam—some 320
protestants, more than 100 Rom

to a man, their consciences were
aggressively clear about the
moral rationale for the U.S. mili

lains' interviews, a disinterested
observer would have to charac
terize the American approach
to war as (a) saintly and (b)
child-like. Consider the follow
ing four assumptions:
(1) We are here to save the
Vietnamese people from the evils
of Communism. This theme was
sounded by at least ten of the
thirteen chaplains. The follow
ing quotes are representative,
and in my opinion the complete
contexts would not change their
import:
"The Viet Cong are misguided
zealots who have been given the
wrong information all their lives.
What would you believe if you
had been taught all your life
that Americans are the aggres
sors?" — Chaplain Ross C.
Wright, Conservative Baptist
from Los Angeles.
"How can you call this war
immoral? You can't say life is
more important than personal
freedoms, honor, and the dignity
of human beings. The basic
moral issue is: are these things
worth defending?" — Father
•Thomas D. McGrath (known to
;a less bellicose colleague as
Quick Draw'), Roman Catholic
from Worcester, Mass.
"I'm not so concerned about

the democratic process, but I
think the clergy should be on
the side of right. Maybe the
majority of the Vietnamese peo
ple do support the Viet Cong,
but if so they do it out of igno
rance and fear- . . . It's like our
American race riots. The police
at Watts weren't very popular,
but they were right."—Orville
McCormack, Assemblies of God,
Oklahoma City.
McCormack, an air force chap
lain, says some of the men who
come back from bombing mis
sions break down and cry over
mistakes they have made In
hitting the wrong village or
striking innocent civilians. He
concludes, "But to compare these
accidents with cold-blooded Viet
Cong atrocities is to compare a
man who has had a car acci
dent with a killer who goes
downtown and machine guns
twenty people. ... GI Joe is a
healer, not a killer. We're not
here to kill people but to keep
them from being killed, not to
conquer but to free, not to take
but to give our lives in order
that they might have. ... 'Great
er love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life
for his friend.' "
Their Own Enemies
Lest the lighthearted laugh too
loud, it should be said that there
is some ground for the attitudes
of most of these men, some
truth in what they say. But
when all is said and done, in
many parts of this country sav
ing the Vietnamese from the
evils of Communism boils down
to saving them from themselves
—whether or not they are Com
munists.
The Viet Cong may be zealots,
but few Vietnamese would call
them misguided. Personal free
dom and human dignity may be
more important than life to
Americans, but Saigon and
Washington are asking many
Vietnamese to trade their lives
for a freedom and dignity they
never had.
(2) We should be given credit
for our good intentions, for sin
cerely wanting to help the Viet
namese people. Most American
officials in Vietnam like to talk
about how America is helping
the Vietnamese. The chaplains
were no exception; they referred
most frequently to the military's
civic action programs.
It is true, there are a stag
gering number of hopelessly al
truistic Americans running
around Vietnam. By old colonial
standards, they are shedding
much blood and many tears with
little to show for it in the way
of dollar profits. Gl's build
orphanages, support poor fam
ilies, put hundreds of kids
through school, hand out choco
late bars the length and breadth
of Vietnam, and often make con
siderable personal sacrifices in
the process.

But with child-like naivete and
almost total ignorance of what
a century of colonialism has
taught the Vietnamese, they ex
pect to be thanked. They expect
the Vietnamese to take their
good works and good intentions
at face value. Less than a frac
tion speak more than a few
words of Vietnamese, and
many have no idea why their
generosity is often met with
suspicion. In areas where hand
outs have become the rule, some
Americans complain that "the
Vietnamese act like we owe it
to them."
(3) The Viet Cong should not
use sneaky tricks to kill Ameri
can soldiers. The thought carica
tured here runs just below the
surface of many American con
versations. The implications Is
that war ought to be played by
the rules, as defined in the U.S.
Code of Chivalry.
Chaplain Wright told of a
young American captain who
had been killed trying to clean

out an enemy cave in the Cen
tral Highlands. A North Viet
namese soldier had come out of
the cave, pushing a woman and
child in front of him. Not want
ing to hit the human shields, the
American lowered his gun,
whereupon the North Vietnam
ese shot him point blank in the
head.
All's Fair In War
It was a dirty thing to do, and
I like it no better than the young
American's mother would. But
to suggest that it wasn't fair,
and that the North Vietnamese
soldier was an evil ogre because
he took unfair advantage, is to
make war into a child's game.
(Tit for tat: within minutes the
cave had been blown with ex
plosives and one GI estimated
over 100 Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese were buried alive
inside.)
You dear people who say the
Viet Cong should not use sneaky
tricks to kill American soldiers,
have you ever talked with a

Vietnamese who says Americans
should not be here in the first
place, should not bomb and burn
and loose their horrible instru
ments of death on Vietnamese
villages, should not seek to im
pose American solutions on a
people whose problems they do
not understand.
(4) The Vietnamese should
be more responsive to our bene
volent but firm approach to
pacification. I depart from the
chaplains' script at this point
to discuss the American way of
pacification, which refers to
making hostile peasants friend
ly.
The Marines have been pacify
ing villages in I Corps (Central
Vietnam) for a year and a half
now, and their example has been
followed by many other Ameri
can units engaged in civic ac
tion programs. The basic form
ula is to move into a village,
maintain order by intensive pa
trolling and hunt down any stray
guerillas with the left hand,
while setting up medical aid
programs, building dams and
spillways, and giving out candy,
soap and toothpaste with the
right.
Often the Gl's make friends,
especially among the kids. But
observers who live in I Corps
say the hard facts are that most
of these villages are less paci
fied than when the leathernecks
landed.
'Be Good Now'
There are many reasons for
this, but one may be that the
double offer of bullets to bad
Vietnamese and candy to good
ones suggests something of the
father trying to discipline his
child: "Now Nguyen, be a good
Vietnamese and don't throw a
temper tantrum against your
government. If you be good,
Uncle Sam will give you choco
late bars and merthiolate for

your cuts. But If you be bad,
we'll have to cut you down " To
those Vietnamese who are weary
of being treated as children by
great white fathers, this ap
proach misses the heart of the
problem by about 180 degrees.
The lessons we learn from the
American experience in Vietnam
will be largely conditioned by
our own view of ourselves. If
the foregoing is at all to the
point, it suggests there are a lot
of psychological cobwebs that
will have to be cleared away
first.
Some may object that the
chaplains' views are not repre
sentative. Chaplains, after all,
would be bound to come up with
moral reasons for a war. But
the protests of many civilian
clergy suggests that the issue is
not so simple. (Indeed, they
raise the interesting question of
how a single church inspired by
one Lord can produce such dif
ferent answers to such funda
mental problems.)
What It's like
Furthermore, the language of
the chaplains is the language of
many—not all, but many—Amer
ican officers and enlisted men
who have served in Vietnam.
(Would you believe the lan
guage of Dean Rusk?) These
are the men who will go back
and tell their children and their
Lions Clubs what it was really
like in Vietnam.
If, for historical, political and
diplomatic reasons, we must
fight this war—and sometimes I
think we must —then let us do it.
But let's not do it in the ar
rogance of purity. Let's not put
on the whole armor of God in
order to fight Communist Sa
tans. Let's not go to war as little
children. And for the love of
God, let us not treat Nguyen
Charlie as a child.
(CPS) — One of Yale's great
courses is Edmund Morgan's re
view of American colonial his
tory. Beginning with the Puritan
fathers, Professor Morgan
teaches that our history has
been deeply influenced by the
early Americans' view of them
selves as a morally pure and
righteous people — by contrast
with the decadent, corrupt sons
of Europe.
I didn't really appreciate what
he was saying until I had been
in Vietnam for several months.
What finally brought the idea
home—and left me depressed
and scared—yvas a series of in
terviews with army and air force
chaplains.
There are over 430 American
chaplains in Vietnam—some 320
protestants, more than 100 Rom
an Catholics, and three Jews.
All are volunteers.
I interviewed thirteen. Almost
to a man, their consciences were
aggressively clear about the
moral rationale for the U.S. mili
tary commitment.
US Against Evil
That might be expected of
chaplains. But what surprised
and depressed me were the glow
ing terms they used to describe
what is basically an agonizing,
dirty business of making many
people suffer in order to prove a
political point. In their view of
the world, Americans are still
the standard bearers of morality
in the battle against evil. Cotton
Mather would have recognized
his descendants instantly.
