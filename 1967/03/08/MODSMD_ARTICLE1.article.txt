# Alumni Group Protests ‘Liberal Influence’
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
"Stanford, like most if not all of the major
universities in America, has been subjected to
heavy and increasing pressures in recent
decades from the liberals of the academic
world and from liberal foundations. Stanford
undergraduates are being given a heavily
overbalanced presentation of philosophies
leaning toward collectivism, the welfare state,
and other socialist concepts."
So began Winds of Freedom Foundation
(WOF) Bulletin Number One.
The Foundation, an organization of con
servative alumni, was organized in 1962 with
the avowed purpose of "restoring to Stanford
a balance in social and political beliefs in order
to preserve academic freedom."
Pledge Returned
WOF charges Stanford with stifling aca
demic freedom by maintaining a faculty with
a distinctly liberal bias. The alumni accuse
the Stanford administration of accepting gifts
from liberal groups with strings attached
while refusing like donations from WOF.

In Bulletin Number One they cited a $3,000
gift by a director of the Winds of Freedom, "to
be used for such purposes as may be jointly
agreed to by the Board of Trustees of Stanford
and the Board of Directors of Winds of Free
dom," as the first of several legitimate pledges
which were turned down. At that time the
Board of Trustees returned the pledge ex
plaining that the gift could not be accepted
under those terms.
In explanation for the refusal to accept this
and later gifts from the Foundation, the Board
of Trustees noted that it could not "sur
render or divide the responsibility and au
thority for controlling the University's af
fairs, including solicitations and acceptance
of gifts and the determination of their use."
WOF offers other examples of the Univer
sity discriminating against conservatives. One
is a refusal by the Board to accept $35,000
designated for extended undergraduate teach
ing by the Hoover Institution. Another is the
failure of the Economics Department to ap
point a professor to the endowed chair in

undergraduate economics to which Emma and
Carroll Rousch gave $500,000 in 1962.
'Dim And Dreary- Record'
"The economics department has dim and
dreary record," according to the Foundation,
by "teaching almost exclusively, brands of
economic theory leading to the destruction of
the sources of wealth which built these uni
versities and which continue to pour great
amounts of funds into their coffers."
In the wake of sweeping changes in uni
versity policy concerning on-campus liquor and
social regulations, WOF wondered at the "sud
den collapse of rules and authority that
seemed to serve the University so well." In Bul
letin Number Six, after endorsing President
Sterling's stand that a university should re
main "an inner city which is calmer and more
contemplative than the storms which swirl
about it," WOF protested the then recent in
volvement of faculty members in a movement
to halt the bombing in Vietnam. At that time,
alumni asserted that since the primary pur
pose of a university is learning, the faculty

members overstepped the bounds of their
positions by endorsing such a movement.
In 1966 a controversy erupted between the
alumni group and Professor Christian Bay of
the Political Science Department. The WOF
criticized Bay for "haranguing the students
at an anti-Vietnam War rally." Citing Bay's
"public record" to document his liberal beliefs,
the Foundation charged Stanford with not
accepting a "scholar whose stature and con
victions might add some balance to those of
Dr. Bay "
New Appointments Attacked
In a letter to the Foundation, Bay expressed
his concern for a well-balanced presentation of
all sides of any issue in class, but he stated,
"outside the classroom, I consider it my right
and duty to challenge my colleagues and stu
dents, in public or in private, to discussions
of any and all important public issues on
which I find myself in disagreement with
them."
More recently, the Winds of Freedom Foun

dation has protested the appointment of Rich
ard Lyman and Herbert Packer as Provost
and Vice-Provost respectively. In Bulletin
Number Seven, dated January 1967, WOF
charged that the backgrounds of both men
were damaging to Stanford and its students.
Calling the appointments "so extraordinary
as to call for continuing scrutiny by the
friends of Stanford," the Foundation conclud
ed that profound changes in the course of
Stanford are predictable. The Bulletin went
on: "The rewards in the form of administra
tive positions seem to have gone to the po
litical avtivists. That message gets through to
all members of the Stanford faculty."
In an interview with The Daily, Morton D.
Evelyn, president of the Winds of Freedom,
stated that "it is not our objective to create
a break between students and their teachers.
The Bulletin is not aimed at students, but at
alumni," whom he feels are in a better posi
tion to evaluate the policies of Stanford with
respect to the outside world.

ard Lyman and Herbert Packer as Provost
and Vice-Provost respectively. In Bulletin
Number Seven, dated January 1967, WOF
charged that the backgrounds of both men
were damaging to Stanford and its students.
Calling the appointments "so extraordinary
as to call for continuing scrutiny by the
friends of Stanford," the Foundation conclud
ed that profound changes in the course of
Stanford are predictable. The Bulletin went
on: "The rewards in the form of administra
tive positions seem to have gone to the po
litical avtivists. That message gets through to
all members of the Stanford faculty."
In an interview with The Daily, Morton D.
Evelyn, president of the Winds of Freedom,
stated that "it is not our objective to create
a break between students and their teachers.
The Bulletin is not aimed at students, but at
alumni," whom he feels are in a better posi
tion to evaluate the policies of Stanford with
respect to the outside world.
"Stanford, like most if not all of the major
universities in America, has been subjected to
heavy and increasing pressures in recent
decades from the liberals of the academic
world and from liberal foundations. Stanford
undergraduates are being given a heavily
overbalanced presentation of philosophies
leaning toward collectivism, the welfare state,
and other socialist concepts."
So began Winds of Freedom Foundation
(WOF) Bulletin Number One.
The Foundation, an organization of con
servative alumni, was organized in 1962 with
the avowed purpose of "restoring to Stanford
a balance in social and political beliefs in order
to preserve academic freedom."
Pledge Returned
WOF charges Stanford with stifling aca
demic freedom by maintaining a faculty with
a distinctly liberal bias. The alumni accuse
the Stanford administration of accepting gifts
from liberal groups with strings attached
while refusing like donations from WOF.

In Bulletin Number One they cited a $3,000
gift by a director of the Winds of Freedom, "to
be used for such purposes as may be jointly
agreed to by the Board of Trustees of Stanford
and the Board of Directors of Winds of Free
dom," as the first of several legitimate pledges
which were turned down. At that time the
Board of Trustees returned the pledge ex
plaining that the gift could not be accepted
under those terms.
In explanation for the refusal to accept this
and later gifts from the Foundation, the Board
of Trustees noted that it could not "sur
render or divide the responsibility and au
thority for controlling the University's af
fairs, including solicitations and acceptance
of gifts and the determination of their use."
WOF offers other examples of the Univer
sity discriminating against conservatives. One
is a refusal by the Board to accept $35,000
designated for extended undergraduate teach
ing by the Hoover Institution. Another is the
failure of the Economics Department to ap
point a professor to the endowed chair in

undergraduate economics to which Emma and
Carroll Rousch gave $500,000 in 1962.
'Dim And Dreary- Record'
"The economics department has dim and
dreary record," according to the Foundation,
by "teaching almost exclusively, brands of
economic theory leading to the destruction of
the sources of wealth which built these uni
versities and which continue to pour great
amounts of funds into their coffers."
In the wake of sweeping changes in uni
versity policy concerning on-campus liquor and
social regulations, WOF wondered at the "sud
den collapse of rules and authority that
seemed to serve the University so well." In Bul
letin Number Six, after endorsing President
Sterling's stand that a university should re
main "an inner city which is calmer and more
contemplative than the storms which swirl
about it," WOF protested the then recent in
volvement of faculty members in a movement
to halt the bombing in Vietnam. At that time,
alumni asserted that since the primary pur
pose of a university is learning, the faculty

members overstepped the bounds of their
positions by endorsing such a movement.
In 1966 a controversy erupted between the
alumni group and Professor Christian Bay of
the Political Science Department. The WOF
criticized Bay for "haranguing the students
at an anti-Vietnam War rally." Citing Bay's
"public record" to document his liberal beliefs,
the Foundation charged Stanford with not
accepting a "scholar whose stature and con
victions might add some balance to those of
Dr. Bay "
New Appointments Attacked
In a letter to the Foundation, Bay expressed
his concern for a well-balanced presentation of
all sides of any issue in class, but he stated,
"outside the classroom, I consider it my right
and duty to challenge my colleagues and stu
dents, in public or in private, to discussions
of any and all important public issues on
which I find myself in disagreement with
them."

positions by endorsing such a movement.
In 1966 a controversy erupted between the
alumni group and Professor Christian Bay of
the Political Science Department. The WOF
criticized Bay for "haranguing the students
at an anti-Vietnam War rally." Citing Bay's
"public record" to document his liberal beliefs,
the Foundation charged Stanford with not
accepting a "scholar whose stature and con
victions might add some balance to those of
Dr. Bay "
New Appointments Attacked
In a letter to the Foundation, Bay expressed
his concern for a well-balanced presentation of
all sides of any issue in class, but he stated,
"outside the classroom, I consider it my right
and duty to challenge my colleagues and stu
dents, in public or in private, to discussions
of any and all important public issues on
which I find myself in disagreement with
them."
More recently, the Winds of Freedom Foun

dation has protested the appointment of Rich
ard Lyman and Herbert Packer as Provost
and Vice-Provost respectively. In Bulletin
Number Seven, dated January 1967, WOF
charged that the backgrounds of both men
were damaging to Stanford and its students.
Calling the appointments "so extraordinary
as to call for continuing scrutiny by the
friends of Stanford," the Foundation conclud
ed that profound changes in the course of
Stanford are predictable. The Bulletin went
on: "The rewards in the form of administra
tive positions seem to have gone to the po
litical avtivists. That message gets through to
all members of the Stanford faculty."
In an interview with The Daily, Morton D.
Evelyn, president of the Winds of Freedom,
stated that "it is not our objective to create
a break between students and their teachers.
The Bulletin is not aimed at students, but at
alumni," whom he feels are in a better posi
tion to evaluate the policies of Stanford with
respect to the outside world.
"Stanford, like most if not all of the major
universities in America, has been subjected to
heavy and increasing pressures in recent
decades from the liberals of the academic
world and from liberal foundations. Stanford
undergraduates are being given a heavily
overbalanced presentation of philosophies
leaning toward collectivism, the welfare state,
and other socialist concepts."
So began Winds of Freedom Foundation
(WOF) Bulletin Number One.
The Foundation, an organization of con
servative alumni, was organized in 1962 with
the avowed purpose of "restoring to Stanford
a balance in social and political beliefs in order
to preserve academic freedom."
Pledge Returned
WOF charges Stanford with stifling aca
demic freedom by maintaining a faculty with
a distinctly liberal bias. The alumni accuse
the Stanford administration of accepting gifts
from liberal groups with strings attached
while refusing like donations from WOF.

In Bulletin Number One they cited a $3,000
gift by a director of the Winds of Freedom, "to
be used for such purposes as may be jointly
agreed to by the Board of Trustees of Stanford
and the Board of Directors of Winds of Free
dom," as the first of several legitimate pledges
which were turned down. At that time the
Board of Trustees returned the pledge ex
plaining that the gift could not be accepted
under those terms.
In explanation for the refusal to accept this
and later gifts from the Foundation, the Board
of Trustees noted that it could not "sur
render or divide the responsibility and au
thority for controlling the University's af
fairs, including solicitations and acceptance
of gifts and the determination of their use."
WOF offers other examples of the Univer
sity discriminating against conservatives. One
is a refusal by the Board to accept $35,000
designated for extended undergraduate teach
ing by the Hoover Institution. Another is the
failure of the Economics Department to ap
point a professor to the endowed chair in

undergraduate economics to which Emma and
Carroll Rousch gave $500,000 in 1962.
'Dim And Dreary- Record'
"The economics department has dim and
dreary record," according to the Foundation,
by "teaching almost exclusively, brands of
economic theory leading to the destruction of
the sources of wealth which built these uni
versities and which continue to pour great
amounts of funds into their coffers."
In the wake of sweeping changes in uni
versity policy concerning on-campus liquor and
social regulations, WOF wondered at the "sud
den collapse of rules and authority that
seemed to serve the University so well." In Bul
letin Number Six, after endorsing President
Sterling's stand that a university should re
main "an inner city which is calmer and more
contemplative than the storms which swirl
about it," WOF protested the then recent in
volvement of faculty members in a movement
to halt the bombing in Vietnam. At that time,
alumni asserted that since the primary pur
pose of a university is learning, the faculty

members overstepped the bounds of their
positions by endorsing such a movement.
