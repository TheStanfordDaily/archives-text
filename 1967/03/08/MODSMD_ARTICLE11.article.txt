# NEW TECHNIQUE
## Accelerating At -457°F. Brreakthrough 
### 
A Stanford research group
reported last week that it had
perfected a new type of atom
smasher which operates at
•457 degrees Farenheit.
Professor of Physics Dr. H.
Alan Schwettman announced
that his team had built a five
foot model linear accelerator
which produces a field of six
MeV (million electron volts) to
accelerate electrons.
The advantage of the super
cold temperature is that it
changes a copper pipe one foot
in diameter into a conductor
which offers almost no resist
ance to the electric current flow.
The pipe is cooled by two
aluminum refrigerator tanks.
An outer tank contains liquid
nitrogen, and the inner one con
tains liquid helium. These cool
the pipe to two degrees above
absolute zero.
Dr. Schwettman said that the
team now hoped to build a
larger version, which would be
correspondingly more powerful.
One other advantage of the
new machine is that it can be
run continuously instead of in
short bursts of energy. It will
run 1000 times longer as a re
sult.
The result of this continuity
is that it will allow the creation
of a uniform electron beam of
energy.


Superconducting Linac is
seen nearing completion for
its first big test with two of
its principal builders, Prof.
William M. Fairbank (left)
and Prof. H. Alan Schwett
nian (lower right). In later
tests it accelerated electrons
to energies of six million
electron volts.
