# Stanford To Resist Expansion
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER (Last in a series) 
t.y The next few years are the
•■pivotal ones for Stanford Uni
versity.
(lUA In an age in which the multi
versity is quickly becoming a
reality, Stanford must make the
choice between remaining a
small, compact community or
expanding rapidly to accommo
date America's education ex
plosion.
At this point, projected
figures and building
plans indicate that Stanford will
drastic expansion and will
.'maintain a student and faculty
"community similar to the one
has now.
"We are resisting expansion
i>f numbers beyond what we
have now," verifies Vice Presi
dent for Finance Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson. "We seem to be
near the limits of what makes
an optimum university commu
nity."
"There is no compelling rea
son to expand," according to
.Provost Richard W. Lyman.
"The University of California
must expand; it is run by and
ior the public.
Limited Responsibility
"Stanford can't meet the same
pressures that state institutions
do; we simply don't have the
ysame resources available. We
Thave only a limited and indirect
to the voters.")
~, Stanford is now what Cuth
bertson terms a "maturing uni
versity." Undergraduate growth
.in the past twenty years has
been "limited almost exclusively
to the expansion of the over
seas campus program."
" In addition, campus construc
tion is not planned to accom
modate substantially greater
n numbers of faculty or students
than at present. "Building plans
_are geared to the numbers we
now, with only modest ex
pansion in most areas," accord
ing to Cuthbertson.
Modest Expansion
The present emphasis on con
struction, begun with the PACE
entails renovation of
turn-of-the-century Quad build
ings in most cases and "modest
expansion" in other instances to
$ "catch up to present educational
& demands," Cuthbertson notes,
jf Most actual growth in the
* next decades will be in research
/and graduate training. "We are
J. trying to build strength in in

ter-disciplinary programs,"
Cuthbertson stated.
Cuthbertson also cites the pos
sibility of growth due to new
inventions or technological de
velopments. The harnessing of
atomic power for peaceful use
or further enlargement of aero
nautic and astronautic research
would for instance, necessitate
enlargement of present faculty
and buildings in those areas.
In addition, a significant in
crease in faculty or students
would necessitate additions to
all student services—including
bookstore, post office, union,
and even counseling services.

Education Conflict
Lyman views the variability
of the future as partly a func
tion of "conflict between advo
cates of a general and profes
sional education."
"Some student activists, in
acclaiming the virtues of a 'gen
eral' education, have badly con
fused their objectives," Lyman
feels. "How can this university
provide only a general educa
tion in the face of today's soci
ety's technological demands?
Students have had a in
creasingly larger voice in long
range planning. They will not
have as large a voice as some

want, however. This problem of
goals must be settled dispassion
ately."
Stanford's future as an edu
cational institution and aca
demic community lies in reso
lution of the problem of educa
tional goals, according to Ly
man.
"There's no point in attack
ing the existence of professional
and technological studies in the
University," he said. "Nor is
their existence a threat to to
day's student view of the liberal
education."
Lyman pointed out that ex
ternal variables may also affect
Stanford's future. For example,
he noted that a substantial
weakening of the Berkeley cam
pus of the University of Cali
fornia might have drastic effects
on Stanford.
Politics Threaten
If a mass exodus from the
UC campus of top flight faculty
results from the recent Cali
fornia political turmoil, "both
Berkeley and our University
would suffer. We are that much
stronger by having a great uni
versity across the bay," Lyman
claims. In fact, "the whole uni
versity structure in the United
States would be weakened if
the University of California is
subject to political winds."
Although building plans have
been projected into the next two
ford is far from settled into a
decades, it is obvious that Stan
definite course of expansion.
Technological advances, inter
disciplinary growth, resolution
of the "general-professional"
education debate, and even
changing political conditions
may influence the University's
future. A new hospital may
have to be built, and new de
partments may be added.
