# September Move To Vienna '99% Certain,' Says Hamrdla
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
The chances are "99 out of
100" that Stanford-in-Austria
will move to Vienna this Sep
tember.
George R. Hamrdla, Assistant
to the Director of the Overseas
Campus Program, said yester
day that the move is "practi
cally certain" for September.
Earlier speculation was that the
move might be delayed until
September of 1968.
The new location is the for
mer palace of Archduke Charles
and is in downtown Vienna near
the opera house.
Hamrdla reported that final
negotiations are not yet com
pleted for the move. Group IV,
which leaves for Austria later
this month, will evidently be
the last group to live at the
Hotel Panhans in Semmering,
a ski resort almost two hours
from Vienna.

"Going to Vienna will un
doubtedly provide more educa
tional opportunity," says Ham
rdla. "However, just as the Pan
hans wasn't Utopia, the new
campus is not either." He cited
that there is no parking lot for
the new campus and no im
mediately accessible outside re
creational areas. However, the
kitchen and living facilities are
very good, and parks are near
by.
The top floor of the palace
will continue to operate as an
Austrian student center as the
whole building now does. Dis
cussions and lectures are held
by the Austrian students living
there and Stanford students will
have access to these.
Applications for Austria
group VI for spring-summer of
1968 are due this Thursday, as
are the applications for four
other overseas groups.
