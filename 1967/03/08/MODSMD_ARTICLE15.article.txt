# Can The Liberal Arts Colleges Survive?

(Editor's Note: The following
article is taken from Chapter
10 of Paul Goodman's book
"Compulsory Mis • Education,"
New York: Horizon Press, 1964,
pp. 149-159. From time to time
outside articles on philosophy
and problems in higher educa
tion will appear in The Daily.
It is hope that these ideas will
stimulate community thought
and discussion, especially during
Stanford's Study of Education.)
Jacques Barzun, the Dean of
Faculties at Columbia, has pre
dicted for us the end of the lib
eral arts college; it cannot sur
vive the emphasis on technical
and professional education and
the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.

It is hope that these ideas will

and discussion, especially during
Stanford's Study of Education.)
Jacques Barzun, the Dean of
Faculties at Columbia, has pre
dicted for us the end of the lib
eral arts college; it cannot sur
vive the emphasis on technical
and professional education and
the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.

tion will appear in The Daily.
It is hope that these ideas will
stimulate community thought
and discussion, especially during
Stanford's Study of Education.)
Jacques Barzun, the Dean of
Faculties at Columbia, has pre
dicted for us the end of the lib
eral arts college; it cannot sur
vive the emphasis on technical
and professional education and
the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.

Jacques Barzun, the Dean of
Faculties at Columbia, has pre
dicted for us the end of the lib
eral arts college; it cannot sur
vive the emphasis on technical
and professional education and
the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.

It is hope that these ideas will
stimulate community thought
and discussion, especially during
Stanford's Study of Education.)
Jacques Barzun, the Dean of
Faculties at Columbia, has pre
dicted for us the end of the lib
eral arts college; it cannot sur
vive the emphasis on technical
and professional education and
the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.

Jacques Barzun, the Dean of
Faculties at Columbia, has pre
dicted for us the end of the lib
eral arts college; it cannot sur
vive the emphasis on technical
and professional education and
the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.

eral arts college; it cannot sur
vive the emphasis on technical
and professional education and
the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.

the overwhelming financing of
scientific research by Federal
money, corporate money, and
most of the foundation money.
I think his prediction is justi
fied—l am not so sure I am
gloomy about it; if there is a
revival of real education in this
country, its form and auspices
will not look like what we have
been use to. But I do not think
that the Dean thoroughly under
stands the causes, or the extent,
of the debacle. For the same so
cial trend, of vocational training
and contracted research, spells
the end not only of the colleges
but of the Universities as well,
regarded as schools for inde
pendent professionals, commu
nities of scholars, and centers of
free inquiry. The crucial issue
is not the change from "general"
education to "specialism"; and
there is nothing amiss in the Sci
ences having a turn as the pre
ponderant center of studies,
since, that is the nature of the
environment. The medieval uni
versities were mainly profes
sional schools dominated by a
kind of metaphysical science, ac
cording to their lights. The cru
cial issue is the change from the
humanism of independent guilds
of scholars, whether in the lib
eral arts or the professions, to a
system of social-engineering for
the national economy and polity.
The medieval professions and
specialities were structured in
an ideal world that allowed for
communication, that was inter
national, and in which—in the
important sense — the profes
sions were oddly spontaneous
and free. Our learning is increas
ingly departmentalized and pre
scribed.
Educational Reality
Our educational reality can be
seen in operation in the present
kind of scheduling, testing, and
grading; and if Dean Barzun is
interested in making a change,
he can start right here.
Let me repeat the facts. From
early childhood, the young are
subjected to a lockstep increas
ingly tightly geared to the extra

mural demands. There is little
attention to individual pace,
rhythm, or choice, and none
whatever to the discovery of
identity or devotion to intellec
tual goals. The aptitude and
achievement testing and the
fierce competition for high
grades are a race up the ladder
to high-salaried jobs in the busi
nesses of the world, including
the schooling business. In this
race, time is literally money.
Middle class youngsters — or
their parents — realistically opt
for Advanced Placement and
hasten to volunteer for the Na
tional Merit examinations. Ne
gro parents want the same for
their children, although the chil
dren have less tendency to co
operate.
Liberi
Disappointingly, but not sur
prisingly, the colleges and uni
versities go along with this
spiritual destruction, and indeed
devise the tests and the curricula
to pass the tests. Thereby they
connive at their own spiritual de
struction; yet it is not surpris
ing, for that is where the money
and the grandeur are. I do not
expect for a moment that they
will, in the foreseeable future, re
call their primary duties: to pass
on the tradition of disinterested
learning, to provide a critical
standard, to educate the free
young (liberi) to be free citizens
and independent professionals.
The question is, could the col
leges and universities act other
wise, even if they wished to?
Of course they could. Most of
them are autonomous corpora
tions. Let me here suggest two
modest changes, that are feasi
ble almost immediately, that
would entail no risk whatever,
and yet would immensely im
prove these academic communi
ties and importantly liberate
them in relation to society.
* * *
First, suppose that half a doz
en of the most prestigious lib
eral arts colleges—say Amherst,
Swarthmore, Connecticut, Wes
leyan, Carleton, etc.—would an
nounce that, beginning in 1966,
they required for admission a
two-year period, after high
school, spent in some maturing
activity. These colleges are at
present five times oversub
scribed; they would not want
for applicants on any conditions
that they set; and they are ex
plicitly committed to limiting
their expansion.
By "maturing activity" could
be meant: working for a living,
especially if the jobs are gotten
without too heavy reliance on
connections; community service,
such as the Northern Student
Movement, volunteer service in
hospital or settlement house, do

mestic Peace Corps; the army—
though I am a pacifist and would
urge a youngster to keep out
of the army; a course of pur
poseful travel that met required
standards; independent enter
prise in art, business, or science,
away from home, with some
thing to show for the time spent.
The purpose of this proposal is
twofold: to get students with
enough life experience to be edu
cable on the college level, espe
cially in the social sciences and
humanities; and to break the
lockstep of twelve years of doing
assigned lessons for grades, so
that the student may approach
his college studies with some in
trinsic motivation, and therefore
perhaps assimilate something
that might change him- Many
teachers remember with nostal
gia the maturer students who
come under the Gl-bill, though
to be sure a large number of
them were pretty shell-shocked.
A subsidiary advantage of the
plan would be to relieve the col
leges of the doomed, and hypo
critical, effort to serve in loco
parentis on matters of morality.
If young persons have been out
working for a living, or have
traveled in foreign parts, or have
been in the army, a eolleg? can
assume that they can take care
of themselves.
American Tradition
The American tradition of col
leges for adolescents made a
kind of sense when the curri
culum was largely unquestioned
classics, history, and mathema
tics, taught dogmatically in a
seminarian atmosphere, and to
an elite that thought it had a
justified social role. Present col
lege teaching tries to be some
thing different. It emphasizes
method, background reading,
criticism, and research, and of
fers a range of choice or pre
scription quite bafiling to most
17-year-olds. In a curious way,
the present dominance of math
ematics and physical sciences
has resulted in the students be
ing even less mature, yet has ob
scured the true picture of stu
dent ineptitude and professorial
frustration. It is possible to
teach mathematics and physics
to boys and girls, especially boys.
These abstract subjects suit
their alert and schematizing
minds, the more so if the teach
ing treats science as the solu
tion of puzzles. But it is not pos
sible to teach sociology, anthro
pology, world literature to boys
and girls, for they have no ex
perience and judgment. When it
is done, the message is merely
verbal.
The harsh facts and the rela
tivity of morals are bound to be
embarrassing and shocking. Re
garded as "assignments" — as

high school graduates must re
gard them — the volumnious
readings are indigestible straw
and are annotated by rote; more
mature students might be able
to take them as books. In brief,
whizbang youngsters who have
found their identity as mathe
maticians, chemists, or electronic
technicians might well speed
on to M.I T. at age 15. The liberal
arts colleges, that are essentially
concerned with educating citi
zens and statesmen, social sci
entists and social professionals,
scholars and men-ofletters, re
quire more maturity to begin
with. If the average age of en
trance were higher, these col
leges would also serve as the
next step for the many disap
pointed science - students, who
can hardly be expected to back
track among the seventeens. (A
very numerous group switch
from the physical sciences to the
social sciences and humanities.)
Throughout our educational
system there is a desperate need
for institutional variety and in
terims in which a youth can
find himself. If we are going to
require as much schooling as we
do, we must arrange for breaks
and return points, otherwise the
schooling inevitably becomes
spirit-breaking and regimenta
tion. In my opinion, however, a
much more reasonable over-all
pattern is to structure all of so
ciety and the whole environment
as educative, with the schools
playing the much more particu
lar and traditional role of giving
intensive training when it is
needed and sought, or of being
havens for those scholarly by
disposition.
* * »
My other proposal is even
simpler, and not at all novei.
Let half a dozen of the presti
gious Universities — Chicago,
Stanford, the Ivy League—abol
ish grading, and use testing only
and entirely for pedagogic pur
pose as teachers see fit.
Anyone who knows the frantic
temper of the present schools
will understand the transvalua
tion of values that would be ef
fected by this modest innova

tion. For most of the students,
the competitive grade has come
to be the essence. The naive
teacher points to the beauty of
the subject and the ingenuity of
the research; the shrewd stu
dent asks if he is responsible for
that on the final exam.
An Objection
Let me at once dispose of an
objection whose unanimity is
quite fascinating. I think that
the great majority of professors
agree that grading hinders teach
ing and creates a bad spirit, go
ing as far as cheating and pla
giarizing. I have before me the
collection of essays, Examining
In Harvard College, and this is
the consensus It is uniformly
asserted, however, that the grad
ing is inevitable; for how else
will the graduate schools, the
foundations, the corporations
know whom to accept, reward,
hire? How will the talent scouts
know whom to tap?
By testing the applicants, of
course, according to the specific
task requirements of the induct
ing institution, just as applicants
for the Civil Service or for li
censes in medicine, law and
architecture are tested. Why
should Harvard professor do
the testing for corporations and
graduate-schools ?
Ludicrous
The objection is ludicrous.
Dean Whitla, of the Harvard
Office of Tests, points out that
the scholastic - aptitude and
achievement tests used for ad
mission to Harvard are a super
excellent index for all-around
Harvard performance, better
than high-school grades or par
ticular Harvard course-grades.
Presumably, these college-en
trance tests are tailored for what
Harvard and similar institutions
want. By the same logic, would
not an employer do far better
to apply his own job-aptitude
test rather than to rely on the
vagaries of Harvard section
men? Indeed, I doubt, that many
employers bother to look at
such grades; they are more like
ly to be interested merely in the
fact of a Harvard diploma, what
ever that connotes to them. The

grades have most of their weight
with the graduate schools—here,
as elsewhere, the system runs
mainly for its own sake.
Perhaps the chief objectors to
abolishing grading would be the
students and their parents. The
parents should be simply disre
garded; their anxiety has done
enough damage already. For the
students, it seems to me that a
primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props,
valuation and motivation, and
to force them to confront the dif
their dependence on extrinsic
ficult enterprise itself and final
ly lose themselves in it.
Miserable Effect
A miserable effect of grading
is to nullify the various uses of
testing. Testing, for both stu
dent and teacher, is a means of
structuring, and also of finding
out what is blank or wrong and
what has been assimilated and
can be taken for granted. Review
—including high-pressure review
—is a means of bringing togeth
er the fragments, so that there
are flashes of synoptic insight.
There are several good reasons
for testing, and kinds of test. But
if the aim is to discover weakness,
what is the point of down-grad
ing and punishing it, and there
by inviting the student to con
ceal his weakness, by faking
and bulling, if not cheating?
The natural conclusion of syn
thesis is the insight itself, not a
grade for having had it- For the
important purpose of placement,
if one can establish in the stu
dent the belief that one is test
ing not to grade and make in
vidious comparisons but for his
own advantage, the student
should normally seek his own
level, where he is challenged and
yet capable, rather than trying
to get by. If the student dares to
accept himself as he is, a teach
er's grade is a crude instrument
compared with a student's self
awareness. But it is rare in our
universities that students are en
couraged to notice objectively
their vast confusion. Unlike Soc
rates, our teachers rely on pow
erdrives rather than shame and
ingenuous idealism.

Many students are lazy, so
teachers try to goad or threaten
them by grading. In the long
run this must do more harm
than good. Laziness is a char
acter-defense. It may be a way of
voiding learning, in order to
protect the conceit that one is al
ready perfect (deeper, the de
spair that one never can). It may
be a way of avoiding just the
risk of failing and being down
graded. Sometimes it is a way
of politely saying, "I won't." But
Since it lis the authoritarian
grownup demands that have
created such attitudes in the
first place, why repeat the trau
ma? There comes a time when
we must treat people as adult,
laziness and all. It is one thing
courageously to fire a do-nothing
out of your class; it is quite an
other thing to evaluate him with
a lordly F.
Most important of all, it is of
ten obvious that balking in do
ing the work, especially among
bright young people who get to
great universities, means exact
ly what it says: The work does
not suit me, not this subject, or
not at this time, or not in this
school, or not in school altogeth
er. The student might not be
bookish; he might be school
tired; perhaps his development
ought now to take another direc
tion. Yet unfortunately, if such
a student is intelligent and is not
sure of himself, he can be bullied
into passing, and this obscures
everything My hunch is that I
am describing a common situa
tion. What a grim waste of
young life and teacherly effort!
Such a student will retain no
thing of what he has "passed"
in. Sometimes he must get mo
nonucleosis to tell his story and
be believed.
And ironically, the converse is
also probably commonly true. A
student flunks and is mechani
cally weeded out, who is really
ready and eager to learn in a
scholastic setting, but he has not
quite caught on. A good teacher
can recognize the situation, but
the computer wreaks its svill.
