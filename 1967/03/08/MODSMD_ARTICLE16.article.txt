## Educational Changes Praised 
### 
The Stanford University
School of Medicine and four
other schools that have made
sweeping curricular changes in
recent years are today's leaders
in medical education, according
to a member of the Royal Com
mission reviewing the future of
medical training in Great Brit
ain.
"Yale, Stanford, U.C.L.A., and
Duke universities are, in my
opinion, blazing a trail which
the rest of us are likely to fol
low sooner or later," said Dr. G.
Morris Carstairs, professor and
head of the department of psy
chiatry at the University of
Edinburgh. Another institution
that has made recent curriculum
reforms in medicine is the Uni
versity of Indiana.
Dr. Carstairs came to the
United States in 1961 on a fact
finding mission and visited more
than a dozen medical schools
noted for their quality. He re
visited several of them in inter
vening years and in 1966, when
he was a fellow at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences at Stanford.
The five medical schools have
had, in Dr. Carstairs' words,
"the courage to realize that

medical education in the future
must be less comprehensive and
more diversified.
"Elective study serves two
ends: it enables students to go
more deely into some of the
sciences related to medicine, and
it teaches them techniques of
self-education which will be of
value to them throughout their
careers."
"What they all have in com
mon," he said, "is a willingness
to sacrifice completeness of cov
erage, both in the preclinical
and clinical years, in favor of
stimulating the students' com
prehension of the scientific ap
proach to each different aspect
of medicine, and showing the
students how to find out things
for themselves."
For several years, Yale has
allowed its students one whole
semester of elective study. It is
now proposed to double this, so
that one year out of four will
be spent in approved elective
work.
The Stanford University
School of Medicine has a five
year program, during which 40
per cent of the students' time
(two years) is devoted to elec
tive study. The new curriculum's

success at Stanford is dem
onstrated by the performance
of students in national examina
tions.
Stanford has also been in the
forefront in designing and main
taining laboratories for inte
grated teaching in the basic
medical sciences. It was in the
vanguard of medical schools in
establishing a department of
genetics, and was successful in
achieving an unusually effective
integration between the human
ities and sciences and the pre
clinical sciences.
The new curriculum at the
University of California at Los
Angeles has involved an over
all reduction of teaching time
by 10 per cent in order to pro
vide generous periods of elective
study, according to Dr. Car
stairs. Duke University, whose
example was followed in 1967
by Indiana University, has made
the radical change of compress
ing the preliminary preclinical
instruction into one-year course,
followed by a 16-month stretch
of clinical and applied-science
teaching and clerkship; after
this students can choose elec
tives from a range of alterna
tives in medical science, basic
sciences or in clinical fields.

(two years) is devoted to elec
tive study. The new curriculum's

success at Stanford is dem
onstrated by the performance
of students in national examina
tions.
Stanford has also been in the
forefront in designing and main
taining laboratories for inte
grated teaching in the basic
medical sciences. It was in the
vanguard of medical schools in
establishing a department of
genetics, and was successful in
achieving an unusually effective
integration between the human
ities and sciences and the pre
clinical sciences.
The new curriculum at the
University of California at Los
Angeles has involved an over
all reduction of teaching time
by 10 per cent in order to pro
vide generous periods of elective
study, according to Dr. Car
stairs. Duke University, whose
example was followed in 1967
by Indiana University, has made
the radical change of compress
ing the preliminary preclinical
instruction into one-year course,
followed by a 16-month stretch
of clinical and applied-science
teaching and clerkship; after
this students can choose elec
tives from a range of alterna
tives in medical science, basic
sciences or in clinical fields.
The Stanford University
School of Medicine and four
other schools that have made
sweeping curricular changes in
recent years are today's leaders
in medical education, according
to a member of the Royal Com
mission reviewing the future of
medical training in Great Brit
ain.
"Yale, Stanford, U.C.L.A., and
Duke universities are, in my
opinion, blazing a trail which
the rest of us are likely to fol
low sooner or later," said Dr. G.
Morris Carstairs, professor and
head of the department of psy
chiatry at the University of
Edinburgh. Another institution
that has made recent curriculum
reforms in medicine is the Uni
versity of Indiana.
Dr. Carstairs came to the
United States in 1961 on a fact
finding mission and visited more
than a dozen medical schools
noted for their quality. He re
visited several of them in inter
vening years and in 1966, when
he was a fellow at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences at Stanford.
The five medical schools have
had, in Dr. Carstairs' words,
"the courage to realize that

medical education in the future
must be less comprehensive and
more diversified.
"Elective study serves two
ends: it enables students to go
more deely into some of the
sciences related to medicine, and
it teaches them techniques of
self-education which will be of
value to them throughout their
careers."
"What they all have in com
mon," he said, "is a willingness
to sacrifice completeness of cov
erage, both in the preclinical
and clinical years, in favor of
stimulating the students' com
prehension of the scientific ap
proach to each different aspect
of medicine, and showing the
students how to find out things
for themselves."
For several years, Yale has
allowed its students one whole
semester of elective study. It is
now proposed to double this, so
that one year out of four will
be spent in approved elective
work.
The Stanford University
School of Medicine has a five
year program, during which 40
per cent of the students' time
(two years) is devoted to elec
tive study. The new curriculum's

success at Stanford is dem
onstrated by the performance
of students in national examina
