# General Studies—A Corpse?

### DAVID L AIKEN Collegiate Press Service 
"It may be time to declare the
formal general education
movement dead in America, to
cease bowing to its corpse, and
to pursue the spirit of broad
learning in fresher ways.
Mechanical general education
requirements have never real
ly worked; why don't we ad
mit it?" (From a recent speech
by Louis T. Benezet, President
of the Claremont Graduate
School.)
The question of general edu
cation is not a new one, but it
has become a central issue in
higher education as student pro
tests of alienation and rising
dropout rates have underlined
the importance of change in
American education.
The idea of "gen ed" as pres
ently used began to develop
around the 1920'5, growing out
of dissatisfaction with the pure
ly elective system that then
held sway in most colleges.
Classical Academies
For a while, a battle was
waged between the classical acad
emies and the new upstarts of
German-style scholarship and
American style "public service."
By the end of the century, how
ever, it was all over. Classicism
was dead.
Taking its place in most uni
versities was the elective system,
championed by the influential
Charles Eliot, President of Har
vard from 1869 to 1909. By the
time he came to college, Eliot's
theory went, the young person
should be able to embark upon
study which would lead to a pro
fession.
This idea was quite popular
in the last half of the 19th cen
tury and on into the 20th, but
it was by no means universally
accepted.
The University of Chicago's
first president, William Harper,
pointed out the danger of pat

ternless skipping from course
to course, and, while president
of Princeton, Woodrow Wilson
proposed that all students should
gain "a wide acquaintance with
the best books that men have
written joined with a knowl
edge of the institutions men
have made trial of in the past."
Meanwhile, at Harvard Uni
versity, President Abbott Lowell
was replacing his predecessor's
elective system with a pattern
of concentration and distribu
tion, limiting student's freedom
to choose any course.
The distributing system, which
requires some number of
courses from each of several
fields or groups, is still widely
used. Often called the "Chinese
menu" plan ("Take one from
corumn A, two from corumn B,
and everybody get egg loll"), it
is not usually considered re
spectable by those who cham
pion the "true" gen ed pattern.
Survey Course
One alternative is the "sur
vey" course, which attempts to
sample material from each of
several related disciplines.
Survey courses were not uni
versally acclaimed. Alexander
Meiklejohn, president of Am
herst until 1924, later the father
of the University of Wisconsin's
famous Experimental College,
commented that survey courses
"in themselves have no dominat
ing unity. Against the survey
course which lists, describes,
and classifies a group of studies,
I would suggest the analytic
course which finds a method of
thought and gives a student
practice in it."
Not all practitioners of gen ed
have recognized the distinction,
and clearly chosen one over the
other — the "method" over the
"matter," as Meiklejohn urged.
Another alternative which at
tempts to give students some
practice in "thinking" is the

"problem" course. Here, a va
riety of "problems" is discussed,
supposedly prodding the student
to consider the factual back
ground and policy implications
connected with the problem.
A variation on this theme is
one which treats "eternal prob
lems." For example, a humani
ties course at Princeton looks at
"Man and His Freedom" as dis
cussed in literature from the
Bible to the present. Less his
torical and more topical, a
course at Wesleyan examines
works concerned with free will
and necessity by Greek trage
tdists, Augustine, Luther and
Shakespeare.
In the social sciences, many
schools have used courses which
examine broad questions of so
cial policy, often on fairly
theoretical, abstract level. Don't
look at specific issues that are
hot today, the idea goes, but try
to grasp the general concepts of
law, society, culture, etc. Then
you can apply them to specific
cases.
The attempt to work up inter
disciplinary courses has not real
ly taken on the proportions of a
fad. Concern has not abated,
however, but has become more
urgent as the forces which press
upon colleges become more se
vere.
Combined with scarcity of
teaching resources is the increas

ing determinates of social status.
If almost half the people of
college age are in fact in some
sort of college, and almost find
themselves there by necessity,
what happens to the notion of
what "a college education"
should consist of? This is par
ticularly acute as the univer
sity is increasingly asked to take
on training in specialized activi
ties formerly performed "on-the
job."
Several colleges have recog
nized the need for some oppor
tunity to test ideas and theories
in the "real world."
Such opportunities, patterned
after the programs at Antioch
College in Ohio and Beloit Col
lege in Wisconsin, would, in ef
fect, throw the students off the
campus for periods of several
months, sometimes quite a bit
longer than the usual three
month summer vacation. At
Antioch and Beloit, the colleges
help place students in work
which offers challenges to their
abilities and widens their ex
periences.
Students who might have been
caguely considering the possi
bility of teaching, for example,
might find work in a community
development project working
with Appalachian or inter-city
children, and gain a new per
spective on what education can
do for people.

tion, limiting student's freedom
to choose any course.
The distributing system, which
requires some number of
courses from each of several
fields or groups, is still widely
used. Often called the "Chinese
menu" plan ("Take one from
corumn A, two from corumn B,
and everybody get egg loll"), it
is not usually considered re
spectable by those who cham
pion the "true" gen ed pattern.
Survey Course
One alternative is the "sur
vey" course, which attempts to
sample material from each of
several related disciplines.
Survey courses were not uni
versally acclaimed. Alexander
Meiklejohn, president of Am
herst until 1924, later the father
of the University of Wisconsin's
famous Experimental College,
commented that survey courses
"in themselves have no dominat
ing unity. Against the survey
course which lists, describes,
and classifies a group of studies,
I would suggest the analytic
course which finds a method of
thought and gives a student
practice in it."
Not all practitioners of gen ed
have recognized the distinction,
and clearly chosen one over the
other — the "method" over the
"matter," as Meiklejohn urged.
Another alternative which at
tempts to give students some
practice in "thinking" is the

"problem" course. Here, a va
riety of "problems" is discussed,
supposedly prodding the student
to consider the factual back
ground and policy implications
connected with the problem.
A variation on this theme is
one which treats "eternal prob
lems." For example, a humani
ties course at Princeton looks at
"Man and His Freedom" as dis
cussed in literature from the
Bible to the present. Less his
torical and more topical, a
course at Wesleyan examines
works concerned with free will
and necessity by Greek trage
tdists, Augustine, Luther and
Shakespeare.
In the social sciences, many
schools have used courses which
examine broad questions of so
cial policy, often on fairly
theoretical, abstract level. Don't
look at specific issues that are
hot today, the idea goes, but try
to grasp the general concepts of
law, society, culture, etc. Then
you can apply them to specific
cases.
The attempt to work up inter
disciplinary courses has not real
ly taken on the proportions of a
fad. Concern has not abated,
however, but has become more
urgent as the forces which press
upon colleges become more se
vere.
Combined with scarcity of
teaching resources is the increas

ing determinates of social status.
If almost half the people of
college age are in fact in some
sort of college, and almost find
themselves there by necessity,
what happens to the notion of
what "a college education"
should consist of? This is par
ticularly acute as the univer
sity is increasingly asked to take
on training in specialized activi
ties formerly performed "on-the
job."
Several colleges have recog
nized the need for some oppor
tunity to test ideas and theories
in the "real world."
Such opportunities, patterned
after the programs at Antioch
College in Ohio and Beloit Col
lege in Wisconsin, would, in ef
fect, throw the students off the
campus for periods of several
months, sometimes quite a bit
longer than the usual three
month summer vacation. At
Antioch and Beloit, the colleges
help place students in work
which offers challenges to their
abilities and widens their ex
periences.
Students who might have been
caguely considering the possi
bility of teaching, for example,
might find work in a community
development project working
with Appalachian or inter-city
children, and gain a new per
spective on what education can
do for people.
"It may be time to declare the
formal general education
movement dead in America, to
cease bowing to its corpse, and
to pursue the spirit of broad
learning in fresher ways.
Mechanical general education
requirements have never real
ly worked; why don't we ad
mit it?" (From a recent speech
by Louis T. Benezet, President
of the Claremont Graduate
School.)
The question of general edu
cation is not a new one, but it
has become a central issue in
higher education as student pro
tests of alienation and rising
dropout rates have underlined
the importance of change in
American education.
The idea of "gen ed" as pres
ently used began to develop
around the 1920'5, growing out
of dissatisfaction with the pure

held sway in most colleges.
Classical Academies
For a while, a battle was
waged between the classical acad
emies and the new upstarts of
German-style scholarship and
American style "public service."
By the end of the century, how
ever, it was all over. Classicism
was dead.
Taking its place in most uni
versities was the elective system,
championed by the influential
Charles Eliot, President of Har
vard from 1869 to 1909. By the
time he came to college, Eliot's
theory went, the young person
should be able to embark upon
study which would lead to a pro
fession.
This idea was quite popular
in the last half of the 19th cen
tury and on into the 20th, but
it was by no means universally
accepted.
The University of Chicago's
first president, William Harper,
pointed out the danger of pat

ternless skipping from course
to course, and, while president
of Princeton, Woodrow Wilson
proposed that all students should
gain "a wide acquaintance with
the best books that men have
written joined with a knowl
edge of the institutions men
have made trial of in the past."
Meanwhile, at Harvard Uni
versity, President Abbott Lowell
was replacing his predecessor's
elective system with a pattern
of concentration and distribu

to choose any course.

"It may be time to declare the

Mechanical general education
requirements have never real

by Louis T. Benezet, President
of the Claremont Graduate
School.)
The question of general edu
cation is not a new one, but it
has become a central issue in
higher education as student pro
tests of alienation and rising
dropout rates have underlined
the importance of change in
American education.
The idea of "gen ed" as pres
ently used began to develop
around the 1920'5, growing out
of dissatisfaction with the pure
ly elective system that then
held sway in most colleges.
Classical Academies
For a while, a battle was
waged between the classical acad
emies and the new upstarts of
German-style scholarship and
American style "public service."
By the end of the century, how
ever, it was all over. Classicism
was dead.
Taking its place in most uni
versities was the elective system,
championed by the influential
Charles Eliot, President of Har
vard from 1869 to 1909. By the
time he came to college, Eliot's
theory went, the young person
should be able to embark upon
study which would lead to a pro
fession.
This idea was quite popular
in the last half of the 19th cen
tury and on into the 20th, but
it was by no means universally
accepted.
The University of Chicago's
first president, William Harper,
pointed out the danger of pat

ternless skipping from course
to course, and, while president
of Princeton, Woodrow Wilson
proposed that all students should
gain "a wide acquaintance with
the best books that men have
written joined with a knowl
edge of the institutions men
have made trial of in the past."
Meanwhile, at Harvard Uni
versity, President Abbott Lowell
was replacing his predecessor's
elective system with a pattern
of concentration and distribu
tion, limiting student's freedom
to choose any course.
The distributing system, which
requires some number of
courses from each of several
fields or groups, is still widely
used. Often called the "Chinese
menu" plan ("Take one from
corumn A, two from corumn B,
and everybody get egg loll"), it
is not usually considered re
spectable by those who cham
pion the "true" gen ed pattern.
Survey Course
One alternative is the "sur
vey" course, which attempts to
sample material from each of
several related disciplines.
Survey courses were not uni
versally acclaimed. Alexander
Meiklejohn, president of Am
herst until 1924, later the father
of the University of Wisconsin's
famous Experimental College,
commented that survey courses
"in themselves have no dominat
ing unity. Against the survey
course which lists, describes,
and classifies a group of studies,
I would suggest the analytic
course which finds a method of
thought and gives a student
practice in it."
Not all practitioners of gen ed
have recognized the distinction,
and clearly chosen one over the
other — the "method" over the
"matter," as Meiklejohn urged.
Another alternative which at
tempts to give students some
practice in "thinking" is the

"problem" course. Here, a va
riety of "problems" is discussed,
supposedly prodding the student
to consider the factual back
ground and policy implications
connected with the problem.
A variation on this theme is
one which treats "eternal prob
lems." For example, a humani
ties course at Princeton looks at
"Man and His Freedom" as dis
cussed in literature from the
Bible to the present. Less his
torical and more topical, a
course at Wesleyan examines
works concerned with free will
and necessity by Greek trage
tdists, Augustine, Luther and
Shakespeare.
In the social sciences, many
schools have used courses which
examine broad questions of so
cial policy, often on fairly
theoretical, abstract level. Don't
look at specific issues that are
hot today, the idea goes, but try
to grasp the general concepts of
law, society, culture, etc. Then
you can apply them to specific
cases.
The attempt to work up inter
disciplinary courses has not real
