# Mao: From Conflicts To Justification

### SUE MEYER 
Mao Tse-Tung- in Opposition
1927 1935, John E. Rue, (Stan
ford University Press) $10.

In Mao Tse-Tung in Opposi
tion 1927-1935, John E. Rue
traces the ideological ins and
outs of Mao's relationship with
the Chinese Communist Party
Politburo and the Comintern,
Relying heavily on documents
and paying sometimes exasper
ating attention to detail, Rue
shows how Mao's policies were
almost constantly at odds with
those of his superiors: in fact,
Mao was in opposition for 68
out of the 89 months between
August 1927 and January 1935,
and was expelled from the Cen
tral Committee three times.
Justification
It is Rue's contention that be
cause of his precarious position
during this period and after
ward, Mao could not afford to
press his position on his com
rades. It was only after he was
secure, at the Congress of Vic
tors in 1945, that he could pre
pare his new interpretation of
party history.
At the same time, he had to
give an ideological justification
for the positions he had taken.
Thus, Rue views Mao's party
history as being, in part at least,
a defense of the positions he
field between 1927 and 1935.
The book opens with a brief
biographical sketch: Mao is
shown as a student activists,
with little formal training in
Marxism-Leninism but with

much experience in organizing
labor: Mao was a revolutionary
before he became a communist.
When Mao joins the Commu
nist Party and begins to organ
ize with them, we can see his
pragmatic and organizational
bent appearing, as Mao urges
organization of the peasants
Mao Vs. Comintern
This difference in policies be
tween Mao and the Comintern,
a set of quarrels which forms a
dominant theme in the book,
with the two protagonists
switching roles and advocacy of
policies.
The drama on the Comintern
side was played against Stalin's
struggle to assert his total con

trol of the CPSU. Mao, on the
other hand, was trying to retain
his power in Hunan province
and control over the Front Com
mittee while at the same time
attempting to make inroads in
the influence of the CCP Central
Committee.
Rue analyzes these develop
ments in the same way as he re
lates them: by using many
documents—letters, speeches,
writings—and by paying partic
ular attention to changes which
have been made in subsequent
editions of several works.
The implications he can find
in seemingly minor changes—
such as the change in the
charge against Li Li San from

"idealism" to "subjectivism"—
sometimes seem rather exagger
ated in importance until one
remembers that the emphasis
Mao places on ideology makes
subtle terminological changes
take on major significance.
The resulting detail of names
a"nd concepts and places, how
ever, detracts from the contin
uity of the book. One gets so
bogged down in detail as to ob
scure the whole picture. This is
compensated for, however, by
the excellent summaries of de
velopments which appear
throughout the book—a schol
arly, detailed work which
should be of interest to students
of Chinese political history.

biographical sketch: Mao is
shown as a student activists,
with little formal training in
Marxism-Leninism but with

much experience in organizing
labor: Mao was a revolutionary
before he became a communist.
When Mao joins the Commu
nist Party and begins to organ
ize with them, we can see his
pragmatic and organizational
bent appearing, as Mao urges
organization of the peasants
Mao Vs. Comintern
This difference in policies be
tween Mao and the Comintern,
a set of quarrels which forms a
dominant theme in the book,
with the two protagonists
switching roles and advocacy of
policies.
The drama on the Comintern
side was played against Stalin's
struggle to assert his total con

trol of the CPSU. Mao, on the
other hand, was trying to retain
his power in Hunan province
and control over the Front Com
mittee while at the same time
attempting to make inroads in
the influence of the CCP Central
Committee.
Rue analyzes these develop
ments in the same way as he re
lates them: by using many
documents—letters, speeches,
writings—and by paying partic
ular attention to changes which
have been made in subsequent
editions of several works.
The implications he can find
in seemingly minor changes—
such as the change in the
charge against Li Li San from

"idealism" to "subjectivism"—
sometimes seem rather exagger
ated in importance until one
remembers that the emphasis
Mao places on ideology makes
subtle terminological changes
take on major significance.
The resulting detail of names
a"nd concepts and places, how
ever, detracts from the contin
uity of the book. One gets so
bogged down in detail as to ob
scure the whole picture. This is
compensated for, however, by
the excellent summaries of de
velopments which appear
throughout the book—a schol
arly, detailed work which
should be of interest to students
of Chinese political history.
Mao Tse-Tung- in Opposition
1927 1935, John E. Rue, (Stan
ford University Press) $10.

In Mao Tse-Tung in Opposi
tion 1927-1935, John E. Rue
traces the ideological ins and
outs of Mao's relationship with
the Chinese Communist Party
Politburo and the Comintern,
Relying heavily on documents
and paying sometimes exasper
ating attention to detail, Rue
shows how Mao's policies were
almost constantly at odds with
those of his superiors: in fact,
Mao was in opposition for 68
out of the 89 months between
August 1927 and January 1935,
and was expelled from the Cen
tral Committee three times.
Justification
It is Rue's contention that be
cause of his precarious position
during this period and after
ward, Mao could not afford to
press his position on his com
rades. It was only after he was
secure, at the Congress of Vic
tors in 1945, that he could pre
pare his new interpretation of
party history.
At the same time, he had to
give an ideological justification
for the positions he had taken.
Thus, Rue views Mao's party
history as being, in part at least,
a defense of the positions he
field between 1927 and 1935.
