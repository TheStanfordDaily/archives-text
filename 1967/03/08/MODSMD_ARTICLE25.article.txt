Prof. Sidney Hook once ob
served that there is "more slop
py rhetoric per page about aca
demic freedom by those who be
lieve that they are supporting,
and those intent on criticizing it,
than on any other theme with
the possible exception of democ
racy."
Those who have for any period
of time listened to the exhorta
tions of student activists, or read
the principle and declaration sec
tions of National Students Asso
ciation resolutions, know the
truth of that statement. Dean of
Students E. G. Williamson and
John L. Cowan have attempted,
in a book just published, to sup
ply a much needed factual base
and long-absent perspective for
such questions. "Discussions of

student academic freedom," they
point out, "have seldom been
academic."
The book, called The American
Student's Freedom of Expres
sion: A Research Appraisal, is
long on facts and statistics and
short on rhetoric and opinion.
Abstract Activism
One fact is that there is an im
portant upsurge in student self
expression on American cam
puses. They survey indicated,
however, that while this expres
sion involves controversial is
sues, and a greater number of
students are demonstrating more
openly for their points of view,
there has not been a commen
surable increase in "extremist"
activity on the campuses.
Nonetheless, in over 50 per
cent of the 900 responding insti
tutions of higher education, less
than 10 per cent of the students
belong to "activist" organiza
tions.
Most college administrators
(presidents and deans of stu
dents) approve of this tendency
toward student activism in the
abstract. "The greatest commit
ment to the abstract principle of
academic freedom is found in the
private universities and liberal
arts colleges and the least is
found in the Catholic schools."
In discussing controversial is
sues the survey finds there is a

slight overall disparity betwem
the abstract commitment to stu
dent freedoms and the willing
ness to discuss certain kinds of
issues. The authors noted a slight
disparity, too, between the oppo
sition to such discussion envi
sioned by students and that
gested by administrators.
Those who have taken the po
sition that a school's speaker
policy is the acid test of its com
mitment to student freedoms will
find support in the Williamson-
Cowan study. Some 17 speaker
were inquired about, ranging ii
controversiality from Earl War
ren (acceptable at 95 per cent ot
all schools polled) to George Lin
coin Rockwell (only 18 per com >:
and here more than anywhere
else the grand rationales com •
in: incidents at other schools,
motives of the sponsoring stu
dent group, community pros
sures, and so on.
Forms of Protest
These three areas — state
ments of principle, student or
ganizations and speaker policies
— are still all in the realm of ad
vocacy. When it comes to or
ganized protest action the survey
indicates that there are virtually
no completely free campuses.
The most objectionable of a list
of nine kinds of organized action
was the picketing of a public
meeting.
