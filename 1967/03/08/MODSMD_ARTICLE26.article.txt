# Letters To The Editor
## Frustrated Activist's Daily Hang-Up 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This letter is to you, o noble
verbal ragers, dabblers with
Thought and Idea, whose own
minds of late have become bog
gled and tired, whether you call
yourselves activists, radicals,
liberals, or whatever you think
fits your image.
I can feel your frustration at
being able to accomplish noth
ing by your protests. But don't
you see why your words go un
comprehended? Who is sup
posed to be listening to them?
Don't you realize that the only
way political action is effected
in this country is through ma
jority rule? How can you hope
to move a majority of the popu
lation to your side by maligning
it? If you want to reject the
concept of majority rule, fine
reject it. But don't feel frus
trated then because a society
which is built upon it rejects
you.
If, however, the noble ambi
tions you espouse in your writ
ing and oratory are anything
more than means by which the
insecure and impotent try to
bolster their lunatic dreams of
self-grandeur, if your ambitions
mean anything to you, then why
not seriously attempt to carry
them out? How? Is that the
hang-up? The answer is simple,
my friends. Get a majority of
the American people on your
side and then vote in men who
express that majority's views.
But don't think you're doing any
snow job on the public at large
by maligning those who present
ly represent them (and don't
tell me in mitigation that only
two acid-heads were out there
"Shame"). Baby, the Vice Presi
dent, by his office alone, is the
United States, and if you want
to win that to your side, you'd
better not try to pull it off by
spitting on the representatives
of the people.
But you say you value the
role of the individual and don't
want your image as an individ
ual mucked up by close contact
with the masses? You just want
to reveal your own dislike of
war and violence? Go ahead,
but I warn you, baby, it'll take
courage. If you want to stand
as an individual, fine; do it. But
don't drag an irrational mob
along for protection. Speak as
an individual, listen to other in
dividuals, but don't condemn
them for lack of openness if
they, as individuals, don't hap
pen to agree. And don't think
that by ignoring them you'll
influence them or reach any ac
cord with them, 'cause you'll
only brand yourself as too
cowardly to face free debate.
So, my frustrated colleagues
in life, show hair! Have the
courage to discover your own
positions, to decide whether you
want to do anything or to drop
out. Decide if your inviolate and
incorruptible images as individ
uals will bear the strain of con
versation with others who may
not agree. And if you're a real
activist, baby, you gotta flick in
the cloud and step down to
where the action is. You gotta
respect the people you need to
get something done; you can't
get anywhere by spitting on
them! PERRY ANDERSON

Editor, The Daily:
As one who formerly sup
ported the administration policy
in Vietnam, I think it is becom
ing increasingly clear that an at
tenuated conflict in southeast
Asia is draining the moral as
well as physical resources of
this country.
There does indeed come a time
when silence is betrayal, when
a concern for justice overstrews
one's febrile grasp on the stra
tegic consequences of upright
action.
No army can withstand an
idea whose time has come, and
the idea of a quick and honor
able solution in Vietnam dwarfs
Hubert Humphrey's political
rhodomontade.
And that idea, born of agoniz
ing bouts with indefatigable con
science, compels our academic
community to call upon the

President to put an end to the
hostilities, to think the unthink
able.
Perhaps it is time, in point
of fact, to get out of Vietnam;
perhaps it is time to "drop the
big one."

Editor, The Daily:
Do I read this community cor
rectly? It will tolerate any ex
aggeration—bare feet, tattered
pants, long hair, drugs, etc. —
that can be isolated and ridiculed
as "fanatic," "immature," "ex
treme," "hippy," "unrealistic."
But if such an exaggeration be
comes the symbol of restless,
powerful, disturbing thoughts,
out it goes.
One thought cannot go away,
even though Davey Harris has
resigned, and it is this: »Once
upon a time, the Scientific Rev
olution had lowly status. It
threatened the status quo, and
was, naturally, resisted. For
some time now, the Revolution
has become the status quo. It
makes money. A counter-revolu
tion has formed because there
are human beings who have
found that human progress
needs more than technological
goodies.
Is human thought to be lim
ited to those scietnific thoughts
and methods that attract big
money? Is a distinction being
made in this community be
tween thoughts that pay off and
those which don't?
Why did President Sterling
obligated to apologize to
HHH, when it is our vice presi
dent who should apologize to
us, for assuming, as he did, that
we are no better than the audi
ences that listened to Hitler and
Mussolini?
Why does Davey Harris feel
that it isn't worth his while to
serve this community any long
er? If there are no divided con
sciences hereabouts, then God
help us. We deserve another
dose of HHH.

• Explanation
Editor, The Daily:
As one of the participants in
the protest activities surround
ing the Humphrey visit, I would
like to explain my view of those
developments. Some 250 stu
dents and faculty, hoping to ex
press opposition to the war with
out arousing irrelevant antago
nisms, chose to walk out.
At the same time, it appeared
to me that more than half of the
audience wore white armbands.
In the face of these armbands,
Hubert Humphrey was able to
say that he had noticed no lack
of support in the academic com
munity.
As we walked out and gather
ed around the speakers outside,
Mr. Humphrey chose to say that
we were demonstrating our im
maturity. I judge this remark
as a rude and cynical effort to
obscure a serious act of political
dissent. Treated as though they
did not exist, many hundreds of
opponents of the war were frus
trated and antagonized by these
maneuverings.
Finally, the secret service
agents agitated the crowd out

side by a number of decoy cor
dons, so that the tension of the
crowd was raised with each false
alarm.
The cynicism and dishonesty
with which the Vice-President
treated questions related to the
war and the protest activities
were deeply disappointing to me.
I had expected so much more. I
feel that the words of Mr. Hum
phrey and the actions of the sec
ret service provoked what would
otherwise have been a peaceful
protest. JAMES H. WARE
• The Limit
Editor, The Daily:
I sympathize with and share
President Sterling's concern for
the preservation of free and
civilized debate on the campus.
But I find it impossible to accept
the statements of Mr. Humphrey
as contributions to such debate.
His statements appear to me as
rhetorical camouflage rather

clumsily designed to cover over
the acts of an administration
controlled by arrogant and self
righteous men who have long
since closed themselves off from
debate. And even if a real debate
were proceeding, here or in
Washington, D.C., the acts of
that administration proceed as
well, without any clear relevance
to the outcome of the debate.
These acts are abhorrent to the
people of a large part of the
world, including many millions
in the United States. Nor does
the administration debate with
the taxpayer who must support
the military machine or with the
young man who must fight its
bloody battles. Surely there is a
limit to decorum in these mat
ters. Perhaps we have not yet
reached it — certainly this is a
debatable point — but should
the Germans have preserved
their political decorum in the
thirties when Hitler defended

his murderous and grandiose
policies?

Editor, The Dally:
Professor Julian Ripley is ad
vised that neither his opposition
to U.S. policy in Vietnam nor his
part in the Great Proletarian
Walk-out at the Vice-President's
address constitute treason.
One is compelled to agree with
the gentleman's opinion that the
walk-out was perhaps "unwise
and foolish." It was.
Professor Ripley's credentials
to speak for "Humanity" are
suspect. In cases of extreme frus
tration, it is the usual practice
to write a book. Or read one. Or
run for office.

No army can withstand an

As one of the participants in
the protest activities surround
ing the Humphrey visit, I would
like to explain my view of those
developments. Some 250 stu
dents and faculty, hoping to ex
press opposition to the war with
out arousing irrelevant antago
nisms, chose to walk out.
At the same time, it appeared
to me that more than half of the
audience wore white armbands.
In the face of these armbands,
Hubert Humphrey was able to
say that he had noticed no lack
of support in the academic com
munity.
As we walked out and gather
ed around the speakers outside,
Mr. Humphrey chose to say that
we were demonstrating our im
maturity. I judge this remark
as a rude and cynical effort to
obscure a serious act of political
dissent. Treated as though they
did not exist, many hundreds of
opponents of the war were frus
trated and antagonized by these
maneuverings.
Finally, the secret service
agents agitated the crowd out

side by a number of decoy cor
dons, so that the tension of the
crowd was raised with each false
alarm.
The cynicism and dishonesty
with which the Vice-President
treated questions related to the
war and the protest activities
were deeply disappointing to me.
I had expected so much more. I
feel that the words of Mr. Hum
phrey and the actions of the sec

otherwise have been a peaceful
protest. JAMES H. WARE

Editor, The Daily:
I sympathize with and share
President Sterling's concern for
the preservation of free and
civilized debate on the campus.
But I find it impossible to accept
the statements of Mr. Humphrey
as contributions to such debate.
His statements appear to me as
rhetorical camouflage rather

clumsily designed to cover over
the acts of an administration
controlled by arrogant and self
righteous men who have long
since closed themselves off from
debate. And even if a real debate
were proceeding, here or in
Washington, D.C., the acts of
that administration proceed as
well, without any clear relevance
to the outcome of the debate.
These acts are abhorrent to the
people of a large part of the
world, including many millions
in the United States. Nor does
the administration debate with
the taxpayer who must support
the military machine or with the
young man who must fight its
bloody battles. Surely there is a
limit to decorum in these mat
ters. Perhaps we have not yet
reached it — certainly this is a
debatable point — but should
the Germans have preserved
their political decorum in the
thirties when Hitler defended

his murderous and grandiose
policies?

Editor, The Daily:
This letter is to you, o noble
verbal ragers, dabblers with
Thought and Idea, whose own
minds of late have become bog
gled and tired, whether you call
yourselves activists, radicals,
liberals, or whatever you think
fits your image.
I can feel your frustration at
being able to accomplish noth
ing by your protests. But don't
you see why your words go un
comprehended? Who is sup
posed to be listening to them?
Don't you realize that the only
way political action is effected
in this country is through ma
jority rule? How can you hope
to move a majority of the popu
lation to your side by maligning
it? If you want to reject the
concept of majority rule, fine
reject it. But don't feel frus
trated then because a society
which is built upon it rejects
you.
If, however, the noble ambi
tions you espouse in your writ
ing and oratory are anything
more than means by which the
insecure and impotent try to
bolster their lunatic dreams of
self-grandeur, if your ambitions
mean anything to you, then why
not seriously attempt to carry
them out? How? Is that the
hang-up? The answer is simple,
my friends. Get a majority of
the American people on your
side and then vote in men who
express that majority's views.
But don't think you're doing any
snow job on the public at large
by maligning those who present
ly represent them (and don't
tell me in mitigation that only
two acid-heads were out there
"Shame"). Baby, the Vice Presi
dent, by his office alone, is the
United States, and if you want
to win that to your side, you'd
better not try to pull it off by
spitting on the representatives
of the people.
But you say you value the
role of the individual and don't
want your image as an individ
ual mucked up by close contact
with the masses? You just want
to reveal your own dislike of
war and violence? Go ahead,
but I warn you, baby, it'll take
courage. If you want to stand
as an individual, fine; do it. But
don't drag an irrational mob
along for protection. Speak as
an individual, listen to other in
dividuals, but don't condemn
them for lack of openness if
they, as individuals, don't hap
pen to agree. And don't think
that by ignoring them you'll
influence them or reach any ac
cord with them, 'cause you'll
only brand yourself as too
cowardly to face free debate.
So, my frustrated colleagues
in life, show hair! Have the
courage to discover your own
positions, to decide whether you
want to do anything or to drop
out. Decide if your inviolate and
incorruptible images as individ
uals will bear the strain of con
versation with others who may
not agree. And if you're a real
activist, baby, you gotta flick in
the cloud and step down to
where the action is. You gotta
respect the people you need to
get something done; you can't
get anywhere by spitting on
them! PERRY ANDERSON

the preservation of free and

But I find it impossible to accept

His statements appear to me as
rhetorical camouflage rather

clumsily designed to cover over
the acts of an administration

debate. And even if a real debate
were proceeding, here or in

These acts are abhorrent to the
people of a large part of the
world, including many millions
in the United States. Nor does
the administration debate with
the taxpayer who must support
the military machine or with the
young man who must fight its
bloody battles. Surely there is a
limit to decorum in these mat

his murderous and grandiose

This letter is to you, o noble
verbal ragers, dabblers with
Thought and Idea, whose own
minds of late have become bog
gled and tired, whether you call
yourselves activists, radicals,
liberals, or whatever you think
fits your image.
I can feel your frustration at
being able to accomplish noth
ing by your protests. But don't
you see why your words go un
comprehended? Who is sup
posed to be listening to them?
Don't you realize that the only
way political action is effected
in this country is through ma
jority rule? How can you hope
to move a majority of the popu
lation to your side by maligning
it? If you want to reject the
concept of majority rule, fine
reject it. But don't feel frus
trated then because a society
which is built upon it rejects
you.
If, however, the noble ambi
tions you espouse in your writ
ing and oratory are anything
more than means by which the
insecure and impotent try to
bolster their lunatic dreams of
self-grandeur, if your ambitions
mean anything to you, then why
not seriously attempt to carry
them out? How? Is that the
hang-up? The answer is simple,
my friends. Get a majority of
the American people on your
side and then vote in men who
express that majority's views.
But don't think you're doing any
snow job on the public at large
by maligning those who present
ly represent them (and don't
tell me in mitigation that only
two acid-heads were out there
"Shame"). Baby, the Vice Presi
dent, by his office alone, is the
United States, and if you want
to win that to your side, you'd
better not try to pull it off by
spitting on the representatives
of the people.
But you say you value the
role of the individual and don't
want your image as an individ
ual mucked up by close contact
with the masses? You just want
to reveal your own dislike of
war and violence? Go ahead,
but I warn you, baby, it'll take
courage. If you want to stand
as an individual, fine; do it. But
don't drag an irrational mob
along for protection. Speak as
an individual, listen to other in
dividuals, but don't condemn
them for lack of openness if
they, as individuals, don't hap
pen to agree. And don't think
that by ignoring them you'll
influence them or reach any ac
cord with them, 'cause you'll
only brand yourself as too
cowardly to face free debate.
So, my frustrated colleagues
in life, show hair! Have the
courage to discover your own
positions, to decide whether you
want to do anything or to drop
out. Decide if your inviolate and
incorruptible images as individ
uals will bear the strain of con
versation with others who may
not agree. And if you're a real
activist, baby, you gotta flick in
the cloud and step down to
where the action is. You gotta
respect the people you need to
get something done; you can't
get anywhere by spitting on
them! PERRY ANDERSON

As one who formerly sup
ported the administration policy
in Vietnam, I think it is becom
ing increasingly clear that an at
tenuated conflict in southeast
Asia is draining the moral as
well as physical resources of
this country.
There does indeed come a time
when silence is betrayal, when
a concern for justice overstrews
one's febrile grasp on the stra
tegic consequences of upright
action.
No army can withstand an
idea whose time has come, and
the idea of a quick and honor
able solution in Vietnam dwarfs
Hubert Humphrey's political
rhodomontade.
And that idea, born of agoniz
ing bouts with indefatigable con
science, compels our academic
community to call upon the

President to put an end to the
hostilities, to think the unthink
able.
Perhaps it is time, in point
of fact, to get out of Vietnam;
perhaps it is time to "drop the

Is human thought to be lim

Why did President Sterling

Editor, The Daily:
As one of the participants in
the protest activities surround
ing the Humphrey visit, I would
like to explain my view of those
developments. Some 250 stu
dents and faculty, hoping to ex
press opposition to the war with
out arousing irrelevant antago
nisms, chose to walk out.
At the same time, it appeared
to me that more than half of the
audience wore white armbands.
In the face of these armbands,
Hubert Humphrey was able to
say that he had noticed no lack
of support in the academic com
munity.
As we walked out and gather
ed around the speakers outside,
Mr. Humphrey chose to say that
we were demonstrating our im
maturity. I judge this remark
as a rude and cynical effort to
obscure a serious act of political
dissent. Treated as though they
did not exist, many hundreds of
opponents of the war were frus
trated and antagonized by these
maneuverings.
Finally, the secret service
agents agitated the crowd out

side by a number of decoy cor
dons, so that the tension of the
crowd was raised with each false
alarm.
The cynicism and dishonesty
with which the Vice-President
treated questions related to the
war and the protest activities
were deeply disappointing to me.

"Shame"). Baby, the Vice Presi

United States, and if you want
to win that to your side, you'd
better not try to pull it off by
spitting on the representatives
of the people.
But you say you value the
role of the individual and don't
want your image as an individ
ual mucked up by close contact
with the masses? You just want
to reveal your own dislike of
war and violence? Go ahead,
but I warn you, baby, it'll take
courage. If you want to stand
as an individual, fine; do it. But
don't drag an irrational mob
along for protection. Speak as
an individual, listen to other in
dividuals, but don't condemn
them for lack of openness if
they, as individuals, don't hap
pen to agree. And don't think
that by ignoring them you'll
influence them or reach any ac
cord with them, 'cause you'll
only brand yourself as too
cowardly to face free debate.
So, my frustrated colleagues
in life, show hair! Have the
courage to discover your own
positions, to decide whether you
want to do anything or to drop
out. Decide if your inviolate and
incorruptible images as individ
uals will bear the strain of con
versation with others who may
not agree. And if you're a real
activist, baby, you gotta flick in
the cloud and step down to
where the action is. You gotta
respect the people you need to
get something done; you can't
get anywhere by spitting on
them! PERRY ANDERSON

• The Big One
Editor, The Daily:
As one who formerly sup
ported the administration policy
in Vietnam, I think it is becom
ing increasingly clear that an at
tenuated conflict in southeast
Asia is draining the moral as
well as physical resources of
this country.
There does indeed come a time
when silence is betrayal, when
a concern for justice overstrews
one's febrile grasp on the stra
tegic consequences of upright
action.
No army can withstand an
idea whose time has come, and
the idea of a quick and honor
able solution in Vietnam dwarfs
Hubert Humphrey's political
rhodomontade.
And that idea, born of agoniz
ing bouts with indefatigable con
science, compels our academic
community to call upon the

President to put an end to the
hostilities, to think the unthink
able.
Perhaps it is time, in point
of fact, to get out of Vietnam;
perhaps it is time to "drop the
big one."

• Explanation
Editor, The Daily:
As one of the participants in
the protest activities surround
ing the Humphrey visit, I would
like to explain my view of those
developments. Some 250 stu
dents and faculty, hoping to ex
press opposition to the war with
out arousing irrelevant antago
nisms, chose to walk out.
At the same time, it appeared
to me that more than half of the
audience wore white armbands.
In the face of these armbands,
Hubert Humphrey was able to
say that he had noticed no lack
of support in the academic com
munity.
As we walked out and gather
ed around the speakers outside,
Mr. Humphrey chose to say that
we were demonstrating our im
maturity. I judge this remark
as a rude and cynical effort to
obscure a serious act of political
dissent. Treated as though they
did not exist, many hundreds of
opponents of the war were frus
trated and antagonized by these
maneuverings.
Finally, the secret service
agents agitated the crowd out

side by a number of decoy cor
dons, so that the tension of the
crowd was raised with each false
alarm.
The cynicism and dishonesty
with which the Vice-President
treated questions related to the
war and the protest activities
were deeply disappointing to me.
I had expected so much more. I
feel that the words of Mr. Hum
phrey and the actions of the sec
ret service provoked what would
otherwise have been a peaceful
protest. JAMES H. WARE
• The Limit
Editor, The Daily:
I sympathize with and share
President Sterling's concern for
the preservation of free and
civilized debate on the campus.
But I find it impossible to accept
the statements of Mr. Humphrey
as contributions to such debate.
His statements appear to me as
rhetorical camouflage rather

clumsily designed to cover over
the acts of an administration
controlled by arrogant and self
righteous men who have long
since closed themselves off from
debate. And even if a real debate
were proceeding, here or in
Washington, D.C., the acts of
that administration proceed as
well, without any clear relevance
to the outcome of the debate.
These acts are abhorrent to the
people of a large part of the
world, including many millions
in the United States. Nor does
the administration debate with
the taxpayer who must support
the military machine or with the
young man who must fight its
bloody battles. Surely there is a
limit to decorum in these mat
ters. Perhaps we have not yet
reached it — certainly this is a
debatable point — but should
the Germans have preserved
their political decorum in the
thirties when Hitler defended

his murderous and grandiose
policies?

This letter is to you, o noble
verbal ragers, dabblers with
Thought and Idea, whose own
minds of late have become bog
gled and tired, whether you call
yourselves activists, radicals,
liberals, or whatever you think
fits your image.
I can feel your frustration at
being able to accomplish noth
ing by your protests. But don't
you see why your words go un
comprehended? Who is sup
posed to be listening to them?
Don't you realize that the only
way political action is effected
in this country is through ma
jority rule? How can you hope
to move a majority of the popu
lation to your side by maligning
it? If you want to reject the
concept of majority rule, fine
reject it. But don't feel frus
trated then because a society
which is built upon it rejects
you.
If, however, the noble ambi
tions you espouse in your writ
ing and oratory are anything
more than means by which the
insecure and impotent try to
bolster their lunatic dreams of
self-grandeur, if your ambitions
mean anything to you, then why
not seriously attempt to carry
them out? How? Is that the
hang-up? The answer is simple,
my friends. Get a majority of
the American people on your
side and then vote in men who
express that majority's views.
But don't think you're doing any
snow job on the public at large
by maligning those who present
ly represent them (and don't
tell me in mitigation that only
two acid-heads were out there

ited to those scietnific thoughts
and methods that attract big
money? Is a distinction being
made in this community be
tween thoughts that pay off and
those which don't?
Why did President Sterling
obligated to apologize to
HHH, when it is our vice presi
dent who should apologize to
us, for assuming, as he did, that
we are no better than the audi
ences that listened to Hitler and
Mussolini?
Why does Davey Harris feel
that it isn't worth his while to
serve this community any long
er? If there are no divided con
sciences hereabouts, then God
help us. We deserve another
dose of HHH.

• Explanation
Editor, The Daily:
As one of the participants in
the protest activities surround
ing the Humphrey visit, I would
like to explain my view of those
developments. Some 250 stu
dents and faculty, hoping to ex
press opposition to the war with
out arousing irrelevant antago
nisms, chose to walk out.
At the same time, it appeared
to me that more than half of the
audience wore white armbands.
In the face of these armbands,
Hubert Humphrey was able to
say that he had noticed no lack
of support in the academic com
munity.
As we walked out and gather
ed around the speakers outside,
Mr. Humphrey chose to say that
we were demonstrating our im
maturity. I judge this remark
as a rude and cynical effort to
obscure a serious act of political
dissent. Treated as though they
did not exist, many hundreds of
opponents of the war were frus
trated and antagonized by these
maneuverings.
Finally, the secret service
agents agitated the crowd out

side by a number of decoy cor
dons, so that the tension of the
crowd was raised with each false
alarm.
The cynicism and dishonesty
with which the Vice-President
treated questions related to the
war and the protest activities
were deeply disappointing to me.
I had expected so much more. I
feel that the words of Mr. Hum
phrey and the actions of the sec
ret service provoked what would
otherwise have been a peaceful
protest. JAMES H. WARE
• The Limit
Editor, The Daily:
I sympathize with and share
President Sterling's concern for
the preservation of free and
civilized debate on the campus.
But I find it impossible to accept
the statements of Mr. Humphrey
as contributions to such debate.
His statements appear to me as
rhetorical camouflage rather

clumsily designed to cover over
the acts of an administration
controlled by arrogant and self
righteous men who have long
since closed themselves off from
debate. And even if a real debate
were proceeding, here or in
Washington, D.C., the acts of
that administration proceed as
well, without any clear relevance
to the outcome of the debate.
These acts are abhorrent to the
people of a large part of the
world, including many millions
in the United States. Nor does
the administration debate with
the taxpayer who must support
the military machine or with the
young man who must fight its
bloody battles. Surely there is a
limit to decorum in these mat
ters. Perhaps we have not yet
reached it — certainly this is a
debatable point — but should
the Germans have preserved
their political decorum in the
thirties when Hitler defended

his murderous and grandiose
policies?

Editor, The Dally:
Professor Julian Ripley is ad
vised that neither his opposition
to U.S. policy in Vietnam nor his
part in the Great Proletarian
Walk-out at the Vice-President's
address constitute treason.
One is compelled to agree with
the gentleman's opinion that the
walk-out was perhaps "unwise
and foolish." It was.
Professor Ripley's credentials
to speak for "Humanity" are
suspect. In cases of extreme frus
tration, it is the usual practice
to write a book. Or read one. Or
run for office.

Editor, The Daily:
This letter is to you, o noble
verbal ragers, dabblers with
Thought and Idea, whose own
minds of late have become bog
gled and tired, whether you call
yourselves activists, radicals,
liberals, or whatever you think
fits your image.
I can feel your frustration at
being able to accomplish noth
ing by your protests. But don't
you see why your words go un
comprehended? Who is sup
posed to be listening to them?
Don't you realize that the only
way political action is effected
in this country is through ma
jority rule? How can you hope
to move a majority of the popu
lation to your side by maligning
it? If you want to reject the
concept of majority rule, fine
reject it. But don't feel frus
trated then because a society
which is built upon it rejects
you.
If, however, the noble ambi
tions you espouse in your writ
ing and oratory are anything
more than means by which the
insecure and impotent try to
bolster their lunatic dreams of
self-grandeur, if your ambitions
mean anything to you, then why
not seriously attempt to carry
them out? How? Is that the
hang-up? The answer is simple,
my friends. Get a majority of
the American people on your
side and then vote in men who
express that majority's views.
But don't think you're doing any
snow job on the public at large
by maligning those who present
ly represent them (and don't
tell me in mitigation that only
two acid-heads were out there
"Shame"). Baby, the Vice Presi
dent, by his office alone, is the
United States, and if you want
to win that to your side, you'd
better not try to pull it off by
spitting on the representatives
of the people.
But you say you value the
role of the individual and don't
want your image as an individ
ual mucked up by close contact
with the masses? You just want
to reveal your own dislike of
war and violence? Go ahead,
but I warn you, baby, it'll take
courage. If you want to stand
as an individual, fine; do it. But
don't drag an irrational mob
along for protection. Speak as
an individual, listen to other in
dividuals, but don't condemn
them for lack of openness if
they, as individuals, don't hap
pen to agree. And don't think
that by ignoring them you'll
influence them or reach any ac
cord with them, 'cause you'll
only brand yourself as too
cowardly to face free debate.
So, my frustrated colleagues
in life, show hair! Have the
courage to discover your own
positions, to decide whether you
want to do anything or to drop
out. Decide if your inviolate and
incorruptible images as individ
uals will bear the strain of con
versation with others who may
not agree. And if you're a real
activist, baby, you gotta flick in
the cloud and step down to
where the action is. You gotta
respect the people you need to
get something done; you can't
get anywhere by spitting on
them! PERRY ANDERSON

• The Big One
Editor, The Daily:
As one who formerly sup
ported the administration policy
in Vietnam, I think it is becom
ing increasingly clear that an at
tenuated conflict in southeast
Asia is draining the moral as
well as physical resources of
this country.
There does indeed come a time
when silence is betrayal, when
a concern for justice overstrews
one's febrile grasp on the stra
tegic consequences of upright
action.
No army can withstand an
idea whose time has come, and
the idea of a quick and honor
able solution in Vietnam dwarfs
Hubert Humphrey's political
rhodomontade.
And that idea, born of agoniz
ing bouts with indefatigable con
science, compels our academic
community to call upon the

President to put an end to the
hostilities, to think the unthink
able.
Perhaps it is time, in point
of fact, to get out of Vietnam;
perhaps it is time to "drop the
big one."

• W ell-deserved ?
Editor, The Daily:
Do I read this community cor
rectly? It will tolerate any ex
aggeration—bare feet, tattered
pants, long hair, drugs, etc. —
that can be isolated and ridiculed
as "fanatic," "immature," "ex
treme," "hippy," "unrealistic."
But if such an exaggeration be
comes the symbol of restless,
powerful, disturbing thoughts,
out it goes.
One thought cannot go away,
even though Davey Harris has
resigned, and it is this: »Once
upon a time, the Scientific Rev
olution had lowly status. It
threatened the status quo, and
was, naturally, resisted. For
some time now, the Revolution
has become the status quo. It
makes money. A counter-revolu
tion has formed because there
are human beings who have
found that human progress
needs more than technological
goodies.
Is human thought to be lim
ited to those scietnific thoughts
and methods that attract big
money? Is a distinction being
made in this community be
tween thoughts that pay off and
those which don't?
Why did President Sterling
obligated to apologize to
HHH, when it is our vice presi
dent who should apologize to
us, for assuming, as he did, that
we are no better than the audi
ences that listened to Hitler and
Mussolini?
Why does Davey Harris feel
that it isn't worth his while to

sciences hereabouts, then God
