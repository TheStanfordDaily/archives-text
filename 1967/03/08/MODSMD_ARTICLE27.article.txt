## Letter From The President: Case Of Misplaced Modifiers 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Mr. President: I feel called
upon to respond to your letter
of 3 March 1967. I shall not
quote you; your words are now
familiar to ? 3,000 persons, at a
cost to the University, inciden
tally, of $1500.
Since coming here four years
ago, I have listened to you. I
heard your address at the fresh
man convocation; I have read
each year your address on the
State of the University. Once
even, I had the opportunity of
talking with you about Wilbur
Hall. I followed carefully your
views and actions on the sit-in
trial; I noted your correspon
dence on the Off issue; I have
read your releases to The Stan
ford Daily and to the Stanford
Observer. Because you are the
president of our University, I
have tried to be aware of the
appointments you have commis
sioned, the professors you have
invited, the committees and dis
cussions you have arranged.
And finally, I have read and
studied your recent letter re
peatedly.
I have taken your letter as an
important occasion for my own
self-examination. Once again, I
have thought about my actions
and those of my friends during
and after the speech of the Vice
President. Once again, I have
examined why I walked out, and
why I was among the crowd
And perhaps it is most perti
nent to say that I have attempt
ed to understand your assess
ments and conclusions, as ex
pressed in your letter.
Your remarks, however, still
leave me perplexed and dis
turbed, just as the actions at
tendant to the Vice President's
speech perplexed and disturbed
you.
You state that the Stanford

community rejects violence, yet
this same community gives sup
port and facilitates a violent war
abroad.
You state that we, the com
munity, have fallen far from
the tradition of fair and free
discussion; in so saying, you as
sert that four years of an edu
cation devoted to the vindication
of that principle could be ef
faced in a morning.
You mention a tradition which
you say we have sullied; yet, I
remember all the times when
your turned your back on free
discussion, invoked your posi
tion as a justification for close
ness, and left us talking to no
one at all.
You are dismayed that our
perception of that day's events
differs from yours, while it is
the very open expression of dif
fering preceptions which makes
discussion passible.
You assert that we, with ease,
become ugly actors, while it is
our very reluctance to act —re-
luctance born out of a fear of
committing harm — which has
kept Stanford silent for so long.
You decry intimidation of free
discussion, yet you intimidate
us with threats of disciplinary
action.
You disavow the mob, yet by
invoking your power, you sub
stitute despotism, a gain diffi
cult to accept.
You acclaim free discussion,
Mr. President, and yet you do
not discuss but inform, vis. only
regular meeting with students,
half-year convocations, senten
tious monologues.
You are our President only
by virtue of your position and
your power. You have insulted
our education and presumed
that the reports of your Ap
pointees might speak for us.
We demand that we speak for

ourselves and that the teachings
of our professors not be Insult
ed. These traditions we will not
yield, if it is yielding you seek.
