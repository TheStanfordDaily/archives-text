# The 						Pompous Observer
## Letter To A Former Activist 
### James Briscoe 
Dear ,
It's not without misgivings
that I sit down to answer some
of the questions you ask about
Stanford: misgivings not about
your questions, but about the
replies I feel constrained to
give. "What's happening at Stan
ford?" you ask, "has the farm
really changed? Were our ef
forts worth anything?"
I wish I could know. Much
has changed in the last three
years, much is still changing:
yet the goals and ideals which
seemed so bright, if so distant
a few years ago, seem just as
distant and a good deal more
tarnished now.
Progress has come. The strug
gle against in loco parentis, or
if you prefer, the struggle for
personal freedom, which found
such effective champions in Ar
min Rosencrantz, Bud Wedin,
and Ilene Strelitz, to name a
few, has met with considerable
success. Liquor policy, the issue
which really lit the fuse, has
been changed to allow liquor on
campus; freedom of religion has
been secured, some 180 years
after the Bill of Rights.
Social Regs
And remember the big fight
over women's social regulations
and how we thought the student
leaders had sold out when they
agreed to go along with modifi
cations in the regs instead of
insisting on complete elimin
ation? Well, they were right
when they said, "we'll take
what we can get now and the
pest will come later."
Interestingly enough, when
rules were liberalized to the
point that they didn't restrict
anyone, the girls simply quit
playing the game. But the final
solution is very much tied up
jlri another controversy: allow
ing women to live off campus.
This one's still bubbling; in fact,
the issue is in a strikingly an
alogous position to the liquor
question five springs ago.
The change is overwhelmingly

supported by the students, the
faculty and most of the lower
administrators. But the final de
cision is up to Wally and the
Board of Trustees, and Jane
only knows what they'll do. Sim
ilarly for open house hours.
Proposed liberalization needs
only the stamp of the B of T's.
Auntie Lucy
That blackguard in loco par
entis, seems indeed, to be on the
run, and the last reminants of
Auntie Lucy's Finishing School
appear about ready to drop into
San Franciscito Creek. Never
theless, I have the disturbing
impression that although the
rules within the framework
have been greatly changed, the
framework itself is still intact.
The question that must still
be settled is not "why have
this policy," but "why change
this policy." Changes in the past
have in fact, required persua
tion on these lines.
And I think student pressure
has provided most of the im
petus for these changes. By
pressure, I mean vocal power,
for that's really about the only
power students have at Stan
ford. I maintain, in fact, that
students have been the dynamic
element in this university in the
past half-decade. This is not to
say they have proposed all the
changes or all the ideas for
change, but they have provided
the "creative tension" appar
ently required for progress.
Voltage
If students have not supplied
all the current, they, at least,
have accounted for the voltage.
By refusing to allow issues of
concern to the community to
be pigeonholed or shoved aside,
by continuing to raise questions
and arguments until the rest of
the community began to listen,
students, and I refer primarily
to those two or three hundred
so-called activists, have played
a key role in accomplishing

whatever has been accomplished
on the Farm.
But where from here? This is
the important question; and
equally valid, how do we go?
I can't avoid noting striking
parallels between the situation
of Stanford students, and that of
the American Negroes.
Both groups have experienced
striking improvements in their
treatment and rights recently,
yet both are imbittered and dis
illusioned to an unprecedented
degree. Both resent that what
they consider rightfully theirs
has been very magnanimously
given to them, and both have
begun to entertain serious
doubts concerning the motives
of those in power.
Let me illustrate with a cur
rent controversy at Stanford.
There was recently set in mo
tion a major review of the "in
stitution, under the guise of a
study of education. Students
have been given (a key point)
an unprecedented part in this
review. For essentially the first
time, students are participating
as full members, as equals, in a
study of this import.
This opportunity, one might
think, would have been wel
comed by the students, but no,
in fact, there arose an angry
and indeed bitter controversy
over the selection of the stu
dents.
Students, like the Negroes,
are becoming increasingly
aware that they have little or
no genuine power, and increas
ingly, they resent the fact. I
might add, the reaction of the
various university officials has
been not unlike that of the
white liberals: astonishment
and not a little anger.
And this, I think, is the pres
ent situation: a paradox for
which I see no easy solution. To
come back then to your ques
tion: Has Stanford changed?
Yes. For the better? I wish I
knew. J. BRISCOE

study of this import.
This opportunity, one might
think, would have been wel
comed by the students, but no,
in fact, there arose an angry
and indeed bitter controversy
over the selection of the stu
dents.
Students, like the Negroes,
are becoming increasingly
aware that they have little or
no genuine power, and increas
ingly, they resent the fact. I
might add, the reaction of the
various university officials has
been not unlike that of the
white liberals: astonishment
and not a little anger.
And this, I think, is the pres
ent situation: a paradox for
which I see no easy solution. To
come back then to your ques
tion: Has Stanford changed?
Yes. For the better? I wish I
knew. J. BRISCOE
Dear ,
It's not without misgivings
that I sit down to answer some
of the questions you ask about
Stanford: misgivings not about
your questions, but about the
replies I feel constrained to
give. "What's happening at Stan
ford?" you ask, "has the farm
really changed? Were our ef
forts worth anything?"
I wish I could know. Much
has changed in the last three
years, much is still changing:
yet the goals and ideals which
seemed so bright, if so distant
a few years ago, seem just as
distant and a good deal more
tarnished now.
Progress has come. The strug
gle against in loco parentis, or
if you prefer, the struggle for
personal freedom, which found
such effective champions in Ar
min Rosencrantz, Bud Wedin,
and Ilene Strelitz, to name a
few, has met with considerable
success. Liquor policy, the issue
which really lit the fuse, has
been changed to allow liquor on
campus; freedom of religion has
been secured, some 180 years
after the Bill of Rights.
Social Regs
And remember the big fight
over women's social regulations
and how we thought the student
leaders had sold out when they
agreed to go along with modifi
cations in the regs instead of
insisting on complete elimin
ation? Well, they were right
when they said, "we'll take
what we can get now and the
pest will come later."
Interestingly enough, when
rules were liberalized to the
point that they didn't restrict
anyone, the girls simply quit
playing the game. But the final
solution is very much tied up
jlri another controversy: allow
ing women to live off campus.
This one's still bubbling; in fact,
the issue is in a strikingly an
alogous position to the liquor
question five springs ago.
The change is overwhelmingly

supported by the students, the
faculty and most of the lower
administrators. But the final de
cision is up to Wally and the
Board of Trustees, and Jane
only knows what they'll do. Sim
ilarly for open house hours.
Proposed liberalization needs
only the stamp of the B of T's.
Auntie Lucy
That blackguard in loco par
entis, seems indeed, to be on the
run, and the last reminants of
Auntie Lucy's Finishing School
appear about ready to drop into
San Franciscito Creek. Never
theless, I have the disturbing
impression that although the
rules within the framework
have been greatly changed, the
framework itself is still intact.
The question that must still
be settled is not "why have
this policy," but "why change
this policy." Changes in the past
have in fact, required persua
tion on these lines.
And I think student pressure
has provided most of the im
petus for these changes. By
pressure, I mean vocal power,
for that's really about the only
power students have at Stan
ford. I maintain, in fact, that
students have been the dynamic
element in this university in the
past half-decade. This is not to
say they have proposed all the
changes or all the ideas for
change, but they have provided
the "creative tension" appar
ently required for progress.
Voltage
If students have not supplied
all the current, they, at least,
have accounted for the voltage.
By refusing to allow issues of
concern to the community to
be pigeonholed or shoved aside,
by continuing to raise questions
and arguments until the rest of
the community began to listen,
students, and I refer primarily
to those two or three hundred
so-called activists, have played
a key role in accomplishing

whatever has been accomplished
on the Farm.
But where from here? This is
the important question; and
equally valid, how do we go?
I can't avoid noting striking
parallels between the situation
of Stanford students, and that of
the American Negroes.
Both groups have experienced
striking improvements in their
treatment and rights recently,
yet both are imbittered and dis
illusioned to an unprecedented
degree. Both resent that what
they consider rightfully theirs
has been very magnanimously
given to them, and both have
begun to entertain serious
doubts concerning the motives
of those in power.
Let me illustrate with a cur
rent controversy at Stanford.
There was recently set in mo
tion a major review of the "in
stitution, under the guise of a
study of education. Students
have been given (a key point)
an unprecedented part in this
review. For essentially the first
time, students are participating
as full members, as equals, in a
study of this import.
This opportunity, one might
think, would have been wel

of Stanford students, and that of
the American Negroes.
Both groups have experienced
striking improvements in their
treatment and rights recently,
yet both are imbittered and dis
illusioned to an unprecedented
degree. Both resent that what
they consider rightfully theirs
has been very magnanimously
given to them, and both have
begun to entertain serious
doubts concerning the motives
of those in power.
Let me illustrate with a cur
rent controversy at Stanford.
There was recently set in mo
tion a major review of the "in
stitution, under the guise of a
study of education. Students
have been given (a key point)
an unprecedented part in this
review. For essentially the first
time, students are participating
as full members, as equals, in a
study of this import.
This opportunity, one might
think, would have been wel
comed by the students, but no,
in fact, there arose an angry
and indeed bitter controversy
over the selection of the stu
dents.
Students, like the Negroes,
are becoming increasingly
aware that they have little or
no genuine power, and increas
ingly, they resent the fact. I
might add, the reaction of the
various university officials has
been not unlike that of the
white liberals: astonishment
and not a little anger.
And this, I think, is the pres
ent situation: a paradox for
which I see no easy solution. To
come back then to your ques
tion: Has Stanford changed?
Yes. For the better? I wish I
knew. J. BRISCOE
Dear ,
It's not without misgivings
that I sit down to answer some
of the questions you ask about
Stanford: misgivings not about
your questions, but about the
replies I feel constrained to
give. "What's happening at Stan
ford?" you ask, "has the farm
really changed? Were our ef
forts worth anything?"
I wish I could know. Much
has changed in the last three
years, much is still changing:
yet the goals and ideals which
seemed so bright, if so distant
a few years ago, seem just as
distant and a good deal more
tarnished now.
Progress has come. The strug
gle against in loco parentis, or
if you prefer, the struggle for
personal freedom, which found
such effective champions in Ar
min Rosencrantz, Bud Wedin,
and Ilene Strelitz, to name a
few, has met with considerable
success. Liquor policy, the issue
which really lit the fuse, has
been changed to allow liquor on
campus; freedom of religion has
been secured, some 180 years
after the Bill of Rights.
Social Regs
And remember the big fight
over women's social regulations
and how we thought the student
leaders had sold out when they
agreed to go along with modifi
cations in the regs instead of
insisting on complete elimin
ation? Well, they were right
when they said, "we'll take
what we can get now and the
pest will come later."
Interestingly enough, when
rules were liberalized to the
point that they didn't restrict
anyone, the girls simply quit
playing the game. But the final
solution is very much tied up
jlri another controversy: allow
ing women to live off campus.
This one's still bubbling; in fact,
the issue is in a strikingly an
alogous position to the liquor
question five springs ago.
The change is overwhelmingly

supported by the students, the
faculty and most of the lower
administrators. But the final de
cision is up to Wally and the
Board of Trustees, and Jane
only knows what they'll do. Sim
ilarly for open house hours.
Proposed liberalization needs
only the stamp of the B of T's.
Auntie Lucy
That blackguard in loco par
entis, seems indeed, to be on the
run, and the last reminants of
Auntie Lucy's Finishing School
appear about ready to drop into
San Franciscito Creek. Never
theless, I have the disturbing
impression that although the
rules within the framework
have been greatly changed, the
framework itself is still intact.
The question that must still
be settled is not "why have
this policy," but "why change
this policy." Changes in the past
have in fact, required persua
tion on these lines.
And I think student pressure
has provided most of the im
petus for these changes. By
pressure, I mean vocal power,
for that's really about the only
power students have at Stan
ford. I maintain, in fact, that
students have been the dynamic
element in this university in the
past half-decade. This is not to
say they have proposed all the
changes or all the ideas for
change, but they have provided
the "creative tension" appar
ently required for progress.
Voltage
If students have not supplied
all the current, they, at least,
have accounted for the voltage.
By refusing to allow issues of
concern to the community to
be pigeonholed or shoved aside,
by continuing to raise questions
and arguments until the rest of
the community began to listen,
students, and I refer primarily
to those two or three hundred
so-called activists, have played
a key role in accomplishing

whatever has been accomplished
on the Farm.
But where from here? This is
the important question; and
equally valid, how do we go?
