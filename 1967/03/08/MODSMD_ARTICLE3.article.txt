# Protestors Urged To Sign List
## 
### MARTHA HUMPHREY 
Those who took part in the protest
action following Vice President Hu
bert Humphrey's. February 20 speech
in Memorial Auditorium are being
asked to identify themselves as "a
matter of conscience" by signing a
statement posted in the Experiment
building.
The statement declares "We the
undersigned participated in 'what
really happened' following the Vice
President's speech in Memorial Audi
torium . . . We stand by what we did
and we would do it again."
This is in reply to a letter sent by
President Wallace Sterling Monday
to all members of the Stanford com
munity regarding the protest demon
stration against Humphrey. Sterling
alluded to the possibility of disciplin
ary action being taken against those
participating.
"We want to let the people who
took part to be able to declare them
selves that they participated, and that
they saw it as an act of good faith,"
said Janet Howell, an originator of
the statement. "We aren't coercing
anyone to sign it. It's a matter of
conscience."
Miss Howell sees this as a declara
tion against possible intimidation for
a student's political opinions on the
war. It will also furnish evidence that
the participants can not be accused
of apathetic acceptance of Sterling's
letter, she said.
