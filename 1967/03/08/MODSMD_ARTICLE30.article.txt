# Reply To Ripley: A Call For Candor

(Editor's Note: The following is
ail open letter to Prof. Julian
Ripley)
Dear Prof. Ripley:
I should like to comment on
your open letter to the Vice-
President. I too went to Memo
rial Auditorium to hear the
Vice-President. I too wrote a let
ter to Mr. Humphrey, in which
I expressed disappointment that
he had failed to answer over
half the questions put to him.
I did not participate in the walk
out, although I have been op
posed to U.S. policy on Vietnam
since February 1965. I disagree
with your analysis that Hum
phrey's "showmanship is artis
tic." After reading Robert Ken
nedy's Senate speech of March 2
and listening to Senator Mark
Hatfield in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium, I am sure you must agree
with me that the Vice-President
gave a bad performance indeed.
Along with Senator Hatfield,
I am disturbed by the prevalent
attitude of liberals which you
have expressed in your letter.
You tell Humphrey "it would be
folly to expect you to change
your convictions." You say you
"walked out to emphasize our
disapproval." I suspect you were
also attempting to absolve your
self of responsibility for our dis
astrous foreign policy. I agree
that those who remain silent
are responsible. Any action or
inaction which does nothing to
improve our national policy is
equally responsible. Good inten
tions are not enough. We are
all responsible for the actions
of our government. History will
judge us by the results of our
efforts. If the academic commu
nity becomes hysterical, it will
drive the majority of the voters
into the camp of the war hawks.
"The vehement division of opin
ion in this community" renders
it impotent to contribute con
structively to national policy.
The "shame and the dismay
and anger" which you express is
quite understandable, but only
a dispassionate discussion of na
tional politics can lead to ef
fective action by this commu
nity. Any attempt to work out
side the constitutional system in
order to achieve peace in Viet
nam is doomed to failure. Any
attempt to set up a political op
position outside the two major
political parties would be coun
terproductive.
President Kennedy's great con
tribution to foreign policy was
to deal with other countries re
spectfully, on the basis of mu
tual interest, rather than to try
to make everyone conform to
our own views. This same prin
ciple must be applied to domes
tic politics. Most of our national
leaders, including President
Johnson, do want peace in Viet
nam. They also want to remain

in office, they want respect and
dignity, they want the approval
of history. We must convince
them that continued lack of can
dor will not, bring them resp?ct,
and may cost them their jobs.
We must convince them that
continued escalation is not in
t. i? best interests of the United
States. We must convince them
that negotiations will enhance
their prestige.
President Johnson consistent
ly tries to undercut political op
position either by discrediting it
or by stealing the proposals of
the opposition. We must avoid
actions which will discredit us
and our proposals. Whether or
not you believe that unilateral
withdrawal would be morally
preferable, you must realize that
such a proposal would strength
en the political position of the
war hawks, since the common
man would never accept what
he would regard as surrender.
We must continue to urge nego
tiations. If the President chooses
to negotiate in good faith, we
should rejoice. If he does not,
we should educate the people as
to the facts and try to replace
the President in 1968. In either
case, our best hope is to support
such liberal leaders as Robert
Kennedy, Frank Church, Jacob
Javits and Mark Hatfield.
I am asking my friends to
sign two open letters, one to
Robert Kennedy, the other to
Mark Hatfield, expressing sup
port for their speeches of March
2 and March 6, respectively. I
invite you and your friends to
sign these letters, which I in
tend to send not only to these
two senators but also to the
President and to the two Cali
fornia senators.
Sincerely,
BURWELL GOODE
