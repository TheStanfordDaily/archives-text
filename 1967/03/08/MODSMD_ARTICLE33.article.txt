## Lack Of Debate Not Fault Of 'Mob' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
i I am answering President
Sterling's letter of March 3 out
of a deep concern for the pres
ervation of free and civilized
debate both on the Stanford
campus and in the United
States. Every member of this
community has not only the
right but the duty to be seri
ously disturbed about the war
in Vietnam which it is support
ing.
Free and civilized debate

about this issue cannot take
place here or anywhere else in
the United States unless the
facts regarding what our gov
ernment is doing and what it
has done in Vietnam are recog
nized by both sides in any ques
tions of judgment or value.
There are so many documented
cases where our government has
systematically distorted or falsi
fied the facts that the existence
of a credibility gap is generally
recognized.

The person who occupies the
second highest position in the
executive branch of our govern
ment, a former professor of po
litical science, confronted our
intellectual community as an un
compromising propagandist for
government policy rather than
as an intellectual.
I ask you, President Sterling,
if an intellectual community
can be reduced to the position
of listening to propaganda from
a former professor of po)ideal

science, what are the chances
for free and open discussion
about this important issue in the
"non-intellectual" community in
the United States? How can you
place the responsibility for an
atmosphere not conducive to
fair and free discussion on a
group of students who acted af
ter the Humphrey speech in
view of the following two facts:
1. The Secret Service asked
your offiice not to permit the
two students wearing white
armbands to sit on the panel.
2. When a member of the panel
attempted to come back with a
question to which he had re
ceived an evasive answer, his
microphone was shut off. Is it
really surprising to you that
some members of this commu
nity responded in a manner in
appropriate to free and civilized
debate to one who behaved in
a manner inappropriate to an
intellectual community? Do you
think that disciplinary "action"
treats the symptoms or the
causes?

• Equivocation
Editor, The Daily:
I must really be naive. For
some reason I interpreted Pres
ident Sterling's apology to Vice
President Humphrey as an in
dication that President Sterling
had, in one way or another,
taken part in the demonstration.
Yesterday, when I, like every
other member of the Stanford
community except the fabled
non-students, received the form
letter from President Sterling
I was really shocked. My image
of J. E. Wallace Sterling as the
epitome of the University's role
as a critic of society was shat
tered.
The Humphrey protest has
been condemned as violent. As
a pacifist firmly committed to
non-violence, and as a partici
pant in the demonstration, I say
that this is not so. The "mob"
was no more violent than a foot
ball crowd. It was infinitely less
violent than a football crowd.
It was infinitely less violent
than what might be term
ed an "insignificant skirm
ish" in Vietnam. To speculate

what might have happened un
der a particular conjunction of
Andromeda, Venus, and Mrs.
Stanford is ridiculous.
Don't get me wrong. I do
agree with President Sterling.
Violence has no place in the
University community. (I actual
ly go a dangerous step further;
I content that violence has no
place anywhere.) Yet I do not
see how he can claim to be half
serious in his statements, when
the University he runs has
thrown its resources (the Stan
ford Research Institute, the Mil
itary Industrial Park, etc.)
squarely behind both the arms
race and Johnson's war.

• All Wet?
Editor, The Daily:
With regard to Vice Presi
dent Humphrey's allegations
about student (oops, I meant
"non-student") activities in con
nection with his infamous exit
from Memorial Auditorium, I
find it very hard to believe that
anyone, even the most militant
anti-war activist, would ever
conceive of saving up his urine
in order to throw it on a cop.
Such a charge should not go un
substantiated. Will the doused
policeman please stand up? Or,
perhaps, it was Vice President
Humphrey himself who was all
wet.

• FF/io's Rude?
Editor, The Dally:
"This is downright immoral.
How can he get away with it?"
"He was really rude. He didn't
even stay to listen to our accusa
tions. I was standing there with
my sign and shouting at him,
and he and his guards brushed
right past me."
"One of those guys pushed me
when I was standing in front of
his car as it was pulling out."
"Yeah. When the Vice Presi
dent of the country is that rude,
you can really tell the United
States is going to the dogs."
