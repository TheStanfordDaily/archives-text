# New Pro-War Group Joins Armband Fray
## 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
"We have the greatest respect for
those who wear white armbands. Yet
. . . we feel it's time we made our
presence known also." With that state
ment, Bob Crowe, head of a newly
formed group of undegraduates, be
gan to explain the latest response to
Vietnam protests.
Crowe plans to distribute black
armbands on Wednesdays in White
Memorial Plaza. The armbands he
said are not to be worn as a protest
but rather as an agreement with the
war.
"We are not fanatics. We simply
believe in the principle that something
must be done," said Crowe.
Image Improvement
By wearing the black armbands to
day they hope to assert both their
presence and their beliefs. They hope
also to improve what Crowe calls the
"tainted" image Stanford has re
ceived as a result of Vice President
Humhprey's visit.
The group was formed last Tues
day, the same day that another ad hoc
committee came out with a proposal
to distribute white armbands to pro
test the Administration's handling of
the war.
Crowe said he felt the administra
tion was carrying on the war in the
best way possible at the present time.
He felt it was of paramount impor
tance to demonstrate that not the en
tire university was against the war.
'Pro-Freedom'
"We are not pro-death but rather
pro-freedom," Crowe said. He feels
it was necessary for our government
to be in Vietnam, fighting for the
freedom of the South Vietnamese as
well as American freedom.
Doug Phillips, a co-sponsor of the
group, stressed the detrimental effect
of the white armbands on the morale
of those fighting the war. Acts similar
to this encourage the enemy, he said.
It is strongely felt by the group that
the troops in Vietnam must ge given
the general support of the popula
tion.
"We feel, as do those who wish for
withdrawal, that the time has come
when silence is betrayal. Wo are dedi
cated to answer constructively what
we believe to be the harmful effects
of the white armbands.
Crowe stated that the political views

of the group are not united. The par
ticipants, he said, are sympathetic
with the war in general, rather than
with specific acts.
Fie hopes that his actions will "make
those who have so far disregarded
the issue or evaded it, come to a de
cision. We want to bring the issue to
a point, we want to force an evalua
tion of the issues. We want people
to re-evaluate their commitment to
United States government."
