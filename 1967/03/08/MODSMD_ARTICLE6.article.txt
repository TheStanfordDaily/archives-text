### ROBERT E. STONE 
Nikolai Fedorenko, Soviet Ambas
sador to the United Nations, told an
overflow audience in Dinkelspiel yes
terday,"The good fruit of peaceful
cooperation cannot be grown on
poisonous soil, it can be raised only
on the ground of peaceful co-exist
ence."
Citing co-existence as the only al
ternative to war, he stated, "We have
repeatedly declared that we are pre
pared to develop our relations with
the U.S. But for these relations to
develop the United States must drop
its policy of escalation and interna
tional tension."
Denying that he was a professional
diplomat, Fedorenko opened his ad
dress by acknowledging that both the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. have their own
places in the system of world rela
tions. "It is quite natural,' 'he said,
"that there are differences in our ap
proach to many problems, different
ideas of the methods of overcoming
international complications and
crises."
Non-interference
The ambassador then turned to
some of the areas in which Russia
and the United States have different
opinions. One of these areas was the
principle of non-interference in the
domestic affairs of states. He com
mented that the principle was ex
pressed in words, but asked, "What
happens in reality?"
Answering his own question Fedor
enko said, "The conflict in Vietnam is
the most striking example of the vio
lation of the U.N. declaration on non
interference."
The policy of peaceful co-existence
"signifies the repudiation of war as
a means of solving controversial is
sues," Fedorenko said. "However,
this does not cover the entire con
cept of peaceful co-existence. Apart
from the commitment to non-aggres
sion, it also presupposes an obliga
tion on the part of all states to desist
from violating each other's territorial
integrity and sovereignty in any form
and under any pretext whatsoever."
On Vietnam
Fedorenko said that he did not see
that South Vietnam was essential
to the safety of "vital American in

terests." But, by so declaring, he went
on, "one can declare any part of the
Earth, any island or continent, a
sphere of one's own interests." The
ambassador quoted Secretary General
U Thant: "If Vietnam is independent
and militarily non-aligned, . . . then
I do not see how this could pose a
threat to international peace."
Fedorenko made it clear that as far
as Russia is concerned "the first step
toward the solution of the Viet
namese problem must be the uncondi
tional discontinuance of American air
raids and other aggressive acts
against North Vietnam."
On China
Realizing that his audience was con
cerned by the Sino-Soviet split, Fedor
enko tried to explain the current
trend in that area. "I must say that
we deeply esteem the great Chinese

people, the Communist Party of
China. But, the so-called 'cultural
revolution' has nothing to do whatso
ever with culture, revolution or social
ism."
Fedorenko drew a bleak picture.
"Everything shows that [Mao] is pre
paring the Chinese People's Republic
for further adventuristic actions in
the field of both domestic and foreign
policy, not excluding also new provo
cations against the Soviet Union."
Following the address a student
asked, "What would the Soviet Union
do if U.S. bombers began to bomb
China?"
The ambassador urged his audi
ence: "Be cool. Please turn your at
tention in another directionâ€”south
of the border of China. Try to stop
the real war, killing people, the bomb
ings."
