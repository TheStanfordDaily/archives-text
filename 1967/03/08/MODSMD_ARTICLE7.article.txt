# Candidates Initiate Campaigns In Vice Presidential Contest
## 
### 
To gain a general picture of the
various campaigns for ASSU Vice
President, The Daily yesterday at
tempted to contact each of the candi
dates for brief comments on steps
being taken before the primary elec
tions.
Contestants for the office include:
Joseph Reich (Junior, El Capitan);
Bob Arnon (Senior, Beta Theta Pi);
Bill Stone (Senior, Theta Chi); Vic
toria Bowles (Sophomore, Cardenal);
John Trimbur (Junior, Wilbur Spon
sor); Fcrrest Church (Freshman,
Trancos); and Steve Schechter (Grad
uate, Engineering).
Poor Timing
Bob Arnon voiced a complaint com
mon to several of the candidates, that
the timing of the election was most
unfortunate. Because of the especially
heavy work load immediately prior
to Dead Week, he has been forced
to rely on literature distributed
around campus containing his plat
form and views on specific issues and
word-of-mouth support by by ac
quaintances in "most living groups
on campus."

Despite this, Arnon stated that he
felt his "position must be available
to the community as an alternative to
impractical, unrealistic methods of
implementing educational reform."
Steve Schechter has found himsell
faced with a problem similar to Ar
non's The combination of a heavy
workload plus what he considers an
insufficient time lapse between the
announcement of the election and the
actual voting has allowed for no for
mal campaign on his part.
Although John Trimbur could not
be reached for comment, The Daily
has learned that he has been officially
endorsed by both Michael Collins and
Dave Harris, the present and the re
cently-resigned presidents of the
ASSU.
The other four candidates could not
be reached for comment.
Tomorrow's Daily will present a
closer look at each candidate, with
special emphasis upon individual
platforms.
The Vice Presidential candidates
will hold a debate in White Memorial
Plaza at noon today.
