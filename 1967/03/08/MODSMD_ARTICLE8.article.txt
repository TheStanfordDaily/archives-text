# Editors Attack U.S. Power Policy
## 
### 
Suicide through power, the nuclear
stalemate, and the shock proof gen
eration were subjects of extreme con
cern for editors Norman Cousins and
Erwin Canham yesterday. After a
combined press-conference, both men
gave separate addresses.
"The United States doesn't recog
nize that it is threatening to commit
suicide everytime it talks about "pol
icy by power," said Cousins, editor of
the Saturday Review, at the confer
ence.
Cousins suggested that the U.S. find
some means "other than military
power" to promote world peace.
Two World Problem
Cousins said that the problem of
Vietnam is cast into "two worlds",
composed of the government's real in
tentions and strategy and a "cover" to
make its policy palatable.
"The two don't always coincide", he
said, adding that the administration
cannot "indifferently carry out one
policy while professing another."
Canham, editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, called the administra
tion's handling of information on
Vietnam Policy and strategy "relativ
ely poor" but commended the Ameri
can press for its handling of Vietnam
news.
Military' Not Enough
Citing the "pull out" position of the
"doves" as not feasible, Canham de
fended the presence of the U.S. troops
in Vietnam. However, he agreed with
Cousins that military power alone is
not the solution.

Also agreeing that American mili
tary action has not brought about its
stated objectives, Canham said that
this "relative ineffectiveness" does
not create a general lack of confidence
in the United States but rather "as
sures the world that solutions other
than military power must be sought."
Nuclear Stalemate
Last night, speaking before a capac
ity audience in Dinkelspiel, Canham
asserted, "a nuclear power stalemate
is the balance of power between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Both powers possess what he re
ferred to as "Second Strike Capabil
ity." The condition arises because each
side has the power to retaliate to an
attack with equal crushing force. This
polarity, Canham believes, will re
raim "indefinitely."
The major U.S. problem, he stated,
is a restoration of "moral leadership"
by efforts to solve the Vietnam prob
lem and the domestic issue of race
relations.
Canham placed important stress on
America's heritage, a heritage which

is "revolutionary, not reactionary," as
a guide to solutions of problems and
attainment of social and moral goals.
Shock Proof Generation
Yesterday morning, Cousins, who is
staying here as a guest-in-residence
of Wilbur Hall, spoke to Western
Civilization classes in Memorial Audi
torium.
"We have adjusted to things we
have no right to adjust ourselves to,"
he stated.
Because of this ability to adjust to
and accept any situation, Cousins
labelled people today as being mem
bers of the "Shock Proof Generation."
Although faced with such threats as
atomic bombs, germ warfare, and
poison gasses, "We take these things
in stride."
Continuing to point out the flaws
in today's society, Cousins spoke of
the "unhappy and tragic character
istic" that "as we have gone up in
order of power, we have gone down
in order of control." He meant that
accidents from power improperly con
trolled are more likely because re
sponsible men are farther from con
trol.
Cousins concluded that as the world
operates today, national sovereignty
leads to world anarchy because no one
in a position of responsibility is look
ing out for the "total welfare and
safety" of the world. "We have not
made the sustaining of civilization the
concern of anyone "
