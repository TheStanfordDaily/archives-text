# Consul Pact 'Premature,' Says Hoover Authority
## 
### 
A scholar from Stanford's
Hoovfi Institution on War,
i Revolution, and Peace testified
before the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee recently that
•i the proposed consular treaty
with the Soviet Union is "clear
\ ly premature."
« Richard V. Allen, 31, a senior
•o staff member at the institute,
justified his statement by cau
tioning the Senate policy
that "when we speak
of the 'dialogue' with the com
munist world, we should keep
♦in mind that the communists,
" including the Soviet Union, have
one language for the industrial
ized West and another for the
3 rest of the world."
Allen continued, "I believe
d that sterile 'anti-communism' as

a goal itself has impeded out
comprehension of the overall
communist challenge."
"But opposition to commu
nism," he added, "which is
sometimes unfortunately equat
ed with 'anti-communism', is, in
my opinion, completely justi
fied on the basis of our histor
ical experience, including that
of the present day.
"The record shows that the
Soviet Union does not enter
into agreements such as this
one before the committee, on
the basis of good faith."
Allen concluded, "it is certain
ly true that the form of the
Soviet threat to the U.S. and,
for that matter, to Western
Europe, has changed. But it is
an error to say that its nature
has changed."
Allen also cited the rise in
numbers of communists, which
now number 50 million in 90
parties. "In the past ten years,
the communist nnovement has
undergone a degree of consoli
dation, and the emphasis has
shifted to the underdeveloped
world.
"The available evidence shows
that the Soviet Union is making
a substantial commitment in
Latin America through the
Havana based 'Tri-Continental
Movement.' That commitment is
a broad based revolutionary
struggle, including armed strug
gle."
The Foreign Relations Com
mittee later approved the treaty
by a wide margin. Senate ap
proval is expected within a few
days.
