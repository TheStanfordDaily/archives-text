# A 						Phi O Schedules Spring Book Sale
## 
### 
A Phi O National Service Fra
ternity will sponsor a book ex
change during registration
week next quarter. The sale, to
be held in the old Western Civ
Library Building, offers a way
for students to sell used books
other than through the book
store or through a national used
book buyer.
The sale will be held April
4-9; from 1-5 p.m. Tuesday
through Friday, and from 1
a.m.-3 p.m. on Saturday. Each
seller records the price of a
book on a ticket, half of which
is put in the book and the other
half which serves as a receipt.
The book is then put on sale.
A ten cent fee is collected by
A Phi O for each book offered
for sale.
Currently the book store pays

half price for used books in
good condition. Used book buy
ers pay one-fourth or less of the
original price. Used books resold
by the bookstore are priced at
three-fourths of the new book
price, and the selection is
usually limited.
