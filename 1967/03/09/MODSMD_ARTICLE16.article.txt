## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
John Trlmbur's platform in
cludes "as many reforms as
possible" in the hope that he
will elicit a response to propos
als for changes within the Stan
ford community.
In an interview yesterday,
Trimbur elaborated on several
of his platform points which in
clude off-campus housing for
women, an end to In loco par
entis, one-to-one ratio of men to
women, integrated and coeduca
tional residences, and open
meetings of all University com
mittees.
Co-chairman of the ASSU
housing Commission report,
Trimbur feels that it is "up to
the administration to implement
the decision of the Commis
sion." He pointed to the appar
ent success of the Grove pro
ject as a favorable basis for
more coeducational residences
and implementation of the Wil
bur Experiment.
'Hypocrisy'
Regarding the fraternity sub
committee's report, he said that
the purpose was to make it a
"critique" of the system as a
whole and to show the "hypo
crisy of the administration to
ward fraternity activities." He
explained that the University
has been aware of incidents of
violation of state law, but in as
suming its parental role, has
often refused to take disciplin
ary action against students.
"Actually, the main fault of the
fraternity system is that the
University has allowed such
violations to go on," he said.
Another Hotel
Trimbur said he was "glad"
that plans for construction of
the Moore and Jacks residences
have been delayed, in the hope
that the administration will be
able to consider the suggestions
of the Housing Commission be
fore planning the construction
of additional residences.
"There is no reason to set up
another hotel. We should take
time to find out the ultimate
goals of the residence university
and find what kind of programs

will implement this concept," he
said. "The fact that there was
no provision for faculty quar
ters and seminar rooms in
Moore shows that there was a
lack of concern for integrating
residence living and education,"
he added.
Sterling's Letter
Trimbur commented on the
reaction to events surrounding
Vice President Humphrey's rec
ent visit and called President
Sterling's letter to the Stanford
community "an ultimatum, al
most a threat. I share Presi
dent Sterling's concern for free
and civilized debate, but his let
ter didn't open itself up to de
bate," he said.
Trimbur also calls for the dis
missal of Robert A. Walker
from his administrative capaci
ties, stressing students' general
"dissatisfaction with his de
cisions and the way he makes
them."
Cocktail Conversation
Concerning "student power,"
Trimbur feels that students
should have more say in determ
ining curriculum as well as resi
dence policies. He supports a
thorough study of the General
Studies program by the Packer
Committee, adding that it
should be determined "whether
students are getting no more
than cocktail conversation
knowledge in a number of areas
or if they are really being lib
erally educated."
He suggested that student
voice in such areas as determin
ation of curricula "be estab
lished on the basis of who is
concerned with what topic." For
example, graduate students
rather than undergraduates
would be involved m decisions
concerning growth and pro
grams in graduate areas. He
added that there is some ques
tion as to whether money is go
ing into graduate schools at the
expense of the undergraduates,
and pointed with concern to the
"creeping professionalism"
which has extended beyond
graduate schools into the under
graduate sphere.

ties, stressing students' general
"dissatisfaction with his de
cisions and the way he makes
them."
Cocktail Conversation
Concerning "student power,"
Trimbur feels that students
should have more say in determ
ining curriculum as well as resi
dence policies. He supports a
thorough study of the General
Studies program by the Packer
Committee, adding that it
should be determined "whether
students are getting no more
than cocktail conversation
knowledge in a number of areas
or if they are really being lib
erally educated."
He suggested that student
voice in such areas as determin
ation of curricula "be estab
lished on the basis of who is
concerned with what topic." For
example, graduate students
rather than undergraduates
would be involved m decisions
concerning growth and pro
grams in graduate areas. He
added that there is some ques
tion as to whether money is go
ing into graduate schools at the
expense of the undergraduates,
and pointed with concern to the
"creeping professionalism"
which has extended beyond
graduate schools into the under
graduate sphere.
John Trlmbur's platform in
cludes "as many reforms as
possible" in the hope that he
will elicit a response to propos
als for changes within the Stan
ford community.
In an interview yesterday,
Trimbur elaborated on several
of his platform points which in
clude off-campus housing for
women, an end to In loco par
entis, one-to-one ratio of men to
women, integrated and coeduca
tional residences, and open
meetings of all University com
mittees.
Co-chairman of the ASSU
housing Commission report,
Trimbur feels that it is "up to
the administration to implement
the decision of the Commis
sion." He pointed to the appar
ent success of the Grove pro
ject as a favorable basis for
more coeducational residences
and implementation of the Wil
bur Experiment.
'Hypocrisy'
Regarding the fraternity sub
committee's report, he said that
the purpose was to make it a
"critique" of the system as a
whole and to show the "hypo
crisy of the administration to
ward fraternity activities." He
explained that the University
has been aware of incidents of
violation of state law, but in as
suming its parental role, has
often refused to take disciplin
ary action against students.
"Actually, the main fault of the
fraternity system is that the
University has allowed such
violations to go on," he said.
Another Hotel
Trimbur said he was "glad"
that plans for construction of
the Moore and Jacks residences
have been delayed, in the hope
that the administration will be
able to consider the suggestions
of the Housing Commission be
fore planning the construction
of additional residences.
"There is no reason to set up
another hotel. We should take
time to find out the ultimate
goals of the residence university
and find what kind of programs

will implement this concept," he
said. "The fact that there was
no provision for faculty quar
ters and seminar rooms in
Moore shows that there was a
lack of concern for integrating
residence living and education,"
he added.
Sterling's Letter
Trimbur commented on the
reaction to events surrounding
Vice President Humphrey's rec
ent visit and called President
Sterling's letter to the Stanford
community "an ultimatum, al
most a threat. I share Presi
dent Sterling's concern for free
and civilized debate, but his let
ter didn't open itself up to de
bate," he said.
Trimbur also calls for the dis
missal of Robert A. Walker
from his administrative capaci
ties, stressing students' general
"dissatisfaction with his de
cisions and the way he makes
them."
