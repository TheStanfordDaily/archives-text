# Vice Presidential Candidates And Their Views...
## Arnon: Local Issues First, Rebuild Respect In ASSU 
### 
Bob Arnon, a senior member
of Beta Theta Pi, is running for
ASSU vice president because, he
says,"I don't think the entire
student body is being represent
ed." His platform, he adds, "must
be made available to the com
munity as an alternative to im
practical, unrealistic methods of
implementing educational re
form."
Arnon sees the role of the vice
president as a limited one, in
that it should not be used as
a platform for expressing views
on national politics. "A student
officer should restrict himself
to local issues. I think the vice
president should be working
on campus projects and concerns
of the students."
Specifically, Arnon proposes
several immediate considera
tions. Junior and senior women
should be able to move off cam
pus next quarter in limited num
bers as a pilot program. The
priority of building construc
tion on campus should be recon
sidered. Apartment facilities for
both men and women should be
built and the additions to Tresid
der Union should be constructed
as soon as possible with priority
given to the construction of a
coffee house and facilities for the
Experiment. The basement of
the UGLY should be converted
into a canteen and informal
gathering spot until the addi
tions to Tresidder are completed.
Speaking of former ASSU
President David Harris, Arnon
said, "He acknowledges that he's
no administrator. It was right
for him to bow out. Now we

have to pick up the pieces and
rebuild the community's confi
dence that student government
will be based on thoughtful con
siderations and give-and-take
with the administration."
And he added, "Those who
voted against Dave haven't been
represented. The people who are
not in power are still members
of the community. Their rights
and beliefs should be sought and
considered."
