# Reich: Eliminate Puppet Government
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Joseph Reich, a junior and a
member of El Capitan, is run
ning for ASSU vice president
as a protest against "puppet
government."
"I am running on a plank
against student government,"
Reich stated. He feels that the
existing student government is
ineffective and, moreover, harm
ful because it falsely claims to
represent the students.
"Anything, including nothing,
is better than having false rep
resentation," Reich commented.
He believes that student gov
ernment today is based on "false
representation" because it is run
by the administration, not the
students, and because members
of LASSU do not represent the
students.
Elaborating on the first reas
son, Reich explained that he felt
student government as it oper
ates today is nothing but "an
arm of the administration." He
compared it to a company union,
set up by the administration,
which does nothing to change
the status quo.
LASSU Not Qualified
As for his claim that LASSU
members do not represent the
student body, Reich said, "The
only people who run are those
who have the time. People in
LASSU are generally not the
most qualified people in school."
Another problem Reich feels
that "student government pre
vent any effective organization
from forming. The Constitution
is made for inaction."

The only part of student gov
ernment which Reich thinks has
any power, "and then only to
hurt students," is the Judicial.
"The administration would rath
er have us pass judgment. And
if we don't, they will," he com
mented.
The only offices that are "a
true mandate, a choice of the
students," according to Reich,
are the presidency and vice
presidency of ASSU. But it is up
to the people in these position
to make their work effective.
Tacit Assumptions
"There has always been the
tacit assumption that the way
to get things done is to work
within the system," but this is
not so, Reich said. "You can
either choose to build an ef
fective organization or continue
to work within the Mickey
Mouse structure."
Reich also said that new ASSU
president Michael Collins "is
not learning by anyone's mis
takes." He feels that Collins will
continue to operate within the
present structure. Reich criti
cized this policy, saying, "To
work within the system is to
work for the system."
Other criticisms he made
concerned the student members
of the Committee of Fifteen,
whom "the student body cannot
hold responsible since we do not
know how they vote," and the
method of selection of students
for the Steering Committee.
Reich also opposes the univer
sity's policy of ranking male
students for the draft.

mented.
The only offices that are "a
true mandate, a choice of the
students," according to Reich,
are the presidency and vice
presidency of ASSU. But it is up
to the people in these position
to make their work effective.
Tacit Assumptions
"There has always been the
tacit assumption that the way
to get things done is to work
within the system," but this is
not so, Reich said. "You can
either choose to build an ef
fective organization or continue
to work within the Mickey
Mouse structure."
Reich also said that new ASSU
president Michael Collins "is
not learning by anyone's mis
takes." He feels that Collins will
continue to operate within the
present structure. Reich criti
cized this policy, saying, "To
work within the system is to
work for the system."
Other criticisms he made
concerned the student members
of the Committee of Fifteen,
whom "the student body cannot
hold responsible since we do not
know how they vote," and the
method of selection of students
for the Steering Committee.
Reich also opposes the univer
sity's policy of ranking male
students for the draft.
Joseph Reich, a junior and a
member of El Capitan, is run
ning for ASSU vice president
as a protest against "puppet
government."
"I am running on a plank
against student government,"
Reich stated. He feels that the
existing student government is
ineffective and, moreover, harm
ful because it falsely claims to
represent the students.
"Anything, including nothing,
is better than having false rep
resentation," Reich commented.
He believes that student gov
ernment today is based on "false
representation" because it is run
by the administration, not the
students, and because members
of LASSU do not represent the
students.
Elaborating on the first reas
son, Reich explained that he felt
student government as it oper
ates today is nothing but "an
arm of the administration." He
compared it to a company union,
set up by the administration,
which does nothing to change
the status quo.
LASSU Not Qualified
As for his claim that LASSU
members do not represent the
student body, Reich said, "The
only people who run are those
who have the time. People in
LASSU are generally not the
most qualified people in school."
Another problem Reich feels
that "student government pre
vent any effective organization
from forming. The Constitution
is made for inaction."

The only part of student gov
ernment which Reich thinks has
any power, "and then only to
hurt students," is the Judicial.
"The administration would rath
er have us pass judgment. And
if we don't, they will," he com
mented.
The only offices that are "a
true mandate, a choice of the
students," according to Reich,
are the presidency and vice
