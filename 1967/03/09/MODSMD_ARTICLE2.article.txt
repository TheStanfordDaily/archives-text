## $500,000 Endowment Still Untapped 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
In 1962 Mr. and Mrs. Carroll Roush
endowed a professorship in economics
with $500,000. No one has yet been ap
pointed.
The Winds of Freedom Foundation,
a right-wing alumni organization, at
tributes the Economics Department's
failure to fill the post to its hostility
toward conservative economic theory.
The Foundation cites the absence of
Stanford professors from the member
ship in the Mont Pelerin Society, an
honorary society for traditionalist
economists, and the idealogical imbal
ance of textbooks as evidence of liberal
bias.
In a Daily interview yesterday, Ed
ward Shaw, Executive Head of the Ec
onomics Department, said, "No quali
fied economist could accept a chair
that limited expression of his own be
liefs." When the money was made
available for the endowment an at
tempt was made to attract a qualified
economist, according to Shaw. When
it became apparent that the funds
hinged on the approval of the Winds
of Freedom, efforts to fill the chair
were suspended.
The Business School has considered

several candidates for the professor
ship, but no action has been taken to
appoint anyone. The future of the
$500,000 is uncertain at the present
time.
Shaw claims that those economists
sought for the appointment, including
Milton Friedman and Arthur Burns,
Economic Adviser to President Eisen
hower, declined the invitation to come
to Stanford for purely personal rea
sons. He dismissed the Foundations
charge that the Department was so
biased and intolerant that it would not
accept a conservative, as "absolutely
untrue."

Shaw contends that Stanford's Eco
nomics Department is actually con
sidered to the right of the main
stream of current economic thought
by other departments around the
country and that a rivalry has existed
between the University of Chicago
and Stanford for the services of sev
eral professors. The Winds of Free
dom had lauded Chicago for "surging
ahead in leadership by advocating the
proven road to real progress."
Reasons For Refusal
Morton D'Evelyn, President of the
Winds of Freedom, told the Daily
that Friedman had felt that he could

not work productively in the liberal
atmosphere of Stanford. While con
ceeding that "highly able and prom
ising young men have been on the
staff from time to time," the Founda
tion maintains that "such scholars
(refering to Friedman) are lacking
on the Stanford faculty only because
they are not really wanted by the
Economics Department.
Bulletin numbsr 2 of the Winds of
Freedom states it is ironic that corp
orations contribute to Stanford
"whose very Economics Department
does nothing to protect private owner
ship."

honorary society for traditionalist
economists, and the idealogical imbal
ance of textbooks as evidence of liberal
bias.
In a Daily interview yesterday, Ed
ward Shaw, Executive Head of the Ec
onomics Department, said, "No quali
fied economist could accept a chair
that limited expression of his own be
liefs." When the money was made
available for the endowment an at
tempt was made to attract a qualified
economist, according to Shaw. When
it became apparent that the funds
hinged on the approval of the Winds
of Freedom, efforts to fill the chair
were suspended.
The Business School has considered

several candidates for the professor
ship, but no action has been taken to
appoint anyone. The future of the
$500,000 is uncertain at the present
time.
Shaw claims that those economists
sought for the appointment, including
Milton Friedman and Arthur Burns,
Economic Adviser to President Eisen
hower, declined the invitation to come
to Stanford for purely personal rea
sons. He dismissed the Foundations
charge that the Department was so
biased and intolerant that it would not
accept a conservative, as "absolutely
untrue."

Shaw contends that Stanford's Eco
nomics Department is actually con
sidered to the right of the main
stream of current economic thought
by other departments around the
country and that a rivalry has existed
between the University of Chicago
and Stanford for the services of sev
eral professors. The Winds of Free
dom had lauded Chicago for "surging
ahead in leadership by advocating the
proven road to real progress."
Reasons For Refusal
Morton D'Evelyn, President of the
Winds of Freedom, told the Daily
that Friedman had felt that he could

not work productively in the liberal
atmosphere of Stanford. While con
ceeding that "highly able and prom
ising young men have been on the
staff from time to time," the Founda
tion maintains that "such scholars
(refering to Friedman) are lacking
on the Stanford faculty only because
they are not really wanted by the
Economics Department.
Bulletin numbsr 2 of the Winds of
Freedom states it is ironic that corp
orations contribute to Stanford
"whose very Economics Department
does nothing to protect private owner
ship."
In 1962 Mr. and Mrs. Carroll Roush
endowed a professorship in economics
with $500,000. No one has yet been ap
pointed.
The Winds of Freedom Foundation,
a right-wing alumni organization, at
tributes the Economics Department's
failure to fill the post to its hostility
toward conservative economic theory.
The Foundation cites the absence of
Stanford professors from the member
ship in the Mont Pelerin Society, an
honorary society for traditionalist
economists, and the idealogical imbal
ance of textbooks as evidence of liberal
bias.
