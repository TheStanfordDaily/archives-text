# Stone Asks End To ASSU 'In Group'
## 
### 
"The Associated Students must
cease to be an 'in-group' opera
tion," believes ASSU Vice-Presi
dential candidate Bill Stone. He
feels that he cannot support a
"student government role of
power plays, of browbeating, of
name calling."
Stone said in a prepared state
ment, "I find myself more able
to agree with many of David
Harris' ideas than with any of
his methods. I concede freely
that there are many things at
Stanford about which people are
deservedly unhappy, and that
these problems must be resolv
ed. Beyond this, however, I must
disagree."
Stone went on to recall his
experiences of last year as Stu
dent Financial Manager and said
that, "my experience has shown
that a rational pursuit of one's
goals, with reasoned discussion

and compromise, can be fruit
ful, and I suggest, more closely
approximates the idea of a com
munity than arrangements
which constantly place students
at odds with the University ad
ministration.
"Students certainly have a
place in decision-making at Stan
ford, but must conduct them
selves in a manner which legiti
matizes and reinforces their
their right to be involved," the
former Student Financial Man
ager continued. "Calling for the
ouster of a University officials
does not jibe with this pattern.
Nor does the refusal of the
ASSU to cooperate with Uni
versity committees strengthen
student demands to be heard.
Clearly the best interests of
the student body are not being
served.
"The seeking of student opin
ion about University affairs has

too-often been an afterthought.
But perhaps we have ourselves
partly to blame. The equal part
nership to which we aspire im
plices more tolerance, practical
ity, and responsibility than we
have been able to evidence in
the past two quarters.
"I think it is time that we
faced up to these demands.
"The Associated Students mus 4
cease to be an 'in group' opera
tion. All students must be as
sured that their student govern
ment actually belongs to them
â€”that it is able and willing tc
listen to them and to articulatf
their views to the community.
Students with grips, with ques
tions, with ideas must be rep
resented, not alienated.
"The other imyerative task
for the rest of 1966-67 is a com
munity-wide restroation of con
fidence.
"Our goal is a University

where demarcation of the stu
dent sector in decision-making
is minimized, where counterval
ing power in crisis situations
will be replaced by logic and
cooperation through ongoing
structures. Mutual trust is an
essential precondition for such
a system.
