# Church Stresses 'Key Issues'
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
"There is no way to solve the
limitless problems in two
months. For anything construc
tive to come out of the office,
emphasis must be on one or two
key issues."
Forrest Church stressed this
point yesterday. Church is the
first freshman in Stanford's
history to run for a student
body office.
"I see my running as a chance
for the freshmen to involve
themselves. I also see this as
a chance for the office of Vice-
President to form advisory stu
dent committees."
"Dave Harris has self-admit
tedly fulfilled his role. Now
is the time to de-emphasize talk
ing and stress action. As Vice-
President I would state my
goals and set up committees to
fulfill this task."
Must Cooperate
In reference to the Commit
tee for the Study of Education
at Stanford, Church said, "I
would like to see groups work
ing with the Packer Commit
tee on such problems as hous
ing and academics."

"We have voiced our objection
to the Packer Committee. How
ever, this study is so important
that we must work with them
or all our goals will be sacri
ficed."
Church's main emphasis in
terms of obtaining some pro
gress in the next two months
would be on freshman life at
Stanford and the Stanford ju
dicial system.
"Freshmen right now are in a
position to look back on their
first year here at Stanford. It is
truly unfortunate that the Pack
er Committee has only one
undergraduate member, and no
Freshman representation."
Freshman Committee
"I am in favor of setting up a
Freshman Committee made up
of undergraduates from which
the Packer Committee could
draw ideas on freshman hous
ing and the freshman academic
year."
In relation to freshman prob
lems, Church added, "I would
be in favor of setting up a com
mittee that would work with

the freshmen all fall quarter
with the goal of integrating
them into Stanford life."
Turning to the judicial sys
tem, Church stressed, "More
emphasis should be placed on
the fact that Stanford should be
a part of society, and not an
island of its own."
Judicial Reform
"One important question that
the judicial system committee
should explore is, 'What is the
nature and role of Judicial Coun
cil?' Recommendations would
bo made to the Packer Commit
tee, and specific interim mea
sures could be arranged."
"One such measure would be
the establishment of an orien
tation program for council mem
bers."
Church is very involved in
freshman life having been a
LASSU representative last quar
ter. He is currently president of
Trancos House in Wilbur.
"Regardless of the outcome of
this election," Church said, "I
would hope that more construc
tive attention would be focused
on these freshman problems."

tee for the Study of Education
at Stanford, Church said, "I
would like to see groups work
ing with the Packer Commit
tee on such problems as hous
ing and academics."

"We have voiced our objection
to the Packer Committee. How
ever, this study is so important
that we must work with them
or all our goals will be sacri
ficed."
Church's main emphasis in
terms of obtaining some pro
gress in the next two months
would be on freshman life at
Stanford and the Stanford ju
dicial system.
"Freshmen right now are in a
position to look back on their
first year here at Stanford. It is
truly unfortunate that the Pack
er Committee has only one
undergraduate member, and no
Freshman representation."
Freshman Committee
"I am in favor of setting up a
Freshman Committee made up
of undergraduates from which
the Packer Committee could
draw ideas on freshman hous
ing and the freshman academic
year."
In relation to freshman prob
lems, Church added, "I would
be in favor of setting up a com
mittee that would work with

the freshmen all fall quarter
with the goal of integrating
them into Stanford life."
Turning to the judicial sys
tem, Church stressed, "More
emphasis should be placed on
the fact that Stanford should be
a part of society, and not an
island of its own."
Judicial Reform
"One important question that
the judicial system committee
should explore is, 'What is the
nature and role of Judicial Coun
cil?' Recommendations would
bo made to the Packer Commit
tee, and specific interim mea
sures could be arranged."
"One such measure would be
the establishment of an orien
tation program for council mem
bers."
Church is very involved in
freshman life having been a
LASSU representative last quar
ter. He is currently president of
Trancos House in Wilbur.
"Regardless of the outcome of
this election," Church said, "I
would hope that more construc
tive attention would be focused
on these freshman problems."
"There is no way to solve the
limitless problems in two
months. For anything construc
tive to come out of the office,
emphasis must be on one or two
key issues."
Forrest Church stressed this
point yesterday. Church is the
first freshman in Stanford's
history to run for a student
body office.
"I see my running as a chance
for the freshmen to involve
themselves. I also see this as
a chance for the office of Vice-
President to form advisory stu
dent committees."
"Dave Harris has self-admit
tedly fulfilled his role. Now
is the time to de-emphasize talk
ing and stress action. As Vice-
President I would state my
goals and set up committees to
fulfill this task."
