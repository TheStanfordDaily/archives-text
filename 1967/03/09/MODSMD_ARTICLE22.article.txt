# Bowles Asks For ASSU Rejection, Radical Reform
## 
### 
"I wouldn't do anything if I
were elected, basically because I
think students shouldn't support
the ASSU," Victoria Bowles,
vice presidential candidate, de
clared in an interview for The
Daily Tuesday.
"The ASSU," Miss Bowles pro
tested, "was created by the
Board of Trustees and can't do
anything without the approval
of the President and the Board.
What we need is an autonomous
group not bound up with ad
ministrative requirements."
Sophomores
The sophomore, a member of
Students for a Democratic So
ciety and the Anti-Draft Union,
decided to run last week at the
Legislature meeting when it was
decided to have a short cam
paign because LASSU members
felt that the candidates would be
experienced in student govern
ment. "This angered me," she
said. "So I decided to run be
cause I am totally inexperienced
and don't know any thing about
student government."
Community
Asked what alternative she
has to the ASSU, Miss Bowles
stated that "It couldn't be abol
ished by the students because
such a proposal would not get
through the Board of Trustees.
The only thing we can do is to
informally refuse to function."
"I would like to see the Uni
versity as a community of schol
ars. But we had better stop talk
ing about it, until we can make
it a reality. The obvious inequi
ties in the system must be taken
care of and we must establish a
real dialogue between the ad
ministration and the' students
before we can make a valid state
ment about a community of
scholars," she said.
Turning to the recent Hum
phrey incident, she said, "I don't
think it was the intention of the
vast majority to do any violence
to Hubert Humphrey." She
added that President Sterling's
letter to the University commu
nity was "a typical Sterling
move to pacify the alumni. He

tried again to infer that nori
students were involved."
"The Packer Commission,"
Miss Bowles commented, "I
hope, will provide more basis
for discussion of issues in the
University. But I wouldn't place
any confidence in it.
Referring to the OFF Cam
paign, she said, "I'm sorry that
it took the administration so
long to decide that there should
be no discrimination between
men and women." The candi
date believes that the University
should also provide apartment
housing for students on campus
"relatively free of administra
tive control."
Unmarried Couples
"Unmarried as well as mar
ried couples should be able to
rent apartments," she suggested.
Miss Bowles, who lives in
Florence Moore Hall, said, "I
don't think dorm living as it is
now at Stanford accomplishes
many of its objectives- I find it
personally very sterile and con
fining."
She advocates complete re
moval of social regulations, in
cluding those for freshman.
"I am opposed to the frater
nity system as far as it implies
selective membership. I don't
think the selection procedure
should be institutionalized, as
with rush, a brief confrontation
of people who don't know much
about each other," she stated.
Abolish General Studies
Concerning the academic sit
uation, Miss Bowles thinks that
"General Studies and grades
should be abolished and there
should be much more opportun
ity for independence to have di
rected study and small seminar
type work. I would like to see
a universal pass-fail system."
In actively opposing the war
in Vietnam, she said that "It is
almost a moral duty for me to
try to communicate what I have
learned about the war to as
many people as possible, to try
to overcome the distrotions of
facts about the situation in Viet
nam."
