## 
### TANDA DYKES 
Stanford's 1967 Summer Festi
val of the Arts will feature New
Orleans Dixieland Jazz, the City
Center Joffrey Ballet, and piano
cello concerts.
According to Festival Director
Virgil K. Whitaker, "We also
plan to have a major American
dramatic company; and we will
try for one or two series on
American achievements in films
and a week of programs on de
velopments in television."
The theme of the Festival,
which runs from June 27 to
August 19, will be "Focus on
America " Whitaker announced,
"We have been waiting a long
time to turn the spotlight to
some of our principal American
contributions in the arts."
World View
"However," he added, "we are
not abandoning our intenational
focus, but will view American
contributions in probably their
most important perspective—the
way in which they are seen
around the world. Jazz, for in
stance, may be something we
have grown up with, but to the
rest of the world it is probably
America's most important con
tribution to the arts."
Principle Jazz representatives
will be Billie and DeDe Pierce, a
married team of piano-vocalist
and blind cornetist from New
Orleans' Preservation Hall.
During July the Pierce Band
will play six nights of "come

and go" performances which will
be fashioned after their infor
mal Preservation Hall gather
ings.
Two other jazz attractions,
representing swing and blues as
well as modern styles, will end
the New Orleands' Band's jam
sessions.
Ballet
Contrasted with the jazz, "the
oldest of the living old," will
be the City Center Joffrey Bal
let, which debuted in New York
last spring. Opening the Festi
val with a six-night, seven-per
formance billing from Tuesday,
June 27 through Sunday, July 2,
the Ballet will present twelve
pieces. Its repetrtory, hailed by
the New York Times as "one of
the most varied and imaginative
in the world," includes creations
from many of America's major
choreographers.
In keeping with the Festival's
theme, concert pianist Grant
Johannesen will give two re
citals and join his wife, cellist
Zara Melsova, in two duo-con
certs which will emphasize the
works of American composers.
Quality Preserved
Stephen Baffrey of the sum
mer festival staff remarked that
this year's Festival "will be
smaller than it has been in the
past, but the reduction will be
only in quantity, not quality."
"Up until last October we
weren't sure that we would have
a festival this year." The doubt,
which arose from a lack of fi
nancial resources, was resolved
by a $25,000 grant from the San
Francisco foundation.
Festival Director Whitaker
concluded, "We sense the need
to trim the number of events in
the Festival . . . the sadness in
such a policy is natural—we
have had to turn aside a great
many potentially exciting ideas."

married team of piano-vocalist
and blind cornetist from New
Orleans' Preservation Hall.
During July the Pierce Band
will play six nights of "come

and go" performances which will
be fashioned after their infor
mal Preservation Hall gather
ings.
Two other jazz attractions,
representing swing and blues as
well as modern styles, will end
the New Orleands' Band's jam
sessions.
Ballet
Contrasted with the jazz, "the
oldest of the living old," will
be the City Center Joffrey Bal
let, which debuted in New York
last spring. Opening the Festi
val with a six-night, seven-per
formance billing from Tuesday,
June 27 through Sunday, July 2,
the Ballet will present twelve
pieces. Its repetrtory, hailed by
the New York Times as "one of
the most varied and imaginative
in the world," includes creations
from many of America's major
choreographers.
In keeping with the Festival's
theme, concert pianist Grant
Johannesen will give two re
citals and join his wife, cellist
Zara Melsova, in two duo-con
certs which will emphasize the
works of American composers.
Quality Preserved
Stephen Baffrey of the sum
mer festival staff remarked that
this year's Festival "will be
smaller than it has been in the
past, but the reduction will be
only in quantity, not quality."
"Up until last October we
weren't sure that we would have
a festival this year." The doubt,
which arose from a lack of fi
nancial resources, was resolved
by a $25,000 grant from the San
Francisco foundation.
Festival Director Whitaker
concluded, "We sense the need
to trim the number of events in
the Festival . . . the sadness in
such a policy is natural—we
have had to turn aside a great
many potentially exciting ideas."
Stanford's 1967 Summer Festi
val of the Arts will feature New
Orleans Dixieland Jazz, the City
Center Joffrey Ballet, and piano
cello concerts.
According to Festival Director
Virgil K. Whitaker, "We also
plan to have a major American
dramatic company; and we will
try for one or two series on
American achievements in films
and a week of programs on de
velopments in television."
The theme of the Festival,
which runs from June 27 to
August 19, will be "Focus on
America " Whitaker announced,
"We have been waiting a long
time to turn the spotlight to
some of our principal American
contributions in the arts."
World View
"However," he added, "we are
not abandoning our intenational
focus, but will view American
contributions in probably their
most important perspective—the
way in which they are seen
around the world. Jazz, for in
stance, may be something we
have grown up with, but to the
rest of the world it is probably
America's most important con
tribution to the arts."
Principle Jazz representatives
will be Billie and DeDe Pierce, a
married team of piano-vocalist
and blind cornetist from New
Orleans' Preservation Hall.
