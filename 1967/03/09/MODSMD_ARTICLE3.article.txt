According to Miss Martha Madden,
Director of Florence Moore, the rob
beries in Gavilan and Faisan "are es
sentially two different things."
The Palo Alto Times reported that
Mary Bergen, a co-ed in Faisan, was
Struck in the mouth Tuesday night
when she caught two burglars enter
ing the room next to hers. After hit
ting her, the boys fled down a fire es
cape.
At approximately the same time,
someone walked through the second
and third floors of Gavilan House en
tering those rooms whose doors were
open.
Apparently only cash was taken In
amounts ranging from $2 to $35. Over
$100 was reported missing In all.
Miss Madden stated that the earlier
newspaper coverage was true. She
added, however, that any further as
sumptions about the robberies, includ

ing the fact that they might be con
nected, was only speculation.
Hoo Tow Burglary
The attempted robbery in Hoover
Tower Tuesday night led to the arrest
of one East Palo Alto teenager.
Mr. Belmont, Executive Assistant of
Hoover Institute, said that apparently
two boys knocked a hole in the rear
door with a rock. When they attempt
ed to reach through the hole to open
the door, a janitor on duty scared them
off.
"There was nothing taken, and, out
side of the broken window, nothing
was damaged. As to why they did it, I
just don't know," Belmont added.
The Stanford Police Department re
ported that a policeman on duty appre
hended one of the youths later that
night.
A secretary in the Records office of
the Santa Clara Sheriff's Department
stated that there was no information
available, as yet on the case. She added,
"It usually takes about two or three
days for the records to come over here
from Stanford."
