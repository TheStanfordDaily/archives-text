It looks like Brian Leek of Stan
ford's varsity is never going to
get to the tennis ball, but he
did to make an impossible re
turn shot against the NorCal
All Stars. Leek maintained his
feet to win the point also.
A grand slam home run by
Bill Holt Tuesday against UOP
at Stockton paved the way for
an easy 7-2 Stanford win.
Indian fence busters pounded
out 11 hits, and also hit some
long fly outs to completely de
moralize University of the Pa
cific pitchers.
Don Rose and Frank Klinger
shared the throwing chores for
the Tribe. Rose who was the
winner, pitched the first five
innings and struck out eight.
Klinger threw the last four and
struck out six.
Stanford scored five runs in a
big third inning.
Frank Duffy began the pro
ceedings with a single. Consecu
tive singles by Mark Marquess
and Dick Swan brought Duffy
in to score. Bob Boone got
aboard on a fielder's choice and
Ron Shotts loaded the bases up
with a single to perpare the
scene for left fielder Holt.
Holt hit the ball over the 420
foot mark in center field for
his grand slam.

Duffy, hit by a pitch to lead
'off the fourth, stole second,
moved to third on a single by
Marquess, and scored on a fly
to left by Swan.
Boone scored the first Tribe
run in the second when he
walked, stole second, and Holt
and Shoemaker singles brought
him home.
Holt was the hitting hero for
the day with three for three on
a single, double, and home run.
Marquess went two for three.
Cal Poly Next
The Tribe faces tough Cal
Poly of Pomona in a two game
series this weekend. The games
will be in Sunken Diamond Fri
day and Saturday.
Cal Poly beat UCLA, 9-3,
Tuesday and is supposed to be
one of the tougher teams on the
coast.
These will be the last games
for the Indian varsity until after
finals week.
