## Trimbur: Vote Of Confidence 
### H. Muller C. Harte 
John Trimbur stands out
among an otherwise unimpres
sive field of vice presidential
aspirants as one who can
combine an understanding of the
ideals articulated in the last
year with the capability of put
ting these goals into effect.
His platform includes both a
laudable general view of the Uni
versity—the notion of a commu
nity of scholars—and a number
of realistic specific proposals
leading toward that ideal — in
cluding demands for experimen
tation toward residential educa
tion (such as the Wilbur Experi
ment), for the end of discrimina
tion against women, for open
meetings of all committees (in
cluding the Packer Committee
and the Board of Trustees), and
for decision-making in the hands
of students and faculty mem
bers.
By comparison other candi
dates suffer greatly. Bob Arnon
endorses ROTC because it gives

students "an equal opportunity
to participate in a nationwide
program, and comes out for al
lowing only junior and senior
women to live off campus, with
no explanation for the discrim
ination between sophomore men
and women.
Forrest Church has a platform
in which the word freshman
pops up in the most unusual
places, and his appeal must per
force be limited to a shortsighted
segment of that class.
Bill Stone is a throwback to
the pre-Harris days, and seems
firmly to believe that the "many
things at Stanford about which
people are deservedly unhappy"
can be changed the old way—
behind the scenes and through
continual compromise. Indeed,
he even calls on students to
"legitimize" their "right to be
involved," rather than asking
those who have for years ob
structed this right to move
aside.

And the little we know of the
other candidates leads us to be
lieve they have little to offer
the student body of Stanford in
this particular office.
As co-chairman of the ASSU
Housing Commission, Trimbur
can be credited with a major role
in presenting the only proposal
to date which incorporates re
freshing new ideas with a prac
tical plan for their implementa
tion.
David Harris' resignation
should not bring to a standstill
the discussion of Stanford's edu
cational goals and any rejection
of the progress made so far
would be a tragedy.
A vote for John Trimbur will
be a vote of confidence for those
who have shown an intense in
terest in a thorough reevaluation
of the purpose of education and
of the University's role in the
educational process.
