## Armbands Or Blindfolds? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
How about grey armbands for
those of us who cannot separate
the blackness of our despair
from the whiteness of our hope?
How about grey armbands for
those of us who cannot contain
our sorrow and pity and
warmth for those suffering chil
drenjathe waifs of the Saigon
streetcorner, who know nothing
of black and white except GI
boot-polish?
How about sending all of our
tatered linen symbols to Viet
nam, where they can be used
as shoe shine rags, or as gags,
or as bandages to cling to
wounded flesh, to become rod
armbands?
Armbands remind me of blind
folds.

• More Gray
Editor, The Daily:
May I suggest GRAY arm
bands for those people who be
lieve the following:
1. That the United States may,
as a principle of foreign policy,
legitimately aid established gov
ernments in resisting aggres
sion (upon their request);
2. That, given the profoundly
nationalistic nature of the cur
rent conflict in Vietnam, this
principle may have been mis
applied;
3. But that such an error in
policy does not imply that the
Administration is not sincere in
its efforts to negotiate a settle
ment, or that it is deliberately
lying to the American public to
hide a policy of military imper
ialism ;
4. And finally, such an error
in policy does not mean that
American soldiers now fighting
in Vietnam are criminals, oper
ating with utter disregard for
the welfare of the Vietnamese
people.

• Responsibility
Editor, The Daily:
'It is the responsibility of the
intellectuals to speak the truth

and to expose lies. This, at least,
may seem enough of a truism
to pass over without comment.
Not so, however. For the modern
intellectual, it is not at all ob
vious. Thus we have Martin
Heidegger writing, in a pro-
Hitler declaration of 1933, that
'truth is the revelation of that
makes people certain, clear,
clear, and strong in its action
and knowledge'; it is only this
kind of "truth" that one has a
responsibility to speak", that
"truth" that can interpret away
serious conflict to present a
united image, say of a univer
sity.
Inasmuch as Stanford's goal
is to be an intellectual commun
ity, a place where people are
free to seek truth, its spokes
men cannot tacitly support, dis
regard, or ignore untruth, even
(and especially) when under the
pressure of an untruthful press
or government propaganda.
President Sterling's apology
to Humphrey, and his plea for
politeness to the community,
give encouragement to these
propagandistic forces because
they too are based in respect
for power and position rather
than in respect for truth. Ster
ling's arguments are consistent
within a framework of respect
for power, but the ultimate ir
rationality of that framework is
ultimately deadly, both for the
intellectual community and for
those who suffer absurdly from
its results in Vietnam.
I say "absurdly" because:
How can a government say it is
dedicated to negotiation (which
can only develop from a truth
framework) if that government
also feels that it can say any
thing, true or not, which is in
the country's self interest? Sim
ilarly, how can President Ster
ling make an unqualified apol
ogy to a Humphrey who has
lied to the press, if Sterling
really has concern for creating
an atmosphere where free and
honest debate can take place?
To not have condoned the possi
bility of violence on the day

of Humphrey's speech is na
turally understandable in Presi
dent Sterling, but not to
acknowledge and oppose the un
fairness to a fairly vast minor
ity of dissenters of Humphrey's
U.S. News statements is wrong.
"I urge all who oppose the
President's quiet toleration of
untruth to tell him why, indi
vidually or as a group.

• FOR The Letter
Editor, The Daily:
In defense of President Ster
ling's letter:
The first responsibility of any
individual is to practice his prin
ciples in his own life. If he
cannot do this, he has no busi
ness preaching them. If a per
son cannot express his disgust
and frustration and disappoint
ment without resorting to vio
lence or rabble-rousing tactics,
then he has no right to tell any
one to reject the Vietnam war.
President Sterling was criti
cized for ignoring paradoxes.
The crowd that opposed Hum
phrey's exit had obviously pre
ceded and surpassed President
Sterling in this ignorance. These
protestors were exempting their
own conduct from the principle
of peaceful discussion and solu
tion that they advocate for Viet
nam.
President Sterling can do little
about Vietnam, even if he were
inclined to make his opinions
public. His responsibility here is
no more than any other con
cerned citizen. But as President
of Stanford University he has a
much more immediate and stron
ger responsibility to preserve
an atmosphere on campus that
allows rational, non-violent dis
cussion.
This type of discussion was
definitely jeopardized by what
happened after Humphrey's
speech. No one has the right
to decide for anyone else who
is worth listening to. By treat
ing Humphrey as they did, these
protestors were sealing off the

University from any future at
tempts to state what, in the opin
ion of many people, is a respon
sible side of the Vietnam debate.
I can see no fault in the Presi
dent's effort, which, as Presi
dent of SU he is obliged to make,
to preserve open debate on cam
pus, no matter what crass, non
idealistic motives he may have.
