## The 						Establishment: Power On The Left 
### Fritz Schaefer 
Why is it that nearly all
facets of student life at Stan
ford are rigidly controlled by
a constituency of perhaps 500
of Stanford's 11,000 students?
The student Establishment at
Stanford consists of the Students
for a Democratic Society, The
Experiment, Henry Muller and
his Daily staff, ex-ASSU presi
dent David Harris and his LAS
SU friends, and a handful of
scattered unaffiliated young
leftists whose sole task is to
write letters to The Daily in
support of the other four groups.
On any given day, if an out
sider were to scan The Daily,
he would surely believe that 95
per cent of all Stanford students
were members of the Establish
ment —the New Left.
Shallowness
In a typical Daily one finds
nine articles, editorials, and let
ters to the editor denouncing
the war in Vietnam. Eight of
these blasts reflect the shallow
ness ("There is no sane reason
for the United States to be in
Vietnam.") that Americans have
come to expect from the aca
demic community.
The Daily rarely fails to con
tain a few articles concerning
that noble body of 35, the SDS
Anti-Draft Union. A large por
tion of our student newspaper is
invariably devoted to attacks
on Stanford's administration.
These attacks are all of the same
nature —they denounce the ad
ministration for allowing any
one but SDS, The Experiment,
The Dally, and LASSU to in
fluence the future of Stanford.

Besides these three old stand
bys, The Dally also carries "in
depth coverage" on issues of
immediate interest to the Estab
lishment. Along these lines, re
cent issues have had spreads on
How to Use LSD, The Rise and
Fall of the Prophet David Har
ris, How to Join The Experi
ment (the only place where peo
ple with "concern" for other peo
ple can meet), and The Wicked
ness of President Sterling in
Censuring Those Who Resorted
to Violence Against the Vice
President of the United States.
Perhaps the biggest single
reason for the seemingly inex
plicable amount of power held
by the Establishment is the fact
that the Faculty nourishes and
supports the young "idealists."
Under the pressures of four
years of intensive leftist indoc
trination (which begins with the
first class in Western Civ), it is
a wonder that not more than 5
per cent of the student body is
converted to the line of thought
which says that American so
ciety is an evil conspiracy which
must be destroyed.
Only Amusing
Hecklers please note that I
am not suggesting that any
members of the Stanford Fac
ulty be released. I only wish to
point out the simple fact that
many teachers here have rigidly
preconceived notions with re
spect to current political and so
cial issues. And it is admirable
for these teachers to present
their preconceived notions as
opinions and not as objective
truths.
It is indeed fortunate that
while the Establishment runs the
show, the rest of us are sensible
enough to ignore the exhibition
ism. Will the academic commu
nity ever transcend its role as
nothing more than a source of
amusement for the real world?
