# Self-Study Bill Before LASSU
## 
### 
A bill initiating a permanent self
study of education sponsored by the
ASSU tops the agenda for tonight's
Legislature meeting.
LASSU will also consider a change
in the Publications Board by-laws and
appropriations to the Experiment, to
The Daily, and to a group of students
interested in making a film of the
Grove Project.
A constitutional change to enable
the ASSU President to begin his term
immediately after election may be pre
sented tonight; however, the resolu
tion will probably be postponed until
next quarter
LASSU will meet in room 320 at 7:30.
