## The 						Old Rancher

Now looky here Lyndon, this
here nonsense has got to stop.
It isn't bad enough that our
boys is dyin' over theah at the
rate of moren a hunnert a week,
you gotta go and call up all
them uneducated 19-year-olds to
go too.
You just ain't a gonna be able
to work that way. Suppose they
don' wanna go? Where you gon
na find jail space for three
million young men?
Now don' argue with me Lyn
don. I know all about your
politickin'. I know that your
plannin' to end this here war be
tween the convention and the
election in '68, but you're forget
tin' one very important thing.
You may not get renominated.
Who's gonna stop you? Well
have you evah thought of the
junior Senator from the Empire
State? Yes, of course I mean
Bobby. Who the hell else would
I mean?
New Crop O'Voters
Well I don't know if he's got
the guts to fight you either.
Seems to me, however, that he
been fightin' you ever since 1960,
and I tell you sumpthin' Lyndon,
you ain't been comin' out on
top too often. Did you have an
interview with the Pope?

Gotta remember too, Lyndon
that an awful lot of them kids
you is tryin' to draft is gonna
be able to vote come the next
election. You know as well as I
do that your mandate wasn't
no mandate no how. It was a
vote against Goldwater. You
don't stop actin' like the man
you beat, the same thing gon
na happen to you.
What d'ya mean, you can't be
beat? Who do you thing you
are? Charlie de Gaulle? Ain't
been a man in this country who
couldn't be beat one way or an
other. Even Dewey got beat.
Outta Powah
And how 'bout all them moth
ers and sisters of those po' boys
you is sendin' ovah theah? How
long do you think it's gonna
be before they figger out you
is playin' GOD with their sons?
Its time you wised up Lyndon.
For a smart politician you been
actin' awful stupid lately.
The only stupid president ever
got re-elected was Eisenhower,
and I don't think you want your
posterity to read the same as his.
Now you get on the ball Lyndon,
or we gonna find ourselves outta
powah come 1968. We gonna end
up with a Republican, no mattah
who wins. I is warnin' you.
