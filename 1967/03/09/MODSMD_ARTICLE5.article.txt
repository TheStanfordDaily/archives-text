# California Purchases Farm Land To Extend New Serra Freeway
## 
### CICELY BATES 
The state of California last week
purchased 215 acres of Stanford land
to extend the Junipero Serra Free-

way which, when completed, will link
San Jose and San Francisco.
The freeway, which will be started
in June and completed in the summer
of 1969, will run south of the main
campus between Page Mill Road and
Willow Road. "More than $2 million"
was involved in the sale, according
to Metropolitan District right of way
agent William J. Kenney.

The land is being used at the pres
ent time for grazing, but it was hoped
to eventually develop it into a re
search park and residential area, ex
plained the Stanford Manager of Real
Estate, Robert S. Riley. "Now it will
be much harder to develop the area,"
he stated.
The freeway will cut off much of
the access to the Radio and Science
Research Area that is beyond the
road. Except for two small under
passes the land will be severed. Riley
said this would be an inconvenience
and that worse yet, the noise of auto
mobiles could prove to be a problem.
He felt that such noise might "de
crease capabilities in ranges of re
ceiving radio signals," and therefore
be a hinderance to research.
Long Range Plan
Although official transactions were
completed only last week, plans for
building such a freeway have been
in the making for around 8 years.
Such preparation is evident at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator which
has had a bridge over it since the
time it was built.

The land for the freeway was not
officially "sold" because such a prac
tice is forbidden in the deed granting
the land to Stanford. Stanford land
must be condemned before it can be
purchased. This freeway is not the
first piece of land to be condemned.
Thirty-one acres were earlier con
demned for another section of the
same freeway which will be com
pleted this summer. Other condemna
tions have been involved in land used
for several schools in the area as well
as the Veterans Administration Hos
pital.
