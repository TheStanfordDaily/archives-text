# Friedman Talks On Market Role
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Economist Milton Friedman spoke
last night on "Politics and Economics,"
concentrating on the division of social
organization between governmental
operations and market operations.
Friedman, president of the Ameri
can Economic Association and a mem
ber of the "Chicago school" of liber
tarian economics, was the guest of the
Political Union and the Western Poll
tica Society in the final Focus Series
lecture.
Professor Friedman emphasized his
belief that the "Left" and the "Right"
have similar values, intentions, and ob
jectives. The differences between the
two are on the results of certain eco
nomic actions, he said. Neither the
market nor the political arrangement
is an end in itself. The question is what
will be the results.
Friedman said that there is a pro
nounced tendency to look at the market
with all of its faults and then to look
at governmental operations through
rose-colored glasses. John Stuart Mill
had accurately diagnosed the problem
100 years ago, Friedman stated, when
he discussed the question of collecti
vism. Mill said that most discussions
of capitalism concerned capitalism as
it existed and as it had existed; most
discussions of collectivism discussed It
as it might be. The more logical thing
to do was to discuss the two ideals or
the two actualities.
Political Terms
In describing the ideal market sys
tem, Friedman found it best to use
political terms. It Is a system of vot
ing; a dollar is a vote. It is an effective
proportional representation system.
That is, everyone can get what he
wants and votes for.
The political mechanism, he claimed,
is the opposite. Any combination to
taling the threshold of 51 percent gets
100 percent. Friedman considered the
political mechanism best where only
one choice is possible- For example,
a choice as to the size of the army
that a state might have. The political
mechanism is an agreed-upon method
for reaching agreement when there
is no unanimity and the situation
is such that someone must give in.
Friedman cited as another correct
use of the political mechanism any
situation where it would be too ex
pensive, too impractical, for the mar
ket. For example, the building and
maintenance of streets could be han
dled by the market, but it is, in Fried
man's opinion, best handled by the
government.
Imperfection
Friedman acknowledged that in the
real world the market does not func
tion perfectly. He mentioned weighted
voting (concentrations of capital),
monopoly, and friction as faults.
Nonetheless, Friedman stated that
the faults of capitalism are familiar
to all- What is needed is a hard-boiled
look at the political arrangement be
cause it is here that the commonly
held views deviate most from the
facts.
The significant characteristic of gov
ernmental activity, as seen by Fried

man, is that a measure designed to
serve the public interest, but operat
ing in a realm not falling under one
of Friedman's previously described
proper spheres of governmental ac
tivity, has the tendency to serve
special private interets.
According to Friedman, this ten
dency is due to the nature of politics,
in which any coalition totalling 51
percent has total power, and due to
the fact that consumers' interest is
dispersed, whereas producers' interest
is concentrated.
ICC Action
Numerous examples of governmen
tal activity were employed by Fried
man to back up his contentions. The
Interstate Commerce Commission, de
signed to protect consumers and ship
pers, ended the short haul/long haul
abuse by raising the long fare to equal
the sum of the short fares.
With the advent of automobiles and
trucking, a monopoly situation no
longer existed, and there was no long
er any conceivable reason for the ICC.
The railroad interests were so firmly
in control of the ICC by this time, be-

cause of their relative concentration of
interest in the working of the ICC,
that the ICC was used to set minimum
rates on truck transportation.
The agricultural Farm Price Sup
port System, which originally aimed
to help indigent farmers on the
grounds that small farmers are disad
vantaged, uses government funds not
for the farmer, but for storage fains
and fertilizer, Friedman stated. The
people who are hurt are the poor in
the cities for whom the prices are
raised. This program, begun with the
best of intentions, has not worked.
Yet, it cannot be terminated. The
market works on a profit and loss sys
tem; unsuccessful operations must be
terminated. It is difficult to end a gov
ernmental venture.
Friedman gave us further ex
amples the licensing of taxi drivers,
barbers, and plumbers; the Federal
Communications Commission, domi
nated by the networks; urban re
newal and federal housing; and the
minimum wage, which Friedman said
he would like to see raised overnight
to $10 in order to demonstrate its true
nature.
