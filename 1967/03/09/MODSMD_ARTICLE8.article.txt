## BU Editors Seek LBJ Ouster 
### LONNIE TERRY 
Eight of the nine members of the
editorial board of Boston University's
BU News have begun a campaign
calling for the impeachment of Presi
dent Johnson which has drawn heavy
criticism from administrative lead
ers of the university.
The editors stated in an open letter
to House speaker John McCormack
that "we realize our call for impeach
ment is beyond the pale of American
political tradition. But we ask you
to begin now a serious investigation
of the merits of our beliefs."
The letter cited the editors' views
that Johnson's actions regarding the
Vietnam war are "illegal" and are
grounds for his impeachment under
the constitutional clause of "treason,
bribery, or high crimes and misde
meanors.'
Administration Reaction
The letter, and accompanying edi
torials by members of the War Regis
ters' League, SANE, and the CLA,
brought immediate reaction from Bos
ton University officials. BU President
Harold C. Case sent telegrams to the
members of the House and to Mass
achusetts' Senators Brooke and Ken
nedy hours after the paper's distribu
tion-
Case wrote: "This telegram is to re
mind you that under the guise of
freedom of speech, student editors
often write intemperately . . . student
editors enjoy editorial freedom in
producing the newspaper. It is un
fortunate that they do not also reveal
a corresponding sense of responsibil
ity."
Speak For Themselves
The telegram ended, "These eight
students speak only for themselves,
not for Boston University. Our pa
tience is sorely tried by such unreal
istic immaturity but in due time we
expect them to mature and to accept
responsibility consistent with their
privileges."
After Case's telegram, faculty mem
bers circulated a letter protesting the

"paternalistic attitude implicit in his
communication."
Raymond Mungo, BU News Editor
in-Chief, claims student reaction to
the editorial campaign is favorable.
Mungo said that when he raised the
impeachment idea before a crowd of
800 students, he "got a roaring ovation
out of it." He claims that "by and
large, I don't think students here are
upset or at all offended" by the pro
posal.
However, by March 3, 4000 students

at BU had signed a statement dis
agreeing with the BU News stand.
The statement, sent to McCormack,
read: "We the undersigned do not
agree with the BU News' demand that
President Johnson be impeached, and
we deplore any implication that it rep
resents the consensus of the Boston
University student population."
McCormack's legislative assistant,
Dr. Martin Sweig, called the student's
camapign "ridiculous. Who ever
heard of such a thing," he said.
