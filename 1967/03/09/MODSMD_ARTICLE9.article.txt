# Group To Urge Refutation Of Humphrey Statements
## 
### 
An ad hoc group of students and
faculty has formed to demand that
President Sterling publicly refute Vice
President Humphrey's recent state
ments concerning his visit to Stanford.
The group is organizing a meeting,
open to all concerned, at the Experi
ment at 3 p.m. today.
"We believe the Vice President has
lied to the press," their demand claims.
"Vice President Humphrey has
stated in a public letter that the 'hooli
ganism' during my visit (at Stanford)
was not organized by Stanford stu
dents," the group's demand continues.
"The letter failed to deny his earlier
charges that some 'ruffians' acted In a
'violent' manner."
The group's letter continues, "If you
(President Sterling) know the 'ring
leaders,' know that none is a student,
know of violent acts, we demand that
you publicly refute Vice President
Humphrey's lies.
"In the absence of any public refu
tation, we cannot believe you hold a
'deep concern for the preservation of
free and civilized debate on the Stan
ford campus', as you stated in your
letter."

All who gather at the Experiment
will walk to the President's office and
deliver the demand as a delegation,
stated Mary Hanson, a spokesman for
the group.
