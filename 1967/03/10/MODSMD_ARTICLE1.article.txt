# Stanford: 72% Favor Legalized Abortion

### BONNIE SELWAY 
In a poll given this week by Stan
ford's Chapter of the "California Com
mittee to Legalize Abortion" seventy
two percent of the students respon
ing were in favor of general legalized
abortion.
Large majorities thought that reas
sons such as rape, high risk of birth
defects and the jeopardy of the wom
an's life, should warrant safe legalized
abortion when desired in the first
three months of pregnancy. The puni
tive question, "If abortion is allowed
at all, should it be available to unmar
ried as to married women?" was an
swered "yes" by ninety-three percent
of the over 1800 student polled.
The same poll administered at the
University of California at Berkeley

solicited affirmative answers by
around ninety percent of the 1600 stu
dents responding.
Stanford's CCLA Chairman, F. H.
Kirkpatrick, Jr., stated that the pur
pose of the poll was to publicize the
campaign for legalized abortion, and
measure what support an upcoming
"Constitutional Initiative" might ex
pect. The Initiative will be sponsored
by the CCLA and drafted in the form
of a Constitutional Amendment, call
ing for the repeal of California's pres
ent anti-abortion laws.
"We must get the present illegal
abortions out of the illegal category
and put them in the hospital," Kirk
patrick said.
The present State laws, unchanged
since 1872, make it a felony for: any

person to provide medicine or any
instrument with intent to have an
abortion, give an abortion, or pro
vide medicine or instruments for such
a cause.
The California "Business and Pro
fessional Code" makes it illegal to dis
seminate any information regarding
abortions. Two local women were ar
rested February 20 by the San Mateo
Sheriff's office for holding classes on
how to perform abortions and for
handing out lists of abortion centers
in Mexico.
Under most state laws it is virtually
impossible to obtain a legal abor
tion, even in cases of rape or predicti
ble birth deformities, resultant on the
mother's contraction of German mea
sles, or her use of harmful drugs,

such as thalidomide.
A few states have added "health"
provisions or liberalized their abor
tion laws through recent amendment.
It is too soon to appraise the effects
of these actions.
One Million Illegal Abortions
Due to this legal strictness one mil
lion American women every year ob
tain illegal abortions and 8000 die
from complications arising from the
unsanitary conditions under which
they are performed.
Often when a women injured by
an illegal abortion appeals for medi
cal aid at a respectable hospital, she
is denied treatment until she reveals
to the police who performed her
abortion. Legal prosecution is often
threatened.

The "Beilensen Bill," aut'iored by
former California Assemblyman and
present State Cenator Beilera en, seeka
to legalize abortions for rape, incest,
predictable deformity, and conditions
which endanger the mental and physi
cal health of the mother. The decision
to perform one must be made by
three doctors and approved by hos
pital authorities.
The Beilensen Bill was previously
killed in committee and once voted
down on the Assembly floor but has
gained supporters and may pass this
time.
The CCLA views this bill as a good
first attempt at legislation, but favors
broader unconditional legalization of
abortion.
Kirkpatrick said, "The Beilensen
bill will cover only 4 or 5 percent of
the 100,000 illegal abortions in Cali
fornia every year, if the bill is strictly
interpreted as written. At least 60 per
cent of these illegal abortions are of
married women who do not want or
can't support any more children or
have finished raising their families."
The fifteen chapters of CCLA, made
up mostly of students, housewives,
doctors and businessmen from all
over California, will meet in San Fran
cisco April 15 to draft the Initiative.

Kirkpatriek anticipates a debate over
the number of months in which it is
best to abort the fetus before it be
comes "viable," that is, able to live out
side the womb. Some members are op
posed to abortions performed after the
third or fourth month because the
child may have life of its own- The
proposed Initiative may include there
fore a time clause.
Dr. Osborne, Director of the Stan
ford Health Service, when interviewed,
stated abortion as a "last resort for a
situation that perhaps could have
been prevented by a greater knowl
edge by the individuals involved, a
greater feeling of responsibility, or by
contraception." In cases of rape, or
predictable malformation of the baby,
he unequivocably supports legalized
abortion.
Dr. Osborne also favors legalized
abortion in place of forced, unwanted
marriages. "I don't want to see a
child brought into an unstable mar
riage, made for reasons of social
pressure or guilt atonement," he said.
The best answer he believes is a
new, postâ€”exposure contraceptive
which is soon to be on the market.
The ASSU will sponsor the showing
of the film "Abortion and the Law"
on campus in April.
