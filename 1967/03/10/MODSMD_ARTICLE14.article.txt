# 'Mafia' Brings Back Special Saturdays
## 
### WENDY WEINER 
Saturday nights have returned
to The Farm.
Those once-a-week, once-spe
cial evenings were no different
from the other six days for stu
dents a bit too sophisticated to
cotton to traditional distractions.
But Saturday night has been
resurrected at Stanford by the

Master of Fine Arts candidates
in theater—or the "Mafia," as
they have dubbed themselves
They offer an alternative for
those who have had enough of
books, a party that palls, or the
depression of seeing "A Man and
A Woman" alone.
"An Evening with the Mafia"
is a refreshing kind of party.

The guests (anyone who pays
50 cents) crowd into the Nitery
in the Old Union at 11:30 p.m.
every Saturday, sit on the floor
Or on the squeaking canvas
chairs, munch on free peanut
butter and jelly hors d'oeuvres,
relax, and are entertained.
As for the caliber of the en
tertainment, last Saturday

night's offering was as fresh, yet
polished an improvisational thea
ter as one can find. The previous
three weeks had admittedly left
much to be desired. The "Mafia"
had been fun, but it was obvious
that the group needed to jell;
still, there was in those first
programs an easily recognized
potential for more than mere

fun.
Saturday night was more than
fun. The program was a com
bination of prepared scenes —
excerpts from plays that the
M.F.A.'s had presented in
classes and improvisations based
on words, one-line jokes, and
absurd situations (for example,
a very funny sketch based on the
Pope's appearance in Yankee
Stadium, humorously perform
ed by Charlie Edelman, Sheldon
Feldner and Steve Newman).
The prepared scenes conveyed
the audience through a variety
of moods. There was the light
ness of a rendezvous between a
divorced couple who have re
discovered each other (with Car
rillo Gantner as a lovingly lop

ing ex husband), from Noel
Coward's "Private Lives." And
there was the moving sequence
in Harold Pinter's "The Care
takers" in which a young man
relates his frightening exper
iences in a mental hospital to
an uninterested old man (well
played by Sergei Tachernisch
and Joe Medalis). There was
even an amusing monologue by
Steve Newman (and his amaz
ing voice) from Thornton Wild*
er's "The Matchmaker," on the
difficulty of doing justice to
more than one vice at a time.
Thank you, Mafia for inviting
us to your anything-can-happen
parties and saving Saturday
night from threatened assimila
tion.

Thank you, Mafia for inviting
us to your anything-can-happen
parties and saving Saturday
night from threatened assimila
tion.
Saturday nights have returned
to The Farm.
Those once-a-week, once-spe
cial evenings were no different
from the other six days for stu
dents a bit too sophisticated to
cotton to traditional distractions.
But Saturday night has been
resurrected at Stanford by the

Master of Fine Arts candidates
in theater—or the "Mafia," as
they have dubbed themselves
They offer an alternative for
those who have had enough of
books, a party that palls, or the
depression of seeing "A Man and
A Woman" alone.
"An Evening with the Mafia"
is a refreshing kind of party.

The guests (anyone who pays
50 cents) crowd into the Nitery
in the Old Union at 11:30 p.m.
every Saturday, sit on the floor
Or on the squeaking canvas
chairs, munch on free peanut
butter and jelly hors d'oeuvres,
relax, and are entertained.
As for the caliber of the en
tertainment, last Saturday

night's offering was as fresh, yet
polished an improvisational thea
ter as one can find. The previous
three weeks had admittedly left
much to be desired. The "Mafia"
had been fun, but it was obvious
that the group needed to jell;
still, there was in those first
programs an easily recognized
potential for more than mere

fun.
Saturday night was more than
fun. The program was a com
bination of prepared scenes —
excerpts from plays that the
M.F.A.'s had presented in
classes and improvisations based
on words, one-line jokes, and
absurd situations (for example,
a very funny sketch based on the
Pope's appearance in Yankee
Stadium, humorously perform
ed by Charlie Edelman, Sheldon
Feldner and Steve Newman).
The prepared scenes conveyed
the audience through a variety
of moods. There was the light
ness of a rendezvous between a
divorced couple who have re
discovered each other (with Car
rillo Gantner as a lovingly lop

ing ex husband), from Noel
Coward's "Private Lives." And
there was the moving sequence
in Harold Pinter's "The Care
takers" in which a young man
relates his frightening exper
iences in a mental hospital to
an uninterested old man (well
played by Sergei Tachernisch
and Joe Medalis). There was
even an amusing monologue by
Steve Newman (and his amaz
ing voice) from Thornton Wild*
er's "The Matchmaker," on the
difficulty of doing justice to
more than one vice at a time.
