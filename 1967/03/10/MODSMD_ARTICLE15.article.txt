# ON HUMPHREY'S VISIT:
## Lecturer Encouraged By Positive Protest 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
For Jay Neugeboren, visiting
lecturer in English, the events
surrounding Vice President
Humphrey's visit is an "en
couraging sign" that many of
those who disagree with the
administration's policy in Viet
nam are ready to take a more
positive stand.
In "Humphrey's Visit: A Let
ter From Stanford" to be pub

lished in the next issue of The
New Republic, Neugeboren
speaks of Stanford as a "uni
formly quiet campus" before
Humphrey's visit and says that
little "interest or concern was
shown by students over such
issues as the Navy recruiting
team, which was the cause of
a recent strike at Berkeley.
Stanford: 'Rich Man's School'
According to Neugeboren, "at

Berkeley, Stanford is known as
a 'rich man's school'." He writes
that students in his classes seem
poorly informed and that people
here feel much more remote
from the war than do New
Yorkers. He says, "living in
Palo Alto it is difficult to be
lieve that Americans are actual
ly doing those things we wit
ness daily."
"Less than a week before
Humphrey's visit," Neugeboren
continues, "some things began
to happen." He cites plans for
a walk-out, a teach-in, a post
speech rally and a silent protest
as evidence of the new spirit
on campus.
Protest Mild
He feels that, given the frus
tration of those who did not
get into Memorial Auditorium
and the reaction to the content
of Humphrey's speech, the hos
tility of the crowd was extreme
ly mild. President Sterling has
no grounds, in his opinion, for
apologizing in the name of the
University for the actions of
those, including himself, who
yelled "shame! shame!"
As do others who were on the
scene at Humphrey's departure,
Neugeboren disagrees with

those accounts which accuse
non-students of violence at that
time.
Because the article was writ
ten last week, it contains no
reference to President Sterling's
unprecedented letter to all mem
bers of the Stanford Commun
ity. In a Daily interview yester
day, however, Neuenboren re
ferred to the letter as "deplor
able."
Neugeboren stresses his be
lief that 10,000 professors sign
ing 10,000 ads will cause little
consternation in the White
House, but 10,000 professors
might have other effects. He ad
vocates serious consideration of
a nation-wide strike.

here feel much more remote
from the war than do New
Yorkers. He says, "living in
Palo Alto it is difficult to be
lieve that Americans are actual
ly doing those things we wit
ness daily."
"Less than a week before
Humphrey's visit," Neugeboren
continues, "some things began
to happen." He cites plans for
a walk-out, a teach-in, a post
speech rally and a silent protest
as evidence of the new spirit
on campus.
Protest Mild
He feels that, given the frus
tration of those who did not
get into Memorial Auditorium
and the reaction to the content
of Humphrey's speech, the hos
tility of the crowd was extreme
ly mild. President Sterling has
no grounds, in his opinion, for
apologizing in the name of the
University for the actions of
those, including himself, who
yelled "shame! shame!"
As do others who were on the
scene at Humphrey's departure,
Neugeboren disagrees with

those accounts which accuse
non-students of violence at that
time.
Because the article was writ
ten last week, it contains no
reference to President Sterling's
unprecedented letter to all mem
bers of the Stanford Commun
ity. In a Daily interview yester
day, however, Neuenboren re
ferred to the letter as "deplor
able."
Neugeboren stresses his be
lief that 10,000 professors sign
ing 10,000 ads will cause little
consternation in the White
House, but 10,000 professors
might have other effects. He ad
vocates serious consideration of
a nation-wide strike.
For Jay Neugeboren, visiting
lecturer in English, the events
surrounding Vice President
Humphrey's visit is an "en
couraging sign" that many of
those who disagree with the
administration's policy in Viet
nam are ready to take a more
positive stand.
In "Humphrey's Visit: A Let
ter From Stanford" to be pub

lished in the next issue of The
New Republic, Neugeboren
speaks of Stanford as a "uni
formly quiet campus" before
Humphrey's visit and says that
little "interest or concern was
shown by students over such
issues as the Navy recruiting
team, which was the cause of
a recent strike at Berkeley.
Stanford: 'Rich Man's School'
According to Neugeboren, "at

Berkeley, Stanford is known as
a 'rich man's school'." He writes
that students in his classes seem
poorly informed and that people
here feel much more remote
from the war than do New
Yorkers. He says, "living in
Palo Alto it is difficult to be
lieve that Americans are actual
ly doing those things we wit
ness daily."
