# WIN Expects To Lose; Wants More Discussion
## 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
"We are not going to win, but
I think we are proving our
point," stated Bob Crowe, head
of WIN, a group that supports
the administration's handling of
the war in Vietnam. The group
distributed black armbands yes
terday in White Memorial Plaza
in order to assert their beliefs
and "improve the image of Stan
ford University."
Despite a few hecklers and
the fact that many of their signs
were torn down, the group was
able to pass out a fair number
of black armbands. The group
hoped to stimulate discussion
of issues and perhaps clarify the
different points of view.
Many students regarded the
campaign as a humorous ven
ture. But Crowe and his associ
ates were adamant in insisting
that this was a serious enter
prise inspired by their beliefs.
"We feel that the wearing of
white armbands has had a very
detrimental effect on the morale
of both the troops in Vietnam
and the public in general."
'Fairly Successful'
Crowe felt that the group was
fairly successful, passing out
about 350 black armbands. He
mentioned that there was a
great deal of discussion caused
by the group's action, and that
for the most part people de
bated in good faith and were
not hecklers.
However he felt personally
defeated because of the refusal
of people to accept the sincerity
of his stand. Those who favor
the war and bombing felt that
Crowe was too lenient when he
said that those who wear white
armbands could be patriots.
Others, who wore white arm
bands, felt that he was both
naive and insincere. Many sim
ply regarded his actions as
blatent attempts to achieve pub
licity.
Crowe felt, however, that the
group per se was successful
since it was able to promote a
dialogue, and allow members of
the student community to ex
press an intellectual rationale
for the war.
Will Continue
Despite this, Crowe plans to
continue the project at least
through next Wednesday. "I am
disappointed with the re
action of all factions who re
fused to trust the sincerity of
someone who is trying to state
succinctly a point of view."
Crowe felt that concept of

armbands had degenerated to
such a point that it was no
longer serving any purpose to
continue his campaign. Associ
ate Steve Otto agreed, and
added that what had started as
a serious venture has been
turned into a ludicrous farce.
The idea of wearing armbands
has become a joke, as splinter
groups developed and began to
wear such things as cereal
boxes and cellophane.
