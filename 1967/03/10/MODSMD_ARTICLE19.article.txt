diana, Yale, and USC for the
NCAA championship March 23-
25 at Michigan State.

Ten championship last week and
has depth to back up its im
pressive array of 'big guns.'
Yale, with Don Schollander for
its bright light, returned to the
NCAA's good graces two weeks
ago and will take home one of
the top three trophies.
USC, picked before the season
to win its fifth consecutive
NCAA crown, tied Stanford in
a dual meet and went on to win
the AAWU's. The Trojans' pow
er in the conference meet came
as a result of their depth which
cancelled out Stanford's high
places.
Stanford has the artillery to
knock off the top places in the
NCAA's. Greg Buckingham
leads the country in four events.
World record holders Dick Roth
and Luis Nicolao will be hard
to beat. Bob Momsen and Mike
Wall brought home silver and
bronze NCAA medals last year.

depend upon the efforts of the
second and third swimmers who
must elbow their way into the
finals and push the relays to
ward the top.
