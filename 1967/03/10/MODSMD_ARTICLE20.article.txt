# USC SLIGHT FAVORITE
## Farm Hosts AAWU Gymnasts Sitting Pretty 
### GREG PSALTIS 
Many of the United States'
t°P gymnasts will compete to
night in Stanford's Pavilion in
the AAWU conference cham
pionship.
The star-studded field of com
petitors includes USC's Saka
moto brothers. Makoto, a sopho
more, is a four-time national
champion and probably the best
gymnast this country has ever
produced. His brother, Mikio,
placed second in last year's
AAWU all-around, behind a third
Sakamoto brother, Sam-
Cal Threats
California's main threats are
Sid Freudenstein and Josh Rob

ison. Freudenstein, a junior, is
eyeing a bid for the 1968 Olym
pic games. He will compete in
all-around and will be favored in
several individual events. Rob
ison is favored to win the rings,
as he has for the last two years.
He will also be one of the fav
orites in the upcoming NCAA
meet.
UCLA will have Kanati Allen
in all-around. Allen, last year's
AAWU horizontal bar champion,
was an alternate on the 1967
World Game team. Mickey Chap
lan, another Bruin, is one of
the outstanding rings perform
ers in the meet tonight.
Stanford's best chances for

medals lie with John Marks and
Rich Guess. Marks, a sophomore,
set Stanford's rings record this
year and will be one of the top
competitors in that event. Guess,
a junior, will be competing for
top honors in the long horse,
his strongest event.
USC Favored
The meet will be extremely
close, as USC will be favored to
win with Cal second and UCLA
third. All three have been scor
ing around 185 points consis
tently. Earlier this year, USC
edged Cal by .25 points and
UCLA by 65 points. Cal de
feated UCLA by .75. With three
so close, one missed routine
could change the outcome of
the meet.
Washington is bringing a
strong squad that can easily cap
ture fourth place. It has been

right around 180 points all year.
Stanford will be right in the
battle for fifth.
Makato Sakamoto Again!
As would be expected. Makoto
Sakamoto is unquestionably the
favorite for the all-around title.
His closest competition will
come from his brother, Mikio,
and also from Sid Freudenstein
and Kanati Allen.
Jim Petersen, Stanford's all
around performer, will only com
pete in three events, floor ex
ercise, horizontal bar and rings.
His wrist injury still hasn't re
covered sufficiently for him to
compete in all six all-around
events.
The meet begins at 7- There
will be two competitors going
at once to help speed up the
meet, but it is still expected to
take somewhere around three
hours.

but will meet stiff competition
from Cal and UCLA.

will be two competitors going
at once to help speed up the
meet, but it is still expected to
take somewhere around three
hours.

Jim Peterson, shown straining
on the rings, will be able to com
pete in only three events in the
AAWU championships tonight,
at Stanford. He has been ham
pered by a wrist injury. USC Is
a slight favorite to win the meet,
but will meet stiff competition
from Cal and UCLA.
Many of the United States'
t°P gymnasts will compete to
night in Stanford's Pavilion in
the AAWU conference cham
pionship.
The star-studded field of com
petitors includes USC's Saka
moto brothers. Makoto, a sopho
more, is a four-time national
champion and probably the best
gymnast this country has ever
produced. His brother, Mikio,
placed second in last year's
AAWU all-around, behind a third
Sakamoto brother, Sam-
Cal Threats
California's main threats are
Sid Freudenstein and Josh Rob

ison. Freudenstein, a junior, is
eyeing a bid for the 1968 Olym
pic games. He will compete in
all-around and will be favored in
several individual events. Rob
ison is favored to win the rings,
as he has for the last two years.
He will also be one of the fav
orites in the upcoming NCAA
meet.
UCLA will have Kanati Allen
in all-around. Allen, last year's
AAWU horizontal bar champion,
was an alternate on the 1967
World Game team. Mickey Chap
lan, another Bruin, is one of
the outstanding rings perform
ers in the meet tonight.
Stanford's best chances for

medals lie with John Marks and
Rich Guess. Marks, a sophomore,
set Stanford's rings record this
year and will be one of the top
competitors in that event. Guess,
a junior, will be competing for
top honors in the long horse,
his strongest event.
USC Favored
The meet will be extremely
close, as USC will be favored to
win with Cal second and UCLA
third. All three have been scor
ing around 185 points consis
tently. Earlier this year, USC
edged Cal by .25 points and
UCLA by 65 points. Cal de
feated UCLA by .75. With three
so close, one missed routine
could change the outcome of
the meet.
Washington is bringing a
strong squad that can easily cap
ture fourth place. It has been

right around 180 points all year.
Stanford will be right in the
battle for fifth.
Makato Sakamoto Again!
As would be expected. Makoto
Sakamoto is unquestionably the
favorite for the all-around title.
His closest competition will
come from his brother, Mikio,
and also from Sid Freudenstein
and Kanati Allen.
Jim Petersen, Stanford's all
around performer, will only com
pete in three events, floor ex
ercise, horizontal bar and rings.
His wrist injury still hasn't re
covered sufficiently for him to
compete in all six all-around
events.
The meet begins at 7- There
will be two competitors going
at once to help speed up the
meet, but it is still expected to
take somewhere around three
hours.
