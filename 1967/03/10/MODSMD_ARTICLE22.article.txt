"Gallows Humor," Jack Rich
ardson's unconvincing sneer at
Man's willingness to sacrifice
life for order and joy for con
formity, opened last weekend to
a small and sporadically enthus
iastic crowd at the Playhouse
Theatre in San Francisco.
The Playhouse production man
aged to bolster Richardson's
rather weak satire with fine
performances from Ann Content
and Bruce Bishop. However, Con
tent and Bishop and Director
Ronald Arden's stage innova
tions were not enough to war
rant a reprieve for the play.
With the exception of Mal
colm Smith, the Playhouse gave
a largely good performance of
a bad play — which was just
enough noose for Smith, in his
dual roles as hangman and
hanged, and for playwright Rich
ardson to lynch themselves.
The first act of "Gallows Hu
mor" is set in the cell of a pris
oner about to be hanged for the
semi-conscious murder of his
wife with a seven iron. In an
enrapt reminiscence of the
event, he remembers that "the
first swing sounded like a good
shot" but then concedes that
it. took him "forty strokes from
her temple to her chin."
A Job To Do
; His fastidious plans for the
last hours before his execution
(sewing on his prison number
securely, polishing his shoes,
cleaning the cell, and then a
quick stroll around the 20' by
30' cubicle) are disrupted by the
warden who introduces a prosti
tute hired by the state to see
that the prisoners reach the gal
lows in a mellow frame of mind.
The prisoner politely declines;
but the warden and the prosti
tute hear nothing of his objec
tion as they both have a job to
do, and do it they will.
The prisoner, once a success
ful lawyer who believed in im
putable law and absolute order,
had seen his life shattered when
a case clearly in his and juris
prudence's favor was lost be
cause of his client's untimely hic
cups in the courtroom. A wild
spree of riotous living follows
his disallusionment with the law
and ends in a round of golf
practice with his wife's head.
Orderly Universe
The prison has once again
provided him with an orderly
Universe that protects him from
the turmoil of reality. The prosti
tute concludes that he is al
ready dead, but is resolute to
breath a little life into his stifled
soul in time for the execution.
So far so listless.
Act II of "Gallows Humor"
takes place on the same deathly
morning in the kitchen of the
prison executioner. He too has
become restless in his precisely
planned and ordered life. The
executioner decides to instate a
little dignity to his job and de
signs a black hood to wear at
his workaday tripping the trap
at the gallows.
lAs he returns to the kitchen to
model his burnoose, he finds his
wife and the warden in a panting
embrace. Now he has the chance
to break out of the strangle hold
of conformity in his day to day
existence!
He imagines adventures in the
steaming jungles of the Amazon.
And then he lights upon an am
bition to become a free-lance
executioner who would tippy toe
around the world prunning the
dead wood—those whose spirits
and therefore existences are al
ready dead but who have ne
glected to lie down.

Straight Jacket
But while he day dreams of
a new and vital life, his wife
straight jackets him in an apron
and leads him to the sink to dry
the breakfast dishes. His glor
ious imagings have been prop
erly noosed, nettled, and na
palmed. And his chance to es
cape has been lost.
Notably the less entertaining
of the two parts, Act I bogged
down with the epicene portayal
of the prisoner which Malcolm
Smith sustained throughout.
Smith's pettifoggery and effem
inate affectations neatly cap
ture the spineless and spiritless
nature of the prisoner who con
sciously forfeits his ego for
order- Yet he never varied this
one characterization. Conse
quently, when the prostitute
prods him into recognizing the
bane of his well ordered Uni
verse, Smith never reached an
epiphany. He was so one-di
mensional throughout the per
formance in the first act that his
renaissance as a living spirit
seemed ludicrous.
Ann Content was marvellous
ly professional and business
minded as the prison whore, wor
ried that the reluctant Smith
would be a blemish on her rec
ord and yet increasingly compas
sionate to his emotional needs.
Second Act Better
The second act of "Gallows
Humor," and its performance,
were markedly better handled.
The satire was more striking,

Richardson's brand of humor
less esoteric, and the main char
acter more dimensional.
Playing the hangman in this
act, Smith trowled some depth
in his characterization. He
seemed more realistic, perhaps
because he was trying to break
away from the shackles of order
instead of locking himself in
them as in the first act.
Still, Smith lacked the force
to successfully project the execu
tioner's dreams of escaping from
his inert existence. He could not
quite evoke an emotional in
volvement from the audience;
hence, the response to his
plight was one of indifference.
BLshop A Delight
Portly Bruce Bishop, who re
markably resembles Burl Ives,
greatly spiced the play with a
comic unawareness which he in
toned into the role of the prison
warden. In one uproarious scene,
as he plumped his great carcass
atop the breakfast table and lec
tured to. Smith about the innuen
does of life, Bishop looked like
some great Bratwurst sausage
with its juices and stuffing ooz
ing out.
By no mistake, the Playhouse's
"Gallows Humor" has its hilar
ious moments and its prickly
satire. As an entertainment ve
hicle, though, the production
showcases its rewarding mo
ments in spotty array. "Gal

The prison has once again
provided him with an orderly

the turmoil of reality. The prosti

breath a little life into his stifled
soul in time for the execution.
So far so listless.
Act II of "Gallows Humor"
takes place on the same deathly
morning in the kitchen of the
prison executioner. He too has

his workaday tripping the trap

lAs he returns to the kitchen to

wife and the warden in a panting
embrace. Now he has the chance
to break out of the strangle hold
of conformity in his day to day
existence!
He imagines adventures in the
steaming jungles of the Amazon.
And then he lights upon an am
bition to become a free-lance
executioner who would tippy toe
around the world prunning the
dead wood—those whose spirits
and therefore existences are al
ready dead but who have ne
glected to lie down.

Straight Jacket
But while he day dreams of
a new and vital life, his wife
straight jackets him in an apron
and leads him to the sink to dry
the breakfast dishes. His glor

Notably the less entertaining

Smith's pettifoggery and effem

nature of the prisoner who con
sciously forfeits his ego for
order- Yet he never varied this
one characterization. Conse
quently, when the prostitute
prods him into recognizing the
bane of his well ordered Uni
verse, Smith never reached an
epiphany. He was so one-di
mensional throughout the per
formance in the first act that his
renaissance as a living spirit
seemed ludicrous.
Ann Content was marvellous

minded as the prison whore, wor

would be a blemish on her rec

sionate to his emotional needs.
Second Act Better

were markedly better handled.
The satire was more striking,

Richardson's brand of humor
less esoteric, and the main char

Playing the hangman in this
act, Smith trowled some depth
in his characterization. He
seemed more realistic, perhaps
because he was trying to break
away from the shackles of order
instead of locking himself in
them as in the first act.
Still, Smith lacked the force
to successfully project the execu
tioner's dreams of escaping from
his inert existence. He could not
quite evoke an emotional in
volvement from the audience;
hence, the response to his
plight was one of indifference.

and therefore existences are al
ready dead but who have ne
glected to lie down.

Straight Jacket
But while he day dreams of
a new and vital life, his wife
straight jackets him in an apron
and leads him to the sink to dry
the breakfast dishes. His glor
ious imagings have been prop
erly noosed, nettled, and na
palmed. And his chance to es
cape has been lost.
Notably the less entertaining
of the two parts, Act I bogged
down with the epicene portayal
of the prisoner which Malcolm
Smith sustained throughout.
Smith's pettifoggery and effem
inate affectations neatly cap
ture the spineless and spiritless
nature of the prisoner who con
sciously forfeits his ego for
order- Yet he never varied this
one characterization. Conse
quently, when the prostitute
prods him into recognizing the
bane of his well ordered Uni
verse, Smith never reached an
epiphany. He was so one-di
mensional throughout the per
formance in the first act that his
renaissance as a living spirit
seemed ludicrous.
Ann Content was marvellous
ly professional and business
minded as the prison whore, wor
ried that the reluctant Smith
would be a blemish on her rec
ord and yet increasingly compas
sionate to his emotional needs.
Second Act Better
The second act of "Gallows
Humor," and its performance,
were markedly better handled.
The satire was more striking,

Richardson's brand of humor
less esoteric, and the main char
acter more dimensional.
Playing the hangman in this
act, Smith trowled some depth
in his characterization. He
seemed more realistic, perhaps
because he was trying to break
away from the shackles of order
instead of locking himself in
them as in the first act.
Still, Smith lacked the force
to successfully project the execu
tioner's dreams of escaping from
his inert existence. He could not
quite evoke an emotional in
volvement from the audience;
hence, the response to his
plight was one of indifference.
BLshop A Delight
Portly Bruce Bishop, who re
markably resembles Burl Ives,
greatly spiced the play with a
comic unawareness which he in
toned into the role of the prison
warden. In one uproarious scene,
as he plumped his great carcass
atop the breakfast table and lec
tured to. Smith about the innuen
does of life, Bishop looked like
some great Bratwurst sausage
with its juices and stuffing ooz
ing out.
By no mistake, the Playhouse's
"Gallows Humor" has its hilar
ious moments and its prickly
satire. As an entertainment ve
hicle, though, the production
showcases its rewarding mo
ments in spotty array. "Gal
lows Humor" continues to play
on Friday and Saturday eve
nings.
