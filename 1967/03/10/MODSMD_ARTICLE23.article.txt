THEATER
Every night from now through March 12 at the Nitery at 8, un
dergraduate drama students present a program called "Tragedy:
Two Views," with adaptations from Euripides' THE TROJAN
WOMAN and the contemporary French Playwright Anouilh's
ANTIGONE.
At the Nitery 11:30 tomorrow night the MaFiA will do its usual
skits and improvisations, and perform Charles Edeman's PLEASE
DON'T HIT ME AGAIN, AUDREY.
The freshman drama group will be at Branner tomorrow and
Sunday nights at 8 to stage THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED
PRUFROCK, RIDERS TO THE SEA and one other short play.
There will be no charge for admission.
The Interplayers in SF have announced that they will perform a
revival of Aristophanes 2,400 year old bawdy classic, LYSISTRATA,
on Friday, March 17, at 8:30 p.m. Better catch their act while this
play is still around.
The American Conservatory Theater's madcap satirical revue,
BEYOND THE FINGE, is returning to the Midpeninsula on March
31 and April 1. Those who are still in the Midpeninsula on these
dates will probably be feeling beyond the fringe anyway, but you
can see the show at the Palo Alto High School Auditorium at 7:45
and 10:45 each night.
MOVIES
FUNERAL IN BERLIN is a sequel of sorts to "The Iprcress File,"
and once again stars the finagaling philanderer Michael Caine as a
calm, cool and collected cockney super-agent. Lots of fun at the
Park and the Belmont.
Critic Pauline Keal aptly described Michelangelo Antonioni's
BLOW-UP as "a dehumanized study in dehumanization " Those of
you who have read or heard the exultations of other critics will
probably think it's the profundest, however. Especially for dead
beats at the Tivoli.
MUSIC
On April 1 rock and roller Johnny Rivers will be at the Berkeley
Community Theater, singing BABY I NEED YOUR LOVIN' for
those who are still around. Me, I plan to get my lovin' in Tijuana
this vacation.

DON'T HIT ME AGAIN, AUDREY.
The freshman drama group will be at Branner tomorrow and
Sunday nights at 8 to stage THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED
PRUFROCK, RIDERS TO THE SEA and one other short play.
There will be no charge for admission.
The Interplayers in SF have announced that they will perform a
revival of Aristophanes 2,400 year old bawdy classic, LYSISTRATA,
on Friday, March 17, at 8:30 p.m. Better catch their act while this
play is still around.
The American Conservatory Theater's madcap satirical revue,
BEYOND THE FINGE, is returning to the Midpeninsula on March
31 and April 1. Those who are still in the Midpeninsula on these
dates will probably be feeling beyond the fringe anyway, but you
can see the show at the Palo Alto High School Auditorium at 7:45
and 10:45 each night.
MOVIES
FUNERAL IN BERLIN is a sequel of sorts to "The Iprcress File,"
and once again stars the finagaling philanderer Michael Caine as a
calm, cool and collected cockney super-agent. Lots of fun at the
Park and the Belmont.
Critic Pauline Keal aptly described Michelangelo Antonioni's
BLOW-UP as "a dehumanized study in dehumanization " Those of
you who have read or heard the exultations of other critics will
probably think it's the profundest, however. Especially for dead
beats at the Tivoli.
MUSIC
On April 1 rock and roller Johnny Rivers will be at the Berkeley
Community Theater, singing BABY I NEED YOUR LOVIN' for
those who are still around. Me, I plan to get my lovin' in Tijuana
this vacation.
