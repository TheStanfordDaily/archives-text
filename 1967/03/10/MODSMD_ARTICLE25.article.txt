" ORANGEBURG, S.C. (AP)—
South Carolina State College
students, threatened with dis
missal if they don't return to
asses, agreed today to "stand
f*st, hold our ground, and
our position."
Student leader Isaac Williams
Called the dismissal threat

issued Wednesday by Gov. Rob
ert McNair, the trustees and
college president B. C. Turner,
"another ultimatum trying to
scare us."
At issue in the class boycott
which is 90 per cent effective is
the re-admittance of three stu
dents who were dismissed from

the predominantly Negro school
two weeks ago as a result of a
demonstration against student
rules.
"The Trustees said they were
going to close the college if the
regular routine wasn't re
sumed," Williams reminded a
crowd of some 500 yesterday.

"Well, it wasn't resumed, so
now they've just issued another
ultimatum."
Referring to the president as
"Tom" Turner, Williams said,
"I bet all he said to the Gov
ernor yesterday (Wednesday)
was 'un huh.'"
"Our president doesn't know

how to be a Negro. He doesn't
know what our parents have
sacrificed—and for what?— a
second rate education."
"This whole thing is the re
sult of the educational deprava
tion of the Negroes of this
state," Williams exclaimed.
