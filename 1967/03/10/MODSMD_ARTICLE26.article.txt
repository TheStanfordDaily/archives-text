# Princeton May End Bickers, Go Coed

- PRINCETON, N.J. (AP)—A
faculty group has called for es
tablishment of coeducation and
an end to Princeton University's
exclusive dining club system as
.remedies for "an unhealthful
climate."
The call was contained in an
xB-page interim report by a four
man subcommittee of Prince
ton's Faculty Committee on Un
dergraduate Life.
'* The subcommittee was orig
/ lally formed to study "Bicker,"
;the campus name for the week
'ong series of interviews con
flicted by members of the Uni
versity's 15 dining clubs to
screen candidates for member
-ship. Princeton does not have
[fraternities.
"Bicker"—no one knows how
the name got started—has long
*>een a subject of controversy
at the 221-year-old University.
It was one of the many college
• institutions assailed by Wood
, row Wilson when he served as
oresident of Princeton in 1907,
; *nd received nationwide atten
tion in 1957 when surveys dis
posed that three quarters of the
rejected candidates were Jew
ish.

The new report assailed both
"Bicker" and the dining clubs on
the ground they tend to per
petuate the least desirable
aspects of club life—emphasis on
consensus and conformity and
a tendency to produce over
homogeneous groups.
It also called for establish
ment of coeducation on the
grounds that students at the all
male University had minimal op

portunities for the less formal
kinds of intellectual and so
cial companionship with young
women.
The report is being distributed
to faculty and students on the
campus this week and, after go
ing before the full Faculty Com
mittee on Undergraduate Life,
probably will be submitted to the
University trustees.
