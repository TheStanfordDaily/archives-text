## 'War Supporters Will Listen, Discuss' 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In your editorial of March 7,
you said, "The reception given
to Senator Hatfield clearly de
monstrates that fair discussion
is not in jeopardy here, and, in
particular, that its preservation
hinges as much on the openness
of the speaker as on the atti
tude of the audience." B.S.
Senator Hatfield was well re
ceived because his views are
similar to thoso of many stu
dents, staff, and faculty mem
bers here, while, o/i the other
hand, Vice President Hum
phrey's "reception" was gen
erally hostile because they don't
agree with the Johnson Admin
istration on the conduct of the
war in Vietnam.
The Vice President's speech
was reportedly full of lies and
half-truths, and the same c?n
be said about Senator Hatfield's
speech. It is merely a matter
of opinion.
There wasn't a walkout, or
heckling, or any other type of
harrassment at the Sneator's
speech. The people who sup
port the war have not felt the
need to speak out. They are
willing to listen to the other
side and discuss the problem
rationally.
The people who feel the war
is "illegal, immoral, etc." appar
ently have an insatiable desire
to make themselves heard. In
fact, they talk so much that
they don't have the time or are
unwilling to listen to the other
side.
People who are against the
war, no matter what their reas
ons are, seem to get very emo
tional when the subject is
brought up. They believe that
their opinoins are right, and any
other point of view is wrong.
Anyone who disagrees with
them must be ignorant, a liar,
or a hypocrite, and, therefore,
it is a waste of time to listen
to them.
Those who walked out on
Vice President Humphrey, for
instance, renounced their right
to free, open, rational discus
sion They apparently felt that,
since they did not agree with
him and they know what is
right, it wasn't worth their
while to stay to listen to his
speech.
It seems very strange, in
deed, that members of the Stan
ford community would be pre
sumptuous enough to suppose
that they know more about the
war than the Vice President of
the United States.

• In The Daily?
Editor, The Daily:
As a faculty member con
cerned with fair play as well as
with issues I should like to say
something which seems to get
expressed very rarely in The
Daily: a word of appreciation
for the leadership which Presi
dent Sterling has given Stan
ford during his years in office.
To say that we have always
agreed would be less than fair
to both of us, but to indicate, as
Mr. Kast did in his letter of

March 7th, that while Mr. Ster
ling has done pretty well in
terms of money and buildings
he has been deficient in educa
tional leadership is grossly to
distort the picture of an ad
ministration which has helped
Stanford reach new high levels
of achievement and has made
it, presumably, the kind of uni
versity which Mr. Kast thought
he wanted to attend.
Nor do I think that the kind
of instant perfection which Mr.
Kast wishes for an imperfect
world would be reached by hav
ing the university, through its
president, abandon its role of
ensuring an open forum for all
kinds of debate, in order to take
official positions on each matter
of public policy.
I am hopeful that Mr. Sterling
will not feel compelled to take
Mr. Kast's suggestion that he
resign.

• Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
Because questions have been
raised about admission to Me
morial Auditorium for the ap
pearance of Vice President Hum
phrey, it may be a service to
your readers to present clearly
and concisely the exact proce
dures which were used in han
dling attendance. These proce
dures were based, of course,
upon the realization that far
more would want to hear the
Vice President than could be ac
commodated in Memorial Audi
torium with its 1700 seat capac
ity.
The building was cleared Sun
day night and all entrances were
controlled after that time. Thus
it is possible to say with pre
cision exactly who was admitted,
where, and for what purpose.
Attendance at the convocation
was limited, as announced, to
members of the University com
munity: faculty, students and

staff. Identifications were
checked at the front door which
accounts in major part for the
slowness with which the audi
torium filled.
• With the exception of the three
special groups named below, all
admission was on a first come,
first served basis. This admis
sion was only via the four front
doors to Memorial Auditorium.
The three groups given special
passes included (a) the press,
(b) student ushers and special
guests of the political union who
had been invited to a reception
which had to be canceled be
cause of the Vice President's
schedule, and (c) faculty and
staff of the University involved
in the Vice President's visit.
In total, there were 87 seats
reserved in two special sections,
one of these for students and
the other for faculty and staff.
Of this total, 39 seats in the
front, center section were set
aside for two student groups:
about 19 for ushers and pages
(some of whom stood instead of
sitting thus causing a few va
cant seats) and 20 for Political
Union special invitees, including
the student body president and
the speaker of the legislature.
The special faculty section to
taled 48 seats. It included nine
members of the Food Research
Institute who participated in a
briefing requested by Mr. Hum
phrey, nine foreign visitors and
their escorts, seven leaders of
the faculty group who passed
out leaflets urging a silent pro
test, nine members of the Hum
phrey party and local Demo
cratic officials, and 16 faculty
and officials of the university
who had some part in Mr. Hum
phrey's visit.
In addition to these groups,
a total of 70 seats were set aside
for approximately 100 newsmen,
including students, who covered
the event. In addition, one row
of the balcony was used for 12
TV cameras. All these individ
uals were personally identified

and checked by the Secret Ser
vice and campus police.
Most of the students and those
in the special faculty section
were admitted through the en
trance nearest the Green Room
on the Graduate School of Busi
ness side of Memorial Auditor
ium. Members of the press were
admitted through the entrance
on the opposite side of the audi
torium.
To the best of our knowledge
—and this is confirmed by the
press and by persons stationed
at each of the doors —the more
than 1,500 seats remaining were
filled entirely by those who en
tered through the front en
trance.
Three Santa Clara County po
lice officers, the director of the
student police, and an employee
of the Stanford Repertory Thea
ter who was working in the
Box Office in the lobby have
stated categorically that they
saw no one enter from the side
entrances to the lobby. Further
more, had any large group of in
dividuals been seated on a privi
leged basis in advance, this
would have been immediately ap
parent to the newsmen who were
in the building from about 8:30
a m. on.
If any individual has firm,
factual evidence contrary to
these statements, we would ap
preciate receiving it in writing.

• More Concern
Editor, The Daily:
Because of the nature of our
discipline we are especially con
cerned with the issues raised
by President Sterling's letter.
We doubt whether a fair ap
praisal of the evidence justifies
the suggestion that the demon
stration following Vice Pres
ident Humphrey's speech ap
proached the status of mob
violence. We question whether
his concern for the right of free

speech can be best served by
threats directed against those
who are apparently exercising
that right. We resent the impli
cation that his concern for free
speech exceeds that of those
who disagree with his appraisal
of the demonstration. Let us
assure President Sterling that
we share the revulsion of those
who were dismayed by the Vice
President's speech and conse
quently chose decency before
decorum.

• Polarization
Editor, The Daily:
Although I wore a white arm
band on Wednesday and defend
the right of those who choose to
wear black ones, I am deeply
distressed by the intense pw.a
ization which this produces,
breaking the academic commu
nitv into two disjointed, self
righteous and non-communicat
ing groups.
Therefore I propose that next
Wednesday everyone concerned
about the Vietnam question
should make every effort to com
municate with those who are ex
pressing an opposite commit
ment, or indeed, to sway the un
committed majority. The dialo
gue which could ensue is likely
to be far more constructive than
the continuing division of our so
ciety into hostile and misunder
stood fragments.
