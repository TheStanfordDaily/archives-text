# Two Minutes of Haight
## How Many Roads Can A Man Walk Down? 
### Tim Haight 
Bob Dylan wrote, "Blowin' in
the wind" lour or five years
ago, in the halcyon days of folk
music. The words of that song,
intoned with the whining sin
cerity of Peter, Paul, and Mary,
are out of style now. It's em
harassing, almost painful, to
hear it again.
Freshmen here now were only
wee teeny-boppers then, and for
me the song conjures up visions
of the old linoleum and concrete
halls of Wilbur. Dylan himself
has gone on to other thingsâ€”
acid lyrics, motorcycle acci
dents, maybe smack.
He commented on the change
in his thinking in one song,
saying, "But I was so much
older then, I'm younger than

that now." Good for him. Some
of us, however, just feel older.
People aren't singing about
killing any more. It's out of
vogue. Perhaps it was too sim
ple, too easy. Five years ago,
Ngo Dinh Diem was in the pal
ace and all was right with the
world. John Kennedy was alive
and people were still talking
about the New Frontier.
Now we have all walked down
a few more roads, seen live TV
shots of a few more cannon
balls, and body-counted a few
more deaths. The American
public and probably the major
ity of students on this campus
support the Administration's po
sition on Vietnam or desire a
more aggressive one.

The New Leftists have tried
teach-ins. So many of us have
feet of books about Vietnam.
The number of anti-war publica
tions is beyond counting. We
have marched, picketed, thrown
ourselves in front of troop
trains (napalm trucks, Hum
phrey's car), and exhausted the
number of tactics to make our
feelings known.
We have grown tired of ex
plaining the holes in the 1965
White Paper, noting the timing
of the bombing versus the pres
ence of North Vietnamese
troops in the South, discussing
"Kill" figures, infiltration fig
ures, and estimates of enemy
strength to prove that the ma
jor power of the "enemy" in
Vietnam is indigenous to the
South.
We have tired of listing new
failures of pacification, chronicl
ing the toll upon the morals and
economy of Saigon, or compar
ing the number of civilian wom
en and children killed to the
number of Viet Cong killed.
Even the story in yesterday's
Chronicle, where a Marine has
been tried for killing a Vietna
mese civilian and cutting off his
ear for a trophy, now evokes
only a "How about that?" We
are "the shockproof generation."
We have given up, dropped
acid, dropped out, only to watch
Reagan get elected, the war es
calate further, and the voice of
the Right become more trium
phant.
And, with the coming of Vice
President Humphrey, we have

demonstrated again, not out of
indignation, not out of hope
even, but out of the realization
that even ordinary politeness to
a symbol of the war would be
misconstrued as support
Our frustration has divided our
ranks. If everybody had agreed
to walk out of the auditorium,
the later shouting and running
might not have been necessary.
If we had even known that the
only way to make an effective
demonstration would be at the
time of Humphrey's exit, we
could have been more organized
and orderly.
But we didn't agree. And we
overestimated the number of
people in the auditorium who
were opposed to the war. Per
haps we had forgotten that our
own vocal nature can drown out
the snores of silent thousands.
It would be nice to say that
we'll do better next time. No
body likes violence. Perhaps the
fear of lack of organization will
pull protest together on this cam
pus. Perhaps Humphrey has
given us that much.
We live in a democracy, with
rules about majority rule. Per
haps we are being poor sports
about our failure to arouse the
American "conscience" we
thought existed. But the spectre
of the Nuremburg trials haunts
us.
And somewhere in the back
of our minds we still hear that
almost forgotten question about
"how many roads can a man
walk down?"
