# $110,000 From Tuition
## ASSU Is Big Business 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
Few people realize how big a busi
ness the Associated Students of Stan
ford University is. And very few peo
ple know where the money comes
from to finance the student body or
where it goes.
The money to support the student
body comes from the administration.
For every student registered at Stan
ford the administration gives the stu
dent body three dollars per quarter.
Included in this are those who attend
summer quarter. This amounts to ap
proximately $110,000.00, compared to
a budget of about $130,000.00
The difference comes from three
sources. First, profit on the Sunday
movies, investment earnings, and the
surplus from the 1965-66 budget. Of
the $190,000 invested over the years
by the A.S.SU. $160,000 is invested
by the university in the university
pool of investments.
Financial Advisor
The money is spent in accordance
with a budget set by the legislature
from the year before. The legislature
is relatively free to spend the money
as it sees fit. Dean Smith serves as
financial advisor as provided in the
constitution and by-laws of the student
body.
He expressed his duty as simply
overseeing the student body finances
to see that they are being handled
in a business-like manner, and to guide
the formation of a comprehensive
financial program. Only under very
extraordinary conditions would the

Dean step in and actually advise the
legislature on specific financial issues.
Thus the control of the student
body funds is in the hands of the leg
islature, which establishes a budget
in the spring. The student financial
manager handles the funds and is re
sponsible both to Dean Smith and to
the legislature.
Fee Increase
The legislature recently recommend
ed a raise in the quarterly fee from
three to four dollars. This is to cover
the increase in expenditures not met
by the increase in enrollment. How
ever this is not expected to meet
with university approval since their

budget is already quite tight.
The main problem involved with
student finances is simply the lack of
funds. Two years ago it was neces
sary to raise the quarterly fee from
two to three dollars, and it appears
that if the student body wants to ex
pand the number of subsidized proj
ects, it will again have to raise the
fee sometime in the near future
The student body is not held back
by the university administration,
from whom it receives over 90 per
cent of its money. For the money is
given with few strings attached, and
the legislature is free to develop and
finance new projects.

pool of investments.
Financial Advisor
The money is spent in accordance
with a budget set by the legislature
from the year before. The legislature
is relatively free to spend the money
as it sees fit. Dean Smith serves as
financial advisor as provided in the
constitution and by-laws of the student
body.
He expressed his duty as simply
overseeing the student body finances
to see that they are being handled
in a business-like manner, and to guide
the formation of a comprehensive
financial program. Only under very
extraordinary conditions would the

Dean step in and actually advise the
legislature on specific financial issues.
Thus the control of the student
body funds is in the hands of the leg
islature, which establishes a budget
in the spring. The student financial
manager handles the funds and is re
sponsible both to Dean Smith and to
the legislature.
Fee Increase
The legislature recently recommend
ed a raise in the quarterly fee from
three to four dollars. This is to cover
the increase in expenditures not met
by the increase in enrollment. How
ever this is not expected to meet
with university approval since their

budget is already quite tight.
The main problem involved with
student finances is simply the lack of
funds. Two years ago it was neces
sary to raise the quarterly fee from
two to three dollars, and it appears
that if the student body wants to ex
pand the number of subsidized proj
ects, it will again have to raise the
fee sometime in the near future
The student body is not held back
by the university administration,
from whom it receives over 90 per
cent of its money. For the money is
given with few strings attached, and
the legislature is free to develop and
finance new projects.
Few people realize how big a busi
ness the Associated Students of Stan
ford University is. And very few peo
ple know where the money comes
from to finance the student body or
where it goes.
The money to support the student
body comes from the administration.
For every student registered at Stan
ford the administration gives the stu
dent body three dollars per quarter.
Included in this are those who attend
summer quarter. This amounts to ap
proximately $110,000.00, compared to
a budget of about $130,000.00
The difference comes from three
sources. First, profit on the Sunday
movies, investment earnings, and the
surplus from the 1965-66 budget. Of
the $190,000 invested over the years
by the A.S.SU. $160,000 is invested
by the university in the university
pool of investments.
