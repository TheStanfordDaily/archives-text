# IFC Symposium To Study Charges
## 
### 
The Inter-Fraternity Council is not
taking a defensive attitude about the
alleged educational inadequacies of
fraternities reported by the ASSU
Housing Commission, according to
IFC President Drennen Jones.
Jones gave The Daily the following
statement: "The Inter â€¢ Fraternity
Board welcomed and considered the re
port of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion and decided that the issues raised
by the report should be included in
the Inter-Fraternity Council Spring
Symposium. The agenda for the sym
posium will also include consideration
of the pending report of the Inter-
Fraternity Council Steering Commit
tee on these and other important is
sues."
Both Dean Smith and Dean Hanson
told The Daily that they felt the
ASSU Housing Commission's report
raised questions worth further con
sideration.
With respect to charges of hazing
made in the Commission's report,
Dean Joel Smith said that this is
"thoroughly intolerant" systematic
humiliation of other people," and
plans "to take an appropriate course
of action." Dean Smith also said that
he was "distressed by possible irreg
ularities in the writing of the report."
