# Lyman Admits Lack Of Evidence For Proposed Disciplinary Action
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
No concrete evidence has turned
up so far that would warrant disciplin
ing any anti-Humphrey demonstra
tors, Provost Richard Lyman said yes
terday.
Lyman met in the afternoon with
a group of 35 to 40 Stanford students
and faculty who marched from the
Experiment building to President Wal
lace Sterling's office and presented a
letter which read in part: "If you
know the 'ringleaders'; know none is
a student; know of violent acts; we
demand you make public such knowl
edge. If you don't have such knowl
edge, we demand that you publicly re
fute Vice President Humphrey's lies."
The letter referred to statements
by Humphrey, quoted in U.S. News

an<l World Report, that the demonstra
tion against him here two and a half
weeks ago was characterized by vio
lence and "hooligans."
Sterling Resj)onsible?
Since Sterling was sick in bed, the
letter was received by Provost Rich
ard Lyman, who then conferred with
several of the protesters. Lyman
said he did not see how Sterling
could be held responsible for state
ments made by Humphrey.
In a letter to U.S. News, Humphrey
stated, "There were no students
among the ringleaders." And he made
reference to "off-campus-militant ir
responsibility stirring up legitimate
student concerns." Mary Hanson, who
gave the protesters' letter to Lyman,
said, "The concept that (the demon
stration) was organized is false. There
weren't any (ringleaders)."
Elaborating on the protesters' posi
tion, English Lecturer Jay Neuge
boren said, "We are demanding that
he (Sterling) make a public state
ment concerning these alleged outside
ringleaders." Lyman said that Hum
phrey's information came from the
Secret Service men guarding him,
and that, they have refused to release

specific information. As for whether
the University administration has any
information on whether the demon
stration was led by outsiders, Ly
man said simply, "We don't know."
An Apology Owed
Yesterday's march was organized
on an ad hoc basis by several stu
dents who have held a continued op
position to the Vietnam war. The
group began at the Experiment build
ing with about 30 participants. Some
carried signs reading "Truth," "You
owe us, not Humphrey, an apology,"
and "We are not non-students."
Others simply held up their student
body cards. By the time the group
reached inner quad, it had grown to
about 40 people.
The march and the meeting with
Lyman were ostensibly in protest
against Sterling's letter to all Stan
ford students, faculty and staff, in
which he expressed "my resolution
that intimidation or obstruction will
not be tolerated." The letter also
stated that "there was a threatening
degree of anger among many in the
crowd," and that disciplinary action
would be taken if the evidence war
ranted it.

In conference with Lyman, the pro
testers denied that the crowd en
dangered the Vice President and that
it was dominated by non-students and
outsiders. Neugeboren said Sterling's
letter "has reinforced statements of
Humphrey that we feel were not true,
and we want him to repudiate those
statements."
Accurate Account
Lyman replied that "one of the pur
poses of this letter was to present
what seemed to be the best, most
accurate general account that we
could give of what happened." Re
garding the civil disobedience, he
said, "An attempt to use physical
force—whether it's lying in front of
an automobile or whatever—has no
place on the campus and must not
be allowed. . . . People can lose their
rationality in a crowd, and that's
what we're worried about."
The protesters contended that the
demonstration was warranted as a
last resort in the face of what they
considered Humphrey's evasion of
the issue of the Vietnam war. "Free
dom to discuss does not depend on
decorum," said Miss Hanson. "It de
pends on honesty."
