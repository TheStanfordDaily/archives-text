# LASSU Votes For Presentation Of Student View Before Trustees
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH Legislative Correspondent 
Legislature voted unanimously last
night that two student representatives
be allowed to appear at Trustees meet
ings to present information on spe
cific issues of direct concern to stu
dents.

The students, specifically the ASSU
President and the Speaker of LASSU,
would report to the Trustees "when
charged by the Legislature."
"On the Board there is often a basic
misconception about the motivations
for student requests for changes,"
stated ASSU President Mike Collins.
"Students could present a different
perspective than what the President
of the University would give."
The procedure, according to Speak
er Tom Forstenzer, would be for stu
dents to arrange through President
Sterling to appear at Trustees meet
ings. "At present, there is absolutely
no mechanism for students to dis
cuss matters with the Board," For
stenzer said.
New Viewpoint
"This way, we can emphasize the
general student feeling of urgency
about a certain program," Collins
added. "It's one way of providing
them with more information and per
haps another point of view "
A change in the standing rules of
the Publications Board was also
passed unanimously. The bill changes
the composition of The Daily editorial
board and changes the salaries of edi
torial board members.
Legislature also voted to take any
money remaining after April 1 from
the funds previously appropriated to
underwrite the Grove House Experi
ment and re-appropriate it for mak
ing a film of the Grove Project.

Previously, the money was to have re
verted to contingency fund. The film
will be the joint property of the Com
munications Department and the
ASSU.

A bill to temporarily abolish the
Fundamental Standard was re-refer
red to the Fundamental Standard
Committee by the Speaker.
The purpose of the bill, according
to legislative sponsor Richard Gorln,
was to suspend until July 1, 1967, the
Fundamental Standard and all Ju
dicial Council decisions, except those
pertaining to the Honor Code, "as an
experiment."
"We didn't expect a sudden rush of
inappropriate behavior," Gorin added.
In referring the bill back to com
mittee, Speaker Forstenzer stated
that while he personally did not agree
with in loco parentis and the Funda
mental Standard as it currently reads,
"I think it can be reformed, even
revolutionized, without this type of
experiment. I think the basic idea of
changing the Fundamental Standard
deserves further consideration."
Finally, the Legislature refused to
discuss a proposal to appropriate
funds for a bi-weekly magazine sup
plement to The Dally.
The motion was tabled at last
week's meeting so that The Dally
could investigate outside sources of
financing. A motion to take the bill
from the table was defeated.

dicial Council decisions, except those
pertaining to the Honor Code, "as an
experiment."
"We didn't expect a sudden rush of
inappropriate behavior," Gorin added.
In referring the bill back to com
mittee, Speaker Forstenzer stated
that while he personally did not agree
with in loco parentis and the Funda
mental Standard as it currently reads,
"I think it can be reformed, even
revolutionized, without this type of
experiment. I think the basic idea of
changing the Fundamental Standard
deserves further consideration."
Finally, the Legislature refused to
discuss a proposal to appropriate
funds for a bi-weekly magazine sup
plement to The Dally.
The motion was tabled at last
week's meeting so that The Dally
could investigate outside sources of
financing. A motion to take the bill
from the table was defeated.
Legislature voted unanimously last
night that two student representatives
be allowed to appear at Trustees meet
ings to present information on spe
cific issues of direct concern to stu
dents.

The students, specifically the ASSU
President and the Speaker of LASSU,
would report to the Trustees "when
charged by the Legislature."
"On the Board there is often a basic
misconception about the motivations
for student requests for changes,"
stated ASSU President Mike Collins.
"Students could present a different
perspective than what the President
of the University would give."
The procedure, according to Speak
er Tom Forstenzer, would be for stu
dents to arrange through President
Sterling to appear at Trustees meet
ings. "At present, there is absolutely
no mechanism for students to dis
cuss matters with the Board," For
stenzer said.

"This way, we can emphasize the
general student feeling of urgency
about a certain program," Collins
added. "It's one way of providing
them with more information and per
haps another point of view "
A change in the standing rules of
the Publications Board was also
passed unanimously. The bill changes
the composition of The Daily editorial
board and changes the salaries of edi
torial board members.
Legislature also voted to take any
money remaining after April 1 from
the funds previously appropriated to
underwrite the Grove House Experi
ment and re-appropriate it for mak
ing a film of the Grove Project.

Previously, the money was to have re
verted to contingency fund. The film
will be the joint property of the Com
