# Resigning NSA Official Claims Group Lies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, (AP) — The Na
tional Students Association was ac
cused by a resigning official today of
showing little inclination to break its
financial ties with the Central Intel
ligence Agency.
Larry Rubin, 23, told reporters he
is quitting as Educational Affairs Di
rector of the NSA because he believes
its officers "lied to the staff" and to
the public about their relationship
with the CIA.
Rubin, who said he plans to re
turn to his studies at Antioch Col
lege, Yellow Springs, Ohio, challenged
the statement by NSA officers last
month that financial ties with the CIA
had ended last July. He said the CIA
still holds the lease on the Associa
tion's headquarters building, and he
declared the NSA shows "little in
clination" to make a break that would
cause it to "lose government funds
and favors."
Complete Independence
Greg Movsesyan, NSA press officer,
told newsmen the student group will
"accept any openly received funds
from government sources for specified
programs in which the Association has
complete independence in policy form
ulation and a desire to participate."
Rubin's blast coincided with the in
troduction of bills in Congress de
signed to correct the situation re
vealed with the disclosure that the
CIA had been secretly subsidizing the
student group and other private orga
nizations.
One bill, by Rep. William F. Ryan,
D-N.Y., would prohibit the CIA from
financing any domestic foundation or
philanthropic organization, labor
group, publishing concern, radio or
television operation or educational
group, including student or faculty
associations.
Open Support
Another bill, by Rep. John S. Mon
agan, D Conn, would create a fed
erally chartered corporation to spon
sor and openly support student and
other groups combating Communism.
Monagan said the "American In
ternational Cultural and Educational

Council"he proposes would support
organizations that "symbolize demo
cratic values" in the worldwide com
petition with Communist groups.
He said he hopes that the Council
could be supported by private funds
but if not his bill would authorize
Congressional appropriations.

In the Senate, it. was announced that
Sen. Lister Hill, D-Ala., has been added
to a special appropriations subcommit
tee on funds for the CIA.
The subcommittee, along with a
group from the Armed Services Com
mittee, serves as a watchdog on
CIA operations.

programs in which the Association has
complete independence in policy form
ulation and a desire to participate."
Rubin's blast coincided with the in
troduction of bills in Congress de
signed to correct the situation re
vealed with the disclosure that the
CIA had been secretly subsidizing the
student group and other private orga
nizations.
One bill, by Rep. William F. Ryan,
D-N.Y., would prohibit the CIA from
financing any domestic foundation or
philanthropic organization, labor
group, publishing concern, radio or
television operation or educational
group, including student or faculty
associations.
Open Support
Another bill, by Rep. John S. Mon
agan, D Conn, would create a fed
erally chartered corporation to spon
sor and openly support student and
other groups combating Communism.
Monagan said the "American In
ternational Cultural and Educational

Council"he proposes would support
organizations that "symbolize demo
cratic values" in the worldwide com
petition with Communist groups.
He said he hopes that the Council
could be supported by private funds
but if not his bill would authorize
Congressional appropriations.

In the Senate, it. was announced that
Sen. Lister Hill, D-Ala., has been added
to a special appropriations subcommit
tee on funds for the CIA.
The subcommittee, along with a
group from the Armed Services Com
mittee, serves as a watchdog on
CIA operations.
WASHINGTON, (AP) — The Na
tional Students Association was ac
cused by a resigning official today of
showing little inclination to break its
financial ties with the Central Intel
ligence Agency.
Larry Rubin, 23, told reporters he
is quitting as Educational Affairs Di
rector of the NSA because he believes
its officers "lied to the staff" and to
the public about their relationship
with the CIA.
Rubin, who said he plans to re
turn to his studies at Antioch Col
lege, Yellow Springs, Ohio, challenged
the statement by NSA officers last
month that financial ties with the CIA
had ended last July. He said the CIA
still holds the lease on the Associa
tion's headquarters building, and he
declared the NSA shows "little in
clination" to make a break that would
cause it to "lose government funds
and favors."
Complete Independence
Greg Movsesyan, NSA press officer,
told newsmen the student group will
"accept any openly received funds
from government sources for specified
programs in which the Association has
complete independence in policy form
ulation and a desire to participate."
