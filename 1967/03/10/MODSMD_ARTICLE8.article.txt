# Lytton Criticizes Sterling's Letter; Humphrey Incident 'Not So Terrible'
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Stern Guest-in-Residence Bart
Lytton last "night took issue with
President Sterling's threats of pos
sible reprisals in his community let
ter concerning the Humphrey inci
dent.
"I am in essential agreement with
what Sterling had to say in terms of
the case he makes for restraint," said
Lytton, "but I must sharply disagree
with his last paragraph."
He called the conclusion of the let
ter a "threat" and a "presumption
that there was a design in the stu
dents' conduct worthy of post facto
discipline."
'A Closer Look'
Although Lytton stated that he did
not believe the reports of threatened
violence were true, he added that the
fact that there appeared to have been
such acts warranted a closer look at
the problem of control.

"Society has always been faced
with the problem of control," he said.
"By that I mean reasonable controls.
I am not against demonstrations. On
the contrary, I like to see a sense of
social conscience, especially in young
people. But social justice is not
achieved by a nation of rioters, or
when mob psychology takes over."
When Humphrey came to Stanford,
he said, it was "good that there were
demonstrations. But there are orderly
bounds to expression, and it seems
to me that these were crossed at
Stanford."
'Rousting: Abouff
"Whatever the actual facts may be,
there was a sense that there was
rousting about of the Vice President
of the United States and calling him
insulting names.
"Demonstrating, carrying picket
signs, shouting slogans, walking out
—these are all okay. But you can't
shout 'murderer' and expect most of
the people in the United States to
agree with you." This is disrespect
not only for the man but for the of
fice, he added.
Not Terrible
"I want to emphasize—l don't think
what happened was so terrible," he
said. He added that later this month
he plans to discuss the incident with
Humphrey.
He analogized Humphrey's situa
tion to that of a vice president in his
company who may disagree privately
but must repeat company policy in
public.

—these are all okay. But you can't
shout 'murderer' and expect most of
the people in the United States to
agree with you." This is disrespect
not only for the man but for the of
fice, he added.
Not Terrible
"I want to emphasize—l don't think
what happened was so terrible," he
said. He added that later this month
he plans to discuss the incident with
Humphrey.
He analogized Humphrey's situa
tion to that of a vice president in his
company who may disagree privately
but must repeat company policy in
public.
Stern Guest-in-Residence Bart
Lytton last "night took issue with
President Sterling's threats of pos
sible reprisals in his community let
ter concerning the Humphrey inci
dent.
"I am in essential agreement with
what Sterling had to say in terms of
the case he makes for restraint," said
Lytton, "but I must sharply disagree
with his last paragraph."
He called the conclusion of the let
ter a "threat" and a "presumption
that there was a design in the stu
dents' conduct worthy of post facto
discipline."
'A Closer Look'
Although Lytton stated that he did
not believe the reports of threatened
violence were true, he added that the
fact that there appeared to have been
such acts warranted a closer look at
the problem of control.

"Society has always been faced
with the problem of control," he said.
"By that I mean reasonable controls.
I am not against demonstrations. On
the contrary, I like to see a sense of
social conscience, especially in young
people. But social justice is not
achieved by a nation of rioters, or
when mob psychology takes over."
When Humphrey came to Stanford,
he said, it was "good that there were
demonstrations. But there are orderly
bounds to expression, and it seems
to me that these were crossed at
Stanford."
'Rousting: Abouff
"Whatever the actual facts may be,
there was a sense that there was
rousting about of the Vice President
of the United States and calling him
insulting names.
"Demonstrating, carrying picket
signs, shouting slogans, walking out
—these are all okay. But you can't
shout 'murderer' and expect most of
the people in the United States to
agree with you." This is disrespect
not only for the man but for the of
fice, he added.
