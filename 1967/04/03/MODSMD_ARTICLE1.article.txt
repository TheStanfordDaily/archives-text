## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
EAST LANSING, Mich., Mar. 26—
Stanford swimmers rocked the boat at
the NCAA Championships until they
threw the whole country overboard.
Coach Jim Gaughran's Indians pad
dled home from Michigan State with
Stanford's first national collegiate ti
tle in 15 years, and six of the meet's
13 new NCAA records.
Stanford scored 275 points to beat
defending champion USC's 260 and
outswim Indiana's 249.
Greg Buckingham and Dick Roth
each broke two NCAA records and
the Indians' 400 and 800 freestyle re
lays both destroyed the previous
American records. The Indians cleared
the boards of all but one Stanford
record.
Nation's Fastest Sprinters
Luis Nicolao (46.9), Bill Meyer
(45.8), Morgan Manning (46.1), and
Jim Laney (46.1) left Yale's old 400
free relay record of seconds in the
lurch with a sparkling 3:04.9.
Buckingham anchored Stanford's
800 free relay with the fastest 200 in
swimming history, 1:40.8, to pull Stan
ford to an American record 6:54.5.
Roth led off in 1:46.1, Pete Siebert hit

1:43.7, and Mike Wall threw in a
1:43.9 to set the stage.
Buckingham beat Yale's Don Schol
lander in the 200 freestyle in the
American record time of 1:41.3. Buck
ingham previously demolished his own
500 free record by 4 seconds with a
4:37.0. Buckingham, who also holds
the NCAA record for 1000 free, took
second in the 1650 with a 16:31.7 ef
fort.
IM King
Roth swam away with two individ
ual medley crowns. Roth won the 200
IM in 1:56.0 to undercut Bucking
ham's American record and reassert
ed his domination over the 400 IM
with a NCAA record 4:12.0. Roth's
1:57.9 200 backstroke was good for
sixth place and a Stanford record.
Mike Wall, who started the season
with pneumonia, upset applecarts
everywhere as he turned in the fast
est times of his life to take third in
the 1650 (16:37.0), fifth in the 200
free (1:43.8), and sixth in the 500
(4:44.2).

Ross Wales in the 100 butterfly in
50.9. Nicolao, world record holder for
100 meters butterfly, hit 49.5 for his

butterfly leg of the medley relay and
placed sixth in the 200 fly in 1:54.6.
Bob Momsen repeated last year's
runner-up performance in the 200
breaststroke. Momsen's 2:10.4 knocked
off defending champion Wayne An
derson of USC and would have tied
the NCAA record had SMU's Ken
Merten not swum him fantastic 2:07.9.
Momsen swam 1:00.1 in the medley
relay and hit 1:01.1 for ninth place in
the 100 breaststroke.
Pete Siebert left mouths agape with
his 1:57.2 third place in the 200 IM.
Siebert also took fifth in the 400 IM
in 4:15.0, blasting his last 100 in 55.0.
Siebert's 1:43.7 800 relay split bettered
his previous best 200 time by more
than 4 seconds.
Meyer Sprints
Bill Meyer's 45.8 100 put Stanford's
400 free relay ahead to stay. Meyer
upset North Carolina's touted Steve
Rerych to win the consolation final of
the 100 freestyle in 47.1.
Jim Laney, team captain and the
only senior on the NCAA squad, an
chored both the 400 medley and 400
free relays and took ninth in the 100
