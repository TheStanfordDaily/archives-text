# Stanford Swimmers Win First NCAA Title
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
EAST LANSING, Mich., Mar. 26—
Stanford swimmers rocked the boat at
the NCAA Championships until they
threw the whole country overboard.
Coach Jim Gaughran's Indians pad
dled home from Michigan State with
Stanford's first national collegiate ti
tle in 15 years, and six of the meet's
13 new NCAA records.
Stanford scored 275 points to beat
defending champion USC's 260 and
outswim Indiana's 249.
Greg Buckingham and Dick Roth
each broke two NCAA records and
the Indians' 400 and 800 freestyle re
lays both destroyed the previous
American records. The Indians cleared
the boards of all but one Stanford
record.
Nation's Fastest Sprinters
Luis Nicolao (46.9), Bill Meyer
(45.8), Morgan Manning (46.1), and
Jim Laney (46.1) left Yale's old 400
free relay record of seconds in the
lurch with a sparkling 3:04.9.
Buckingham anchored Stanford's
800 free relay with the fastest 200 in
swimming history, 1:40.8, to pull Stan
ford to an American record 6:54.5.
Roth led off in 1:46.1, Pete Siebert hit

1:43.7, and Mike Wall threw in a
1:43.9 to set the stage.
Buckingham beat Yale's Don Schol
lander in the 200 freestyle in the
American record time of 1:41.3. Buck
ingham previously demolished his own
500 free record by 4 seconds with a
4:37.0. Buckingham, who also holds
the NCAA record for 1000 free, took
second in the 1650 with a 16:31.7 ef
fort.
IM King
Roth swam away with two individ
ual medley crowns. Roth won the 200
IM in 1:56.0 to undercut Bucking
ham's American record and reassert
ed his domination over the 400 IM
with a NCAA record 4:12.0. Roth's
1:57.9 200 backstroke was good for
sixth place and a Stanford record.
Mike Wall, who started the season
with pneumonia, upset applecarts
everywhere as he turned in the fast
est times of his life to take third in
the 1650 (16:37.0), fifth in the 200
free (1:43.8), and sixth in the 500
(4:44.2).
Nicolao took second to Princeton's
Ross Wales in the 100 butterfly in
50.9. Nicolao, world record holder for
100 meters butterfly, hit 49.5 for his

butterfly leg of the medley relay and
placed sixth in the 200 fly in 1:54.6.
Bob Momsen repeated last year's
runner-up performance in the 200
breaststroke. Momsen's 2:10.4 knocked
off defending champion Wayne An
derson of USC and would have tied
the NCAA record had SMU's Ken
Merten not swum him fantastic 2:07.9.
Momsen swam 1:00.1 in the medley
relay and hit 1:01.1 for ninth place in
the 100 breaststroke.
Pete Siebert left mouths agape with
his 1:57.2 third place in the 200 IM.
Siebert also took fifth in the 400 IM
in 4:15.0, blasting his last 100 in 55.0.
Siebert's 1:43.7 800 relay split bettered
his previous best 200 time by more
than 4 seconds.
Meyer Sprints
Bill Meyer's 45.8 100 put Stanford's
400 free relay ahead to stay. Meyer
upset North Carolina's touted Steve
Rerych to win the consolation final of
the 100 freestyle in 47.1.
Jim Laney, team captain and the
only senior on the NCAA squad, an
chored both the 400 medley and 400
free relays and took ninth in the 100
freestyle in 47.2.
Stanford's medley relay took fourth
in 3:32.0 behind UCLA's Ameri
can record 3:29.5. Bill Kee led
off in 55.9, followed by Momsen
(60.1) Nicolao (50.5), and Laney
(46.5).
Rolling Start
Buckingham and Wall got the
meet off to an auspicious start
in the 500. Buckingham, who
set a 4:40.9 record in the pre
lims, took out his first 200 in
1:46.0 and held a 57.0 pace for

the next 300 yards for the 4:37.0
record-smasher.
Roth and Siebert, both sopho
mores, took a gilded 1-3 in the
next event, the 200 IM.
The Indians swallowed a set
back in the 50 as Meyer, who
swam 21.3 in warm-up, disquali
fied on 2 false starts.
Stanford's fourth place In the
medley relay left the Tribe in
third place, 8 points away from
the leader USC. In the second

day the Indians took a slim 1
point lead over Southern Cal
while Indiana, sans diving, fell
23 points off pace.
Buck Beats Schollander
Buckingham got the day start
ed with his victory over Schol
lander in the 200 free. Both
swimmers, teammates during
the summer, bumped Scholland
er's old American record of
1:41.7. Wall took fifth for a
bumper point crop.
Nicolao's sixth in the 200 fly
and Momsen's ninth in the 100
breast kept the Indians within
range of the leaders.
Then came the 400 IM with
Roth and Siebert holding their
own against 5 USC qualifiers.
A deafening Stanford chant
heralded perhaps the surprise of
the meet. Stanford had set a
record 3:07.0 for the 400 free
relay in the prelims, but that
was regarded as a fluke—Yale
and USC were the teams to
watch. Then the fireworks be
gan.
Maximum Effort
Nicolao led off the Stanford
relay in 46.9. He missed his
first turn nearly completely, but
buried his head and brought
back his second 50 as fast as the
first (23.4—23.5) — and then
passed out on the deck.
Bill Meyer took off and never
stopped, as he opened up a criti
cal length lead over Yale and
USC. Meyer's 45.8 preempted his
previous best this season of 49.4.
Morgan Manning swam the
fastest in his life, 46.1, to stretch
Meyer's lead. Laney flashed to
a 46.1 on the anchor leg to pre

vail over Schollander (45.4) and
USC's Don Havens, who swam
an unbelievable 44.8.
Stanford's 3:04.9 averages 46.2
per man, .6 second per man fast
er than the old record of 3:07.2.
Mutterings of disbelief mingled
with Stanford shrieks after the
race . . . Stanford went 3:32 two
weeks ago in the AAWU's at
Oregon.
Stanford's relay victory put
the Cards into the lead and op
ened the nation's eyes, but one
local newspaper still advertised
a "tight two-way duel between
USC and Indiana for the cham
pionship."
Buckingham and Wall went
2-3 in the arduous 1650 to start
the final day of competition.
Buckingham stayed with
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton for 1100 yards, but
then the Bruin moved out
towards his American record
16:17.5.
Bulldog in the Water
Wall, in fifth place after 500
yards, swam a Winston Chur
chill 1650. Wall gained 6 inches
every length to beat Michigan's
Carl Robie and USCs Steve Dan
ielson for third place. Wall's
16:37 0 would have been an
NCAA record three weeks ago.
The deciding point of the
meet may have come in the 100
freestyle. Meyer and Laney, who
had qualified fourth and sixth
in the consolation final, moved
up to first and third. Mean
while, in the championship fi
nal, Michigan State's Ken Walsh
beat USC's Havens with a rec
ord-tying 45.6.

Roth took sixth in the 200
back. Momsen and Nicolao both
picked up second places, beating
their USC opponents to pad
Stanford's point cushion.
No Way For Second
The final event of the NCAA's,
the 800 free relay (4x200),
looked for 775 yards as though
it belonged to Southern Cal.
Stanford could afford to take
third place and still win the
meet, but Roth, Siebert, Wall,
and Buckingham had different
ideas.
Roth led off for Stanford in
1:46.1, but ceded a 3 second de
ficit to USC's Dean Willeford.
Siebert then swam his beeline
1:43.7, but could not close the
gap. Wall, fresh out of the 1650,
cut the USC margin slightly
with a 1:43.9.
"I don't care if he's half a pool
ahead, I'm going after him," said
Greg Buckingham as he left two
body lengths behind USC's an
chor man Bill Johnson. John
son, who took third in the 200
free in 1:42.7, held his own for
150 yards.
Water Luau
At the 150, Buckingham
turned on a sprint that brought
the crowd to its feet. Buck
nearly caught him at the 175
and left the Trojan his Achilles
heels in the final lap. Out at the
100 in 48.9, Buckingham covered
the final 100 yards in 51.9, for a
1:40.8.
The first 12 places scored
points — in consolation and
championship finals—placing a
premium upon depth. USC's
great depth and dogged deter
mination brought Peter Da
land's Trojans within 15 points
of the championship without
winning a single first.
Sweet Revenge
The Stanford victory avenged
a healthy loss to Southern Cal
at the AAWU championships,
settled the score of a 52-52 dual
meet tie, and broke a string of
four straight USC champion
ships.
The West Coast's conditioning
and come-through efforts left
the rest of the country far in
the wake. Indiana's 75 points
in diving saved the pre-meet
favorites from a flame-out. UC
LA (148) set two American rec
ords to beat highly-regarded
Yale (135) and take fifth behind
fourth place Michigan (184).
The majority of the Stanford
swimmers seek berths on the
1967 Pan Am team at the Na

Wall, in fifth place after 500
yards, swam a Winston Chur
chill 1650. Wall gained 6 inches
every length to beat Michigan's
Carl Robie and USCs Steve Dan
ielson for third place. Wall's
16:37 0 would have been an
NCAA record three weeks ago.
The deciding point of the
meet may have come in the 100
freestyle. Meyer and Laney, who
had qualified fourth and sixth
in the consolation final, moved
up to first and third. Mean
while, in the championship fi

beat USC's Havens with a rec
ord-tying 45.6.

Roth took sixth in the 200

their USC opponents to pad
Stanford's point cushion.
No Way For Second
The final event of the NCAA's,
the 800 free relay (4x200),
looked for 775 yards as though
it belonged to Southern Cal.
Stanford could afford to take
third place and still win the
meet, but Roth, Siebert, Wall,
and Buckingham had different
ideas.
Roth led off for Stanford in
1:46.1, but ceded a 3 second de
ficit to USC's Dean Willeford.
Siebert then swam his beeline
1:43.7, but could not close the
gap. Wall, fresh out of the 1650,
cut the USC margin slightly
with a 1:43.9.
"I don't care if he's half a pool
ahead, I'm going after him," said
Greg Buckingham as he left two
body lengths behind USC's an

free in 1:42.7, held his own for
150 yards.

At the 150, Buckingham
turned on a sprint that brought
the crowd to its feet. Buck
nearly caught him at the 175
and left the Trojan his Achilles
heels in the final lap. Out at the
100 in 48.9, Buckingham covered
the final 100 yards in 51.9, for a
1:40.8.
The first 12 places scored
points — in consolation and
championship finals—placing a
premium upon depth. USC's
great depth and dogged deter

of the championship without
winning a single first.
Sweet Revenge
The Stanford victory avenged
a healthy loss to Southern Cal
at the AAWU championships,
settled the score of a 52-52 dual

four straight USC champion
ships.
The West Coast's conditioning

the rest of the country far in

defending champion USC's 260 and
outswim Indiana's 249.
Greg Buckingham and Dick Roth
each broke two NCAA records and
the Indians' 400 and 800 freestyle re

Nation's Fastest Sprinters
Luis Nicolao (46.9), Bill Meyer

1:57.9 200 backstroke was good for
sixth place and a Stanford record.
Mike Wall, who started the season
with pneumonia, upset applecarts
everywhere as he turned in the fast
est times of his life to take third in
the 1650 (16:37.0), fifth in the 200
free (1:43.8), and sixth in the 500
(4:44.2).
Nicolao took second to Princeton's
Ross Wales in the 100 butterfly in
50.9. Nicolao, world record holder for
100 meters butterfly, hit 49.5 for his

butterfly leg of the medley relay and
placed sixth in the 200 fly in 1:54.6.
Bob Momsen repeated last year's
runner-up performance in the 200
breaststroke. Momsen's 2:10.4 knocked
off defending champion Wayne An
derson of USC and would have tied
the NCAA record had SMU's Ken
Merten not swum him fantastic 2:07.9.
Momsen swam 1:00.1 in the medley
relay and hit 1:01.1 for ninth place in
the 100 breaststroke.

Siebert's 1:43.7 800 relay split bettered
his previous best 200 time by more
than 4 seconds.
Meyer Sprints
Bill Meyer's 45.8 100 put Stanford's
400 free relay ahead to stay. Meyer
upset North Carolina's touted Steve

the 100 freestyle in 47.1.
Jim Laney, team captain and the
only senior on the NCAA squad, an
chored both the 400 medley and 400
free relays and took ninth in the 100

can record 3:29.5. Bill Kee led
off in 55.9, followed by Momsen
(60.1) Nicolao (50.5), and Laney
(46.5).
Rolling Start
Buckingham and Wall got the
meet off to an auspicious start
in the 500. Buckingham, who
set a 4:40.9 record in the pre
lims, took out his first 200 in
1:46.0 and held a 57.0 pace for

the next 300 yards for the 4:37.0
record-smasher.
Roth and Siebert, both sopho
mores, took a gilded 1-3 in the
next event, the 200 IM.
The Indians swallowed a set
back in the 50 as Meyer, who
swam 21.3 in warm-up, disquali
fied on 2 false starts.
Stanford's fourth place In the
medley relay left the Tribe in
third place, 8 points away from
the leader USC. In the second

day the Indians took a slim 1
point lead over Southern Cal
while Indiana, sans diving, fell
23 points off pace.
Buck Beats Schollander
Buckingham got the day start
ed with his victory over Schol
lander in the 200 free. Both
swimmers, teammates during
the summer, bumped Scholland
er's old American record of
1:41.7. Wall took fifth for a
bumper point crop.
Nicolao's sixth in the 200 fly
and Momsen's ninth in the 100
breast kept the Indians within
range of the leaders.
Then came the 400 IM with
Roth and Siebert holding their
own against 5 USC qualifiers.
A deafening Stanford chant
heralded perhaps the surprise of
the meet. Stanford had set a
record 3:07.0 for the 400 free
relay in the prelims, but that
was regarded as a fluke—Yale
and USC were the teams to
watch. Then the fireworks be
gan.
Maximum Effort
Nicolao led off the Stanford
relay in 46.9. He missed his
first turn nearly completely, but
buried his head and brought
back his second 50 as fast as the
first (23.4—23.5) — and then
passed out on the deck.
Bill Meyer took off and never
stopped, as he opened up a criti
cal length lead over Yale and
USC. Meyer's 45.8 preempted his
previous best this season of 49.4.
Morgan Manning swam the
fastest in his life, 46.1, to stretch
Meyer's lead. Laney flashed to
a 46.1 on the anchor leg to pre

vail over Schollander (45.4) and
USC's Don Havens, who swam
an unbelievable 44.8.
Stanford's 3:04.9 averages 46.2
per man, .6 second per man fast
er than the old record of 3:07.2.
Mutterings of disbelief mingled
with Stanford shrieks after the
race . . . Stanford went 3:32 two
weeks ago in the AAWU's at
Oregon.
Stanford's relay victory put
the Cards into the lead and op
ened the nation's eyes, but one
local newspaper still advertised
a "tight two-way duel between
USC and Indiana for the cham
pionship."
Buckingham and Wall went
2-3 in the arduous 1650 to start
the final day of competition.
Buckingham stayed with
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton for 1100 yards, but
then the Bruin moved out

1:46.0 and held a 57.0 pace for

the next 300 yards for the 4:37.0
record-smasher.
Roth and Siebert, both sopho
mores, took a gilded 1-3 in the
next event, the 200 IM.
The Indians swallowed a set
back in the 50 as Meyer, who
swam 21.3 in warm-up, disquali
fied on 2 false starts.
Stanford's fourth place In the
medley relay left the Tribe in
third place, 8 points away from
the leader USC. In the second

day the Indians took a slim 1
point lead over Southern Cal
while Indiana, sans diving, fell
23 points off pace.
Buck Beats Schollander
Buckingham got the day start
ed with his victory over Schol
lander in the 200 free. Both
swimmers, teammates during
the summer, bumped Scholland
er's old American record of
1:41.7. Wall took fifth for a
bumper point crop.
Nicolao's sixth in the 200 fly
and Momsen's ninth in the 100
breast kept the Indians within
range of the leaders.
Then came the 400 IM with
Roth and Siebert holding their
own against 5 USC qualifiers.
A deafening Stanford chant
heralded perhaps the surprise of
the meet. Stanford had set a
record 3:07.0 for the 400 free
relay in the prelims, but that
was regarded as a fluke—Yale
and USC were the teams to
watch. Then the fireworks be
gan.
Maximum Effort
Nicolao led off the Stanford
relay in 46.9. He missed his
first turn nearly completely, but
buried his head and brought
back his second 50 as fast as the
first (23.4—23.5) — and then
passed out on the deck.
Bill Meyer took off and never
stopped, as he opened up a criti
cal length lead over Yale and
USC. Meyer's 45.8 preempted his
previous best this season of 49.4.
Morgan Manning swam the
fastest in his life, 46.1, to stretch
Meyer's lead. Laney flashed to
a 46.1 on the anchor leg to pre

vail over Schollander (45.4) and
USC's Don Havens, who swam
an unbelievable 44.8.
Stanford's 3:04.9 averages 46.2
per man, .6 second per man fast
er than the old record of 3:07.2.
Mutterings of disbelief mingled
with Stanford shrieks after the
race . . . Stanford went 3:32 two
weeks ago in the AAWU's at
Oregon.
Stanford's relay victory put
the Cards into the lead and op
ened the nation's eyes, but one
local newspaper still advertised
a "tight two-way duel between
USC and Indiana for the cham
pionship."
Buckingham and Wall went
2-3 in the arduous 1650 to start
the final day of competition.
Buckingham stayed with
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton for 1100 yards, but
then the Bruin moved out
towards his American record
16:17.5.
Bulldog in the Water
Wall, in fifth place after 500
yards, swam a Winston Chur
chill 1650. Wall gained 6 inches
every length to beat Michigan's
Carl Robie and USCs Steve Dan
ielson for third place. Wall's
16:37 0 would have been an
NCAA record three weeks ago.
The deciding point of the
meet may have come in the 100
freestyle. Meyer and Laney, who
had qualified fourth and sixth
in the consolation final, moved
up to first and third. Mean
while, in the championship fi
nal, Michigan State's Ken Walsh
beat USC's Havens with a rec
ord-tying 45.6.

Roth took sixth in the 200
back. Momsen and Nicolao both
picked up second places, beating
their USC opponents to pad
Stanford's point cushion.
No Way For Second
The final event of the NCAA's,
the 800 free relay (4x200),
looked for 775 yards as though
it belonged to Southern Cal.
Stanford could afford to take
third place and still win the
meet, but Roth, Siebert, Wall,
and Buckingham had different
ideas.
Roth led off for Stanford in
1:46.1, but ceded a 3 second de
ficit to USC's Dean Willeford.
Siebert then swam his beeline
1:43.7, but could not close the
gap. Wall, fresh out of the 1650,
cut the USC margin slightly
with a 1:43.9.
"I don't care if he's half a pool
ahead, I'm going after him," said
Greg Buckingham as he left two
body lengths behind USC's an
chor man Bill Johnson. John
son, who took third in the 200
free in 1:42.7, held his own for
150 yards.
Water Luau
At the 150, Buckingham
turned on a sprint that brought
the crowd to its feet. Buck
nearly caught him at the 175
and left the Trojan his Achilles
heels in the final lap. Out at the
100 in 48.9, Buckingham covered
the final 100 yards in 51.9, for a
1:40.8.
The first 12 places scored
points — in consolation and
championship finals—placing a
premium upon depth. USC's
great depth and dogged deter
mination brought Peter Da
land's Trojans within 15 points
of the championship without
winning a single first.
Sweet Revenge
The Stanford victory avenged
a healthy loss to Southern Cal
at the AAWU championships,
settled the score of a 52-52 dual
meet tie, and broke a string of
four straight USC champion
ships.
The West Coast's conditioning
and come-through efforts left
the rest of the country far in
the wake. Indiana's 75 points
in diving saved the pre-meet
favorites from a flame-out. UC
LA (148) set two American rec

Yale (135) and take fifth behind
fourth place Michigan (184).

ual medley crowns. Roth won the 200
IM in 1:56.0 to undercut Bucking
ham's American record and reassert
ed his domination over the 400 IM
with a NCAA record 4:12.0. Roth's
1:57.9 200 backstroke was good for
sixth place and a Stanford record.
Mike Wall, who started the season
with pneumonia, upset applecarts
everywhere as he turned in the fast
est times of his life to take third in
the 1650 (16:37.0), fifth in the 200

butterfly leg of the medley relay and
placed sixth in the 200 fly in 1:54.6.
Bob Momsen repeated last year's
runner-up performance in the 200

butterfly leg of the medley relay and
placed sixth in the 200 fly in 1:54.6.
Bob Momsen repeated last year's
runner-up performance in the 200

Rolling Start
Buckingham and Wall got the
meet off to an auspicious start
in the 500. Buckingham, who
set a 4:40.9 record in the pre
lims, took out his first 200 in
1:46.0 and held a 57.0 pace for

the next 300 yards for the 4:37.0
record-smasher.
Roth and Siebert, both sopho
mores, took a gilded 1-3 in the
next event, the 200 IM.
The Indians swallowed a set
back in the 50 as Meyer, who
swam 21.3 in warm-up, disquali
fied on 2 false starts.
Stanford's fourth place In the
medley relay left the Tribe in
third place, 8 points away from
the leader USC. In the second

day the Indians took a slim 1
point lead over Southern Cal
while Indiana, sans diving, fell
23 points off pace.
Buck Beats Schollander
Buckingham got the day start
ed with his victory over Schol
lander in the 200 free. Both
swimmers, teammates during
the summer, bumped Scholland

1:41.7. Wall took fifth for a
bumper point crop.
Nicolao's sixth in the 200 fly
and Momsen's ninth in the 100
breast kept the Indians within
range of the leaders.
Then came the 400 IM with
Roth and Siebert holding their
own against 5 USC qualifiers.
A deafening Stanford chant
heralded perhaps the surprise of
the meet. Stanford had set a
record 3:07.0 for the 400 free
relay in the prelims, but that
was regarded as a fluke—Yale
and USC were the teams to
watch. Then the fireworks be
gan.
Maximum Effort
Nicolao led off the Stanford
relay in 46.9. He missed his
first turn nearly completely, but
buried his head and brought
back his second 50 as fast as the
first (23.4—23.5) — and then
passed out on the deck.
Bill Meyer took off and never
stopped, as he opened up a criti
cal length lead over Yale and
USC. Meyer's 45.8 preempted his
previous best this season of 49.4.
Morgan Manning swam the
fastest in his life, 46.1, to stretch
Meyer's lead. Laney flashed to
a 46.1 on the anchor leg to pre

vail over Schollander (45.4) and
USC's Don Havens, who swam
an unbelievable 44.8.
Stanford's 3:04.9 averages 46.2
per man, .6 second per man fast
er than the old record of 3:07.2.
Mutterings of disbelief mingled
with Stanford shrieks after the
race . . . Stanford went 3:32 two
weeks ago in the AAWU's at
Oregon.
Stanford's relay victory put
the Cards into the lead and op
ened the nation's eyes, but one
local newspaper still advertised
a "tight two-way duel between
USC and Indiana for the cham
pionship."
Buckingham and Wall went
2-3 in the arduous 1650 to start
the final day of competition.
Buckingham stayed with
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton for 1100 yards, but
then the Bruin moved out
towards his American record
16:17.5.
Bulldog in the Water
Wall, in fifth place after 500
yards, swam a Winston Chur
chill 1650. Wall gained 6 inches
every length to beat Michigan's
Carl Robie and USCs Steve Dan
ielson for third place. Wall's
16:37 0 would have been an
NCAA record three weeks ago.
The deciding point of the
meet may have come in the 100
freestyle. Meyer and Laney, who
had qualified fourth and sixth
in the consolation final, moved
up to first and third. Mean
while, in the championship fi
nal, Michigan State's Ken Walsh
beat USC's Havens with a rec
ord-tying 45.6.

Roth took sixth in the 200
back. Momsen and Nicolao both
picked up second places, beating
their USC opponents to pad
Stanford's point cushion.
No Way For Second
The final event of the NCAA's,
the 800 free relay (4x200),
looked for 775 yards as though
it belonged to Southern Cal.
Stanford could afford to take
third place and still win the
meet, but Roth, Siebert, Wall,
and Buckingham had different
ideas.
Roth led off for Stanford in
1:46.1, but ceded a 3 second de
ficit to USC's Dean Willeford.
Siebert then swam his beeline
1:43.7, but could not close the
gap. Wall, fresh out of the 1650,
cut the USC margin slightly
with a 1:43.9.
"I don't care if he's half a pool
ahead, I'm going after him," said
Greg Buckingham as he left two
body lengths behind USC's an
chor man Bill Johnson. John
son, who took third in the 200
free in 1:42.7, held his own for
150 yards.
Water Luau
At the 150, Buckingham
turned on a sprint that brought
the crowd to its feet. Buck
nearly caught him at the 175
and left the Trojan his Achilles
heels in the final lap. Out at the
100 in 48.9, Buckingham covered
the final 100 yards in 51.9, for a
1:40.8.
The first 12 places scored
points — in consolation and
championship finals—placing a
premium upon depth. USC's
great depth and dogged deter
mination brought Peter Da
land's Trojans within 15 points
of the championship without
winning a single first.
Sweet Revenge
The Stanford victory avenged
a healthy loss to Southern Cal
at the AAWU championships,
settled the score of a 52-52 dual
meet tie, and broke a string of
four straight USC champion
ships.
The West Coast's conditioning
and come-through efforts left
the rest of the country far in
the wake. Indiana's 75 points
in diving saved the pre-meet
favorites from a flame-out. UC
LA (148) set two American rec
ords to beat highly-regarded
Yale (135) and take fifth behind
fourth place Michigan (184).

"I don't care if he's half a pool

150 yards.

At the 150, Buckingham
turned on a sprint that brought
the crowd to its feet. Buck
nearly caught him at the 175
and left the Trojan his Achilles
heels in the final lap. Out at the
100 in 48.9, Buckingham covered
the final 100 yards in 51.9, for a
1:40.8.
The first 12 places scored
points — in consolation and
championship finals—placing a
premium upon depth. USC's
great depth and dogged deter

of the championship without
winning a single first.
Sweet Revenge
The Stanford victory avenged
a healthy loss to Southern Cal
at the AAWU championships,
settled the score of a 52-52 dual
meet tie, and broke a string of
four straight USC champion
ships.
The West Coast's conditioning
and come-through efforts left
the rest of the country far in
the wake. Indiana's 75 points
in diving saved the pre-meet
favorites from a flame-out. UC
LA (148) set two American rec

Yale (135) and take fifth behind
fourth place Michigan (184).

EAST LANSING, Mich., Mar. 26—
Stanford swimmers rocked the boat at
the NCAA Championships until they
threw the whole country overboard.
Coach Jim Gaughran's Indians pad
dled home from Michigan State with
Stanford's first national collegiate ti
tle in 15 years, and six of the meet's
13 new NCAA records.
Stanford scored 275 points to beat
defending champion USC's 260 and
outswim Indiana's 249.
Greg Buckingham and Dick Roth
each broke two NCAA records and
the Indians' 400 and 800 freestyle re
lays both destroyed the previous
American records. The Indians cleared
the boards of all but one Stanford
record.
Nation's Fastest Sprinters
Luis Nicolao (46.9), Bill Meyer
(45.8), Morgan Manning (46.1), and
Jim Laney (46.1) left Yale's old 400
free relay record of seconds in the
lurch with a sparkling 3:04.9.
Buckingham anchored Stanford's
800 free relay with the fastest 200 in
swimming history, 1:40.8, to pull Stan
ford to an American record 6:54.5.
Roth led off in 1:46.1, Pete Siebert hit

1:43.7, and Mike Wall threw in a
1:43.9 to set the stage.
Buckingham beat Yale's Don Schol
lander in the 200 freestyle in the
American record time of 1:41.3. Buck
ingham previously demolished his own
500 free record by 4 seconds with a
4:37.0. Buckingham, who also holds
the NCAA record for 1000 free, took
second in the 1650 with a 16:31.7 ef
fort.
IM King
Roth swam away with two individ
ual medley crowns. Roth won the 200
IM in 1:56.0 to undercut Bucking
ham's American record and reassert
ed his domination over the 400 IM
with a NCAA record 4:12.0. Roth's
1:57.9 200 backstroke was good for
sixth place and a Stanford record.
Mike Wall, who started the season
with pneumonia, upset applecarts
everywhere as he turned in the fast
est times of his life to take third in
the 1650 (16:37.0), fifth in the 200
free (1:43.8), and sixth in the 500
(4:44.2).
Nicolao took second to Princeton's
Ross Wales in the 100 butterfly in
50.9. Nicolao, world record holder for
100 meters butterfly, hit 49.5 for his

butterfly leg of the medley relay and
placed sixth in the 200 fly in 1:54.6.
Bob Momsen repeated last year's
runner-up performance in the 200
breaststroke. Momsen's 2:10.4 knocked
off defending champion Wayne An
derson of USC and would have tied
the NCAA record had SMU's Ken
Merten not swum him fantastic 2:07.9.
Momsen swam 1:00.1 in the medley
relay and hit 1:01.1 for ninth place in
the 100 breaststroke.
Pete Siebert left mouths agape with
his 1:57.2 third place in the 200 IM.
Siebert also took fifth in the 400 IM
in 4:15.0, blasting his last 100 in 55.0.
Siebert's 1:43.7 800 relay split bettered
his previous best 200 time by more
than 4 seconds.
Meyer Sprints
Bill Meyer's 45.8 100 put Stanford's
400 free relay ahead to stay. Meyer
upset North Carolina's touted Steve
Rerych to win the consolation final of
the 100 freestyle in 47.1.
Jim Laney, team captain and the
only senior on the NCAA squad, an
chored both the 400 medley and 400
free relays and took ninth in the 100
freestyle in 47.2.
Stanford's medley relay took fourth
in 3:32.0 behind UCLA's Ameri
can record 3:29.5. Bill Kee led
off in 55.9, followed by Momsen
(60.1) Nicolao (50.5), and Laney
(46.5).
Rolling Start
Buckingham and Wall got the
meet off to an auspicious start
in the 500. Buckingham, who
set a 4:40.9 record in the pre
lims, took out his first 200 in
1:46.0 and held a 57.0 pace for

the next 300 yards for the 4:37.0
record-smasher.
Roth and Siebert, both sopho
mores, took a gilded 1-3 in the
next event, the 200 IM.
The Indians swallowed a set
back in the 50 as Meyer, who
swam 21.3 in warm-up, disquali
fied on 2 false starts.
Stanford's fourth place In the
medley relay left the Tribe in
third place, 8 points away from
the leader USC. In the second

day the Indians took a slim 1
point lead over Southern Cal
while Indiana, sans diving, fell
23 points off pace.
Buck Beats Schollander
Buckingham got the day start
ed with his victory over Schol
lander in the 200 free. Both
swimmers, teammates during
the summer, bumped Scholland
er's old American record of
1:41.7. Wall took fifth for a
bumper point crop.
Nicolao's sixth in the 200 fly
and Momsen's ninth in the 100
breast kept the Indians within
range of the leaders.
Then came the 400 IM with
Roth and Siebert holding their
own against 5 USC qualifiers.
A deafening Stanford chant
heralded perhaps the surprise of
the meet. Stanford had set a
record 3:07.0 for the 400 free
relay in the prelims, but that
was regarded as a fluke—Yale
and USC were the teams to
watch. Then the fireworks be
gan.
Maximum Effort
Nicolao led off the Stanford
relay in 46.9. He missed his
first turn nearly completely, but
buried his head and brought
back his second 50 as fast as the
first (23.4—23.5) — and then
passed out on the deck.
Bill Meyer took off and never
stopped, as he opened up a criti
cal length lead over Yale and
USC. Meyer's 45.8 preempted his
previous best this season of 49.4.
Morgan Manning swam the
fastest in his life, 46.1, to stretch
Meyer's lead. Laney flashed to
a 46.1 on the anchor leg to pre

vail over Schollander (45.4) and
USC's Don Havens, who swam
an unbelievable 44.8.
Stanford's 3:04.9 averages 46.2
per man, .6 second per man fast
er than the old record of 3:07.2.
Mutterings of disbelief mingled
with Stanford shrieks after the
race . . . Stanford went 3:32 two
weeks ago in the AAWU's at
Oregon.
Stanford's relay victory put
the Cards into the lead and op
ened the nation's eyes, but one
local newspaper still advertised
a "tight two-way duel between
USC and Indiana for the cham
pionship."
Buckingham and Wall went
2-3 in the arduous 1650 to start
the final day of competition.
Buckingham stayed with
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton for 1100 yards, but
then the Bruin moved out
towards his American record
16:17.5.
Bulldog in the Water
Wall, in fifth place after 500
yards, swam a Winston Chur
chill 1650. Wall gained 6 inches
every length to beat Michigan's
Carl Robie and USCs Steve Dan
ielson for third place. Wall's
16:37 0 would have been an
NCAA record three weeks ago.
The deciding point of the
meet may have come in the 100
freestyle. Meyer and Laney, who
had qualified fourth and sixth
in the consolation final, moved
up to first and third. Mean
while, in the championship fi
nal, Michigan State's Ken Walsh
beat USC's Havens with a rec
ord-tying 45.6.

Roth took sixth in the 200
back. Momsen and Nicolao both
picked up second places, beating
their USC opponents to pad
Stanford's point cushion.
No Way For Second
The final event of the NCAA's,
the 800 free relay (4x200),
looked for 775 yards as though
it belonged to Southern Cal.
Stanford could afford to take
third place and still win the
meet, but Roth, Siebert, Wall,
and Buckingham had different
ideas.
Roth led off for Stanford in
1:46.1, but ceded a 3 second de
ficit to USC's Dean Willeford.
Siebert then swam his beeline
1:43.7, but could not close the
gap. Wall, fresh out of the 1650,
cut the USC margin slightly
with a 1:43.9.
"I don't care if he's half a pool

record 3:07.0 for the 400 free
relay in the prelims, but that
was regarded as a fluke—Yale
and USC were the teams to
watch. Then the fireworks be
gan.
Maximum Effort
Nicolao led off the Stanford
relay in 46.9. He missed his
first turn nearly completely, but
buried his head and brought
back his second 50 as fast as the
first (23.4—23.5) — and then
passed out on the deck.
Bill Meyer took off and never
stopped, as he opened up a criti
cal length lead over Yale and
USC. Meyer's 45.8 preempted his
previous best this season of 49.4.
Morgan Manning swam the
fastest in his life, 46.1, to stretch
Meyer's lead. Laney flashed to
a 46.1 on the anchor leg to pre

vail over Schollander (45.4) and
USC's Don Havens, who swam
an unbelievable 44.8.
Stanford's 3:04.9 averages 46.2
per man, .6 second per man fast
er than the old record of 3:07.2.
Mutterings of disbelief mingled
with Stanford shrieks after the
race . . . Stanford went 3:32 two
weeks ago in the AAWU's at
Oregon.
Stanford's relay victory put
the Cards into the lead and op
ened the nation's eyes, but one
local newspaper still advertised
a "tight two-way duel between
USC and Indiana for the cham
pionship."
Buckingham and Wall went
2-3 in the arduous 1650 to start
the final day of competition.
Buckingham stayed with
UCLA's world record holder
Mike Burton for 1100 yards, but
then the Bruin moved out
towards his American record
16:17.5.
Bulldog in the Water
Wall, in fifth place after 500
yards, swam a Winston Chur
chill 1650. Wall gained 6 inches
every length to beat Michigan's
Carl Robie and USCs Steve Dan
ielson for third place. Wall's
16:37 0 would have been an
NCAA record three weeks ago.
The deciding point of the
meet may have come in the 100
freestyle. Meyer and Laney, who
had qualified fourth and sixth
in the consolation final, moved
up to first and third. Mean
while, in the championship fi
nal, Michigan State's Ken Walsh
beat USC's Havens with a rec
ord-tying 45.6.

Roth took sixth in the 200
back. Momsen and Nicolao both
picked up second places, beating
their USC opponents to pad
Stanford's point cushion.
No Way For Second
The final event of the NCAA's,
the 800 free relay (4x200),
looked for 775 yards as though
it belonged to Southern Cal.
Stanford could afford to take
third place and still win the
meet, but Roth, Siebert, Wall,
and Buckingham had different
ideas.
Roth led off for Stanford in
1:46.1, but ceded a 3 second de
ficit to USC's Dean Willeford.
Siebert then swam his beeline
1:43.7, but could not close the
gap. Wall, fresh out of the 1650,
cut the USC margin slightly
with a 1:43.9.
"I don't care if he's half a pool
ahead, I'm going after him," said
Greg Buckingham as he left two
body lengths behind USC's an
chor man Bill Johnson. John
son, who took third in the 200
free in 1:42.7, held his own for
150 yards.
Water Luau
At the 150, Buckingham
turned on a sprint that brought
the crowd to its feet. Buck
nearly caught him at the 175
and left the Trojan his Achilles
heels in the final lap. Out at the
100 in 48.9, Buckingham covered
the final 100 yards in 51.9, for a
1:40.8.
The first 12 places scored
points — in consolation and
championship finals—placing a
premium upon depth. USC's
great depth and dogged deter
mination brought Peter Da
land's Trojans within 15 points
of the championship without
winning a single first.
Sweet Revenge
The Stanford victory avenged
a healthy loss to Southern Cal
at the AAWU championships,
settled the score of a 52-52 dual
meet tie, and broke a string of
four straight USC champion
ships.
The West Coast's conditioning
and come-through efforts left
the rest of the country far in
the wake. Indiana's 75 points
in diving saved the pre-meet
favorites from a flame-out. UC
LA (148) set two American rec
ords to beat highly-regarded
Yale (135) and take fifth behind
fourth place Michigan (184).

EAST LANSING, Mich., Mar. 26—
Stanford swimmers rocked the boat at
the NCAA Championships until they
threw the whole country overboard.
Coach Jim Gaughran's Indians pad
dled home from Michigan State with
Stanford's first national collegiate ti
tle in 15 years, and six of the meet's
13 new NCAA records.
Stanford scored 275 points to beat
defending champion USC's 260 and
outswim Indiana's 249.
Greg Buckingham and Dick Roth
each broke two NCAA records and
the Indians' 400 and 800 freestyle re
lays both destroyed the previous
American records. The Indians cleared
the boards of all but one Stanford
record.
Nation's Fastest Sprinters
Luis Nicolao (46.9), Bill Meyer
(45.8), Morgan Manning (46.1), and
Jim Laney (46.1) left Yale's old 400
free relay record of seconds in the
lurch with a sparkling 3:04.9.
Buckingham anchored Stanford's
800 free relay with the fastest 200 in
swimming history, 1:40.8, to pull Stan
ford to an American record 6:54.5.
Roth led off in 1:46.1, Pete Siebert hit

1:43.7, and Mike Wall threw in a
1:43.9 to set the stage.
Buckingham beat Yale's Don Schol
lander in the 200 freestyle in the
American record time of 1:41.3. Buck
ingham previously demolished his own
500 free record by 4 seconds with a
4:37.0. Buckingham, who also holds
the NCAA record for 1000 free, took
second in the 1650 with a 16:31.7 ef
fort.
IM King
Roth swam away with two individ
ual medley crowns. Roth won the 200
IM in 1:56.0 to undercut Bucking
ham's American record and reassert
ed his domination over the 400 IM
with a NCAA record 4:12.0. Roth's
1:57.9 200 backstroke was good for
sixth place and a Stanford record.
Mike Wall, who started the season
with pneumonia, upset applecarts
everywhere as he turned in the fast
est times of his life to take third in
the 1650 (16:37.0), fifth in the 200
free (1:43.8), and sixth in the 500
(4:44.2).
Nicolao took second to Princeton's
Ross Wales in the 100 butterfly in
50.9. Nicolao, world record holder for
100 meters butterfly, hit 49.5 for his

butterfly leg of the medley relay and
placed sixth in the 200 fly in 1:54.6.
Bob Momsen repeated last year's
runner-up performance in the 200
breaststroke. Momsen's 2:10.4 knocked
off defending champion Wayne An
derson of USC and would have tied
the NCAA record had SMU's Ken
Merten not swum him fantastic 2:07.9.
Momsen swam 1:00.1 in the medley
relay and hit 1:01.1 for ninth place in
the 100 breaststroke.
Pete Siebert left mouths agape with
his 1:57.2 third place in the 200 IM.
Siebert also took fifth in the 400 IM
in 4:15.0, blasting his last 100 in 55.0.
Siebert's 1:43.7 800 relay split bettered
his previous best 200 time by more
than 4 seconds.
Meyer Sprints
Bill Meyer's 45.8 100 put Stanford's
400 free relay ahead to stay. Meyer
upset North Carolina's touted Steve
Rerych to win the consolation final of
the 100 freestyle in 47.1.
Jim Laney, team captain and the
only senior on the NCAA squad, an
chored both the 400 medley and 400
free relays and took ninth in the 100
freestyle in 47.2.
Stanford's medley relay took fourth
in 3:32.0 behind UCLA's Ameri
can record 3:29.5. Bill Kee led
off in 55.9, followed by Momsen
(60.1) Nicolao (50.5), and Laney
(46.5).
Rolling Start
Buckingham and Wall got the
meet off to an auspicious start
in the 500. Buckingham, who
set a 4:40.9 record in the pre
lims, took out his first 200 in
1:46.0 and held a 57.0 pace for

the next 300 yards for the 4:37.0
record-smasher.
Roth and Siebert, both sopho
mores, took a gilded 1-3 in the
next event, the 200 IM.
The Indians swallowed a set
back in the 50 as Meyer, who
swam 21.3 in warm-up, disquali
fied on 2 false starts.
Stanford's fourth place In the
medley relay left the Tribe in
third place, 8 points away from
the leader USC. In the second

day the Indians took a slim 1
point lead over Southern Cal
while Indiana, sans diving, fell
23 points off pace.
Buck Beats Schollander
Buckingham got the day start
ed with his victory over Schol
lander in the 200 free. Both
swimmers, teammates during
the summer, bumped Scholland
er's old American record of
1:41.7. Wall took fifth for a
bumper point crop.
Nicolao's sixth in the 200 fly
and Momsen's ninth in the 100
breast kept the Indians within
range of the leaders.
Then came the 400 IM with
Roth and Siebert holding their
own against 5 USC qualifiers.
A deafening Stanford chant
heralded perhaps the surprise of
the meet. Stanford had set a
record 3:07.0 for the 400 free
relay in the prelims, but that
was regarded as a fluke—Yale
