CHICAGO â€” Ambiva'ence, de
mands of expediency, and a too
narrow view of the purposes of
education shackle today's col
leges and universities, accor
ding to Nevitt Sanford, director
of the Institute for the Study
of Human Problems.
Speaking to the national con
ference of the Association for
Higher Education, Sanford sug
gested that humanistic leader
ship and greater concern for stu
dent-oriented institutions should
be the goals of America's insti
tutions of higher learning.
Sanford lamented the lack of
direction given by present ad
ministrators and faculty to the
student. "There is seldom a sug
gestion that college might help
to change the individual him
self, to broaden his horizons, to
liberate him from dogma and
prejudices, or to give him a new
sense of identity," he stated.
He described the problem of
administrative leadership of
presidents of American univer
sities as an over concern with
organization and image.
"The responsible individual is
vanishing into a tangle of or
ganized social roles and group
memberships . . . Instead of
good or bad decisions by respon
sible officials, we now have the
consensus of anonymous com
mittees," he commented.
According to Sanford, the
humanistic president who en
courages honest communication,
investigation, and cooperative
participation between himself,
faculty, and students is a rare
being.
The Stanford educator was
equally disturbed with the lack
commitment to students by

many of the instructors and pro
fessors in American colleges and
universities. He said that, "Pro
fessors hide behind the claim
that the university should not
be dragged into the arena of
present-day concerns .... They
are too busy, or afraid, or too
tied up in their own brand of
image-slavery and idea-slavery
to do it. They are amoral, apath
etic, and slothful."
