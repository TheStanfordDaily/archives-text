# Overseas Campus Selections Made
## 
### 
More than four hundred stu
dents have been selected by the
Overseas Campus office to at
tend Stanford's five overseas
campuses next year.
Selection was completed last
Friday and the official lists were
made public Friday afternoon.
They are posted in the Over
seas campus office on Inner
Quad.
A draw system was again
used to select the freshman for
the campuses. This change was
made necessary this year due
to deferred grading in Western
Civ and English.
The groups selected were Ger
many and Britain from January
to June of 1968 and for Italy,
France, and Austria from March
to September of 1968.
All who made application for
the overseas campuses during
the last quarter have been noti
fied by mail of the acceptance
or rejection of their applications.
The next group of applications
will be taken next fall quarter.
