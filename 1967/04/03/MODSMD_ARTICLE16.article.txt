# Library Falls To Finals Week Siege
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
A friendly Stanford cop stood
near the loan desk as the librar
ian announced, "The library will
dose in ten minutes... if you
wish to check out a book .One
or two brave souls ventured
forth midst a barrage of paper
airplanes and parachutes flying
to the tune of exploding fire
crackers while smoke bombs
completed the festive aura.
Show and tell at Camp Winne
muchahatchee? No, just finals
week and book time at the
Henry J. Meyer Memorial Li
brary, fondly referred to as the
UGLY. It all started on Thurs
day of Dead Week when stu
dents became tired of hanging
jver the railings of the third
and fourth levels of the library.
The array of paper planes is
suing forth would have been
worthy entries in The Scientific
American's recent contest. By
Saturday night one exhibitionist
remembered to bring his super
ball along and a good time was
had by all.
Sunday night the final round
began with a full house ready
for action, and action there was.
So much in fact, that the Stan

ford police were called in as the
library was closed shortly after
10 p.m. Guy De√üall, head of cir
culation services of the library,
later said that "apparently stu
dents were releasing the ten
sions of finals and were trying
to see 'how far they could go.'"
They tried again on Monday.
By this time the more enterpris
ing students had constructed
their paper planes and para
chutes before coming to the li
brary, so as not to waste valu
able time getting into the action.
Wilbur sponsors noted that
many freshmen were by now
looking forward to the regular
UGLY happy hours. The library
was again closed at 10 p.m.
Tuesday night brought a hint
of a return to normalcy as some
students had already left cam
pus for vacation and student po
lice were on hand to keep insti
gators away from the railings.
Elmer Grieder, associate di
rector of the University Librar
ies explained the activity in
terms of mob psychology. "It's
like the Flicks," he said. "Every
body is quiet until one person
yells; then everybody yells." He
explained further that those in

charge "naturally want to keep
the library open," but felt it was
necessary to close when there
was a chance of injury to per
sons or property. He said the in
cidents were apparently trigger
ed by a "small minority" and

that the University takes a "seri
ous view" of this infraction of
rights.
There has as yet been no dis
ciplinary action toward any stu
dents involved in the incidents.
Dean of Students Joel Smith

was not available for comment.
Others, however, viewed the
action more optimistically. As
head yell leader Craig Brown
said, "I think it's bitchin ... it's
the way a library should be."
Rah, rah.

After the police closed down the library, only the airplanes were
left in the UGLY (above). Meanwhile, a few studious types, shown
below , were still booking in the nearly deserted Main Library.
