## Unruh Urges Political Involvement 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The academic segment of so
ciety is misunderstood and will
continue being used as a scape
goat until it actively seeks out
the support of politicians, accor
ding to State Assembly Speaker
Jesse M. Unruh in a campus
speech Friday night.
Unruh addressed the opening
session of the first California
Conference of the American As
sociation of University Profes

sors which met at Stanford this
weekend.
Unruh blamed the "chronic
disengagement between politics
and the intellectual community"
for the difficulties now facing
education in this state. Politi
cians are partly at fault in the
dilemma, he said, "but many
intellectuals reject politics out
of hand."
One reason for the rejection,
according to Unruh, is that

"politics necessarily involves
compromises and expediences
that are irrelevant to, and per
haps violative of, honest intel
lectual inquiry."
Mutual Discussion
Unruh, a Democratic assem
blyman from Inglewood, told
the conference, "I do not sug
gest that college professors im
mediately start ringing doorbells
and licking stamps in support
of their local Democratic candi

dates, although I can think of at
least one instance in which such
efforts may be appropriate. I
am suggesting a broad, continu
ing, mutual discussion between
scholars and politicians."
Unruh also told the 75 pro
fessors present that elective
members of the University of
California's Board of Regents
have used their positions "as a
platform to present their own
political ideas." There are six
ex-oflicio members on the Board
—Governor Reagan, Lieutenant
Governor Finch, Superintendent
of Public Instruction Rafferty,
Superintendent of Agriculture
Grant, Acting University of Cali
fornia President Wellman, and
Speaker of the Assembly Unruh.
The other 18 members of the
Board of Regents are appointed
by the Governor.
Politically Motivated
"Try as we might," Unruh
said, "we cannot escape the fact
that in the East the current

crisis in California higher edu
cation is looked upon as being
politically motivated and
brought about as a result of the
1966 state elections.
"This widely held impression
stems almost exclusively from
the fact that the major elected
office-holders of California sit
on the governing board of the
University and have taken an
active part — an outpsoken, al
most dominant part — in the
board's recent deblierations.'
Unruh claimed that the elec
tive members of the board did
not need membership on the
board to make their political
views known.
"The real objection which I
have," Unruh said, "and you
should have, to my service and
the service of any elected poli
tician on these boards, is the
fact that it undeniably brings
politics into education in the
worst way."

compromises and expediences
that are irrelevant to, and per
haps violative of, honest intel
lectual inquiry."
Mutual Discussion
Unruh, a Democratic assem
blyman from Inglewood, told
the conference, "I do not sug
gest that college professors im
mediately start ringing doorbells
and licking stamps in support
of their local Democratic candi

dates, although I can think of at
least one instance in which such
efforts may be appropriate. I
am suggesting a broad, continu
ing, mutual discussion between
scholars and politicians."
Unruh also told the 75 pro
fessors present that elective
members of the University of
California's Board of Regents
have used their positions "as a
platform to present their own
political ideas." There are six
ex-oflicio members on the Board
—Governor Reagan, Lieutenant
Governor Finch, Superintendent
of Public Instruction Rafferty,
Superintendent of Agriculture
Grant, Acting University of Cali
fornia President Wellman, and
Speaker of the Assembly Unruh.
The other 18 members of the
Board of Regents are appointed
by the Governor.
Politically Motivated
"Try as we might," Unruh
said, "we cannot escape the fact
that in the East the current

crisis in California higher edu
cation is looked upon as being
politically motivated and
brought about as a result of the
1966 state elections.
"This widely held impression
stems almost exclusively from
the fact that the major elected
office-holders of California sit
on the governing board of the
University and have taken an
active part — an outpsoken, al
most dominant part — in the
board's recent deblierations.'
Unruh claimed that the elec
tive members of the board did
not need membership on the
board to make their political
views known.
"The real objection which I
have," Unruh said, "and you
should have, to my service and
the service of any elected poli
tician on these boards, is the
fact that it undeniably brings
politics into education in the
worst way."
The academic segment of so
ciety is misunderstood and will
continue being used as a scape
goat until it actively seeks out
the support of politicians, accor
ding to State Assembly Speaker
Jesse M. Unruh in a campus
speech Friday night.
Unruh addressed the opening
session of the first California
Conference of the American As
sociation of University Profes

sors which met at Stanford this
weekend.
Unruh blamed the "chronic
disengagement between politics
and the intellectual community"
for the difficulties now facing
education in this state. Politi
cians are partly at fault in the
dilemma, he said, "but many
intellectuals reject politics out
of hand."
One reason for the rejection,
according to Unruh, is that

"politics necessarily involves
compromises and expediences
that are irrelevant to, and per
haps violative of, honest intel
lectual inquiry."
