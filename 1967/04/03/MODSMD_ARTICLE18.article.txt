# Student's Role Discussed

### DAVID L. AIKEN The Collegiate Press Service News Analysis 
CHICAGO — Educators gath
ered here for the annual get
together sponsored by the As
sociation for Higher Education
(AHE) did not quite have stu
dents on the top of the list of

items for discussion, but various
proposals for finding a place for
students—or for keeping them
in their place—did keep popping
up.
Perhaps one of the most force
ful advocates of students' place
in decision-making was a re
searcher from Berkeley. Warren
B. Martin, research educator
with the Center for Research
and Development in Higher Edu
cation, urged that students be
full members of tri-partite coun
cils to govern units of universi
ties.
Students, faculty and admini
stration should work together
equally on these boards, he
urged, which should be set up
for units of no more than about
1,000 students if a university
is particularly large. An all-uni
versity council with students as
members should co-ordinate gen
eral policy.
Professional Guild
Replying to some of the argu
ments usually made against
student participation, Martin
commented that faculty mem
bers as well as students are
noted for mobility, and "faculty
loyalty today is more to their
professional guild than to their
college. Students may identify

with a college in a way faculty
never will."
Even college and university
presidents have an average ten
ure of "about four years, hardly
longer than the period spent by
students likely to participate in
a college's governance," Mar
tin said.
Antioch
The most frequently men
tioned model of full-cooperation
among students, faculty, and ad
ministration was Antioch Col
lege in Yellow Springs, Ohio. In
deed, it was about the only place
anybody could think of where
all three groups had equal stat
us on bodies with final decision
making authority.
Algo D. Henderson, former
dean and president of Antioch,
said that the traditional busi
ness-like model of a university
as a bureaucratic hierarchy
might be applied to supervision
of janitors, but not of teachers
and students. Likewise, he said,
although the university may be
a set of sub-groups which deal
with each other through negoti
ations, use of such "confronta
tion tactics" as strikes lessens
unity and emphasis on educa
tional goals.

The most frequently men
tioned model of full-cooperation
among students, faculty, and ad
ministration was Antioch Col
lege in Yellow Springs, Ohio. In
deed, it was about the only place
anybody could think of where
all three groups had equal stat
us on bodies with final decision
making authority.
Algo D. Henderson, former
dean and president of Antioch,
said that the traditional busi
ness-like model of a university
as a bureaucratic hierarchy
might be applied to supervision
of janitors, but not of teachers
and students. Likewise, he said,
although the university may be
a set of sub-groups which deal
with each other through negoti
ations, use of such "confronta
tion tactics" as strikes lessens
unity and emphasis on educa
tional goals.
CHICAGO — Educators gath
ered here for the annual get
together sponsored by the As
sociation for Higher Education
(AHE) did not quite have stu
dents on the top of the list of

items for discussion, but various
proposals for finding a place for
students—or for keeping them
in their place—did keep popping
up.
Perhaps one of the most force
ful advocates of students' place
in decision-making was a re
searcher from Berkeley. Warren
B. Martin, research educator
with the Center for Research
and Development in Higher Edu
cation, urged that students be
full members of tri-partite coun
cils to govern units of universi
ties.
Students, faculty and admini
stration should work together
equally on these boards, he
urged, which should be set up
for units of no more than about
1,000 students if a university
is particularly large. An all-uni
versity council with students as
members should co-ordinate gen
eral policy.
Professional Guild
Replying to some of the argu
ments usually made against
student participation, Martin
commented that faculty mem
bers as well as students are
noted for mobility, and "faculty
loyalty today is more to their
professional guild than to their
college. Students may identify

with a college in a way faculty
never will."
Even college and university
presidents have an average ten
ure of "about four years, hardly
longer than the period spent by
students likely to participate in
a college's governance," Mar
tin said.
