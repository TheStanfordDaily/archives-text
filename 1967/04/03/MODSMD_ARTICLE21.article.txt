## Card Matmen Win NCAA Fourths 
### NICK SELBY 
Kent, Ohio
Captain Len Borchers and
Terry Crenshaw of Stanford's
wrestling team won fourth
places in the 37th NCAA Wres
tling Championships held here
at Kent State University March
23-25.
The places represented the
first time that Stanford had cap
tured an NCAA honor, and came
from the first Card entries ever
in the tournament.
The performances of Borchers
and Crenshaw earned 16 points
for the Tribe, enough to tie for
13th best in the nation.
Semifinals Excitement
Borchers had a shot at win
ning the 152 pound class going
into the semifinal round.

After decisioning Dave Camp
bell of Michigan State 6-4, deci
sioning Mike Thrower of the Air
Force 7-4, and pinning Russ
Schneider of Northwestern in
4:52, Borchers faced Wayne
Wells of Oklahoma, the pre-tour
nament favorite.
Borchers started the match
quickly, taking down Wells with
a doubleleg in 20 seconds. Wells
escaped and the first period ran
out.
Wells controlled Borchers for
the entire second period, riding
him closely and preventing all
attempts at standups. At the
start of the third period, Wells
gained two more points on a
reverse to go ahead 3-2.
Borchers escaped and took
Wells down again to regain the
lead, 5-3. But Wells escaped and
took Borchers down to hold a
6-5 lead. Borchers escaped and
tied it ai 6-6.
Because of the riding time
points against him due to Wells'
control in the second period,
Borchers had to get a takedown.
His frantic efforts failed when
Wells got two on a snapdown in
the last 15 seconds to seal a 10-6
win. It was one of the most ex
citing matches of the tourna
ment.
Wells was upset in the finals
by Jim Kamman of the Univer
sity of Michigan and had to
settle for second place.
Consolation Efforts
Borchers then automatically
entered the semifinals of the
consolation bracket. In his first
match he wrestled Phil McCart
ney of the University of Toledo.
He barely squeaked by with a
4-3 decision. McCartney was only
seconds short of a point for rid
ing time and a tie after receiv
ing a point when Borchers' was
called for stalling in the last ten
seconds.
In the finals of the consola
tions, Borchers lost 4-1 to Char
les Seal of Portland State. Bor
chers was unable to escape un
til 30 seconds remained in the
third period. He lost three points
in the second period and was un
able to catch up.
"Stick'ini 'Shaw"
Crenshaw travelled to the con
solation finals by a much differ
ent route. He lost 11-5 to Don
Buzzard of lowa State in the
first round, although he scored
predicament points twice. Cren
shaw was allowed to continue
in the consolations because
Buzzard won his next two
matches.
Crenshaw came to life Friday
night when the consolations
started. Losing 2-0 to Jerome
Pillath of the University of Illi
nois, Crenshaw responded to
Borchers' cries of "Stick'im
'Shaw" to pin him in 32 seconds
of the second period.
Crenshaw reversed on a stand
ing switch, cradled Pillath to
his back, and then flattened him
with a half-and-crotch body
press.
Crucifix Torture
The next match of the night
followed the same script. Cren
shaw was taken down in fifteen

seconds and rode for the rest of
the period by Harry Lane of
Colorado State.
Again Borchers' cries were the
catylysts for excitement. Cren
shaw threw an arm-wrenching
standing switch for a reverse,
then threw on legs. He moved
into a crucifix and ended the
torture for Lane at 2:52 of the
second period.
Baffling Legs
In the semifinals of the con
solations, Crenshaw used legs
for control wrestling to abso
lutely baflle Willie Williams of
Illinois State University. Every
time Williams stood up, Cren-

Shaw returned him to the mat
with cross body rides.
Crenshaw won 3 0 with a two
point predicament off a turk and
an escape in the third period.
In the finals of the consola
tions, Crenshaw lost 11-1 to Jack
Zindel of the champion Michi
gan State team. Zindel countered
Crenshaw's leg wrestling with
leg moves of his own to com
pletely dominate the match.

from the first Card entries ever
in the tournament.
The performances of Borchers

Semifinals Excitement

into the semifinal round.

After decisioning Dave Camp
bell of Michigan State 6-4, deci
sioning Mike Thrower of the Air

Borchers escaped and took
Wells down again to regain the

took Borchers down to hold a
6-5 lead. Borchers escaped and
tied it ai 6-6.
Because of the riding time
points against him due to Wells'
control in the second period,
Borchers had to get a takedown.

Wells got two on a snapdown in
the last 15 seconds to seal a 10-6
win. It was one of the most ex
citing matches of the tourna

Wells was upset in the finals
by Jim Kamman of the Univer

of the second period.
Crenshaw reversed on a stand
ing switch, cradled Pillath to
his back, and then flattened him
with a half-and-crotch body
press.
Crucifix Torture
The next match of the night
followed the same script. Cren
shaw was taken down in fifteen

seconds and rode for the rest of
the period by Harry Lane of
Colorado State.
Again Borchers' cries were the
catylysts for excitement. Cren
shaw threw an arm-wrenching
standing switch for a reverse,
then threw on legs. He moved
into a crucifix and ended the
torture for Lane at 2:52 of the
second period.
Baffling Legs
In the semifinals of the con

lutely baflle Willie Williams of

with cross body rides.
Crenshaw won 3 0 with a two
point predicament off a turk and
an escape in the third period.
In the finals of the consola

Semifinals Excitement

ning the 152 pound class going
into the semifinal round.

After decisioning Dave Camp
bell of Michigan State 6-4, deci
sioning Mike Thrower of the Air
Force 7-4, and pinning Russ

quickly, taking down Wells with
a doubleleg in 20 seconds. Wells
escaped and the first period ran
out.

the entire second period, riding
him closely and preventing all
attempts at standups. At the
start of the third period, Wells
gained two more points on a
reverse to go ahead 3-2.
Borchers escaped and took
Wells down again to regain the
lead, 5-3. But Wells escaped and
took Borchers down to hold a
6-5 lead. Borchers escaped and
tied it ai 6-6.
Because of the riding time
points against him due to Wells'
control in the second period,

the last 15 seconds to seal a 10-6
win. It was one of the most ex
citing matches of the tourna

Wells was upset in the finals
by Jim Kamman of the Univer
