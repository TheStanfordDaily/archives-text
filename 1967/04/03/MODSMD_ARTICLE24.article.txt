The Stanford Daily needs more people, according
to Daily Editor Henry Muller.
The Daily's annual spring recruiting week opened
today with an announcement by Muller that "there are
thirty positions open and we want to fill all of them
by Friday."
Muller stressed the advantages of working on The
Daily. In an exclusive interview he said, "Although my
reasons for working here are mainly hedonistic, I as
sume that most people are in it for the money." Staff
salaries range from three dollars per night for photo
technicians to $125 per month for the editor.
"Some of our staff parties aren't so bad, either," Mul
ler added. "They aren't exactly orgies, but it's better
than studying."
There is one serious drawback to working on The
Daily, Muller commented. "It's so much fun, you don't
want to go home at night."
The thirty new positions that Muller is trying to fill
were created when the Daily expanded its reporting
staff. "We will have reporters assigned to every corner
of the campus after we finish this recruiting drive,"
Muller said.
According to Staff Editor Jay Bosworth, applicants
should come to the Daily office anytime this week and
fill out an application blank. He noted that any Stan
ford student, graduate or undergraduate, is eligible.

cated column, "The House at Pooh
Corner." "Working on The Daily is just
great," says Miss Anderson, "and I
wouldn't trade it even for a Tresidder
hamburger!!"


These license plates are souvenirs
from only one of The Daily's many ad
ventures, the License Plate Scandal of
1953, in which the license plates of
several campus bigshots were stolen.
As a result of a Daily crime investiga
tion, physics major Newton Meters,
who had stolen nearly 15,000 license
plates, was arrested.
