# Sprinters Come Through
## Soggy Gaughran Overflows 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
How does the water feel when
the nation's number One swim
ming team hurls its coach into
the pool? "I didn't feel it. I don't
think I ever hit. It was a bath
I had dreamed of taking for a
'ong time," replied Stanford's
Jim Gaughran.

Gaughran's swimmers staged
a spectacular exhibition of come
through performances at East
Lansing to snatch the NCAA
trophy away from Southern
California. Coaches "in the
know" had pegged Stanford as
a possible shot for third place.
Who was Stanford's hero of
the meet? "There are at least
10 heroes. Some guys scored a
lot more points than others, but
without any one of them, it
wouldn't have made any differ
ence," said Gaughran.
Consistent Come-Through
Stanford swimmers consistent
ly swam their lifetife bests, oft
en by staggering amounts, to
beat the USC man next to him
and put another 2 points be
tween the Indians and the pres
sing Trojans.
The biggest surprise — and
the turning points—of the meet
was, in Gaughran's opinion,
Stanford's 400 frestyle relay.
The Indians smashed every rec
ord on the books to upset heav
ily favored Yale and USC to
take a one-point lead into the
final day of competition.
Stanford sprinters had done

little to distinguish themselves
from mediocrity throughout the
season. Hardly could a 3:12.1 in
the AAWU's have presaged an
American record 3:04.9 two
weeks later in the NCAA's—a
drop of nearly 2 seconds per
man for 100 yards freestyle.
Why the Drop?
"The drop stems from a phi
losophy of training I've adopted
that has several unfortunate
ramifications. During the regu
lar season, we often lose points
in dual meets, sometimes to a
disappointing extent," explained
Gaughran.
"But this year it was a sacri
fice that had to be made, and
it worked out to be worthwhile.
The team and I talked about It
and we agreed."
For the first two thirds of the
season, Stanford sprinters did
almost the same 7000 yard work
out that the longer distance,
"heavy" swimmers trained oh.
This work load put the sprint
ers in tremendous shape, but
the continuous burden stifled
their speed.
Sprint Down Pays Off
Two weeks before the NCAA's,

however, the sprinters dropped
off to practically nothing: 1000
to 1500 yards per day. They con
centrated on fine stroke points,
starts, and turns.
When the test came i"n the
NCAA's, the sprinters had shape
and a fine honed edge unequaled
by any four Americans in his
tory.
Gaughran also had praise for
the 800 freestyle relay — with
four different swimmers on it—
that "just refused to let go, even
thought they only needed a third
to win the meet."


Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
took his impromtu bath in Lane
3 with a huge smile.
