# Dr. Sterling Announces Retirement
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
Wallace Sterling will retire as soon
as the Board of Trustees can find
a new president, he announced March
24.
And the search will formally begin
this afternoon wren the executive
committee of the Academic Council
and the faculty advisory board meet
to discuss plans for setting up a fac
ulty "select committee to advise the
trustees" on selection of a successor.
"There's nothing sudden about
this," Sterling said in an interview
last week. "It's been on my mind for
a long time."
"Every person and every institu
tion needs a change periodically,
about every twenty years, plus or
minus," he continued.
Sterling, who became University
president on April 1, 1949, began his
19th year in the office Saturday.
Asked to summarize the accom

plishments of his term as president,
Sterling spoke of the problems the
University had been confronted with
during the 18 years.
Doubled Student Body
The first was the big jump in en
rollment right after the war. Sterling
recalled that "from Pearl Harbor to
the peak of the GI wave in the late
forties," the student body nearly
doubled.
"We were faced with a doubled stu
dent body, no increase in faculty, and
an academic plant which had had
nothing done for it. So we had to have
money, just like fuel for a fire."
The University's successful comple
tion of its $100 million PACE pro
gram in 1963 set a new high for
private support in capital campaigns
of American academic institutions.
Another problem was "what to do
with the Stanford lands."
"Senator Stanford had written that
one day the lands would be of tre

mendous value to the school, and that
day came in the late forties, right
after the war," Sterling continued.
He cited the various developments
the university planned—the industrial
park, the shopping center, the linear
accelerator—and also the projects of
surrounding communities which Stan
ford had fought, including the new
eight-lane Junipero Serra freeway.
"Guessing Game"
Sterling stressed the difficulty of
planning ahead especially when the
University's neighbors can condemn
land at any time, and called the land
development problem "an exciting
guessing game."
Another accomplishment was the
revision of the curriculum 10-12 years
ago, which added the General Studies
program and the Overseas Campuses
to the Stanford undergraduate pro
gram.
"And now we're at it again," he
went on, "and I hope this one will be

even more productive than the last
one."
In the area of graduate education,
Sterling mentioned the rankings of
university graduate programs, in
Which Stanford rose from 13th in the
nation a decade ago to third yast year.
"This is the real credit to the faculty,"
he said.
During Sterling's 18 years the fac
ulty has increased by 170 per cent,
while the student body has risen only
forty per cent, mainly at the graduate
level.
"And it's a much better student
body than it was," Sterling added,
"which wouldn't have been possible
without a large increase in scholar
ship funds."
Speculation
Sterling had no comment on who
his successor might be or what type
of man would be sought. "The de
cision is entirely the Board's," he said,
"and speculation now is foolish."
The Palo Alto Times speculated in
its March 24 story on the resignation
that Richard W. Lyman, provost since
November, was Sterling's "personal
choice" for the presidency.
Most-mentioned prospect for the
office is John W. Gardner, Secretary
of Health, Education, and Welfare
and a Stanford graduate. But most
observers believe Gardner doesn't
want the job.
And some students have been talk
ing recently about launching a drive

to select David Harris, recently-re
signed ASSU president.
Faculty Meeting
At their meeting this afternoon, the
advisory board and executive com
mittee will discuss the procedure for
picking the "select committee" re
quested by the Trustees, according to
Ernest Hilgard, chairman of the exec
utive committee.
Hilgard emphasized the importance
of having the entire faculty pick the
committee, and said the action taken
today would only be to suggest a pro
cedure for the selection.
Sterling was bom in rural Linwood,
Ontario, Canada, Aug. 6, 1906. He
received his A.B. in 1927 at the Uni
versity of Toronto, his master's at the
University of Alberta in 1930, and
his doctorate at Stanford in 1938.
After serving as an instructor in
history at Stanford and using the re
sources of the Hoover Institution in
his doctoral work, Sterling moved to
the California Institute of Technology
in 1937. He rose from assistant to full
professor of history and chairman of
the faculty in seven years.
From 1942 to 1948 he was a news
commentator on the CBS network.
Among the stories he covered were
major political conventions and for
mation of the United Nations in San
Francisco.
In 1948, he left Caltech for the di
rectorship of the Huntington Library
and Art Gallery in San Marino, and in
1949 he became president of Stan
ford.

major political conventions and for
mation of the United Nations in San

In 1948, he left Caltech for the di

and Art Gallery in San Marino, and in
1949 he became president of Stan

WALLACE STERLING
Wallace Sterling will retire as soon
as the Board of Trustees can find
a new president, he announced March
24.
And the search will formally begin
this afternoon wren the executive
committee of the Academic Council
and the faculty advisory board meet
to discuss plans for setting up a fac
ulty "select committee to advise the
trustees" on selection of a successor.
"There's nothing sudden about
this," Sterling said in an interview
last week. "It's been on my mind for
a long time."
"Every person and every institu
tion needs a change periodically,
about every twenty years, plus or
minus," he continued.
Sterling, who became University
president on April 1, 1949, began his
19th year in the office Saturday.
Asked to summarize the accom

plishments of his term as president,
Sterling spoke of the problems the
University had been confronted with
during the 18 years.
Doubled Student Body
The first was the big jump in en
rollment right after the war. Sterling
recalled that "from Pearl Harbor to
the peak of the GI wave in the late
forties," the student body nearly
doubled.
"We were faced with a doubled stu
dent body, no increase in faculty, and
an academic plant which had had
nothing done for it. So we had to have
money, just like fuel for a fire."
The University's successful comple
tion of its $100 million PACE pro
gram in 1963 set a new high for
private support in capital campaigns
of American academic institutions.
Another problem was "what to do
with the Stanford lands."
"Senator Stanford had written that
one day the lands would be of tre

mendous value to the school, and that
day came in the late forties, right
after the war," Sterling continued.
He cited the various developments
the university planned—the industrial
park, the shopping center, the linear
accelerator—and also the projects of
surrounding communities which Stan
ford had fought, including the new
eight-lane Junipero Serra freeway.
"Guessing Game"
Sterling stressed the difficulty of
planning ahead especially when the
University's neighbors can condemn
land at any time, and called the land
development problem "an exciting
guessing game."
Another accomplishment was the
revision of the curriculum 10-12 years
ago, which added the General Studies
program and the Overseas Campuses
to the Stanford undergraduate pro
gram.
"And now we're at it again," he
went on, "and I hope this one will be

even more productive than the last
one."
In the area of graduate education,
Sterling mentioned the rankings of
university graduate programs, in
Which Stanford rose from 13th in the
nation a decade ago to third yast year.
"This is the real credit to the faculty,"
he said.
During Sterling's 18 years the fac
ulty has increased by 170 per cent,
while the student body has risen only
forty per cent, mainly at the graduate
level.
"And it's a much better student
body than it was," Sterling added,
"which wouldn't have been possible
without a large increase in scholar
ship funds."
Speculation
Sterling had no comment on who
his successor might be or what type
of man would be sought. "The de
cision is entirely the Board's," he said,
"and speculation now is foolish."
The Palo Alto Times speculated in
its March 24 story on the resignation
that Richard W. Lyman, provost since
November, was Sterling's "personal
choice" for the presidency.
Most-mentioned prospect for the
office is John W. Gardner, Secretary
of Health, Education, and Welfare
and a Stanford graduate. But most
observers believe Gardner doesn't
want the job.
And some students have been talk
ing recently about launching a drive

to select David Harris, recently-re
signed ASSU president.
Faculty Meeting
At their meeting this afternoon, the
advisory board and executive com
mittee will discuss the procedure for
picking the "select committee" re
quested by the Trustees, according to
Ernest Hilgard, chairman of the exec
utive committee.
Hilgard emphasized the importance
of having the entire faculty pick the
committee, and said the action taken
today would only be to suggest a pro
cedure for the selection.
Sterling was bom in rural Linwood,
Ontario, Canada, Aug. 6, 1906. He
received his A.B. in 1927 at the Uni
versity of Toronto, his master's at the
University of Alberta in 1930, and
his doctorate at Stanford in 1938.
After serving as an instructor in
history at Stanford and using the re
sources of the Hoover Institution in
his doctoral work, Sterling moved to
the California Institute of Technology
in 1937. He rose from assistant to full
professor of history and chairman of
the faculty in seven years.
From 1942 to 1948 he was a news
commentator on the CBS network.

his doctoral work, Sterling moved to
the California Institute of Technology
in 1937. He rose from assistant to full
professor of history and chairman of
the faculty in seven years.
From 1942 to 1948 he was a news
commentator on the CBS network.
Among the stories he covered were
major political conventions and for
mation of the United Nations in San
Francisco.
In 1948, he left Caltech for the di
rectorship of the Huntington Library
and Art Gallery in San Marino, and in
1949 he became president of Stan
ford.


WALLACE STERLING
Wallace Sterling will retire as soon
as the Board of Trustees can find
a new president, he announced March
24.
And the search will formally begin
this afternoon wren the executive
committee of the Academic Council
and the faculty advisory board meet
to discuss plans for setting up a fac
ulty "select committee to advise the
trustees" on selection of a successor.
"There's nothing sudden about
this," Sterling said in an interview
last week. "It's been on my mind for
a long time."
"Every person and every institu
tion needs a change periodically,
about every twenty years, plus or
minus," he continued.
Sterling, who became University
president on April 1, 1949, began his
19th year in the office Saturday.
Asked to summarize the accom

plishments of his term as president,
Sterling spoke of the problems the
University had been confronted with
during the 18 years.
Doubled Student Body
The first was the big jump in en
rollment right after the war. Sterling
recalled that "from Pearl Harbor to
the peak of the GI wave in the late
forties," the student body nearly
doubled.
"We were faced with a doubled stu
dent body, no increase in faculty, and
an academic plant which had had
nothing done for it. So we had to have
money, just like fuel for a fire."
The University's successful comple
tion of its $100 million PACE pro
gram in 1963 set a new high for
private support in capital campaigns
of American academic institutions.
Another problem was "what to do
with the Stanford lands."
"Senator Stanford had written that
one day the lands would be of tre

mendous value to the school, and that
day came in the late forties, right
after the war," Sterling continued.
He cited the various developments
the university planned—the industrial
park, the shopping center, the linear
accelerator—and also the projects of
surrounding communities which Stan
ford had fought, including the new
eight-lane Junipero Serra freeway.
"Guessing Game"
Sterling stressed the difficulty of
planning ahead especially when the
University's neighbors can condemn
land at any time, and called the land
development problem "an exciting
guessing game."
Another accomplishment was the
revision of the curriculum 10-12 years
ago, which added the General Studies
program and the Overseas Campuses
to the Stanford undergraduate pro
gram.
"And now we're at it again," he
went on, "and I hope this one will be

even more productive than the last
one."
In the area of graduate education,
Sterling mentioned the rankings of
university graduate programs, in
Which Stanford rose from 13th in the
nation a decade ago to third yast year.
"This is the real credit to the faculty,"
he said.
During Sterling's 18 years the fac
ulty has increased by 170 per cent,
while the student body has risen only
forty per cent, mainly at the graduate
level.
"And it's a much better student
body than it was," Sterling added,
"which wouldn't have been possible
without a large increase in scholar
ship funds."
Speculation
Sterling had no comment on who
his successor might be or what type
of man would be sought. "The de
cision is entirely the Board's," he said,
"and speculation now is foolish."
The Palo Alto Times speculated in
its March 24 story on the resignation
that Richard W. Lyman, provost since
November, was Sterling's "personal
choice" for the presidency.
Most-mentioned prospect for the
office is John W. Gardner, Secretary
of Health, Education, and Welfare
and a Stanford graduate. But most
observers believe Gardner doesn't
want the job.
And some students have been talk
ing recently about launching a drive

to select David Harris, recently-re
signed ASSU president.
Faculty Meeting
At their meeting this afternoon, the
advisory board and executive com
mittee will discuss the procedure for
picking the "select committee" re
quested by the Trustees, according to
Ernest Hilgard, chairman of the exec
utive committee.
Hilgard emphasized the importance
of having the entire faculty pick the
committee, and said the action taken
today would only be to suggest a pro
cedure for the selection.
Sterling was bom in rural Linwood,
Ontario, Canada, Aug. 6, 1906. He
received his A.B. in 1927 at the Uni
versity of Toronto, his master's at the
University of Alberta in 1930, and
his doctorate at Stanford in 1938.
