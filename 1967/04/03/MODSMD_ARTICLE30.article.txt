# Eighteen Years
## 
### 
The last eighteen years have seen Stanford
change from an inferior institution on the edge
of financial ruin to one of the nation's most
prosperous and prominent universities. It is no
coincidence that this progress was made during
the presidency of Wallace Sterling.
In this period, the University's total operating
expenditures have increased tenfold and its en
dowment has quadrupled. Other highlights of
the Sterling era have been construction of the
$21 million Medical Center (originally referred
to as Wally's Folly, but now recognized as one
of the best medical schools in the country), the
acquisition of over $100 million in the PACE
program, construction of the $114 million linear
accelerator, and the establishment of five over
seas campuses and seven overseas graduate
centers. In addition, the faculty has increased
by 170 per cent while student enrollment has
only been augmented by 40 per cent. Among
these faculty members have been many re
nowned scholars, including a number of Nobel
laureates.
But dollars, buildings and professors do
not tell the whole story and some of Dr. Sterl
ing's less publicized achievements should not
be overlooked. In the early fifties he vigorously
defended the rights of academic freedom
against the attacks of the McCarthy period. He
opposed witch hunts on campus, as well as
interference from politicians in the affairs of the
academic world. Dr. Sterling has repeatedly
sided with local fraternity chapters protesting
national discriminatory practices. And in 1964,
under Sterling's leadership, Stanford led other
Western colleges in establishing the tradition
that athletes not be paid to play for intercol
legiate teams and meet the same academic
standards as other students.

Dr. Sterling brought to Stanford the personal
ity necessary for effective leadership of this in
stitution. Some refer to him as firm; others call
him stubborn and intransigent. Whichever it is,
no one can argue that he has not made bold
decisions and taken the responsibility for them.
Dr. Sterling has always been a man of action,
although he has often angered his detractors
with what one administrator once called the
gradual approach: "doing easily tomorrow what
could be done today only over a dead body."
The last eighteen years have, of course, not
been without their shortcomings. Stanford has
made great progress when one looks at the
quantity of new red tile on campus and the im
pressive financial statistics, but it is still a long
way from even the edge of intellectual great
ness. Academic innovation has not been com
mensurate with fiscal achievements; Stanford
continues to be a follower, rather than a leader,
among the nation's universities. And as late as
June 1966, Dr. Sterling still referred to degrees
as negotiable commodities when he said that
"their coinage has not been debased and they
have excellent currency throughout the world."
Perhaps the Study of Education will fill the
academic gap and advance Stanford from a
scholastic factory to an intellectual community.
If it does, it may well rank as the greatest
achievement of the Sterling presidency, and
maybe he recognized this when he timed his re
tirement to come only after completion of the
Study.
In any case, John Gardner's comment about
Dr. Sterling last December still holds true: "He
has contributed more than any other human
being to the remarkable advance that Stanford
has made."
