## Friedman Gives Reasons For Decision 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
My attention has been called to
a comment in the March 9, 1967
issue of the Daily on my refusal
of the offer of a Professorship at
Stanford.
I regret that a private matter
of this kind should be discussed
in the public press. But since it
has been, I owe it to my friends
at Stanford to set the record
straight.
The choice I had to make was
between two very good alterna
tives and I must confess it was a
hard decision. The Stanford offer
was extremely attractive: free
dom to teach what I chose, gen
erous support for my research,
and the chance to participate in
the further development of an
already distinguished depart
ment. I nonetheless chose to stay
at the University of Chicago be
cause the attraction of the stimu
lating intellectual atmosphere at
Chicago was reinforced by per
sonal loyalty to the institution,
to an intellectual tradition, and
to my colleagues and students.
Insofar as the predominantly
Liberal atmosphere of Stanford
played any role, it was as a chal
lenge and opportunity, not as a
deterrant.

• Misplaced Morals
Editor, The Daily:
One becomes so very weary of
the constant complaints by those
who disagree with the way our
Government seeks to strive to
wards a free world, and halt dan
gerous insidious aggression. One
would almost suppose these ob
jectors naively believe that — if
we sit back in our pseudo aca
demic environments, lament loud
enough, being motivated prin
cipally towards a complacent
existence in our own little en
vironment — dangerous aggres
sion will simply fade away and
the heavily populated, but pov
erty stricken nations throughout
the world will surely emerge,
like a dream, into a tranquil,
prosperous, and happy state!
To be sure, there is exaggera
tion here, but IF there IS another
solution, let us hear it! Let us
see something positive—not neg
ative complaints and actions.
A further puzzler is Stanford's

theologians who seem to exert so
much energy in this regard. Is
not war the Inevitable result of
evil? Does not the wise farmer
vigorously create the proper con
ditions for his field so it will be
free of pestilence, ravage, and
disease? So it would seem to me:
that our religious leaders should
capitalize their efforts towards a
more highly principled fighting
society. A noted theologian (Dr.
Arnold Cum) has stated that the
only real weapon against Com
munism is a belief/ideology
greater. Our so-called "Nation
Under God" with its lack of Rev
erence towards life, man, agape
love, procreation, scientific dis
coveries, history, and selves, can
only result in a rebellions, trou
bled, neurotic and aimless gene
ration. History clearly exempli
fies that nothing (part, evil and
disease) ever dies of its own ac
cord: it must be combatted.
On behalf of the majority of
the less-vocal patriots, grateful
acknowledgements are extended
to President Sterling for his re
cent exemplification of a wise
and MASCULINE administrator.
Thank Providence we have such
a one running our University!

• Plea For Help
Editor, The DaUy:
I am writing this letter out of
a sense of desperation. While it
is spring in California, it is still
winter in Mississippi, and times
are hard. Many of us partici
pated over the past few years in
raising the hopes of ourselves
and others that even in the black
South a man still had the right
to decide his own destiny. Most
of us now know better. We have
a responsibility however to those
who because they are braver, and
have taken stands from which
they cannot back out with an
understood apology, are in deep
trouble.
John Buffington, Isaac Cole
man, Eddie Brooks, Florida Hen
derson, and Eddie Richmond are
workers on a SNCC-FDP project
in Clay County, Miss. Realizing
that Black Power would mean
the end of white support for the

movement, we built a cafe in
West Point, the largest town in
the county, hoping that if it made
money, that money could finance
the county movement. By next
summer it shows every sign of
being able to. Right now how
ever there is no work in the coun
ty. People eat what they have
stored for the winter. They don't
spend much in restaurants and
bars, even for black power.
John, I hear in a letter from
Ike, is in bed with an ulcer. He
should be in a hospital, but then
he should have stopped working
a few months ago. No rent has
been paid on the Freedom house
in 6 months. The two project cars
are out of commission because
we were unable to afford licenses
for them in November. The gas
has been turned off in both the
house and the office. There is not
always enough to eat, and ciga
rettes are a luxury. They won't
starve because the neighbors are
kind, but the real work in the
county has all but stopped. It is
possible to work on faith, but not
always to live on it; as anyone
who's been really poor can tell
you, it can be difficult to work
when it is necessary to beg to
stay alive.
They need three hundred dol
lars. Now. When I was a sopho
more we raised five thousand in
a week. They could use that
much far better than you are
using it to go to Stanford. Send
some of it to them, to John Buf
fington, 451 Cottrell St., West
Point, Miss.

• Creeping Chem?
Editor, The Daily:
Evidently we have more of a
collective of scholars here at
Stanford than is generally
thought, at least in the chemis
try department. I picked up my
lab deposit refund at Encina and
found that almost all of it had
been kept by the University for
"breakage". I was told that all
the people in the lab section
shared the expense of broken
and missing equipment. What
has happened to that grand old
American and Stanfordlike tra
dition of individualism? Do peo
ple no longer assume responsi
bility for their own actions? I

made the lab deposit as a lab de
posit, not a fee or a gesture of
generosity to the chemistry de
partment. I certainly do not wish
to pay for equipment that other
students (heavens, maybe even
non-students) have broken, bor
rowed, or stolen. Looks like
creepin' socialism to me, Maw.

Sophomore
GPA'?
Editor, The Daily:
Have you ever wondered what
the real significance of your GPA
score is in terms of letter
grades? It is interesting that the
grades are given as letter grades
of A, B, C, D, and F with + and —
versions, then become whole
numbers of 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 (the
values of + and — are thus ig
nored), are converted with
"units" consideration to grade
points, and are finally averaged
to give a result like 3.264, 2.851,
or 1.987. When the graduate
schools ask for a minimum of
A— average, B— average, of C—
average, the GPA sometimes can
give no indication of eligibility.
Certainly someone with a GPA
of 3.000 has an unequivocal B
average, but what about 2.851 or
3.264?
When 3 is awarded to a grade
of B-, B, or B-f, the B— is favored
and the B+ is penalized since
there is no recognition of differ
ence between the two. The same
is true of A, C, D, or F. In most
Eastern schools, letter grades
are assigned only after number
calculations, and grades are
given based only on number.
This means that if 80-89 is the
range of Band that after 4 years
of college your grade is 82.46,
then certainly you are a B— stu
dent. At Stanford and Western
schools, grades are given first as
letters with discrimination be
tween + and then are convert
ed to numbers for calculation ig
noring this -112 and — difference.
This is no doubt unfair and in
accurate compared to the East
ern system. But furthermore it is
very difficult to reconvert the
GPA number back into a letter
grade, ironically after so much
computation.
It would seem to be more fair
to differentiate between B-, B,

and B+ to begin with by award
ing, say, 2.7, 3.0, and 3.3 respec
tively; and similarly for A, C, D,
and F. There would still be some
doubt over some GPA values
such as 2.85, 3.15, or 3.50. But
this method would certainly give
a more realistic measure of
achievement in the classroom
relative to the others. There
would be more to test grades
than just knowing whether or
not you're above the median.
And the computers could prob
ably handle the job.
