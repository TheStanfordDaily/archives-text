## Father Knows Best: In Loco Parentis Still Alive And Lurking In Inner Quad 
### Bob Fishman 
Some of our more enlightened
deans and professors have been
proclaiming lately that In loco
parentis is as dead as Jane
Stanford.
But this peculiar institution
still lives, I believe, and not just
in Argentina.
Stanford has simply become a
more modern parent.
In the good old days when
men were men and women were
docile, fathers like Leland Stan
ford laid down the law to their
male and female offispring, es
pecially to the latter. Stanford
University institutionalized this
autocratic authority — and even
its double standard — in the Ad
ministration and the social regu
lations.
Togetherness
But as our Spock-reading,
neurosis-fearing parents have
come to know, this sort of re
pressive rule leads only to per
sonality problems, not to men
tion costly psychiatric bills. "To
getherness" is the ideal of the
mass media; parents should be
pals to their children.
This new form of parental au
thority is best embodied in the
"family council" so beloved by
Life magazine, in which the
family gets together to decide
democratically how many nights
a week Billy should have the
car.
But Stanford's substitute fa
ther-figures failed to keep pace
with the parents they were sup
posed to be imitating. The
breast • fed - on • demand stu
dents who came here in the
early 60's were confronted not

with in loco parentis but with
in loco gTandparentis.
The students rebelled, and the
fruits of their effort are here for
us to enjoy. In place of authori
tarian disciplinarians, we now
have a Dean's Office filled with
pals. They are so friendly, in
fact, that one always expects
them to blurt out, "Hey Son,
what do you say we go out in
Inner Quad and throw the ball
around?"
For those who require more
motherly care, the Health Ser
vice is always available.
And in place of the autocratic
rulers and regulations, we now
have Stanford's answer to the
family council, the student-fa
culty committee.
Father Knows Best
It seems that Stanford wit
nessed the institutional counter
part of what that immortal tele
vision series, Father Knows Best,
proclaimed for the family: the
cutting - down ■ to ■ size of the
American father.
But authority, either in the
home or in the school, is not yet
impotent. The intellectuals who
used Father Knows Best to des
cry the "emasculation of the
American male" missed the
point of this series. Although
Robert Young usually wound up
drying the dishes, he was a far
more clever manipulator than
most of his critics realized. He
bumbled through each episode,
but by the time the last commer
cial rolled around, his wife and
children were following his
line.
I wonder if this is not the

case with our student-faculty
committees as well.
'Dialogue' vs. Decision
More subtle manipulation is
not the only danger in the "to
getherness" model of university
governance. In the family coun
cil, compromise is the essential
form of human relations. On
Stanford committees, too, dia
logue has become more impor
tant than decision.
Students are so proud of them
selves for having been admitted
to Stanford's family councils
that principles seem less impor
tant than keeping the dialogue
alive. Those who insist on their

principles regardless of expedi
ency are soon branded as the
"problem children" of the uni
versity community.
As in Father Knows Best, es
tablished authority gets its way
in the end, and everyone gathers
'round for a big, hearty laugh
just before the last commercial.
Togetherness would be very
pleasant if American education
— and American society in gen
eral — did not cry out for de
termined, principled action. Here
at Stanford, especially, I wonder
if the "big, happy family" is the
best model for a university that
aspires to greatness.
