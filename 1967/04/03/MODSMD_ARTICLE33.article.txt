## Remembrance Of Things Future 
### Steve Gruber 
(Editor's note: Early In Febru
ary, Daily Prophecy Editor
Steve Gruber expressed what
was perhaps wishful thinking
in one of his notorious columns.
The power of suggestion seems
to have proved too strong. Al
though the two presidents re
signed a month apart, it seems
that Dr. Sterling just missed
one holiday and had to wait for
another. Gruber's column Is re
printed below for the edification
of those who may have missed
it the first time.)
Student Body President David
V. Hairless picked up the phone
and dialed the number of Presi
dent Tarnished's office.
"President Tarnished's office,
Fred Puppet speaking."

"This is Dave Hairless. May I
speak to President Tarnished?"
• "The President's in New York.
Won't be back for a week," Pup
pet said.
"I saw him come out of the
Faculty Club 30 minutes ago."
"Well, he's in an all day con
ference then." Puppet was in
stantly alert at this attempted
Invasion of Building 10.
"I know he's not in a con
ference. Why don't you just let
me talk to him?"
"Oh, all right. Hang on—he's
Outside and I'll have to get him."
c Puppet walked out into the
courtyard behind the President's
Office where Tarnished was pol
ishing his Cadillac.
!• "Very good, Boss. You even
got the chrome this time."

" "Fascinating little vehicle, Pup
pet," Tarnished said. "If only it
weren't for the Trustees, I'd put
fyi bucket seats and a floor shift"
Puppet's face lit up when he
mentioned the floor shift.
"Hey, Boss, the bearded won
der is on the phone."
"Hell, now I suppose I'll have
to talk to him."
+ * •
"President Tarnished here.
Hello David."
"Hi. When are you going to
let women live off-campus?"
"About the same time you get
your next haircut."
"Seriously, when are you go
ing to give in to our demands?"
"I'm sorry David, we can't do
it. They'll procastinate like bun
nies."
"You mean proliferate."
"Sorry. It's just that I'm so
tired after the Board of Trustees
meeting last week. Being Univer
sity President isn't quite, as easy
as being Student Body Presi
dent."
"I wouldn't know about that.
You ought to see the crank
letters I've been getting."
"I get hate mail too. Only
from different people."
"Well, at least you have the
support of the alumni. Most of
the students don't care. Even our
little rent strike has been a
failure."
"Things are so bad over here
that the big contributors are
giving their money to Berkeley."
"Things are worse over here,

believe me. I wish I could resign
but everyone would say that I
was giving in to you."
"I've thought about resigning
a few times this year myself,
David. But the alumni would
say that I was forced out by
you."
Suddenly they both spoke at
once: "Why don't we . . . why
don't we both resign at the same
time?"
• • •
When the big day came, the
sun shone over Stanford. Hair
less and Tarnished had an
nounced that they would make
a joint statement in White Plaza
at noon, but both had refused to
elaborate on the details.
"What could they possibly find
to agree on?" one Florence
Moore coed asked her com
panion. "Must be the weather,"
he said. "They both hate sunny
days."
Tarnished and Hairless stepped
to the microphone. "You prob
ably won't believe this," they
said, "but we've both decided to
resign for the good of ourselves
and Stanford University."
The crowd, 10,000 strong, was
dumbfounded.
"Say Dave, would you like to
take a ride in my car?" Tarn
ished asked.
"Well, I don't usually ride
in Cadillacs. . ,
"I've just put in bucket seats
and a floor shift. I can get from
zero to sixty in nine seconds."

got the chrome this time."

Puppet's face lit up when he

"Hey, Boss, the bearded won

"President Tarnished here.
Hello David."
"Hi. When are you going to
let women live off-campus?"
"About the same time you get
your next haircut."
"Seriously, when are you go
ing to give in to our demands?"
"I'm sorry David, we can't do
it. They'll procastinate like bun
nies."
"You mean proliferate."
"Sorry. It's just that I'm so
tired after the Board of Trustees
meeting last week. Being Univer
sity President isn't quite, as easy
as being Student Body Presi
dent."
"I wouldn't know about that.
You ought to see the crank
letters I've been getting."
"I get hate mail too. Only
from different people."
"Well, at least you have the
support of the alumni. Most of
the students don't care. Even our
little rent strike has been a
failure."
"Things are so bad over here
that the big contributors are
giving their money to Berkeley."
"Things are worse over here,

believe me. I wish I could resign
but everyone would say that I
was giving in to you."
"I've thought about resigning
a few times this year myself,
David. But the alumni would
say that I was forced out by
you."
Suddenly they both spoke at
once: "Why don't we . . . why
don't we both resign at the same
time?"

When the big day came, the
sun shone over Stanford. Hair
less and Tarnished had an
nounced that they would make
a joint statement in White Plaza
at noon, but both had refused to
elaborate on the details.
"What could they possibly find
to agree on?" one Florence
Moore coed asked her com
panion. "Must be the weather,"
he said. "They both hate sunny
days."
Tarnished and Hairless stepped
to the microphone. "You prob
ably won't believe this," they
said, "but we've both decided to
resign for the good of ourselves
and Stanford University."
The crowd, 10,000 strong, was
dumbfounded.
"Say Dave, would you like to
take a ride in my car?" Tarn
ished asked.
"Well, I don't usually ride
in Cadillacs. . ,
"I've just put in bucket seats
and a floor shift. I can get from
zero to sixty in nine seconds."

Hello David."
"Hi. When are you going to
let women live off-campus?"
"About the same time you get
your next haircut."
"Seriously, when are you go
ing to give in to our demands?"
"I'm sorry David, we can't do
it. They'll procastinate like bun
nies."
"You mean proliferate."
"Sorry. It's just that I'm so
tired after the Board of Trustees
meeting last week. Being Univer
sity President isn't quite, as easy
as being Student Body Presi
dent."
"I wouldn't know about that.
You ought to see the crank
letters I've been getting."
"I get hate mail too. Only
from different people."
"Well, at least you have the
support of the alumni. Most of
the students don't care. Even our
little rent strike has been a
failure."
"Things are so bad over here
that the big contributors are
giving their money to Berkeley."
"Things are worse over here,

believe me. I wish I could resign
but everyone would say that I
was giving in to you."
"I've thought about resigning
a few times this year myself,
David. But the alumni would
say that I was forced out by
you."
Suddenly they both spoke at
once: "Why don't we . . . why
don't we both resign at the same
time?"

When the big day came, the
sun shone over Stanford. Hair
less and Tarnished had an
nounced that they would make
a joint statement in White Plaza
at noon, but both had refused to
elaborate on the details.
"What could they possibly find
to agree on?" one Florence
Moore coed asked her com
panion. "Must be the weather,"
he said. "They both hate sunny
days."
Tarnished and Hairless stepped
to the microphone. "You prob
ably won't believe this," they
said, "but we've both decided to
resign for the good of ourselves
and Stanford University."
The crowd, 10,000 strong, was
dumbfounded.
"Say Dave, would you like to
take a ride in my car?" Tarn
ished asked.
"Well, I don't usually ride
in Cadillacs. . ,
"I've just put in bucket seats
and a floor shift. I can get from
zero to sixty in nine seconds."
