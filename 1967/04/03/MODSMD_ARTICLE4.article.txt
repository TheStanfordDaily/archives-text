# Palo Alto-Stanford Dispute Ends
## University To Build New Hospital 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Stanford has decided to build its
own hosiptal.
The decision marks the end of near
ly two years of squabbling with Palo
Alto over the ownership of the pres
ent Stanford Palo Alto Hospital.
In addition to the new hospital,
Stanford will finance facilities for a
Basic Science Building, expected to
house the departments of Anatomy,
Physiology, and Medical Microbiology,
plus an ambulatory care center.
According to Dr. Robert J. Glaser,
Dean of the School of Medicine, the
ambulatory care center will "provide
more effectively for patient care and
teaching in the field of comprehen
sive medicine."
There are presently 200 beds avail
able to Stanford in the 437 bed Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital. These beds,
now fully occupied, are inadequate to
meet the Medical School's expanding
patient care, education and research
needs, according to Dr. Glaser. Stan
ford has not decided whether to sell

its beds in the present hospital to
Palo Alto, Glaser said-
Dispute Arose In 1966
The hospital dispute arose when
Palo Alto requested, on May 19, 1965,
that Stanford define its interest in
taking over the city's share of the hos
pital.
A citizen's committee previously
had recommended to the Palo Alto
city council that "it get out of the
hospital business" by leasing the hos
pital to Stanford to accommodate the
expanding needs of the Medical
School.
Stanford responded on January 27,
1966, with a message from President
Sterling to Palo Alto Mayor Edward
Arnold urging that the University
"enter into negotiations with the city
council for purposes of defining mutu
ally acceptable terms whereby the
University could acquire the Palo
Alto- Stanford Hospital."
The negotiation produced a propo
sal by Stanford to buy the Hospital

for $5 million, which was rejected by
the city council.
Master Plan
The Board of Trustees approved the
new hospital March 21, giving the
Medical School permission to develop
a master plan for building and financ
ing the venture. The first step in im
plementing the Trustee's action will
be the appointment of a team of ex
perts to develop the master plan, ac
cording to Glaser. Groundbreaking is
expected in 18 months to two years.
The hospital should be completed by
1971.
The development of the ambulatory
care center is "one of the most im
portant challenges before us," Glaser
commented. The center will provide
comprehensive care for patients who
do not need to be hospitalized, thus
releasing hospital beds for more pa
tients. It will function in place of the
traditional outpatient clinic. /
"Care in such a center should serve
better the patient's needs and should
make for significant economies," Glas

er said. "It will also enhance our pro
grams for the education of outstand
ing physicians for the coming decade."
