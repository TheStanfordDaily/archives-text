# Housing Experiment 'Strongly' Endorsed By Education Study Residence Committee
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
The recently-constituted committee
on residential policies of the Study of
Education at Stanford has "strongly"

endorsed the "idea of a Wilbur Ex
periment as outlined in the ASSU
Housing Commission report."
The committee, in a meeting last

Wednesday, set up a subcommittee
to draw up final plans for the experi
ment. It will report back tomorrow.
If the residence committee approves
the plans, they could be considered
by the steering committee when it
meets the same afternoon.
The residence committee also ap
proved a student-initiated proposal for
coeducation in Hulme and McFarlane
Houses in Escondido Village. The two
graduate high-rises would be coed
on each floor. In future meetings, the
committee will consider eight addi
tional proposed housing changes for
next year. The charge received from
the steering committee stipulated that
any experiments for next year must
be given to the steering committee by
Friday, April 14.
The other proposals include coedu
cation and an academic program in
Branner, coeducation and freshmen in
Toyon, coeducation with a "Festival of
the Arts" theme in Lagunita, and a
continuation of the Grove Project-

The long range duty of the commit
tee, as set forth in the steering com
mittee's charge, "is to consider the
role of student residences in the life
of the University and to make recom
mendations for University policy in
this area."
