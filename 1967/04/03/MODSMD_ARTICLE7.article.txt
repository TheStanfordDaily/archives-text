# Three SRT Administrators Quit; Hierarchical Structure Criticized
## 
### HENRY MULLER 
Three officials of the Stanford Rep
ertory Theater (SRT), including Man
aging Director Peter Troxell, have
resigned.
Also leaving will be Dennis Powers,
Assistant Managing Director, and
Robert Heller, Director of Public Re
lations.
According to Heller, it is a coinci
dence that the three resignations
should be almost simultaneous. He
said the decisions were made inde
pendently and for different reasons.
Troxell said he is leaving because
he can no longer function success

fully under the organizational ma
chinery of the University. Powers and
Heller have resigned to accept attrac
tive job offers, Powers as Director of
Public Relations for the American
Conservatory Theater in San Fran
cisco and Heller as a film producer in
New York.
Administrative Structure
Troxell and Heller both point to the
present administrative structure as a
hindrance to successful operation of
SRT. According to Heller, all policy
decisions are made by SRT officials in
conjunction with University adminis
trators, including Provost Richard Ly
man, Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Robert Sears, Assistant to the Pro
vost Raymond Bacchetti, and Prof.
Robert Loper, head of Speech and
Drama.
The Theater has to be almost a dic
tatorship, Heller emphasizes. He
points out that under the current sys
tem it takes too much time and dis
cussion to reach a decision.
Advisory Capacity
He says the University should act
only in an advisory capacity and
should give SRT complete autonomy.
"It should not be run by people who
don't know what they're talking

about," according to Heller. "Adminis
trators are intelligent men, but they
have never dealt with theater before."
Bacchetti, who has worked closely
with SRT, admitted that the details
of running a professional theater
were unfamiliar to the University and
praised Troxell for the patience he
has shown.
He denied, however, that the Uni
versity was exercising administrative
control over the Theater. "It has
never dictated artistic content or how
plays should be done," Bacchetti em
phasized.
Resource
He said the Provost's office has
been a resource to help SRT, but that
otherwise it does not behave different
ly with Speech and Drama as with
Chemistry or Physics.
Heller remarked that another prob
lem has been that Loper, who origin
ally conceived the idea of SRT, has
had to run the company and at the
same time be head of Speech and
Drama, as well as continue teaching.
Stephen Baffrey, producer of the
Summer Festival, has been named to
replace Troxell. SRT is in the middle
of its second season and still has two
productions to go.
