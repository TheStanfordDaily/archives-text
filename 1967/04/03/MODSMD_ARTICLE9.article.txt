# Twitty Takes Own Life
## 
### 
Professor Victor Chandler
Twitty, nationally prominent em
bryologist and former head of
the Biological Sciences depart
ment for 15 years, died Wednes
day, March 22, victim of ap
parent suicide.
Professor Donald Kennedy,
present department head, de
scribed Twitty as "an extremely
distinguished scientist, noted for
his contributions to experimental
embryology and for his more
recent studies on the behavior
and evolutionary biology of sala
manders."
"He was held in the highest
regard by his faculty colleagues
here and by his many former
students who now hold faculty
positions in American colleges
and universities."

A past pi'esident of the Amer
ican Society of Zoologists (1958-
59) and a member of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences
since 1950, he held the Herzstein
professorship of biology, and
had taught at Stanford since
1932.
A fellow of the American Aca
demy of Arts and Sciences, Prof.
Twitty received a National Coun
cil fellowship after graduation
from Butler College IBS. 1925)
and Yale (Ph.D. 1929). He was
a past president of both the So
ciety for Growth and Develop
ment and the Western Society
of Naturalists. Starred in Amer
ican Men of Science, he received
a Guggenheim fellowship in
1956.

He described his experiences
as a researcher in the book "Of
Scientists and Salamanders,"
published last year. One review
er called it "full of excitement,
the disappointment, the tedium,
and the plain fun of research
and discovery."
After acquiring distinction as
an experimental embryologist,
Prof. Twitty turned to studies
of the homing instinct of a sala
mander — the California newt
or "water dog." In 1963, he spent
a sabbatical year studying 10,000
salamanders in Sonoma County
on a National Science Founda
tion grant.
In that same year he wrote
that "the study of the behavior
of lowly organisms can be justi
fied, if need be, by the perspec
tive it gives in untangling the
components and origins of the
complex behavior patterns in
higher species, including man."
Dr. Twitty was discovered in
his laboratory at 9:15 a.m. by a
research assistant and reported
dead on arrival shortly there
after at the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital. The Santa Clara
County Coroner's office declared
him the victim of suicide by
poison, cyanide.
He left a personal note to his
wife. Its contents were not dis
closed.

Professor Victor Chandler
Twitty, nationally prominent em
bryologist and former head of
the Biological Sciences depart
ment for 15 years, died Wednes
day, March 22, victim of ap
parent suicide.
Professor Donald Kennedy,
present department head, de
scribed Twitty as "an extremely
distinguished scientist, noted for
his contributions to experimental
embryology and for his more
recent studies on the behavior
and evolutionary biology of sala
manders."
"He was held in the highest
regard by his faculty colleagues
here and by his many former
students who now hold faculty
positions in American colleges
and universities."

A past pi'esident of the Amer
ican Society of Zoologists (1958-
59) and a member of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences
since 1950, he held the Herzstein
professorship of biology, and
had taught at Stanford since
1932.
A fellow of the American Aca
demy of Arts and Sciences, Prof.
Twitty received a National Coun
cil fellowship after graduation
from Butler College IBS. 1925)
and Yale (Ph.D. 1929). He was
a past president of both the So
ciety for Growth and Develop
ment and the Western Society
of Naturalists. Starred in Amer
ican Men of Science, he received
a Guggenheim fellowship in
1956.

He described his experiences
as a researcher in the book "Of
Scientists and Salamanders,"
published last year. One review
er called it "full of excitement,
the disappointment, the tedium,
and the plain fun of research
and discovery."
After acquiring distinction as
an experimental embryologist,
Prof. Twitty turned to studies
of the homing instinct of a sala
mander — the California newt
or "water dog." In 1963, he spent
a sabbatical year studying 10,000
salamanders in Sonoma County
on a National Science Founda
tion grant.
In that same year he wrote
that "the study of the behavior
of lowly organisms can be justi
fied, if need be, by the perspec
tive it gives in untangling the
components and origins of the
complex behavior patterns in
higher species, including man."
Dr. Twitty was discovered in
his laboratory at 9:15 a.m. by a
research assistant and reported
dead on arrival shortly there
after at the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital. The Santa Clara
County Coroner's office declared
him the victim of suicide by
poison, cyanide.
He left a personal note to his
wife. Its contents were not dis
