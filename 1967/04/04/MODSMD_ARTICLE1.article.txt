# 'Resistance' Condemns Stanford War Links
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
Stanford University, Stanford Industrial
Park and Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
are closely related to the war in Vietnam,
Ira Arlook charges in an editorial in the sec
ond issue of Resistance, the bi-monthly publica
tion of The Experiment.
The editorial continues: "the war in Viet
nam is no simple case of misguided anti-com
munism, no aberration of an otherwise pure
American society, but rather a symptom of
the disease which pervades every aspect of it
—imperialism is a natural product of Ameri
can society."
Edited by Barry Greenberg and Marc Sapir,
the second issue of Resistance will be distrib
uted to living groups and in Daily boxes
around campus today.
Intimate Connections?
"SRI and Stanford deny that they are inti
mately connected," according to David Ran
som, author of the lead article. Ransom goes
on to refute their claims. He cites a statement
by the U.S. General Accounting Office that
SRl's "close ties with Stanford University are
clear cut and unmistakable as evidenced by
the fact that the Trustess of the University
are the general members of the Institute and

elect the Institute's Board of Directors."
Ransom oilers many examples of men who
are associated with SRI and the University,
war related industries, or both. One such s
Ernest Arbuckle, Dean of the Business School
and a former University trustee who is pres
ently Chairman of the Board at SRI, replac
ing Wallace Sterling, who remains a director.
Ransom claims, "SRI publications predicted
the war as early as 1957 and suggested how it
will be fought and how it ought to be resolved."
Although the stated goals of SRI are "to pro
mote and foster the application of science in
the development of commerce, trade, and in
dustry . . . (for) the improvement of the gen
eral standard of living and the peace and pros
perity of mankind." He charges that SRI think
ing to date has been occupied with maintain
ing U.S. wealth, organizing a world struggle
against Communism and, "looking forward to
increased defense spending".
Taxes Taxing?
Furthermore, Ransom feels that SRI is be
ing used as a tax free means to develop new
products for private industry through research.
Because it is a non-profit institute, contribu
tions to SRI are tax exempt. In many cases,
money has been used to further the interests
of those corporations which have donated
heavily to SRI.
Ransom said, "SRl's Executive Vice Presi

dent Weldon Gibson, oflered two principal bas
es for concern about (the slacking of) defense
expenditures and concluded that 'both princi
pals appear to sound a warning for California
war industry.'
Ransom exposed Stanford's role in the de
velopment of new techniques of chemical bio
logical warfare. He offers a statement by Carl
Amme, a member of SRl's "Defense" Analy
sis Center as an example of what he feels is
the Institute's attitude toward chemical bio
logical warfare. Amme stated that the United
States should not hamper itself in wartime by
agreeing not to use certain weapons as it did
during the Korean Conflict when biological
warfare was banned.
Later in his article Ransom criticized Eu
gene Staley, Professor of Education and Sen
ior International Economist at SRI for his
role in advising the government to pursue a
policy of controlling "strategic hamlets in
Vietnam. He feels that the six weeks Staley
spent in Saigon were hardly sufficient re
search for a decision on which the U.S. has
based "an entire war policy."
Ransom says the policy of directly control
ling the lives of the peasants in these hamlets
is inconsistent with our stated objective of
providing more freedom than will the Com
munists should they come to power.
William Bredo, currently Director of the

Food and Agricudture Division of SRI worked
with Staley in Vietnam. He is also to draw up
a plan of land redistribution to be presented
to the Saigon government. The first proposal
was presented by Albert Shapero, Director of
SRl's Technology Management programs,
who calls himself a "human engineer," accor
ding to Ransom.
Ransom writes, "Dr. Bredo admits he knows
nothing of Vietnamese peasant culture." He
feels that the land reform proposals of the
Viet Cong are more equitable than those of
fered by Bredo. In his article he accuses Bredo
of inconsistency in his attitude toward collec
tivization.
The following are excerpts from the text
of Ransom's article in Resistance:
"Both SRI and Stanford University deny
they are intimately connected, but the truth
is otherwise.
"SRI executives like to boast of their con
nections with the University. In a speech given
at a banquet of the Bay Area Engineering So
cieties in 1955, Jesse Hobson, then President
of SRI, said htat 'we participate in an honors
graduate study progra mat Stanford Univer
sity, contribute to the University's general
funds, and provide assistance toits educational
activities in various other ways.' "
"SRI researched, wrote, and published for
McDonnell Aircraft, a study called "Environ

mental Conditions in Selected Areas of Poten
tial Limited Warefare," which characterized
itself as reviewing 'the basic strategic and
tactical considerations of limited warfare ~.
and environment which would affect the con
duct of small wars in various peripheral areas
of Asia," one of them "Southeast Asia."
"SRI has had a great deal to do with the
development and testing of just such weapons
for just such wars as 'Limited Warfare' sug
gests, and SRI 'Associates have benefited by it.
"Well, there you have it—SRI: simple anti
communism; overt concern with markets, raw
materials, strategic goods; industrial develop
ers of the Pacific; authors of the theory and
practice of 'limited warfare' and counter-insur
gency; research and development for the wea
pons the Industrial Park manufacturers, the
Trustees get rich on, and you and I fight with
in Vietnam. Developers with Stanford and
FMC of the CBW arsenal of contingency plans
for atomic attack, of the anti-missile missile
against rocket attack and economic slump.
Players of games with the Soviet Army, anti
revolutionaries in military oligarchies, con
fused totalitarians who impose decisions and
call them choice. Master-minds and minor
minds of concentration camps, ends to the war
(but not the dictatorship) in 18 months, of
bases from which to harass China, and land
reform that who knows whom will choose."
