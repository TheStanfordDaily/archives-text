# IIR Plans Student Exchange With Tokyo, Berlin, Beirut
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
Bob Robinson, Bob Spring
bord, and Patrick McDermott
are the three Stanford students
chosen by the IIR to attend for
eign exchange programs in Ja
pan, Germany, and Lebanon.
Currently at Stanford, in the
other half of the exchange, are
Takasugu Chiba from Tokyo,
Uwe Nagel from Berlin, and
Edmund Tu'meh from Beirut.
Each September, Stanford
sends one student to Keio Uni
versity in Tokyo, American Uni
versity in Beirut, and the Free

University of Berlin. Each of
these Universities sends one stu
dent here. Stanford and ASSU
split the tuition bill for the stu
dents coming here.
Local Housing
Housing is arranged through
local living groups. The Stanford
students going abroad share
these same benefits, with the
host schools paying tuition and
providing living accomodations.
George Sanborn, IIR Chair
man of the Exchange Division,
explained that each student
would be living with foreigners

s
â€”totally immersed in the host
culture, unlike the overseas cam
pus program.
Sanborn also noted that this
program was the only opportun
ity for Stanford students to
study in the Middle East.
Pat McDermott, a junior En
glish major, will study Japanese
at Keio University in Tokyo,
where classes will be taught in
Japanese. Bob Robinson, a sen
ior interested in German and
psychology, will attend the Uni
versity ot Berlin. Robinson at
tended the Stuttgart overseas
campus.
In Beirut
Bob Springbord, a graduate
student in political science, will
be the exchange student in Bei
rut. He has previously spent a
summer in Egypt, and will study
comparative politics. He plans
to write his thesis in Egypt.
Robinson, from the Philip
pines, hopes Berlin will give him
insights into the East-West con
flict, and opportunities to ex
plore East Germany. Bertolt
Brecht is another one of his
major interests. "I love Ger
many," he said.
Language Improved
Chiba, the Keio University stu
dent now at Stanford, explained
that his first trip outside ol Ja
pan gave him an opportunity to
improve his English. His fields
of interest are economies, politi
cal science, and English litera
ture.
