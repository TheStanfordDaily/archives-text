# Card Swimmers Take It Off, All Off
## The 						Psychological Shave 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The haircut, long a powerful
tradition in Stanford athletics,
bears an entirely practical sig
nificance in swimming. In swim
ming, however, "clean cut" ap
plies not only to the hair on one's
head, but to that worrisome
growth all over the body.
The Shave has become a ven
erable institution among Stan
ford's national champion swim
mers.
The Shave starts with a close
not a bald—haircut three days
before the Big Meet. Once at the
Big Meet, the Big Shave spreads
over the entire corpus.
Man-To-Hair Affair
Shaving is an entirely individ
ual affair that takes about an
hour and a half of uninterrupted
concentration. When the Shave
is finished, nary a hair can be
found on any leg, arm, or
chest. The armpits usually re
tain their foliage until the Olym
pics.
The feeling produced in the
water is an absolutely exhilarat
ing sensation of sleek, sheer
speed. (Remember what a bath
felt like when you were 5 years
old?) Gone is the sand-bag drag
of all those handfuls of clutch
ing hair.
While the physiological bene
lts of bare-follicle swimming can
note be denied,, the true merit of
the Big Shave lies in its psycho
logical preparation. The act of
slicing off one's hair and per
haps drawing a little blood is an
almost pagan rite where a swim
me mrakes his final resolution
to swim as he never has before.
Scoffs At Shirk Jockeys
From Stanford's viewpoint,
shaving is strictly a once-in-the
season proposition. To shave
early in the season might pro
duce delightful temporal results,
but the loss of unique sensation
at year's end would be devastat
ing.
Several of the Eastern swim
ming powers shave for every big
dual meet, and produce some
rather impressive early season
performances. Stanford swim
mers scoff at these with, "Sure,
that's fast, but. they shaved down
for that meet."
At the NCAA's this year, at
least, the shave-savers fared
over and again better than their
eastern ostentatious Shick jock
eys.
Mike Well, perhaps Stanford's
largest proponent of the stain

less steal swath, shaved his
times more than 5 percent in
every event. He brought his 200
time from 1:49 down to 1:43,
his 500 time from 4:56 to 4:44,
and dropped his 1650 from 17:20
to 16:37.
For that half of the population
that does not customarily shave

Its legs, the after-effects of the
shave can be an itchy torture
for several weeks. Stanford
swimmers, however, will be re
lieved shortly.
Most of Stanford's swimmers
enter the national Indoor AAU
chapionships at Dallas this week
end. The AAU's are obviously

big enough to warrant the Big
Shave, especially since there
suits will determine the U.S. Pan
American team.
Where to go? The forests lie
barren after the NCAA's. Stan
ford swimmers, it appears, will
have to settle to attack a two
week "shadow."

mers scoff at these with, "Sure,
that's fast, but. they shaved down
for that meet."
At the NCAA's this year, at
least, the shave-savers fared
over and again better than their
eastern ostentatious Shick jock
eys.
Mike Well, perhaps Stanford's
largest proponent of the stain

less steal swath, shaved his
times more than 5 percent in
every event. He brought his 200
time from 1:49 down to 1:43,
his 500 time from 4:56 to 4:44,
and dropped his 1650 from 17:20
to 16:37.
For that half of the population
that does not customarily shave

Its legs, the after-effects of the
shave can be an itchy torture
for several weeks. Stanford
swimmers, however, will be re
lieved shortly.
Most of Stanford's swimmers
enter the national Indoor AAU
chapionships at Dallas this week
end. The AAU's are obviously

big enough to warrant the Big
Shave, especially since there
suits will determine the U.S. Pan
American team.
Where to go? The forests lie
barren after the NCAA's. Stan
ford swimmers, it appears, will
have to settle to attack a two
week "shadow."
The haircut, long a powerful
tradition in Stanford athletics,
bears an entirely practical sig
nificance in swimming. In swim
ming, however, "clean cut" ap
plies not only to the hair on one's
head, but to that worrisome
growth all over the body.
The Shave has become a ven
erable institution among Stan
ford's national champion swim
mers.
The Shave starts with a close
not a bald—haircut three days
before the Big Meet. Once at the
Big Meet, the Big Shave spreads
over the entire corpus.
Man-To-Hair Affair
Shaving is an entirely individ
ual affair that takes about an
hour and a half of uninterrupted
concentration. When the Shave
is finished, nary a hair can be
found on any leg, arm, or
chest. The armpits usually re
tain their foliage until the Olym
pics.
The feeling produced in the
water is an absolutely exhilarat
ing sensation of sleek, sheer
speed. (Remember what a bath
felt like when you were 5 years
old?) Gone is the sand-bag drag
of all those handfuls of clutch
ing hair.
While the physiological bene
lts of bare-follicle swimming can
note be denied,, the true merit of
the Big Shave lies in its psycho
logical preparation. The act of
slicing off one's hair and per
haps drawing a little blood is an
almost pagan rite where a swim
me mrakes his final resolution
to swim as he never has before.
Scoffs At Shirk Jockeys
From Stanford's viewpoint,
shaving is strictly a once-in-the
season proposition. To shave
early in the season might pro
duce delightful temporal results,
but the loss of unique sensation
at year's end would be devastat
ing.
Several of the Eastern swim
ming powers shave for every big
