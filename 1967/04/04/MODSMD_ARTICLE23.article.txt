The problems which have led to the resigna
tion of the Repertory Theater's Managing Di
rector should serve as a reminder of the hazard
that faces any innovation here: that the Univer
sity's omnipresent bureaucracy can threaten the
success of even the most auspicious enterprise.
It is clear from statements made by officials
of both the Theater and the University that all
have the best interests of SRT in mind. Man
aging Director Peter Troxell, in leaving, has
reiterated his belief that a professional resident
theater can exist in the context of a University.
And the administration readily agrees that the
Repertory Theater, if successful, can be of great
value to Stanford.
The problem is that the present administra
tive structure inherently stifles fulfillment of the
potential of the Theater. Urgent decisions
should be left to one responsible individual, not
to a group of men, some of whom know very
little about the theater. SRT should be given
greater autonomy, so that its own leadership
can develop the strength necessary for effective
management of this venture.
The Repertory Theater has already proven

that it is an asset to the University. Undergrad
uate productions have improved considerably
since its formation in 1965 and graduate stu
dents in Speech and Drama have been given
the unique opportunity to receive not only a de
gree, but also practical experience in the theater.
SRT, however, is still on probation and needs
help in order to be guaranteed the success it de
serves. The University should begin by re-eval
uating its administrative relationship with the
Repertory Theater.
