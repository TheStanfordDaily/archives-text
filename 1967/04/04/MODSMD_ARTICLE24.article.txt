# Welcome, Palo Alto
## 
### 
The City of Palo Alto is trying to set np a
"liason committee" with Stanford in order to
work out their mutual problems. The University
however has insisted that the meetings be "in
formal and private."
Mrs. Frances Dias, Mayor of Palo Alto said
that the question of secret meetings is a "con
stant problem of long-stariding we have had
with Stanford."
Welcome, Mrs. Dias, to the long standing line
behind closed doors.
