# This Stanford
## Of Lakeside Spring And Evening Light... 
### Clay L. Miller 
A fellow was propped flat,
against a very pale twilight, on
the short bank of turf down be
tween the trail around Lake
Lagunita and the water itself.
He had set up one of those com
pact, battery - powered phono
graphs that go anywhere with
out a cord and was playing some
thing fairly classical, sung by a
magnificent choir. Passing above
him, I could read on the album
jacket that it was "Finlandia."
"It's 'Finlandia'," he said up to
me. Except for the gnats, hang
ing in their same loose swarms
for hours, he'd had the lake to
himself until I came. We talked
about his record player, then I
went on along the trail.
The sky that had been such a
deep blue all day was almost
white and the air was thick and
warm -not what people expect
spring to be like at all. I think
the reason Stanford has no real
spring in the conventional, char
treuse sense is the dust that
comes so amazingly fast. Two
days or three of sunshine after a
rainstorm and it's back, dull on
the tops of my shoes, caked
exactly like fine-ground ginger
on hubcaps and tires. It settles
into everything, like face-pow
der into a woman's jewelry
drawer, and mellow us down to
something more like September.
Delicate Balance
Almost at a given instant, the
very, very delicate balance of
smells — oak leaves, eucalyptus
bark, grass, the wood scaps rot
ting in a giai t ring around the
edge of the water, even the tal
cum a barber whisked on my

neck that afternoon right after
lunch—shifted perceptibly. Since
time of day is mostly set by the
nose, even though the sun was
still pumping up afternoon from
behind the foothills, it became
night.
Night in the men's gym with
the last showers dripping off and
the last bare feet slapping, echo
ing, across the wet cement floor.
And on Quad, in cramped cubi
cle-libraries behind sandstone
still just barely warm to the
touch, where mean wearing dark
brown sportcoats over green
sweaters would be speaking
French together.
Now it began to get properly
dark. Over where the Laguinita
Court kitchen windows beamed
yellow through black oak trees,
an unseen hasher slammed down
a major tray of dishes.
Record Player
I started around, finally back
past the fellow with the record
player.
"We're on 'Swedish Rhapsody'
now," he called.
Absolutely, amazingly still on
the water, four of the sailing
club's boats, scrubbed, empty,
squared away for the night, were
tied up in a bunch at the end of
the narroy float down below the
boathouse. I dropped down on
my haunches to mark their
masts against the gleam of the
Kappa Alpha dining room. With
the slightest ripple these shells
dip and bob like pieces of cork
in a bathtub. But now they really
were absolutely still. If they
were people, they might have
been straining to hear the very
last of "Swedish Rhapsody."

The sky that had been such a
deep blue all day was almost
white and the air was thick and
warm -not what people expect
spring to be like at all. I think
the reason Stanford has no real
spring in the conventional, char
treuse sense is the dust that
comes so amazingly fast. Two
days or three of sunshine after a
rainstorm and it's back, dull on
the tops of my shoes, caked
exactly like fine-ground ginger
on hubcaps and tires. It settles
into everything, like face-pow
der into a woman's jewelry
drawer, and mellow us down to
something more like September.
Delicate Balance
Almost at a given instant, the
very, very delicate balance of
smells — oak leaves, eucalyptus
bark, grass, the wood scaps rot
ting in a giai t ring around the
edge of the water, even the tal
cum a barber whisked on my

neck that afternoon right after
lunch—shifted perceptibly. Since
time of day is mostly set by the
nose, even though the sun was
still pumping up afternoon from
behind the foothills, it became
night.
Night in the men's gym with
the last showers dripping off and
the last bare feet slapping, echo
ing, across the wet cement floor.
And on Quad, in cramped cubi
cle-libraries behind sandstone
still just barely warm to the
touch, where mean wearing dark
brown sportcoats over green
sweaters would be speaking
French together.
Now it began to get properly
dark. Over where the Laguinita
Court kitchen windows beamed
yellow through black oak trees,
an unseen hasher slammed down
a major tray of dishes.
Record Player
I started around, finally back
past the fellow with the record
player.
"We're on 'Swedish Rhapsody'
now," he called.
Absolutely, amazingly still on
the water, four of the sailing
club's boats, scrubbed, empty,
squared away for the night, were
tied up in a bunch at the end of
the narroy float down below the
boathouse. I dropped down on
my haunches to mark their
masts against the gleam of the
Kappa Alpha dining room. With
the slightest ripple these shells
dip and bob like pieces of cork
in a bathtub. But now they really
were absolutely still. If they
were people, they might have
been straining to hear the very
last of "Swedish Rhapsody."
A fellow was propped flat,
against a very pale twilight, on
the short bank of turf down be
tween the trail around Lake
Lagunita and the water itself.
He had set up one of those com
pact, battery - powered phono
graphs that go anywhere with
out a cord and was playing some
thing fairly classical, sung by a
magnificent choir. Passing above
him, I could read on the album
jacket that it was "Finlandia."
"It's 'Finlandia'," he said up to
me. Except for the gnats, hang
ing in their same loose swarms
for hours, he'd had the lake to
himself until I came. We talked
about his record player, then I
went on along the trail.
