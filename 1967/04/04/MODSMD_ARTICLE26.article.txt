## UGLY Pavilion: Standing Room Only 
### Maggie McComas 
High University officials an
nounced yesterday plans to con
vert the undergraduate library
into a badly-needed pavilion and
recreation center. The announce
ment came coupled with an ex
planation of the infamous finals
week "riots" in the UGLY.
t In an exclusive interview, Pro
vost Richard Lemon and his
helper Herbert Picker explained
the decision and outlined plans
for the conversion, intended to
take place as soon as possible.
, Q: Isn't this sudden decision

a rather abrupt departure from
usual University procedures?
Picker: Well, yes and no.
Lemon: What he is trying to
say is that the decision actually
isn't sudden and the whole thing
is rather embarrassing.
Q: In what way?
Switched Blueprints
Lemon: Well, the undergradu
ate library was actually sup
posed to be a pavilion and sports
area in the first place. That is,
the architect commissioned to
design the two structures got a

little mixed up and finished the
pavilion plans first. We and the
contractor thought they were
for the library, and by the time
we found out it was too late. . .
Q: You mean all those books
and chairs were moved into
what's supposed to be a sports
arena ?
Lemon: The dedication of the
structure as a library was actu
ally part of an experiment to
determine the possibilities for
its function. We decided to initi
ate Phase One and go ahead to

see if the building could be used
as a library. But from the be
ginning we were considering the
possibility of its being used for
sports events.
Riotous Experiment
Q: What about the so-called
"riots" at the UGLY during
finals week? There are rumors
that they were instigated by
non-students. . .
Picker: Yes and no. The in
spiration for this series of
events came from an intensive
study of the varied possibilities
of the functionality of the struc
ture.
Lemon: What he means is
that certain student leaders
were contacted by administrat
ive officials to participate in
Phase Two of the experiment
which involved introducing
"moderated" sports activity in
to the then-library.
Q: You mean the paper plane
and super ball-throwing con
tests weren't spontaneous?
Picker: Yes and no. To get
the thing underway, we con
tacted the Axe Comm people.
Several of that group were help
ful in promoting the venture.
In addition the yell leaders of
fered to help lead Phase Two.
Lemon: Actually we were
quite pleased with the students'
response and enthusiasm. Their
support and participation sur
passed our wildest dreams.
Spectator Sports
Q: Will there be other, more
organized, sports activities plan
ned for the new pavilion?
Lemon: Of course, there'll be
basketball, perhaps ice hockey.
Q: Won't the physical conver
sion be a little difficult? I mean,
it almost looks more like a li
brary than a pavilion . . .
Lemon: Not actually. The

three-tiered structure will give
ample standing and viewing, as
well demonstrated by the suc
cess of Phase Two. And the
"reference" alcoves will serve
as recreation centers for such
activities as pool and ping-pong.
The loan desk was originally
conceived as a refreshment
stand and will serve as such.
Q: .What about all those
books?
TMXJ Libe?
Lemon: That actually in
volves another project. We have
found that with increased ac
tivity at the UGLY, Tresidder
Union has now largely fallen
into disuse. We figure with a
few shelves here and there in
the cafeteria and bowling alley
Q: Don't you think that stu
dents should have a say in how
the library-pavilion structure is
to be used?
Picker: Of course they should.
Now that the decision has been
made, a faculty-student commit
tee will be set up to give advice
and consent as to how the con
version should take place. I
shall appoint a committee to
select this committee.

Q: .What about all those
books?
TMXJ Libe?
Lemon: That actually in
volves another project. We have
found that with increased ac
tivity at the UGLY, Tresidder
Union has now largely fallen
into disuse. We figure with a
few shelves here and there in
the cafeteria and bowling alley
Q: Don't you think that stu
dents should have a say in how
the library-pavilion structure is
to be used?
Picker: Of course they should.
Now that the decision has been
made, a faculty-student commit
tee will be set up to give advice
and consent as to how the con
version should take place. I
shall appoint a committee to
select this committee.
High University officials an
nounced yesterday plans to con
vert the undergraduate library
into a badly-needed pavilion and
recreation center. The announce
ment came coupled with an ex
planation of the infamous finals
week "riots" in the UGLY.
t In an exclusive interview, Pro
vost Richard Lemon and his
helper Herbert Picker explained
the decision and outlined plans
for the conversion, intended to
take place as soon as possible.
, Q: Isn't this sudden decision

a rather abrupt departure from
usual University procedures?
Picker: Well, yes and no.
Lemon: What he is trying to
say is that the decision actually
isn't sudden and the whole thing
is rather embarrassing.
Q: In what way?
Switched Blueprints
Lemon: Well, the undergradu
ate library was actually sup
posed to be a pavilion and sports
area in the first place. That is,
the architect commissioned to
design the two structures got a

little mixed up and finished the
pavilion plans first. We and the
contractor thought they were
for the library, and by the time
we found out it was too late. . .
Q: You mean all those books
and chairs were moved into
what's supposed to be a sports
arena ?
Lemon: The dedication of the
structure as a library was actu
ally part of an experiment to
determine the possibilities for
its function. We decided to initi
ate Phase One and go ahead to

see if the building could be used
as a library. But from the be
ginning we were considering the
possibility of its being used for
sports events.
Riotous Experiment
Q: What about the so-called
"riots" at the UGLY during
finals week? There are rumors
that they were instigated by
non-students. . .
Picker: Yes and no. The in
spiration for this series of
events came from an intensive
study of the varied possibilities
of the functionality of the struc
ture.
Lemon: What he means is
that certain student leaders
were contacted by administrat
ive officials to participate in
Phase Two of the experiment
which involved introducing
"moderated" sports activity in
to the then-library.
Q: You mean the paper plane
and super ball-throwing con
tests weren't spontaneous?
Picker: Yes and no. To get
the thing underway, we con
tacted the Axe Comm people.
Several of that group were help
ful in promoting the venture.
In addition the yell leaders of
fered to help lead Phase Two.
Lemon: Actually we were
quite pleased with the students'
response and enthusiasm. Their
support and participation sur
passed our wildest dreams.
Spectator Sports
Q: Will there be other, more
organized, sports activities plan

Lemon: Of course, there'll be
basketball, perhaps ice hockey.
Q: Won't the physical conver
sion be a little difficult? I mean,
it almost looks more like a li
brary than a pavilion . . .
Lemon: Not actually. The

three-tiered structure will give
ample standing and viewing, as
well demonstrated by the suc
cess of Phase Two. And the
"reference" alcoves will serve
as recreation centers for such
activities as pool and ping-pong.

conceived as a refreshment
