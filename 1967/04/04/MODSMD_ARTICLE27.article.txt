# Letters To The Editor
## An FBI Finger In The Files? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
During the Spring break I
received, from the Justice De
partment, the FBl's confidential
report on my claim for con
scientious objector status. The
report, with a copy sent to the
applicant, is standard procedure.
This report provides evidence
that the FBI has free access to
confidential student files at the
University, files which students
themselves are not permitted to
see, I am told.
A check with the Dean's office
at the medical school led to the
confirmation that this type of
action was clearly against Med
school policy and that no excep
tion had been made in my case,
which I believe.
This type of behavior, appar
ently by decision of the central
Administration, will come as no
surprise to most members of
the Stanford community. Ac
tivists on campus have had less

direct evidence that the Univer
sity has given names of students
to government investigating
agencies without subpoena.
Even with subpoena, the case is
arguable.
I submit this evidence in the
hope that Joel Smith's denial (of
last year) that the University is
complicitous in in these matters
will be laid to rest. Clearly the
truth is somewhat askew.
If the Administration has ex
planations for how these things
did or did not, will or will not
happen, I am sure that the com
munity will listen quite objec
tively. I am pleased to be able
to use the FBI as the source of
my written evidence.

Plaudits to Vice President

Packer and his Committee for
The Study of Education at Stan
ford. They really seem sincere.
If their meetings are less pon
derous than their titles, they
should have things ship-shape
before Dr. Sterling retires.
This is a wonderful chance for
those who've bitched for such
an insufferably long time; bet
ter than they'll get "out there"
in the "real world." After all,
kids, it'll be a helluvalot of pay
days before General Motors
asks you for your two cents
worth, or World Wide Widget
lets you exercise your so-called
rights.
As for myself, I pass. Where
should be enthusiasm, I find
only cynicism.

arguable.
I submit this evidence in the
hope that Joel Smith's denial (of
last year) that the University is
complicitous in in these matters
will be laid to rest. Clearly the
truth is somewhat askew.
If the Administration has ex
planations for how these things
did or did not, will or will not
happen, I am sure that the com
munity will listen quite objec
tively. I am pleased to be able
to use the FBI as the source of
my written evidence.

Plaudits to Vice President

Packer and his Committee for
The Study of Education at Stan
ford. They really seem sincere.
If their meetings are less pon
derous than their titles, they
should have things ship-shape
before Dr. Sterling retires.
This is a wonderful chance for
those who've bitched for such
an insufferably long time; bet
ter than they'll get "out there"
in the "real world." After all,
kids, it'll be a helluvalot of pay
days before General Motors
asks you for your two cents
worth, or World Wide Widget
lets you exercise your so-called
rights.
As for myself, I pass. Where
should be enthusiasm, I find
only cynicism.

Editor, The Dally:
During the Spring break I
received, from the Justice De
partment, the FBl's confidential
report on my claim for con
scientious objector status. The
report, with a copy sent to the
applicant, is standard procedure.
This report provides evidence
that the FBI has free access to
confidential student files at the
University, files which students
themselves are not permitted to
see, I am told.
A check with the Dean's office
at the medical school led to the
confirmation that this type of
action was clearly against Med
school policy and that no excep
tion had been made in my case,
which I believe.
This type of behavior, appar
ently by decision of the central
Administration, will come as no
surprise to most members of
the Stanford community. Ac
tivists on campus have had less

direct evidence that the Univer
sity has given names of students
to government investigating
agencies without subpoena.
Even with subpoena, the case is
arguable.
I submit this evidence in the
hope that Joel Smith's denial (of
last year) that the University is
complicitous in in these matters
will be laid to rest. Clearly the
truth is somewhat askew.
If the Administration has ex
planations for how these things
did or did not, will or will not
