## 
### WYNNE FURTH 
A noon rally to "indict Stanford Uni
versity and its Board of Trustees for
Complicity in War Crimes" will be the
principal event of Stanford's partici
pation in the Spring Mobilization to
End the War in Vietnam, a nation-wide
peace movement focusing around ral
lies in New York and San Francisco
on April 15th. The noon rally is sched
uled here for Thursday, April 13.
The Spring Mobilization Committee
expects about 100,000 participants at
the Saturday rally in San Francisco's
Kezar Stadium. Speakers will include
Mrs. Martin Luther King, Jr., Georgia
legislator Julian Bond, Robert
Vaughan of television's "Man from
U.N.C.L.E.," Rabbi Abraham Fein
berg, and Morris Evanson of the Paint
ers Union. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
will speak at the rally in New York,
which will be held near the United
Nations Headquarters.
The rally in San Francisco will be
preceded by a march from the water
front, with contingents representing
labor unions, religious groups, stu
dents, Afro-Americans, businessmen,
women and other groups. In addition,
the Spring Mobilization will give a
number of benefit concerts and exhib
its earlier in the week.
Offices have been set up in a number
of western cities by the committee,
whose West Coast chairman is Ram
parts editor Edward Keating, in an
effort to bring as many people as pos
sible to San Francisco for the rally.
Students Join In
Student participation is coordinated
by ihe Student Mobilization Commit
tee, set up in Chicago last December by
students and faculty from a number
of universities. Over two hundred stu
dents are expected from Reed College,
as well as large groups from other
Oregon schools. The University of
Colorado has chartered a train for the
occasion, while groups in southern
California have organized a motorcade
to spread information about the war
to Orange County, in addition to mak
ing arrangements for transportation
and housing for those wishing to come
to San Francisco.
In addition to the indictment of the
University, groups at Stanford plan a
march Thursday to Stanford Research
Institute, "one of the nation's major
developers of chemical and biological
warfare." The march will begin at The
Experiment at 3:30 p.m.
Earlier in the week, there will be
a silent vigil at the Stanford Shopping

Center at noon Monday, a march to the
Palo Alto City Hall also on Monday,
and a showing of two anti-war films
in Cubberley Auditorium on Wednes
day.
On the fifteenth, busses will trans
port demonstrators from Palo Alto
High School to San Francisco and
back.
Condemned By HUAC
Nationally, the Mobilization's princi
pal publicity has resulted from a 55-
page report issued by the House Un-
American Activities Committee on al
leged communist inspiration and di
rection for the movement. HUAC
states that a "deliberate effort has
been made ... to conceal the major
role Communists have played and are
playing in organizing and promoting"
the Spring Mobilization, which "may
succeed in their basic objective of
staging the largest and most extensive
demonstrations against the war in
Vietnam."
Spring Mobilizations leaders have
discounted the charges, stating that
the Spring Mobilization Committee is

"composed of individuals from many
organizations who represent a wide
variety of views. There is no exclu
sion on political, racial, or religious
grounds. We invite . . . groups and
individuals all over the country to
support and actively take part in the
National Spring Mobilization ... or
ganizations retain the freedom to de
termine the extent and manner of
their activity."
Among the organizations endorsing
Spring Mobilization are the Young
Democrats, the National Student As
sociation, the Congress of Racial
Equality, the Student Non-violent Co
ordinating Committee, the W.E.B.
Dußois Club and the YWCA.
The Spring Mobilization Commit
tee goes on to state that its basic ob
jective is "the enlistment of the men,
money and resources now being used
to maintain the military machine in
a fight against the real enemies of
man — hunger, hopelessness, ignor
ance, hate, fear, discrimination and
inequality."
