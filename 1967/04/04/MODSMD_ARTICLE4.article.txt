# Psychedelic Flip
## The 						New Grocery Trip 
### PAT McMAHON 
From one-a-day vitamins to nutmeg,
your local grocer now offers the eas
iest journey to "Psychedelia."
"There is a new emphasis on ex
perimentation these days," reports a
sophomore. "It was once a big thing
just to smoke pot or take acid, but
now when nearly half the student body
has tried one or the other, there is a
need for something new."
It seems that kicks just keep getting
easier to find, and in strange ways. "I
smoked every brand of tea available,
and nothing happened," sighed one
frustrated coed, but other results are
more spectacular.
After a complex process of boiling,
straining, filtering, and separating
ordinary paraffin wax, a history grad
student claims he can gather a small
quantity of opium, and many a mi
grant worker gets "drunk" on the
semi-solid fuel Sterno.
The traditional Indian and South
American psychedelicacies that have

come into use here include beetle nuts,
the Magic Mushroom, peyote, and even
marijuana.
But what are the high-lights of the
grocery shelves? Seven-Up and aspir
in, perhaps, and there's always nut
meg, saffron, or bananas for a
change. Other enticements include
morning-glory seeds (boiled), vita
mins, and the gas from whipped cream
cans (do not shake, let contents settle
at bottom, and inhale fumes).
And what Mother would imagine
that the miracle medicine paregoric
that soothes baby's teething pains is
camphorated tincture of opium?
"Our parents get high drinking, and
maybe at one time, smoking tobacco
was the most potent mind-expander
around. And I'm sure that frat man
has a real psychedelic experience dur
ing his drunken orgy. You can get
high on just about anything if you
have the right attitude," elaimes an
experimenter.

Drugs such as psylosiban, mesco
line, and LSD still rank high among
the old standards. Others are heroin,
methadrine, and hashish.
But the dangers also present them
selves. Laughing gas, N2O, which is
the gas that propels the whipping
cream, and various deodorants can be
fatal if misused. Nutmeg, which is im
bibed as a "tea," is fatal after four
spoonsful. Vitamins, pep pills, and
aspirin are dangerous in excess, and
the various other ways to get high
affect people differently. For instance,
the recently popularized banana smok
ing is considered "a mild, pleasant ex
perience" by some, while the Otero
men reported in a Letter to the Editor
in the Chronicle that they tried smok
ing the banana, but suggested "eating
it raw."
The friendly corner grocer has taken
on many roles, but his latest is his
most dramatic—your neighborhood
psychedelic travel agent.

"Our parents get high drinking, and
maybe at one time, smoking tobacco
was the most potent mind-expander
around. And I'm sure that frat man
has a real psychedelic experience dur
ing his drunken orgy. You can get
high on just about anything if you
have the right attitude," elaimes an
experimenter.

Drugs such as psylosiban, mesco
line, and LSD still rank high among
the old standards. Others are heroin,
methadrine, and hashish.
But the dangers also present them
selves. Laughing gas, N2O, which is
the gas that propels the whipping
cream, and various deodorants can be
fatal if misused. Nutmeg, which is im
bibed as a "tea," is fatal after four
spoonsful. Vitamins, pep pills, and
aspirin are dangerous in excess, and
the various other ways to get high
affect people differently. For instance,
the recently popularized banana smok
ing is considered "a mild, pleasant ex
perience" by some, while the Otero
men reported in a Letter to the Editor
in the Chronicle that they tried smok
ing the banana, but suggested "eating
it raw."

"There is a new emphasis on ex
perimentation these days," reports a
sophomore. "It was once a big thing
just to smoke pot or take acid, but
now when nearly half the student body
has tried one or the other, there is a
need for something new."
It seems that kicks just keep getting
easier to find, and in strange ways. "I
smoked every brand of tea available,
and nothing happened," sighed one
frustrated coed, but other results are
more spectacular.
After a complex process of boiling,
straining, filtering, and separating
ordinary paraffin wax, a history grad
student claims he can gather a small
quantity of opium, and many a mi
grant worker gets "drunk" on the
semi-solid fuel Sterno.
The traditional Indian and South
American psychedelicacies that have

come into use here include beetle nuts,
the Magic Mushroom, peyote, and even
marijuana.
But what are the high-lights of the
grocery shelves? Seven-Up and aspir
