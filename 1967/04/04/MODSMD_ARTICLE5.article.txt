# Sterling Nine-Year Board Member Of CIA-Supported Asia Foundation
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
President Wallace Sterling has been
a trustee of a CIA-linked organization,
the Asia Foundation, since 1958.
The San Francisco-based foundation
announced two weeks ago that it has
received Central Intelligence Agency
funds. It refused to disclose how much
or for how long.
Sterling also refused to comment on
how extensive the CIA involvement
is or how long he has known of it.
The March 22 announcement by the
trustees ended more than a month of
speculation that the foundation was
CIA-supported, beginning when the
National Student Association revealed

that the Asia Foundation was one of
those supporting it.
Several faculty members contacted
recently indicated that Sterling's in
volvement in the Asia Foundation
could harm the efforts of Stanford
scholars to study in Asia.
Some indicated that since the first
news of CIA support to NSA and other
educational organizations earlier this
year Stanford faculty members and
graduate students abroad have had
grants terminated and havp been re
fused previously-confirmed interviews
with government officials. Others said
they knew of no such instances.
The trustees' announcement began
with a statement of the foundation's
goals and the type of support it has
had from individuals, corporations,
and other foundations.
"Knowingly Received"
It had also, the statement continued,
"knowingly received contributions
from private foundations and trusts
which have been recently named as
having transmitted Central Intelli
gence Agency funds to private Ameri
can organizations."
"All contributions to the foundation,

from whatever source," it went on,
"were accepted on the condition that
the expenditure of such funds was to
be left to the discretion of the trustees
without declared purposes.'
The statement indicated that the
private, non-profit foundation would
continue to request funds from all of
the sources from which it had previ
ously received them, although Presi
dent Johnson has since indicated that
CIA support will no longer be avail
able to private groups.
No Annual Report
The private, non-profit foundation
spends nearly $5 million annually in
non-Communist Asian countries. Un
like most foundations with such large
budgets it does not report its expendi
tures or income and publishes no an
nual report.
There has always been periodic
comment in Asia that the foundation
is acting as an agent of the CIA. A
foundation representative discounted
this as "rumor," saying "part of it is
(from) Peking and part of it is Mos
cow."
The Asia Foundation is the suc
cessor of The Committee for a Free

Asia, an organization to fight com
munism set up in 1951 by a group of
prominent San Franciscans.
Among its projects was Radio Free
Asia, which, like its counterpart in
Europe, was often suspected by
Asians to be a front for the CIA.
The station went off the air in 1953.
The Committee for a Free Asia be
came the Asia Foundation a year
later.
Among its present goals the founda
tion lists:
• To support Asian individuals and
organizations striving to strengthen
their own societies.
• To facilitate regional and inter
regional cooperation among Asian,
American and international private
and public organizations concerned
with progress in Asia.
• To promote in the United States
a better understanding of the peo
ples, cultures, values and histories
of Asian countries.
Other trustees of the foundation
include Grayson Kirk, president of
Columbia University, and Ellsworth
Bunker, recently-appointed Ambassa
dor to South Vietnam.
