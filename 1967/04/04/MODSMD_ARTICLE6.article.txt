# Chief Judge Quinn To Discuss U.S. Court Of Military Appeals
## 
### 
On Wednesday, April 5, the Stan
ford Law Forum will present an
address by Chief Judge Robert E.
Quinn of the United States Court
of Military Appeals. Judge Quinn's
talk will center on the topic of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice
and the work of the U.S- Court of
Military Appeals as the highest ap
pellate court in cases related to the
Code.
The Court of Military Appeals was
largely the result of a public outcry

over reported miscarriages of justice
in trials of servicemen before military
tribunals before and during World
War 11.
In May of 1950, Congress enacted
the Uniform Code in an effort to give
to those accused of crime the rights
enjoyed by accused persons in the
civilian community while still main
taining discipline. Section 867 of the
Code established the Court of Military
Appeals, to sit in Washington D.C.,
as the head of this judicial system.
Judge Quinn is today the only mem
ber of the three-man court who was
one of President Truman's original ap
pointees in 1951. In commenting on the
Court's 16 years of operation, he ad

mits that there is still room for im
provement in the system but main
tains that the accused in a military
court-martial today receives a fairer
trial than ever before.
Quinn's appointment as Chief Judge
was the most recent step in a distin
guished career of public service.
Among other positions, he has served
in England and France as a member of
the United States Diplomatic Intelli
gence Service, in the Rhode Island
Senate, as Lieutenant Governor and
Governor of Rhode Island, and on the
Rhode Island Superior Court.
The presentation, open to the Uni
versity community at large, will begin
at 4 p.m. in Room 161J of the Law
School.
