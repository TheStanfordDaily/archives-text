## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, sus
pended from camDUS for the year,
held rush last night. When the sus
pension was approved by President
Wallace Sterling on Nov. 1, the Phi
Delts were not to be allowed to hold
rush, but investigation last night re
vealed that the Interfraternlty Board
(IFB) has since changed the terms to
allow rush.
Drennen Jones, chairman of IFB,
said that the board had been ap
proached In February by Phi Delt
actives, alumni, and national officers,
inquiring about the reasons for the
suspension.
Late in the quarter the IFB was
formally petitioned by the fraternity
to allow rush, and by mail and phone
vote approved the request. Jones said
that the provision forbidding rush
"had nothing to do with the suspen
sion itself" and therefore did not have
to be approved by President Sterling
as did the suspension.
No public notice of the change was
made until posters announcing last
night's open house appeared in Wil
bur yesterday. Dean Joel Smith and
Associate Dean Bob Gordon were un
available for comment last night.
