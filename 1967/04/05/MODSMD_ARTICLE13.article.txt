## Firkusny: Refined Strength 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The Czech pianist Rudolf Fir
kusny is more of a virtuoso than
Hubert Humphrey. But in the
Memorial Auditorium on Mon
day night he played to an un
comprehending audience of Stan
ford and Palo Alto concertgoers
who were rude enough to find

seats during movements and
walk out during his encores.
Firkusny is one of those daz
zling soloists who warm up right
through a program and finish
with an impetuous outburst of
bravura. Thus his two encores,
the first restrained, the second
an unequivocally appassionato

.nocturne, were the highlight of
the evening.
The program which he chose
was not an obvious one. He might
have been expected to include
Liszt, or certainly Beethoven. He
settled in fact, perhaps aware
of the temptations of his own
virtuosity, for a subtle and
muted one.
In the opening Schubert, the
posthumous B flat Sonata, Fir
kusny had a light touch and
rather impersonal interpreta
tion. Though he made the sonata
sing with a melodious softness,
there was very little humor in
the Scherzo and even the final
Allegro was delicate and gentle.
In the three Brahms Inter
mezzos which followed, Firkus
ny was still concise and re
strained. Into the E flat Rhap
sody, the best known part of this
Opus 119, he injected plenty of
the accustomed vigor and gave it
a precision which might even
have converted Bernard Shaw to
his most hated "Romantic"
Brahms.
In the powerful and passionate
B minor Sonata by Chopin, Fir
kusny was in fact already warm
ing to his best. He was fluent
and decisive, creating an impres
sion of theatrical histrionics by
jerked kicks to the pedals (both,
this time), and by a hunched up
position over the keyboard
perched on the edge of the stool.
This position allowed him literal

ly to "hammer" better in the
Scherzo and in the Finale of the
Sonata, and his fingers weaved
with incredible speed as he got
closer to the final chords. Here
he relished the staccato crunch
with undistinguished pleasure.
Having carried off the Chopin
sonata in great style, the soloist
returned to the rapidly empty
ing auditorium with two gratu
itous and brilliant encores. Crisp
and restrained in the first, he re
affirmed his romantic force in
the second, a nocturne with two
strongly opposed extremes,
which he nicely exaggerated
even further. Firkusny has a
heavy schedule in his concert
tour, but is to be thanked for an
educational stop at Stanford, a
university which, it is to be
hoped, will stay to the bitter end
on his next visit.

on his next visit.
The Czech pianist Rudolf Fir
kusny is more of a virtuoso than
Hubert Humphrey. But in the
Memorial Auditorium on Mon
day night he played to an un
comprehending audience of Stan
ford and Palo Alto concertgoers
who were rude enough to find

seats during movements and
walk out during his encores.
Firkusny is one of those daz
zling soloists who warm up right
through a program and finish
with an impetuous outburst of
bravura. Thus his two encores,
the first restrained, the second
an unequivocally appassionato

.nocturne, were the highlight of
the evening.
The program which he chose
was not an obvious one. He might
have been expected to include
Liszt, or certainly Beethoven. He
settled in fact, perhaps aware
of the temptations of his own
virtuosity, for a subtle and
muted one.
In the opening Schubert, the
posthumous B flat Sonata, Fir
kusny had a light touch and
rather impersonal interpreta
tion. Though he made the sonata
sing with a melodious softness,
there was very little humor in
the Scherzo and even the final
Allegro was delicate and gentle.
In the three Brahms Inter
mezzos which followed, Firkus
ny was still concise and re
strained. Into the E flat Rhap
sody, the best known part of this
Opus 119, he injected plenty of
the accustomed vigor and gave it
a precision which might even
have converted Bernard Shaw to
his most hated "Romantic"
Brahms.
In the powerful and passionate
B minor Sonata by Chopin, Fir
kusny was in fact already warm
ing to his best. He was fluent
and decisive, creating an impres
sion of theatrical histrionics by
jerked kicks to the pedals (both,
this time), and by a hunched up
position over the keyboard
perched on the edge of the stool.
This position allowed him literal

ly to "hammer" better in the
Scherzo and in the Finale of the
Sonata, and his fingers weaved
with incredible speed as he got
closer to the final chords. Here
he relished the staccato crunch
with undistinguished pleasure.
Having carried off the Chopin
sonata in great style, the soloist
returned to the rapidly empty
ing auditorium with two gratu
itous and brilliant encores. Crisp
and restrained in the first, he re
affirmed his romantic force in
the second, a nocturne with two
strongly opposed extremes,
which he nicely exaggerated
even further. Firkusny has a
heavy schedule in his concert
tour, but is to be thanked for an
educational stop at Stanford, a
university which, it is to be
hoped, will stay to the bitter end
on his next visit.
