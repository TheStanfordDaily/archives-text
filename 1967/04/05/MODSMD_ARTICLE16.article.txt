# The 						Military Still Running Vietnam
## 
### HOWARD MOFFETT The Collegiate Press Service 
SAlGON—American officials,
the press, and Vietnamese poli
ticians are setting the stage for
a dramatic transfer of power
from military junta to elected
civilian government. South Viet
Nam's new Constitution will be
ready by the end of March. In
April local elections will be held
in an estimated 39 per cent of
the country's hamlets. By Sep
tember the nation may have a
duly elected president.
The Constituent Assembly in
downtown Saigon buzzes with
energetic speeches. Hopeful poli
ticians say the new Constitution
could be the first step toward
true democracy — if the mili
tary will guarantee honest elec
tions. American officials talk of
a "new political atmosphere,"
and point to the temporary blocs
in (he Assembly as the seeds of
future political parties. The
American press is already focus
ing on possible candidates for
rhe presidency.
But make no mistake, the
military still runs South Viet
nam. Beneath the surface of
civilian politiking there are clear
signs that the generals intend
to play a dominant role for some
time to come.
Lt. Van Thieu
No one is better qualified to
speak for South Vietnam's mili
tary establishment than Lt. Gen.
Nguyen Van Thieu. At 42 the
French-trained Thieu is Chief
of State, Commander in Chief of
•*he Armed Forces, and Chair

man of the 10-man National
Leadership Committee (or jun
ta) by whose grace Air Vice
Marshal Ky governs- Thieu is a
small man, with a bright young
face devoid of wrinkles. Yet his
voice is heavy and authoritative,
and he puffs occasionally on an
impressive English pipe with a
leather-covered bowl. His finest
hour in combat came when, as a
colonel, he commanded the
troops that assaulted Diem's pal
ace in the 1963 Revolution.
General Thieu spent almost
an hour this afternoon talking
off the cuff in his well-appointed
office at General Staff Headquar
ters. What emerged was a pretty
clear picture of how the generals
size up the current excitement
about civilian rule. In brief, they
aren't nearly as excited about it
as the civilians.
Crisis
Underlying everything he said
was one idea: South Vietnam is
in a crisis situation, of which the
war is only one part; of all the
major problems facing the coun
try, there is not one that civi
lians are equipped to handle as
well as the military. Listen to
his reasoning as it came out in
the course of the interview. You
may not like everything he said,
but you'll have a much better
idea of what is likely to happen
in South Vietnam in the near
future, and what isn't.
He began by saying that the
Constitution should be promul
gated and an elected govern
ment be established as soon as
possible. He thought the first

would take a month and a half,
and hoped for the second within
four to five months after that.
Questions and answers follow,
with commentary in paren
theses.
Q. General Thleu, are you sat
isfied with the present draft of
the Constitution, or do you feel
the legislative and judicial bran
ches have been given too much
power? Will South Vietnam need
a stronger executive?
A. Well, you know, some
members of the Constituent As
sembly want to run too fast
toward democracy. I think in
general the Constitution is tak
ing shape well, but some parts
of the draft are not realistic
toward the real situation of the
country. But we are continually
talking with the Assembly mem
bers, and I think there will be
time to explain to them and have
these parts changed.
(Score one for the military:
supervising the drafting of a
civil Constitution. Talks between
the junta and the Assembly have
in fact been going on for some
time. They began when it looked
like the two groups might clash
over controversial Article 20 of
Decree Law 21, which gives the
generals the prerogative of
amending the Assembly's Con
stitution unless overridden by a
two-thirds vote.
General Thieu's comment
underscores another question
which has puzzled observers
here for some time: Is the junta
bringing pressure on the As
sembly members to get object

ionable sections changed, or is
the compromising mutually ami
cable? The importance of the
question lies in the fact that the
Assembly's slowly rising public
stature derives largely from its
independent, almost defiant pos
ture toward the military govern
ment. If it comes out that collu
sion or pressure is involved, the
new Constitution may be poli
tically dead before the ink is
dry.)
Q. What parts of the draft are
you referring to, specifically?
A. Primarily the election of
province chiefs. This is demo
cratic and idealistic, but it is not
practical for the present time of
war, or for many years after the
war. The province chiefs will
have to be appointed by the ex
ecutive and coordinated through
the central government. We are
a small country, you know, and
we cannot afford independent
states with elected governors
like you have.... For some time
more we will need to maintain
army officers as province chiefs.
This is a difficult job, and it re
quires a man of action, a mili
tary man.
(Score two for the military:
province administration.)
I asked a series of questions
about the progress of the war.
General Thieu replied, "It is
very clear that for a year the
Viet Cong have had no momen
tum. They have no more hope of
winning large battles such as in
1964 and 1965. They won't seize
any provinces. They are still in

filtrating, of course, but we can
handle this problem."
(Score three for the generals:
defeating the virulent wily
Cong.)
Q. General Tliieu, there has
bei'n much talk of peace in re
cent weeks. Do you see any
chance for a negotiated settle
ment at the present time? Are
there iiiiy circumstances under
which the government of South
Vietnam might enter into peace
talks with Hanoi or the NLF?
A. We have to be frank and
just. We have been at war for
20 years. The reason we are
fighting, and the reason America
is fighting with us, is that we
do not want a Communist inva
sion. But we want peace, we
want South Vietnam to be quiet.
We would accept a just and hon
orable peace, if Hanoi would stop
its invasion. But there are no
signs yet that Hanoi wants
peace. They are still convinced
they can win — not so much mil
tarily now, but politically. So I
see no move toward peace yet.
Remember too, they may be un
der pressure from China to con
tinue the war, even if Hanoi
might want peace.
Q. But General Thieu, there
seem to be signs now that Ho
Chi Minh might settle for less
than a victory. It is well known
that Russian supplies for North
Vietnam have been stopped at
the Chinese border, and the re
cent chaos in China may mean
that China will no longer be able
to pressure Hanoi into continu
ing the war. A newspaper report
yesterday cited North Vietna
mese sources in Hong Kong as
saying that Ho Chi Minli 110
longer feels he can win the war
and is looking for a possible ne
gotiated peace, in which the Na
tional Liberation Front might
have the minor share of a coali
tion government. Would terms
like these be acceptable to South
Vietnam?
A. Up to now we do not recog
nize the possibility of the NLF
as a political entity in a coalition
government. When Hanoi is feel
ing weak, then it will withdraw
its forces, and then I believe
the NLF will collapse. They are
not strong enough to continue
fighting by themselves.
Q. Suppose a future civilian
government were to seek peace
negotiations? Would the mili
tary feel compelled to prevent
it?
A- We do not feel a coalition
government would be acceptable
to the Vietnamese people. All
people in South Vietnam — stu
dents, politicians, all of them —
are afraid of a coalition govern
ment bocause our political struc
ture is not yet strong enough
to counter the political forces of
the Viet Cong organization. We
are not well enough organized.
(It is true that South Viet
nam's non-Communist political
structure is frail — fragmented,
disorganized, faction-ridden and

propped up by a host of vested
interests. It is also true that
many Vietnamese nationalists
would sincerely like to streng
then it before a peace is signed,
in order to prevent a Viet Cong
political tour de force.
It is patently untrue, on the
other hand, that no South Viet
namese would accept a negoti
ated peace and a coalition gov
ernment. Even among those who
have no sympathy for the Viet
Cong, there is growing feeling
that the war must be stopped.
Some students, religious leaders
and politician - intellectuals have
said privately in recent weeks
that they are willing to take
their chances with peace and
politics, knowing full well that
the Viet Cong have the single
strongest political machine in
the country.
But the army is intransigent,
and the generals still hold the
cards. If the U.S. ever decides
it wants to negotiate in Viet
nam, it will have to persuade
the junta as well as Ho Chi Minh
and the NLF. So score four for
the military: arbitrating a "just
and honorable" peace.)
Q. General Thieu, how long
do you think it will take to or
ganize political parties that may
stand up to the Viet Cong?
A- That will be a very long
process — perhaps ten years.
You must remember that we
have never had an opportunity
to organize democratic parties
in Vietnam. (He cited conditions
under the French, Diem, etc.)
But we cannot have a true demo
cracy without strong political
parties. One of the jobs of the
future government should be to
help parties to organize and
strengthen themselves. The only
parties we have now are very
old and fragmented.
Q. Does this mean you think
the next government should sub
sidize political parties with pub
lic funds?
A. Possibly funds. Other kinds
of support, too. Eventually we
should have just three or four —
mayhe just two- -strong parties.
This is the only way to counter
the Communists. The only two
organized groups now are the
Communists and the army.
Q. Do you mean to imply that
the army might serve as a pos
sible base for one of the strong
political parties you envision?
A. I am against political par
ties in the army. On the other
hand, if any retired military men
wanted to organize a party us
ing other retired army men, that
might be good. Army discipline
would give them a strong organ
ization.
(Score five for the military:
providing a skeleton on which to
hang a flesh-and-blood political
party. Though the idea may be
repugnant to Americans, the al
ternatives for non-Communist
Vietnamese are just not that
hopeful at the present juncture.
Both American officials and Viet
namese generals are paying
close attention to Korea's experi
ment with soldiers-turned-politi

cians. What an army party
might do is force the fragment
ed groups of civilian nationalists
into forming one large party of
their own. Nothing: else has
brought them together.)
Q. What problems will loom
largest for the new government
when it takes over next fall, Gen
eral Thieu?
A. Their problems will be the
same as ours: defense and se
curity, pacification, refugees, the
Open Arms program . . . Many
of these will require military
management. Soldiers are more
qualified to handle them than
civilians would be. Civilians
would have no cadres, no trained
leaders, no resources for rural
reconstruction. In a crisis situa
tion, the nation must depend on
the military. For example, when
the situation turned bad under
Diem, he had to call on the army.
It is the same now.
(Score six for the; military:
pacification and nation-building.
All rural programs — pacifica
tion, rural reconstruction, se
curity, village and hamlet reor
ganization, social reform — have
been placed under the Minister
of Revolutionary Development,
Maj. Gen. Nguyen Due Thang.
Only last month the Ministry of
Youth and Sports was added to
the list, since pacification will
depend so heavily cn trained
youth cadres.
South Vietnamese and Ameri
can officials are both banking
heavily on Thang's dynamism
and administrative talent, for
the anti-guerilla effort in the
countryside will stand or fall
with Revolutionary Develop
ment. So far the highly centra
lized program remains a ques
tion mark, but it illustrates the
priority that is now being given
— perhaps too late — to the
peasant problem. With all their
eggs in this particular basket, it
is highly unlikely that the gen
erals will surrender it lightly to
civilian control.)
Q. General Thieu, how have
the generals of the Directory re
acted to carrying the responsi
bilities of the nation I'or almost
two years? Are they tired, would
they like to return 1» strictly
military duties, or do they en
joy serving in this capacity?
A. (with a laugh) Well, we
are not tired — I have been fight
ing all my life. It's been very in
teresting — the direct on of the
country in wartime — and we're
very encouraged with the re
sults.
(No comment. Scorc as many
as you like for the military.)
General Thieu is right. The
army can do many things that
civilians in Vietnam are neither
equipped nor prepared to do.
The one thing that the! generals
can not do is win the enthusi
astic support of the people. That
being the case, the view from
here is that this frustrating war,
supported by no one except those
who are fighting, is likely to
continue in its present vein until
either the Viet Cong or the AR
VN run out of foreign, support.
