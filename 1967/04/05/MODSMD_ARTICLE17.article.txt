# Clebsch In 'Stanford Today'
## Religion Needs Flexibility 
### 
"Christian ethics today," Wil
liam A. Clobsch, associate pro
fessor of religion writes in the
winter issue of Stanford Today,
"is as remote from current prob
lems as the horse and buggy is
from manned space vehicles."
He feels that Christian ethics is
having serious difficulty catch
ing up with today's fast-moving
society.
"The profound inventiveness
of traditional religious morality
in America is more a historical
fact that a present reality.
"American Christianity suffer
ed a loss of nerve to explore new
ways of identifying the will of
Sod with the weal of man," Cle
bsch declares in the quarterly
magazine.
New Morality
Perhaps, he suggests, the old
ethic will be replaced by the so
called "new morality — that any
act — possibly abortion, euthan
asia, war, civil disobedience, per
haps theft — is Christian if it
s the result of a decision Christ
lanly taken."
"Thus, simple return to the
old equation of 'good with ad
vantage' seems effectively block
ed in this predicament," he
.lotes.
"The once firm and fixed line
between life and nonlife has
oeen blurred if not erased by
the life sciences, throwing old
norms into confusion....
Intercourse
"Sexual intercourse, as some
body said, is at least free of in
fection, detection, or conception,
\nd much of it that goes on out
of wedlock is certainly not pro
miscuous.
"A mobile society makes di
vorce (leaving aside its effects
on children) in many cases a
/nore moral fulfillment of 'per
sonhood' than indissoluble mono
amy; marriages, like other hu
man compacts, die and new ones
morally supplant them.

"An economy geared to pro
duction and a politics geared to
popularity create pressures
which justify compromise in
personal integrity.
World Police
"Nations of undisguised mili
tary might appoint themselves
under slogans of non-interven
tion to police the world against
expanding ideologies, and in do
ing so, wage wars that destroy
the very societies they are de
signed to protect.
"What makes the so-called
'new morality' seem new and
profane," Clebsch writes, "is the
fact that for a long generation
in the public arena and for a
century in the private, our reli
gion has sanctioned old sets of
manners instead of carrying on
its grand tradition of innovating.
"Yesterday's pragmatic norms
... have hardened into the far
thest thing from their original
intent — perspective principles."
Prudence Over Principle
Throughout American reli
gious history, Clebsch points out,
there has always been "a perva
sive preference for prudence
over principle as the basis of
morals and manners."
For example, he cites the fron
tier revivalists who preached
hellfire and brimstone for the
sins of drinking, gambling and
dancing.
This had a sound practical ba
sis, he explains. On the fron
tier, "the hazards of fire and
animal depredation dictated the
alertness of sobriety. Money was
scarce and necessary for com
modities which tillage and hunt
ing would not yield — sugar, salt
and implements — so gambling
jeopardized existence.
Family
"The family was the basic pro
ducing unit of frontier economy,
and to threaten it by philander

ing or promiscuity ... was to
threaten socio-economic founda
tions.
"The evils which frontier
preachers fought... find modern
equivalents in drunk driving,
twisting children's lives by
whimsical divorce, and destroy
ing public education by political
opportunism," Clebsch declares.
"In social morality as well as
personal," he writes, "the great
tradition of American religion
has been to make the impossible
reaches of the human imagina
tion give birth to possible jus
tice in the institutions of men.
"That has always involved
throwing off fixed ideologies ...
and in their place developing
flexible norms pragmatically
adapted to changing conditions
for the sake of proximate ad
vantage — not pursuing abso
lute justice, but striving for at
tainable good"
