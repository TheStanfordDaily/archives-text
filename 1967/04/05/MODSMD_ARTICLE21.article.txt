## MD Describes Viet Health Hazards 
### 
STANFORD—South Vietnam
faces serious health problems
intensified by a shortage of phy
sicians and supplies, inadequate
hospital facilities and the trag
edy of war, according to a re
turning specialist in tropical di
seases.
Dr. Mark T. Hoekenga, a Med
ical School alumnus and scien
tific director of William S. Mer
rell Company in Cincinnati,
went to Can Tho under the
American Medical Association's
program "Volunteer Physicians
for Vietnam." His report ap
pears in the current issue of
STANFORD M.D., the quarter
ly magazine of the Medical
Alumni Association.
Dr. Hoekenga said that the
hospital at Can Tho where he
served as a civilian doctor has
450 beds, but often as many as
650 patients. And this hospital
is typical of other provincial
hospitals in South Vietnam.
"I found that two to three

patients to a bed was a common
occurrence," Dr. Hoekenga said.
"The wards were hot and crowd
ed, frequently ripe with odors
of sweat and urine. Open sew
ers sometimes added to the pun
gency.
"Except in the intensive care
and postoperative wards, pa
tients slept on sleeping mats
plaeed on top of board frames.
Family members stayed with
the patients to assist in feeding
and nursing them, sleeping on
or under the bed as space and
time permitted."
"Our days as physicians were
long," Dr. Hoekenga wrote.
"Speaking a little French, but
more oft<;n using Vietnamese in
terpreters, I saw 50 to 80 or
more outpatients and attended
an equal number of hospitalized
ones.
Usual Disease And More
"All of the usual temperate
climate diseases are prevalent in
Vietnam—tho respiratory, cardi

ovascular, gastrointestinal, and
genitourinary ailments that one
sees everywhere in the world.
But, in addition, tuberculosis, in
fectious hepatitis, and typhoid
fever are rampant. Cholera, ma
laria and parasites are fairly
common, and even bubonic
plague and leprosy and other
exotic diseases are encountered.
"Often during my tour of
duty, essential supplies were
short. The equipment was inade
quate. Always there was the hor
ror and sorrow of the war
around us, the evidence of vi
cious (Viet Cong) attacks on
civilians with small arms fire,
mortars and Claymore mines,
accounting for 40 percent of the
surgery done on civilians.
"Plague is a serious health
problem in Vietnam. A total of
4,453 cases with 253 deaths have
been reported by the Ministry
of Health in 1965 (the latest sta
tistics available). Because of the
high rat population and a lack

of flea control, many locations
in the highlands as well as in
Saigon will continue to be in
volved."
Poor Rato
Although the United States
and other free nations have
moved rapidly to fill the physi
cian shortage and have im
proved the medical care of South
Vietnamese, the ratio of physi
cians to population remains a
most unfavorable one, Dr. Hoe
kenga reported. Of the 1,100
Vietnamese physicians, some
700 are in the army, and ap
proximately 100 more are not
in practice because of political
activity. This leaves 300 physi
cians to treat 15,000,000 civilians
in the country.
Dr. Hoekenga related the
story of two Viet Cong prisoners
in his care. Both of them were
handcuffed to their beds, and a
guard was posted outside the
door. "What a paradox!" Dr.
Hoekenga wrote, "Yesterday our
side tried to kill them. Today,
as doctors, we try to save their
lives. It is particularly strange
to see how unimpressed the oth
er patients and their families
are. One might think that a pa
triotic nationalist would try to
knife them, or at least cut the
intravenous infusion tube. But

they all seem to have lived with
war so long that this, too, they
take in stride."
Signs of Hope
Now and then there is a sign
of human warmth and kindness
—of hope for the future. "Last
night," Dr. Hoekenga wrote,
"Father Campbell, the Catholic
Chaplain for the IV Corps re
gion, came back to chat awhile.
He started to talk about a proj
ect that obviously is dear to his
heart—the providing of shelter
and school for a large group of
orphans 10 to 15 years old who
shift for themselves under lean
tos or on shelves near the river.
He isn't having much success
with shelter and school, but
meanwhile is keeping them
clean and fed.
"My present feeling is based
on two premises," Dr. Hoekenga
wrote. "The first is that inter
national communism is an evil
thing that threatens our own
democratic system of govern
ment and must therefore be
fought. The second premise is
that overwhelming majority of
intelligent South Vietnamese do
want to help in resisting it. If
these premises are true, we
have no alternative but to get
on with the job with vigor and
dispatch."
