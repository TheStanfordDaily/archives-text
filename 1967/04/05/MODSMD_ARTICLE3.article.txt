# Committees Hammer Out Coed Residence Proposals
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
The Committee on Residential Po
licies of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) yesterday endorsed a
modified version of the ASSU Hous
ing Commission's proposal for a Wil
bur Experiment next year.
The SES Steering Committee,
whose approval is required before the
plan becomes an official SES recom
mendation, met later in the day and
discussed the proposal but took no
action.
Apparently desiring more informa
tion on the purposes of the experi
ment, it has asked the residence com
mittee to prepare an additional state
ment.
The statement will be circulated to
members of the steering, committee
sometime before that committee's
next meeting on April 17* and, if
passed, will become the official recom
mendation of the SES on residential
experimentation for next year. It

would probably then have to go to the
Board of Trustees, study participants
indicated.
The residence committee's proposal
calls for three coeducational and inte
grated houses in Wilbur with varying
degrees of academic structure, and
other revisions required to accommo
date freshmen who would have been
in Wilbur.
Additional Revisions
Roble Hall would be a coeducational
freshman residence, with twice as
many men as women. Two Stern
houses would be converted to all
freshman men. About 50 freshman
women would be integrated into Flor
ence Moore ina manner not yet deter
mined. And one house in Wilbur
would become a freshman women's
residence.
Members of the Committee on Resi
dential Policies at yesterday noon's
meeting were unanimous in their ap
proval of the plan, which was pre
sented by a subcommittee.
As presently defined, one of the
three coed experiment houses in Wil
bur would be left totally unstructured,
one would have an academic theme
but no required course work, and the

third would have both a theme and a
required core seminar.
One committee member said that
the proposed innovations would "point
toward humanizing residences."
Meal Policy
The atmosphere at meals in Wilbur
was discussed as a possible impedi
ment to the success of the experiment.
One committee member said he could
foresee the whole Wilbur Experiment
"collapsing in the cacophony of that
cafeteria"
It was suggested and informally
agreed that a solution to the problem
would be the institution of the sys
tem presently used at the Grove
House. Everyone is expected to clear
his own place and hashers come in
to wash dishes and clean the tables
much later, allowing mealtime conver
sations to continue beyond the limits
usually imposed in the residences.
The residence committee also added
two undergraduates as observers for
the rest of the year. The two, Sue
Horst and ASSU Housing Commission
co-chairman John Trimbur, will be
come members of the committee next
fall when three of the present stu
dent members will be gone.
