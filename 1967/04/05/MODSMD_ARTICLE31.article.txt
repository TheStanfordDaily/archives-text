# Myths Exposed
## 
### 
The fact that Wallace Sterling is a trustee of
a foundation that has willingly but clandestinely
accepted funds from the Central Intelligence
Agency should expose a few myths about the
role of the president of this University.
President Sterling has frequently said that he
cannot take stands on national or international
issues not directly related to education at Stan
ford because his statements would be seen not
as the opinions of Wallace Sterling but as the
official position of Stanford University. But by
the same token, Sterling's involvement with a
foundation which is supported by the CIA will
be taken as Stanford's involvement. It will be
seen as Stanford's endorsement of the ClA's sec
ret support of charitable groups which purport

to be privately supported and internally-con
trolled agencies of good will. And it will be
seen as Stanford's approval of the modus oper
andi employed by the Central Intelligence
Agency, an approval of underhanded interven
tion in the affairs of other nations which Ameri
cans like to associate only with Communist re
gimes.
The mere fact that neither the foundation nor
President Sterling is willing to even hint at the
extent of CIA involvement in the Asia Founda
tion is all the indication necessary to show that
this is not an activity any scholar, and much
less a University president keeping in mind the
interests of the institution he represents, should
be involved with.
