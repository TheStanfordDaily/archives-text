## Almond Compares Blasts Against CIA To McCarthyism 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to take this op
portunity to comment on your
lead article in the April 4 issue
of the Daily on President Ster
ling's association with the Asia
Foundation. I should identify
myself as one who has been
deeply concerned about the
problem of government support
for social science research and
in particular the problem of
CIA involvement in research ac
tivities in this country and
abroad.
I am deeply troubled by the
tone of this article. It reminds
me a bit of the mood of the
McCarthyite period when the
reputations of good and public
spirited men were vilified and
often destroyed because of as
sociations and affiliations which
at a later time became, often
carelessly, defined as subver
sive.
The resort by the Central In
telligence Agency to the use of
foundations as covert conduits
for the support of a wide variety
of activities in the United States
and abroad is a very complex
problem. In the first instance
it grew out of the reluctance
of the Congress to give support
to the activities of liberal and
internationalist groups for rep
resentational and other activi
ties in foreign countries.
I believe that this policy of
covert financing was morally
mistaken as well as imprudent
and that it became increasingly
so over the years. At the same
time I believe that it ought to
be clearly understood that this
mistake was made by a very
great many liberal, responsible,
and public-spirited men and that
the appropriate reaction to this
activity, instead of efforts at
moral pillorying, ought to be
"There but for the grace of God
go I."
Those of us old enough to re
member the mood of the early
1950's when this country was
held transfixed by McCarthyite
hysteria and the real threat and
problems growing out of the
Korean War might have associ

ated themselves with an activity
of this kind if they had been
called upon to do so. I cannot
honestly say that I would have
said "no" myself.
Another consideration which
I should like to draw to the at
tention of the Editor of the
Daily is the fact that the re
actions abroad to the exposure
of the CIA conduit operations
is quite complex and mixed.
It has not gone unnoticed that
the CIA has supported a great
many liberal causes, and further
that it was the free press in
America that brought the whole
matter to light, and finally that
the reaction of the government
to these exposures has been to
reject this method as far as
future operations are concerned.
We must not confuse a democ
racy with perfection. All it ever
promised was perfectability.

• Acidberry?
Editor, The Daily:
Before I reach the substance
of this letter, I would like to
state that this is no joke or hoax
such as has perhaps been mak
ing the rounds in Berkeley and
elsewhere. The point which I
would like to share with the rest
of the Stanford student body is
that I have only recently dis
covered the psychedelic effects
of strawberries, and wish to en
courage further experimenta
tion in this field, thus avoiding
the numerous legal problems
which other psychedelics in
volve.
Last night, after consuming
several dozen strawberries, I
found myself, to my great sur
prise and pleasure, "high". To
night after the same procedure,
the same effects were observ
able. In both cases, the exten
sion of consciousness lasted
about an hour. Since I have not
had the opportunity to investi
gate the possibilities of other
methods of using strawberries, I

shall perhaps write again when
I have fuller knowledge of the
remarkable effects of strawber
ries on the mind.
One further note. I had never
noticed any of the stated effects
before moving to California, so
it seems distinctly possible that
this year's strawberry crop has
been subjected to some foreign
psychedelic influence, such as
being sprayed with acid.
If you are inclined to dis
believe this letter or not to print
it for other reasons, I can be
reached by the union bulletin
board for further activities in
what may become the revival of
what I'm sure must have been
known and recognized in many
cultures and traditions, the
psychedelic effect of the com
mon strawberry.

• Who's Slothful?
Editor, the Daily:
Your piece on my Chicago
speech caught the spirit of the
thing all right but in quoting
you got me mixed up with our
own Tim Haight. The last quote
in your article is my quote from
his piece in The Daily. It is the
most eloquent passage in the
whole speech; but it is also the
most inaccurate. We professors
have a lot of faults, but we cer
tainly aren't "slothful."
