## Hoo Tow Cracking Up? 
### Marta Mahoney 
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling reported yesterday that sev
eral large cracks have appeared
in the east wall of Hoover
Tower. The cracks range in size
from six feet to forty-three feet,
and apparently go completely
through the wall.
Sterling stated that attempts
had been made to patch the
cracks, but nothing had worked
so far. "I'm really amazed that
the chemistry department hasn't
come up with anything yet," he
said. "They can win Nobel
Prizes, sure, but when you need
something necessary, they don't
even give you Lepage's glue."
Various professors and admin
istrators advanced theories as to
the origin of the cracks. "The
San Andreas fault is shifting,"
said a Geology professor, who
refused to give his name. "In
about three weeks it should be
under Mem Claw, and then we
should have a pretty rough time.
The constant splash of the water
will create vibration in the low
er igneous strata, and there will
probably be an earthquake."
A Physics professor pointed

out that Hoover Tower has un
dergone a series of recent stress
es. "It really isn't that sturdy
to begin with," he stated. "Then
you get all these kids climbing
around on it painting signs, and
practicing for the mountains in
Germany and Austria, plus the
engineers who use it for stress
analysis experiments, and it's
no wonder you have cracks.
You're lucky the whole thing
hasn't collapsed by now." He
also refused to give his name.
The Registrar's Office, con
tacted in response to a rumor
that surplus tuition payments
were being stored in a hidden
chamber on the east wall and
the weight of the currency was
now causing the wall to crack,
stated, "This is absolutely un
true. The secret chamber on the
east wall is used for storage of
President Hoover's personal
memoranda, the secret ones. We
use the chamber on the north
wall, where, you will notice,
there are no cracks or breaks
of any sort. There isn't enough
money around here to cause
anything to crack."

The Chemistry Department
admitted problems in patching
the wall. "Hoover used a very
unusual type of structural plan
in designing the Tower. We
have to be careful not to use
anything that would adhere to
the walls themselves, since this
would upset the balance and
cause the tower to fall over. All
we can hope to do is fill the
cracks up so that they don't
show," said a Chemistry T.A.
who is studying the situation.
"We have a further problem
in that most of the things that
would do this resist paint, which
means that there would be
these big marks on the east side
of the tower. This might not
bother most people, but the
alumni in New York and Los
Angeles have expressly stated
that the Tower should remain
as it is in coloring. They sort
of feel that the crack marks
would destroy their whole con
ception of good old Hoo Tow.
You can see their point," he
added.
At present the department is
still working on a crack-filling

substance, and President Stea
ling has offered the possibility
of engaging an outside research
er if attempts continue to fail.
This has produced strong an
tipathy among faculty and stu
dents. "What if he went ti
Cal?" said a boy in Tresidder.
"Think of it, Hoo Tow wit*
blue stripes!" A professor suid,
"If he takes it to Harvard and
they develop something, we'll
never live it down. All these
years we've been the Harvard
of the West. Now they're
to say we can't even make put
ty. The alumni will cut off av.
our money. Who wants to give
money to a school with a
cracked tower?"
President Sterling stated, "I'm
sure there is no cause for alarm
After all, nothing has been dor*
yet. We may find something
soon. However, I would rather
go to someone else for the an
swer than have Hoover Tower
—that beautiful piece of archi
tecture" — (and here Mr. Ster
ling wiped a tear from his eye'
—"stand before us cracked and
broken."
