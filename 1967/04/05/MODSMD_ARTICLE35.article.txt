# Vietnam And The Innocents At Home

SAIGON, South Vietnam
(CPS) — The Vietnam war has
hit our generation like a knife
cutting through butter.
It is complex and we want
fast, easy answers. It is years
old and we are young. It is many
little confusing concrete things,
and we like to speak in sweep
ing generalities. It will go on
for years—one way or another
—and we are already tired of
thinking about it.
The war landed on top of the
other problems our fathers
hadn't solved (we may be more
sensitive than any previous gen
eration to the faults of our fore
bearers). Our hero, John Ken
nedy, has been taken from us,
and an anti-hero, Lyndon John
son, left in his place. We never
did assimilate the fact that Ken
nedy did more to shape U.S.
policy in Vietnam in his three
years than Johnson has in the
years since.
The war came in the wake of
the greatest student activism
since the '30's—the civil rights
movement. It came as the Cold
War was being exposed as a
myth perpetuated by vulgar
politicians with a vested interest
in ignorance. The world was be
ing remade, and we had discov
ered it almost before anyone
else.
These things turned Vietnam
into the most explosive campus
issue in a generation. The ques
tion neatly divided informed, ac
tive students into two camps:
belligerent supporters and bit
ter opponents of U.S. policy.
Commitment And Anguish
Those of us who are emotion
ally committed to one side or the
other are probably more an
guished by this war than we
have been over any other pub
lic issue — because there seems
to be nothing we can do about
it. By choice or circumstance,
we are spectators, and poorly
informed ones at that. Because
we look at the war from far
away, and because we under
stand very little of the compli
cated reactions of the Vietna
mese themselves, our anguish is
closer to that of the teenager
seeking to justify his moral in
dignation that to the adult
forced to deal with suffering. To
many of us, it is more important
that our position be vindicated
than that the suffering should
stop.
Part of this innocence is the
heritage of the civil rights move
ment. Many of us stood up and
were counted on behalf of hu
man rights at Albany or Selma.
We marched and fought against

clear cut evil, and some of us
even went to jail to demonstrate
our convictions. We won some
significant victories, or helped
others to.
End of Innocence
You don't lose your innocence
by fighting evil. The end of in
nocence comes when you realize
that you are caught—if only by
association — in a struggle that
is not black and white; in which
there is morality on both sides
as well as power; and in which
decent people with names,
caught between the two sides,
must bear the brunt of the suf
fering while you are free to re
turn to your books and a cold
beer.
Those who are not spectators
in this war — Vietnamese sol
diers, Viet Cong guerillas, peas
ants, refugees, mothers and
children, young teachers, Amer
ican Gl's, and North Vietnamese
regulars—are tougher than we
are, like Secretary McNamara.
Twenty Years
Many on both sides have been
shot at for more than twenty
years; they may be forgiven for
living their lives with the same
resignation that an American
fraternity boy drinks beer on
Sunday afternoon. They nevor
knew innocence, that peculiar
combination of moral indigna
tion and non-participation.
One of the reasons that Amer
ican wars have always been so
glorious is that traditionally
they have come at thirty year
intervals and have lasted just
long enough to provide each
generation with a set of heroes.
Except for the Civil War, our
social fabric was never serious
ly threatened by them. In be
tween wars life went on. Devel
opments in the arts and scien
ces, agriculture, industry and
leisure rounded out a history
for which war provided primar
ily the color.
By contrast, Vietnamese his
tory is one long war. Vietnam
has never been free from the
threat of foreign invasion — by
the Chinese, the Mongols, the
Japanese, the Chams, the
Khmers, the Portuguese, the
French, the Americans. . . . But
even in those brief periods when
foreign enemies have not threat
ened, the Vietnamese have fall
en to fighting among them
selves.
As a result, Vietnamese his
tory is largely a record of what
has been destroyed or saved
rather than what has been built.
One of the country's biggest
problems today is that much of
its top young talent has never
had the opportunity to experi
ment with constructive pro

grams in any field.
From most on-scene accounts,
apathy and war-weariness have
been a problem to the Viet Cong
as much as to the ARVN. The
fact that both ARVN and Viet
Cong are still unwilling to stop
killing—and the fact that many
Vietnamese are not really sym
pathetic to either side (I realize
this contradicts several popular
stereotypes, but it is increasing

ly clear to anyone who has
spent some time in Vietnam and
talked with several classes c.
people) — should give us pause
who insist that this is a simple
war, black and white, and that
solving it calls mostly for moral
indignation.
