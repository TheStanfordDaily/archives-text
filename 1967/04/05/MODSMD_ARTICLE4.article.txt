# Theater Reenacts Congressional Debate
## 
### MARY JEANNE NEWTON 
The issue of a declaration of war
with Germany will be debated tonight
and tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel in a reenactment of the
deliberations in the House of Repre
sentatives fifty years ago today.
The program is being presented by
the Theater of the Congressional Rec
ord, sponsored by the Speech and
Drama Department. Fifty students,
faculty and staff members will partic
ipate in the reading of the debate on
the declaration of war with Germany
from the Congressional Record.
Dinkelspiel represents the House
Chamber, with the stage serving as
the speaker's platform. Members of
the House will sit in the first few
rows of seats along the center aisle,
Democrats on the left, and Republi
cans on the right.
John Kulsar, an instructor in
speech, directs the presentation and
plays the part of "Champ" Clark of
Missouri, Speaker of the House. Mark
Schweninger is the Chairman of the
House. The program is produced by
Helen W. Schrader, an assistant pro
fessor of speech and education.
Record is Good Drama
Kulsar said he first thought of the
idea about a year ago when he no
ticed several copies of the Congres
sional Record in a friend's library.
As they read some of it together it oc
curred to Kulsar that the Record was
excellent drama. Upon coming to
Stanford, he discussed the idea with
others and decided that a theater of
the Congressional Record would be
a good idea.
According to Kulsar, this is a "thea
ter of actuality with no illusion." The
Congressmen were "dealing with very
real issues," and as such, the Record
is "dramatic material in the highest
sense." Someone has suggested that
this was the true theater of the ab
surd. Kulsar feels that this is an ap
propriate title in light of the irony
he sees in the discussions.
Kulsar believes that the Theater of
the Congressional Record provides
more than entertainment — it is able
to provide an historical perspective for
issues being discussed now concern
ing the war in Vietnam. The situation
facing Congressmen in 1917 was simi
lar to what we face today — sending

American men to fight for someone
else — and they considered the ques
tion very carefully and seriously.
Reduced, But Not Changed
The original debate took 17 hours.
Kulsar has reduced this to a script of
three hours. The Record has been
cut, but nothing has been added or
changed.
In addition to the two presentations
this week, the Theater is planning a
reenactment of the 1917 debate on
conscription. This debate, taking place
about a month after war had been de
clared, lasted six days in the house,
and Kulsar is editing it to eight hours
to be given on Memorial Day from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Kulsar hopes that
other enactments will be done to shed
light on events happening now.
Adding color to the current presen
tation will be a demonstration by suf
fragettes and one concerning prohi
bition. These will take place outside
Dinkelspiel.
The programs will be duplications
of the April 6 Washington Post front
and back pages. The newspaper ac
count of the Congressional debate will
serve as program notes for the reen
actment-
The presentation is free and open
to the public.

Kulsar believes that the Theater of
the Congressional Record provides
more than entertainment — it is able
to provide an historical perspective for
issues being discussed now concern
ing the war in Vietnam. The situation
facing Congressmen in 1917 was simi
lar to what we face today — sending

American men to fight for someone
else — and they considered the ques
tion very carefully and seriously.
Reduced, But Not Changed
The original debate took 17 hours.
Kulsar has reduced this to a script of
three hours. The Record has been
cut, but nothing has been added or
changed.
In addition to the two presentations
this week, the Theater is planning a
reenactment of the 1917 debate on
conscription. This debate, taking place
about a month after war had been de
clared, lasted six days in the house,
and Kulsar is editing it to eight hours
to be given on Memorial Day from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Kulsar hopes that
other enactments will be done to shed
light on events happening now.
Adding color to the current presen
tation will be a demonstration by suf
fragettes and one concerning prohi
bition. These will take place outside
Dinkelspiel.
The programs will be duplications
of the April 6 Washington Post front
and back pages. The newspaper ac
count of the Congressional debate will
serve as program notes for the reen
actment-
The presentation is free and open
to the public.
The issue of a declaration of war
with Germany will be debated tonight
and tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel in a reenactment of the
deliberations in the House of Repre
sentatives fifty years ago today.
The program is being presented by
the Theater of the Congressional Rec
ord, sponsored by the Speech and
Drama Department. Fifty students,
faculty and staff members will partic
ipate in the reading of the debate on
the declaration of war with Germany
from the Congressional Record.
Dinkelspiel represents the House
Chamber, with the stage serving as
the speaker's platform. Members of
the House will sit in the first few
rows of seats along the center aisle,
Democrats on the left, and Republi
cans on the right.
John Kulsar, an instructor in
speech, directs the presentation and
plays the part of "Champ" Clark of
Missouri, Speaker of the House. Mark
Schweninger is the Chairman of the
House. The program is produced by
Helen W. Schrader, an assistant pro
fessor of speech and education.
Record is Good Drama
Kulsar said he first thought of the
idea about a year ago when he no
ticed several copies of the Congres
sional Record in a friend's library.
As they read some of it together it oc
curred to Kulsar that the Record was
excellent drama. Upon coming to
Stanford, he discussed the idea with
others and decided that a theater of
the Congressional Record would be
a good idea.
According to Kulsar, this is a "thea
ter of actuality with no illusion." The
Congressmen were "dealing with very
real issues," and as such, the Record
is "dramatic material in the highest
sense." Someone has suggested that
this was the true theater of the ab
surd. Kulsar feels that this is an ap
propriate title in light of the irony
he sees in the discussions.
