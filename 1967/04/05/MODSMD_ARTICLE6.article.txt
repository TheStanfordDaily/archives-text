# SRT Premieres Osborne Classic
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
The Stanford Repertory Theater's
production of John Osborne's "Inad
missible Evidence" opens tonight at
8:30 in the Little Theater.
Gerald Hiken is cast in the
role of Bill Maitland, an archaic ana
corrupt lawyer who has destroyed
himself in an apathetic and indiffer
ent modern world.
Premiere
The SRT production is a northern
California premiere. The play was
first performed in London in the fall
of 1964. Robert Loper, producing di
rector, said, "The play has not been
attempted in northern California
previously because the role is so de
manding."
Loper, who directed SRT produc
tions last year, feels that "Inadmis

sible Evidence" reects a greater ma
turity than Osborne's previous plays,
"Look Back in Anger," "Luther," and
"The Entertainer."
Loper commented, "Maitland is a
mature, if corrupted man. He is not
a heroic lead, but he really repre
sents most of us."
For Adult Adults
New York reviewer Norman Nadel
has said, " 'Inadmissible Evidence' is
drama designed only for adult adults,
and even they'll debate it far into the
night."
Hiken, a member of the Actor's
Studio, is a past resident professional
actor on campus. He has played on
Broadway in "Gideon," "The Cave
Dwellers," "The Three Sisters," and
"Foxy."
Hiken directed a program of three
Chekhov one-act plays this winter,

and, more recently, was seen in the
SRT production of Chekhov's "The
Cherry Orchard."
Past Osborne Successes
Osborne's first play, "Look Back in
Anger," was an overnight success in
1956. The play ran for 18 months
despite critical attacks on its grating
theme, its defiance of the Establish
ment, and its vulgarity. In 1958, it
was honored by the New York Drama
Critics' Circle Award.
Osborne won an Oscar in 1958 for
his script for the movie "Tom Jones."
He has also written articles of social
criticism and occasionally acts in and
directs plays.
Twelve performances, including
Saturday matinees, continue through
April 15. Tickets are available from
the SRT Ticket Office in Memorial
Auditorium.

theme, its defiance of the Establish
ment, and its vulgarity. In 1958, it
was honored by the New York Drama
Critics' Circle Award.
Osborne won an Oscar in 1958 for
his script for the movie "Tom Jones."
He has also written articles of social
criticism and occasionally acts in and
directs plays.
Twelve performances, including
Saturday matinees, continue through
April 15. Tickets are available from
the SRT Ticket Office in Memorial
Auditorium.
The Stanford Repertory Theater's
production of John Osborne's "Inad
missible Evidence" opens tonight at
8:30 in the Little Theater.
Gerald Hiken is cast in the
role of Bill Maitland, an archaic ana
corrupt lawyer who has destroyed
himself in an apathetic and indiffer
ent modern world.
Premiere
The SRT production is a northern
California premiere. The play was
first performed in London in the fall
of 1964. Robert Loper, producing di
rector, said, "The play has not been
attempted in northern California
previously because the role is so de
manding."
Loper, who directed SRT produc
tions last year, feels that "Inadmis

sible Evidence" reects a greater ma
turity than Osborne's previous plays,
"Look Back in Anger," "Luther," and
"The Entertainer."
Loper commented, "Maitland is a
mature, if corrupted man. He is not
a heroic lead, but he really repre
sents most of us."
For Adult Adults
New York reviewer Norman Nadel
has said, " 'Inadmissible Evidence' is
drama designed only for adult adults,
and even they'll debate it far into the
night."
Hiken, a member of the Actor's
Studio, is a past resident professional
actor on campus. He has played on
Broadway in "Gideon," "The Cave
Dwellers," "The Three Sisters," and
"Foxy."
Hiken directed a program of three
Chekhov one-act plays this winter,

and, more recently, was seen in the
SRT production of Chekhov's "The
Cherry Orchard."
Past Osborne Successes
Osborne's first play, "Look Back in
Anger," was an overnight success in
1956. The play ran for 18 months
despite critical attacks on its grating
theme, its defiance of the Establish
ment, and its vulgarity. In 1958, it
was honored by the New York Drama
Critics' Circle Award.
Osborne won an Oscar in 1958 for
his script for the movie "Tom Jones."
He has also written articles of social
criticism and occasionally acts in and
directs plays.
Twelve performances, including
Saturday matinees, continue through
April 15. Tickets are available from
