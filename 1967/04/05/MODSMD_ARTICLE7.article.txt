# Universities Refuse To Send Rankings
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Two more U.S. colleges, reflecting a
growing trend, have abolished the
system of reporting class rankings to
draft boards as a result of student
pressure.
On March 17, President of Reed Col
lege Byron Youtz announced that be
ginning next fall the school will no
longer provide class rankings to local
draft boards. Youtz said that if a stu
dent is making satisfactory progress
in his studies, they will have a state
ment to that effect sent to his draft
board.
Youtz also said that that the college
feels that the use of class rank to
establish student deferments is edu
cationally unsound and undesirable,
and that Reed will be working with
other colleges and universities to have
the ranking system changed.
Columbia Abolishes Rankings
Choosing a more radical approach
to the problem, Columbia University
has decided to abolish class rankings
entirely. This decision by the Colum
bia Board of Trustees was reached
after a period of student pressure to
withhold grades from local draft
boards.
University officials had previously
informed the Trustees that "no hard
ship would be imposed upon indivi
dual students by the discontinuance."
Columbia's University Council
headed off a planned student boycott
by recommending this move to the
Trustees. The boycott would have pro
tested release of rankings to draft
boards.
The trustees decided to do away
with class standings entirely rather
than merely withhold them because
the latter "might be regarded by
many persons as an intrusion by the
University into the political arena."
Permission Cards
At Stanford, cards were distributed
in the registration packets of all men
asking them to report whether they
wanted Stanford to report their stu
dent status to their draft boards.
Registrar Harvey Hall stated last
night that the only condition under
which Stanford would release such in
formation was with the permission of
the student.
A representative of the local draft
board in San Mateo stated yesterday
that if a student's class ranking is not
reported to them, he is not eligible for
a student deferment. The representa
tive added that the only university
that had balked at releasing standing
was San Francisco State, but that

they reported such standings at the
students' request. The representative
added that "most other boards in Cali
fornia" had a similar policy; however,
information from Stanford students
seems to show that many draft boardr.
have no such policy.

Permission Cards
At Stanford, cards were distributed
in the registration packets of all men
asking them to report whether they
wanted Stanford to report their stu
dent status to their draft boards.
Registrar Harvey Hall stated last
night that the only condition under
which Stanford would release such in
formation was with the permission of
the student.
A representative of the local draft
board in San Mateo stated yesterday
that if a student's class ranking is not
reported to them, he is not eligible for
a student deferment. The representa
tive added that the only university
that had balked at releasing standing
was San Francisco State, but that

they reported such standings at the
students' request. The representative
added that "most other boards in Cali
fornia" had a similar policy; however,
information from Stanford students
seems to show that many draft boardr.
have no such policy.
Two more U.S. colleges, reflecting a
growing trend, have abolished the
system of reporting class rankings to
draft boards as a result of student
pressure.
On March 17, President of Reed Col
lege Byron Youtz announced that be
ginning next fall the school will no
longer provide class rankings to local
draft boards. Youtz said that if a stu
dent is making satisfactory progress
in his studies, they will have a state
ment to that effect sent to his draft
board.
Youtz also said that that the college
feels that the use of class rank to
establish student deferments is edu
cationally unsound and undesirable,
and that Reed will be working with
other colleges and universities to have
the ranking system changed.
Columbia Abolishes Rankings
Choosing a more radical approach
to the problem, Columbia University
has decided to abolish class rankings
entirely. This decision by the Colum
bia Board of Trustees was reached
after a period of student pressure to
withhold grades from local draft
boards.
University officials had previously
informed the Trustees that "no hard
ship would be imposed upon indivi
dual students by the discontinuance."
Columbia's University Council
headed off a planned student boycott
by recommending this move to the
Trustees. The boycott would have pro
tested release of rankings to draft
boards.
The trustees decided to do away
with class standings entirely rather
than merely withhold them because
the latter "might be regarded by
many persons as an intrusion by the
University into the political arena."
