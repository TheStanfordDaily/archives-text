# Students Play The Latest Campus Game—'I Spy'
## 
### HENRY MULLER 
Activity credit may soon have to be
given for the newest pastime on the
American college campus—spying.
Although the details vary from one
university to another, the spying has
generally been aimed at investiga
tion of the activities of so-called lib
erals.
FBI and local police officials are
doing much of the spying themselves,
but are also relying on students to
help them. And in at least one case,
students have been in cahoots with
a university administration.
At Brigham Young University
(BYU), 15 students were asked to
keep an eye on eight political science
professors known to be of liberal
leanings.
Check-Up On Faculty
The two students who made this
revelation claimed they had been
asked to "check up" on faculty re
action to a conservative speech given
by the university's president, Ernest
Wilkinson. They also charged that
six of the eight professors were
forced to resign from the faculty for
political reasons.
Wilkinson several days later ad
mitted that students had been asked
to spy on liberal political science pro

fessors, but denied that any of them
had been forced to leave.
The spies had filed a bill of charges
against one of the professors, Ray C.
Hillam; the charges included his
alleged advocacy of the admission
of Red China to the U.N.
Political Activities
Meanwhile, three students at Duke
University charged that the FBI was
using students and officials secretly
to obtain information about campus
political activities. The accusation
provoked a confession by junior
Tommy Taft, who admitted passing
information to the FBI.
Taft explained that after he had
sent some anti-war literature to the
national headquarters of the FBI, he
was approached by an agent who
questioned him on where he had
found the material. Taft said he later
furnished the agent with "more com
plete information and answered cer
tain questions concerning what I
knew of the University Liberal Action
Committee and gave him some gen
eral information concerning several
individuals."
According to the student news
paper, University officials have ex
pressed no concern about FBI activity
on the campus.

A similar controversy has erupted
at the University of California's
Berkeley campus, where students
have charged that information is re
leased to government agencies with
out permission from the individuals
involved.
A registrar on campus, Clinton Gil
liam, has confirmed the charge and ad
mitted that agencies like the FBI and
the CIA are allowed access to records
of students' grades and other informa
tion without specific permission. But
Vice Chancellor Eral Cheit has de
nied the charges and said that the
University's policy was only to re
lease records on individual students
only with the authorization of the stu
dents.
Stanford
The situation at Stanford is equally
confusing. The Dean's office here has
reepatedly insisted that it gives out
no information without the express
permission of the student in ques
tion.
The Registrar's office, however,
allows FBI agents to see transcripts
without the student's permission. The
agent needs only to present his iden
tification and does not need to show
cause for examination of the records.
Civil Service investigators and

agents from other certified govern
ment agencies are allowed the same
privilege; students are told that their
records have not been checked.
SDS At Texas
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) is attracting its share of spies
to the campuses. At the University
of Texas, freshman Bill Green has
been gathering information to facili
tate a State Senate investigation of
SDS.
Green feels that SDS definitely
shows Communist tendencies and is
afraid that some of the ideas it advo
cates would "contaminate the student
body." He is searching for links be
tween SDS and Communist organiza
tion and hopes to have it placed on
the House Un-American Activities
Committee's "subversive list."
And at St. John's University a coed
has revealed that local police authori
ties asked her to report on the activi
ties of delegates to last summer's
National Student Association (NSA)
conference. Gloria Kuzmyak said she
was asked to reveal information on
NSA's "far left" students.
She said that police officials were
particularly interested in the names
of people affiliated with SDS. She re
fused to cooperate and was told to

forget all about the police requests
when contacted later on.
Student Leftists
According to a recent article in
Newsweek, the University of Illinois
keeps extensive files on student left
ists. One employee told the magazine
that "anyone who belongs to a liberal
organization goes in."
Newsweek also reported that one
FBI agent has been assigned to the
Harvard campus for the last fifteen
years and is reportedly assisted 1" "
student informers paid up to $200 a
month. It also said that Berkeley
police sometimes pay student inform
ers $30 to $40 a week to help them
fight the spread of marijuana and
LSD.
At Farleigh Dickinson University,
a coed was asked by a county nar
cotics detective to enroll as a special
student so she could spy on another
student known to be in possession of
marijuana. The administration at Far
leigh Dickinson actively cooperated
with the local police.
And at Cornell, New York police
detectives posed as students to ap
prehend suppliers of psychedelic
drugs, although the University re
portedly knew nothing about the spy
ing on campus.
