# Program Offers German Style Education

More than half of Stanford's under
graduate student body studies at an
overseas campus. For approximately
thirty students a year this means
more than attendance at a Stanford
campus in a foreign country, and in
stead becomes the opportunity for in
tensive study of a foreign language
and culture at a foreign university
through one of the University's lesser
known study abroad programs.
Conducted at the Universities of
Hamburg, Germany, and Nantes,
France, the overseas language study
programs offer a unique opportunity
not only to live in a foreign country
but to participate in its educational
system.
Begun five years ago, the study pro
gram at the University of Hamburg
allows fifteen students, predominantly
German majors, but including a limit
ed number of history majors, to at
tend the German university for six
months. Receiving support from Stan
ford, the University of Hamburg, and
the Bonn Government Education Of
fice, the program seeks to offer stu
dents interested in German language
and culture the chance to gain an

even greater appreciation of Germany
than that offered by Stanford's Over
seas Campuses.
Specialization
"Many students have a desire to
specialize in a major of either Ger
man language or German culture.
This offers an opportunity for inten
sive practice of the language with an
emphasis on history or other culture
aspects which will satisfy this de
sire of the student to prepare himself
in a practical way that just couldn't
be done otherwise," said Dr. Paul Han
ley in describing the Hamburg pro
gram.
Under the direction of Modern
European Language Department
Chairman Dr. Friedrich Strochmann
the program seeks to permit the
American student to live exactly as
his German counterpart. This is in
contrast to the five major overseas
campuses which are open with a mini
mum of language requirements and
seek to introduce the American stu
dents to the culture of a foreign coun
try while not attempting to duplicate
its educational system.
Students discover many differences
between the American educational sys

tem and that in Germany. One chief
difference is the organization of the
German program around the idea of
the accumulation of knowledge over
the students entire educational career
compared to the American system
which moves in steps from quarter to
quarter.
According to Susan Brenner, a re
cent participant in the program, "The
first impression that strikes an Amer
ican student upon attending a German
university is the educational freedom
a German student enjoys. There are
no required courses, rather a required
amount of information which is tested
at the end of the university career.
Furthermore, since most Germans are
twenty years old when they first start
college, they immediately commence
work on their major subject. One ad
vantage is this is that medical, law
and business students begin imme
diately to study their chosen fields."
Freedom
This freedom was appreciated by
another participant, Nancy Smith,
who recalled that "the German stu
dent is above all considered to be a
relatively mature individual who is
enrolled at the university for the pur

pose of studying. Accordingly, he is
allowed to concentrate on the area of
his choice; he is not given a wide
range of various requirements to fill;
he is able to plan his own program
and his own time."
Students also notice a great differ
ence in method of instruction. Where
the Stanford program attempts to
emphasize individual contact with
professors through small classes, un
limited meal invitations, and special
seminar classes, the German profes
sor lives aloof from his students.
"The courses are divided basically
into three types: lecture, seminar, and
'Übung.' In a lecture course the pro
fessor is master over a class of at
least 300 students; the students ap
plaud on his entrance and exit and
may not interrupt the lecture with
questions. Reading assignments are
given during the lecture and are
large enough so that the student is
forced to choose what he thinks is
important. Seminars are very similar,
but a little smaller—usually not larg
er than 150 students. A paper is re
quired for a seminar and should be
at least 20-30 pages long." said Miss
Brenner.

"Due to the large size of classes
and the inaccessibility of the profes
sor, the German student considers
himself very lucky if one professor
can recognize him by name sometime
during his university years. For us
this is incomprehensible, since we
often become well aquainted with our
professors. Therefore, although the
German student is relatively free to
choose the courses he wants, there is
almost no intellectual communication
between professor and student, so
that conflicts in opinions must often
remain unresolved," continued Miss
Brenner.
Miss Smith, however, felt that the
freedom of the German system led
to a better attitude toward learning
than that found here. "The advan
tages of this freedom among the stu
dents at the University of Hamburg
were most impressive to me. The ab
sence of annoying midterms and
quarterly finals seemed to create a
constructive attitude toward learning.
One studied, not for the approaching
test, but because one was interested.
Studying was a serious but enjoyable
part of the student's daily life, not

a necessary but distasteful cramming
session before finals. Thus, what was
learned was probably both significant
and lasting ... In other words, a
healthy educational atmosphere
existed which was likely to continue
among these students long after they
left the university."
She continued, "This atmosphere is
hard to find among undergraduate
students at Stanford. I found it
among the freshmen who entered
Stanford with me in the fall; but by
spring it had shifted for many of
them. It began to develop again
among third and particularly fourth
year students, and significantly, par
ticularly among those who broke
away from the normal routine of
quarterly classes and tests through
participating in an honor's program."
Both students indicated they gained
immensely from the program. Miss
Brenner found the opportunity to
"learn to know and to appreciate the
German student's way of life as well
as the American student's" particular
ly valuable, while Miss Simth stated
that "perhaps the American uni
versity system has something to learn
from the older German system."
