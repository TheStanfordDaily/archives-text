## 
### 
Stanford graduate students
were urged today to submit ap
plications to their department
chairmen for appointments to
the 1967-68 California Legisla
tive Internship Program by
Monday, April 10th.
Dr. Victor Jones, U.C. Berke
ley Executive Committee Chair
man for the Program, said there
was still time to obtain applica
tions from the Political Science,
Law or Journalism Department
offices. Transcripts of scholastic
records may be submitted later.
This year's group will be the
tenth group to be selected by a
screening committee to serve
with Assembly Committee staffs.
The new interns will report to
Sacramento next September and
complete their service in June
of next year. Part of their in
ternship includes intimate in
volvement in the regular legis
lative session beginning next
January.
Richard A- Buck of El Cajon
and Robert J. Murphy 111 of
Stanford Village are Stanford
graduate students currently ser
ving here with Assembly com
mittees. Buck, a Public Admini
stration major, is with the Rev
enue and Taxation Committee.
Murphy, who was a Stanford
law school student, is on the
Judiciary Committee staff.
The Assembly program, start
ed in 1957, is modeled after the
Congressional Internship Pro
gram in Washington, D.C. It is
intended to provide potential fu
ture civic leaders with a sound
knowledge of state government
in action, encourage research

for its improvement, and provide
a small pool of capable person
nel to help out with the heavy
Assembly workload. The pro
gram has also incidentally pro
vided career personnel to the
regular Assembly staff.
Interviewing of selected appli
cants by the screening commit
tee will be held in late April
and appointments will be an
nounced on or about May 15th.
