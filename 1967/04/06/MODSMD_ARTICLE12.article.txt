# 'Only War Will End Activism'
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” Student political ac
tivism is here to stay,and is
bound to expand and spread. So
concludes Christian Bay, politi
cal science professor at the Uni
versity of Alberta. Addressing
the annual meeting of the Amer
ican Orthopsychiatric Associa
tion (AOA), the Canadian pro
fessor said that, barring a major
war, the development of acti
vism is "likely to be self-reinfor
cing and therefore irreversible."
Bay said that educators should
welcome the activist trend rather
than "dread or try to oppose" it.
He claimed that the educated
minority of student activists has
already done much to improve
the intellectual climate of many
universities, and .thereby the
prospects for education.
