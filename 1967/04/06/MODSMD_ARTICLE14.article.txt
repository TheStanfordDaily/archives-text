# Transplants: A Legal Problem
## 
### 
New organs for old will be
commonplace seme day, but re
searchers working to perfect
surgical techniques also must
hurdle such human factors as
public sentiment and legal ter
minology.
Such is the opinion of Dr. Roy
Cohn, professor of surgery at
the Stanford University School
of Medicine.
Writing in the current issue
of Stanford Today Dr. Cohn
says that human organs, most
effectively the kidney, can be
transplanted. But the problems
which now loom largest are eco
nomic, legal, sociological, ethi
cal, and moral in nature.
"The success rate in kidney
and other transplantation would
be increased if we had a new def
inition of death, permitting the
removal of organs at a more op
timal time," Dr. Cohn wrote.
"Physicians would prefer that
the cessation of brain function
for 48 hours (as indicated by an
absence of waves in the electro
encephalogram), rather than
cessation of the heart beat, be
considered as death. It is pos
sible for the heart to go on beat
ing for days after the brain has
passed beyond possible re
covery."
Dr. Cohn explained that trans
plantation is best done with tis
sue from living donors, but ob
viously this is not always pos
sible. So far methods of organ
preservation have yielded meag
er results. It is not possible to
maintain a "bank" except for
the inert structural type of or
gan such as the cornea, bone,
and arteries.

Surgeons have used cadavers
as a source of kidneys, but ex
perience shows they must be
used within a short time, maxi
mally about three hours, or they
will not function. "The success
rate where this source has been
used the most is about 40 per
cent," Dr. Cohn wrote. "This
success rate could be increased
were it not for the legal barrier
to obtaining the cadaver kidney
promptly."
He said that although statutes
vary in different states, the prac
tical situation is that permission
of the next of kin must be ob
tained after death before an
organ can be removed from the
body. This can be true if the de
ceased has willed the organ.
Dr. Cohn cited the case of a
man who was offered to the
Stanford Medical Center as a
donor by his family. The man
had been accidentally shot in
the head and his brain was de
stroyed. "The uncertainties of
the law in regard to the right of
the family to make this offer as
well as the responsibilities of
the physicians in accepting this
patient whose heart was beating
normally, whose breathing had
been taken over by a mechanical
respirator, and whose kidneys
were functioning normally were
so indefinite that those priceless
kidneys could not be used," he
said. The patient was pronounc
ed dead several days later.
Another problem concerned
with kidney transplantation is
cost. Hospitalization alone costs
somewhere between $6,000 and
$30,000 depending upon compli
cations, Dr- Cohn pointed out.

This figure does not include
medical fees and expenses for
drugs which are needed after
the patient leaves the hospital.
There are sociological and psy
chiatric problems concerned
with the future of the donor in
kidney operations. Life insur
ance statistics indicate that a
healthy person with one kidney
has a very small decrease in life
expectancy compared to the

same individual with two kid
neys. "Yet the donor as a per
son cannot be compared in terms
of statistics," Dr. Cohn wrote.
"The fact remains that he is
giving away something which
someday he may need just as
desperately as the intended re
cipient. There are problems here
for the psychiatrist, not only in
dealing with the donor but also
with his family."
