To VISTA Volunteer Judy Chaffin, who is serv ing with her husband
in Baltimore, Maryland, trying to work with the underprivileged
is not only a fight against poverty, but a constant battle against
suspicion and distrust. Sincerity and friendship can build a bridge
for cooperation between the community and the Volunteers, and
cooperation can get things done.
