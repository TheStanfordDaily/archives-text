# Counselor Attacks Pass-Fail Idealism
## 
### 
(1.P.) â€” Ideally, a student
must seek knowledge for itself
rather than the grade he receiv
es, Dr. Eleanore S. Isard, direc
tor of Temple University's Coun
seling Center, states. "However,
a pass-fail system of grading is
more idealistic than realistic,"
she adds.
"Although a pass-fail system
would relieve the pressure of
striving for a reward like a
grade, we are caught up in a
total education system which
requires finer answers than a
pass-fail system could provide,"
she says.
"We could not possibly use a
pass-fail system at the Univer
sity because we have such a he
terogeneous population," Dr.
Isard continued. "Perhaps a
pass-fail system could be used
in an honors program. However,
it would be foolhardy to try to
incorporate a pass-fail system
overnight. First, a formal study
would be necessary, then stu
dents and faculty would have to
be prepared to work under this
system."
Commenting on the system
which makes no provision for
the student who excels with dis
tinction, Dr. Emily Sherwood, a

Counseling Center staff member
said, "It is difficult to distinguish
between a Band C student, but
the difference is obvious between
an A and C or C and F student.
Excellence should be rewarded."
Both Dr. Isard and Dr. Sher
wood agreed that a criterion for
success has to be established be
fore any correlation between
high grades and success can be
made.
