# Stanford Gets $5 Million In Grants And Trust Funds
## 
### 
Hansen Physics Laboratory
and the schools of Medicine and
Business will benefit from over
$5-million recently received by
Stanford in gifts and grants.
A $4.3-million follow-on con
tract for modernizing and oper
ating the Navy's Mark 3 super
cooled linear accelerator has
been awarded by the Office of
Naval Research. The Mark 3 ac
celerator is the latest product
of a research program conduct
ed for the last three years by
the Hansen Labs.
Willson Fund
Cancer research at the School
of Medicine will be aided by the
Jack and Lulu Willson Fund for
Cancer Research recently estab
lished by Sam G. Willson of
Oakland, a retired contractor, in
honor of his parents.
"It is my fond hope," Willson
said, "that by providing some
assistance to those who seek
more knowledge about cancer,
medical science may develop
methods of prevention and con
trol of the disease."
. In announcing the $400,000
gift, Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice
president for medical affairs
and Dean of the School of Medi
cine, commented: "The Jack
and Lulu Willson Fund for Can
cer Research will stand in the
years to come as an example
of the generosity and dedication
of a fine citizen to the develop
ment of medical knowledge.
Nothing would please us more
than for the Willson Fund to be
the means whereby a new and
hnportant breakthrough in the
Understanding of cancer can be
Attained."
Doctor Glaser announced that
income from the Willson Fund
will be used to support the work
of investigators not supported
by Federal grants.
Cancer research at the School
of Medicine ranges from the de
velopment of new and more ef
fective techniques in radiation
treatment to basic studies which
may lead to a better understand
ing of what causes rapid and un
regulated cell growth in cancer.
An increasing knowledge of the
biological behavior of cancer
cells may lead to techniques by
which cancer may be more eas
ily and selectively eradicated.
Eye Grant
Aided by a $246,000 grant
from the National Institutes of
Health, researchers at the School
of Medicine and the Stanford Re-
Search Institute are taking a
new look at the laser to deter
mine its usefulness in the treat
ment and prevention of eye dis
eases that lead to blindness.
The scientists are studying
the biological effects of laser
energy on eye tissue and are
making plans for developing a
laser that would be "clinically
superior" to conventional photo
coagulators. Their studies in
clude the effect of different wave
lengths of light on eye tissues,
the amount of light energy need
ed to produce curative results on
eye tissue, and also laser treat
ment of eye tumors. Also under
study is the application of the
laser to cure eye complications
of diabetes, glaucoma, and clos
ing of the iris because of disease.
The research team from the
School of Medicine includes Dr.
H. Christian Zweng, clinical as
sistant professor of surgery, Dr.
Milton Flocks, clinical associate
professor of surgery, Dr. Robert
Peabody, senior resident in op
thalmology, and Dr. Robert C.
Rosan, assistant, professor of
pathology.
Team
The engineering team respon
sible for laser instrumentation

includes Dr. Richard C. Honey,
Dr. Robert Arthur Vassiliades,
Norman Peppers and Zev Press
man of the Electromagnetic
Techniques Laboratory at the
Stanford Research Institute.
"The potential value of lasers
has been recognized," Drs.
Zweng and Flocks commented.
"However, their use has been
limited to the treatment of cer
tain retinal defects. The best
way of applying laser radiation
to eye disorders is still imper
fectly understood. Studies to
date indicate that lasers prob
ably will prove to be clinically
superior to conventional photo
coagulators."
The laser photocoagulator is
being developed to replace the
old-fashioned xenon arc lamps
now in service. Large scars are
produced by the xenon source,
and anesthesia is often used.
The intense monochromatic light
output of the laser makes it an
ideal source for photocoagula
tion since high heat intensity
can be obtained with a low
amount of energy, the research
ers said. The heat can be focused
directly to the tissue being treat
ed and minimize damage to ad
jacent tissues.
The first test of a handheld
laser photocoagulator on a hu
man was made in the summer
of 1963 by Zweng and Flocks

with a patient who was losing
vision because of a detached reti
na in one eye. The beam passed
through transparent tissue and
liquid in front of the eye, reach
ed the retina in back and pain
lessly spot-welded it back in
place.
Pediatrics
A four-bed pediatric research
unit for the study of childhood
diseases has been established by
the School of Medicine. Con
struction of the unit was made
possible by a $30,000 gift from
The Gillette Company of Boston,
Mass.
Research into several major
diseases will be conducted in the
new unit. By studying a diabetic
child before he is given insulin
researchers seek more informa
tion about the relationship of
the carbohydrate metabolism to
insulin secretion in the predia
betic child. Hypoglycemia, a
condition characterized by a low
blood sugar count, will also be
studied.
GSB Fund
Students at the Graduate
School of Business have received
the first distribution of $33,000
from the Gustav and Elizabeth
Benkendorf Trust Fund.
The $1.6-million trust scholar
ship fund was begun by Benken
dorf in 1957. He anticipated that
20 to 30 scholarships of about
$1000 each would be granted
each semester.



Spring Quarter orientation at the Free University of Palo Alto will
be held tonight at Felix Greene's home, 1765 Fulton in Palo Alto at
7:30. Among the instructors offering course sare Master Subramu
niya (on yoga) and Dave Harris (on living a life of peace and liber
ation in the U.S. today.)

Cancer research at the School
of Medicine ranges from the de
velopment of new and more ef

treatment to basic studies which
may lead to a better understand

Eye Grant
Aided by a $246,000 grant
from the National Institutes of
Health, researchers at the School
of Medicine and the Stanford Re-
Search Institute are taking a
new look at the laser to deter
mine its usefulness in the treat
ment and prevention of eye dis
eases that lead to blindness.
The scientists are studying
the biological effects of laser
energy on eye tissue and are
making plans for developing a
laser that would be "clinically
superior" to conventional photo
coagulators. Their studies in
clude the effect of different wave
lengths of light on eye tissues,
the amount of light energy need
ed to produce curative results on
eye tissue, and also laser treat
ment of eye tumors. Also under
study is the application of the
laser to cure eye complications
of diabetes, glaucoma, and clos
ing of the iris because of disease.
The research team from the
School of Medicine includes Dr.
H. Christian Zweng, clinical as
sistant professor of surgery, Dr.
Milton Flocks, clinical associate
professor of surgery, Dr. Robert
Peabody, senior resident in op
thalmology, and Dr. Robert C.
Rosan, assistant, professor of
pathology.
Team
The engineering team respon
sible for laser instrumentation

includes Dr. Richard C. Honey,
Dr. Robert Arthur Vassiliades,
Norman Peppers and Zev Press
man of the Electromagnetic
Techniques Laboratory at the
Stanford Research Institute.
"The potential value of lasers
has been recognized," Drs.
Zweng and Flocks commented.
"However, their use has been
limited to the treatment of cer
tain retinal defects. The best
way of applying laser radiation
to eye disorders is still imper
fectly understood. Studies to
date indicate that lasers prob
ably will prove to be clinically
superior to conventional photo
coagulators."
The laser photocoagulator is
being developed to replace the
old-fashioned xenon arc lamps
now in service. Large scars are
produced by the xenon source,
and anesthesia is often used.
The intense monochromatic light
output of the laser makes it an
ideal source for photocoagula
tion since high heat intensity
can be obtained with a low
amount of energy, the research
ers said. The heat can be focused
directly to the tissue being treat
ed and minimize damage to ad
jacent tissues.
The first test of a handheld
laser photocoagulator on a hu
man was made in the summer
of 1963 by Zweng and Flocks

with a patient who was losing
vision because of a detached reti
na in one eye. The beam passed
through transparent tissue and
liquid in front of the eye, reach
ed the retina in back and pain
lessly spot-welded it back in
place.
Pediatrics
A four-bed pediatric research
unit for the study of childhood
diseases has been established by
the School of Medicine. Con
struction of the unit was made
possible by a $30,000 gift from
The Gillette Company of Boston,
Mass.
Research into several major
diseases will be conducted in the
new unit. By studying a diabetic
child before he is given insulin
researchers seek more informa
tion about the relationship of
the carbohydrate metabolism to
insulin secretion in the predia
betic child. Hypoglycemia, a
condition characterized by a low
blood sugar count, will also be
studied.
GSB Fund
Students at the Graduate
School of Business have received
the first distribution of $33,000
from the Gustav and Elizabeth
Benkendorf Trust Fund.

20 to 30 scholarships of about
$1000 each would be granted
each semester.



Spring Quarter orientation at the Free University of Palo Alto will
be held tonight at Felix Greene's home, 1765 Fulton in Palo Alto at

clude the effect of different wave
lengths of light on eye tissues,
the amount of light energy need

eye tissue, and also laser treat

study is the application of the
laser to cure eye complications
of diabetes, glaucoma, and clos

The research team from the
School of Medicine includes Dr.
H. Christian Zweng, clinical as

Milton Flocks, clinical associate
professor of surgery, Dr. Robert
Peabody, senior resident in op

The engineering team respon
sible for laser instrumentation

includes Dr. Richard C. Honey,
Dr. Robert Arthur Vassiliades,
Norman Peppers and Zev Press
man of the Electromagnetic
Techniques Laboratory at the
Stanford Research Institute.
"The potential value of lasers
has been recognized," Drs.
Zweng and Flocks commented.
"However, their use has been
limited to the treatment of cer
tain retinal defects. The best
way of applying laser radiation
to eye disorders is still imper
fectly understood. Studies to
date indicate that lasers prob
ably will prove to be clinically
superior to conventional photo
coagulators."
The laser photocoagulator is
being developed to replace the
old-fashioned xenon arc lamps
now in service. Large scars are
produced by the xenon source,
and anesthesia is often used.
The intense monochromatic light
output of the laser makes it an
ideal source for photocoagula
tion since high heat intensity
can be obtained with a low
amount of energy, the research
ers said. The heat can be focused
directly to the tissue being treat
ed and minimize damage to ad
jacent tissues.
The first test of a handheld
laser photocoagulator on a hu
man was made in the summer
of 1963 by Zweng and Flocks

with a patient who was losing
vision because of a detached reti
na in one eye. The beam passed
through transparent tissue and
liquid in front of the eye, reach
ed the retina in back and pain
lessly spot-welded it back in
place.
Pediatrics
A four-bed pediatric research
unit for the study of childhood
diseases has been established by
the School of Medicine. Con
struction of the unit was made
possible by a $30,000 gift from
The Gillette Company of Boston,
Mass.
Research into several major
diseases will be conducted in the
new unit. By studying a diabetic
child before he is given insulin
researchers seek more informa
tion about the relationship of
the carbohydrate metabolism to
insulin secretion in the predia
betic child. Hypoglycemia, a
condition characterized by a low
blood sugar count, will also be
studied.
GSB Fund
Students at the Graduate
School of Business have received
the first distribution of $33,000
from the Gustav and Elizabeth
Benkendorf Trust Fund.
The $1.6-million trust scholar
ship fund was begun by Benken
dorf in 1957. He anticipated that
20 to 30 scholarships of about
$1000 each would be granted
each semester.



Spring Quarter orientation at the Free University of Palo Alto will
be held tonight at Felix Greene's home, 1765 Fulton in Palo Alto at
7:30. Among the instructors offering course sare Master Subramu
niya (on yoga) and Dave Harris (on living a life of peace and liber
ation in the U.S. today.)
Hansen Physics Laboratory
and the schools of Medicine and
Business will benefit from over
$5-million recently received by
Stanford in gifts and grants.
A $4.3-million follow-on con
tract for modernizing and oper

Willson Fund
Cancer research at the School
of Medicine will be aided by the
Jack and Lulu Willson Fund for
Cancer Research recently estab
lished by Sam G. Willson of
Oakland, a retired contractor, in
honor of his parents.
"It is my fond hope," Willson
said, "that by providing some
assistance to those who seek
more knowledge about cancer,
medical science may develop
methods of prevention and con
trol of the disease."
. In announcing the $400,000
gift, Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice
president for medical affairs
and Dean of the School of Medi
cine, commented: "The Jack
and Lulu Willson Fund for Can
cer Research will stand in the
years to come as an example
of the generosity and dedication
of a fine citizen to the develop
ment of medical knowledge.
Nothing would please us more
than for the Willson Fund to be
the means whereby a new and
hnportant breakthrough in the
Understanding of cancer can be
Attained."
Doctor Glaser announced that
income from the Willson Fund
will be used to support the work
of investigators not supported
by Federal grants.
Cancer research at the School
of Medicine ranges from the de
velopment of new and more ef
fective techniques in radiation
treatment to basic studies which
may lead to a better understand
ing of what causes rapid and un
regulated cell growth in cancer.
An increasing knowledge of the
biological behavior of cancer
cells may lead to techniques by
which cancer may be more eas
ily and selectively eradicated.
