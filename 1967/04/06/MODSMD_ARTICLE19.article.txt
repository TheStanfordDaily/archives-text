# Student Gov’t Shake-Ups By Dateline
## 
### 
(CPS)—In a protest against
powerlessness, the students at
Middlebury College have voted
to dissolve their student govern
ment.
A campus referendum on the
issue saw the Middlebury Stu
dent Association abolished by a
407-70 tally. Student Association
president John Rogers said he
"had expected that sort of a
vote."

Rogers said he considered the
referendum results "a positive
act, calling for a referendum ol
the whole concept of student
government at Middlebury."
The editor of the school's pa
per, THE MIDDLEBURY CAM
PUS, stated that the referendum
came about because the Student
Association "felt it had no tan
gible powers."
Campus editor Jeffrey Dwor
kin said that the governing body
had been limited to determining
the distribution of student ac
tivities fees, and that even this
process involved possible veto by
the school's director of student
activities.
According to Dworkin, the
Midlebury administration is con
sidering holding an election to
reconstitute a student governing
group. Meanwhile, the Fresh
man Class Council is contem
plating self-dissolution because
of its lack of power.
Middlebury Dean of Men Den

nis O'Brien said he considered
the referendum a "neutral act"
which "can be interpreted in
many different ways."

Commented O'Brien, "Either
(the results) mean that the stu
dents consider student govern
ment trivial and it should be
gotten rid of, or they feel that
student government is very im
port a nt and it should be
strengthened."
The Vermont school's director
of student activities, Lynn Hin
man, said he was "not sure that
the students understand the
practical inconveniences that
this is going to mean." Hinman
stated that there were "certain
housekeeping functions that
must be performed," and that
it was unclear as to how these
tasks would be handled.
