# Pre-Reg To Promote Small Group Activity
## 
### 
Next year's Freshman Class will
not be herded into Tresidder for the
traditional Jolly Up dance.
The 1967 Pre-Registration Commit
tee has decided to abandon the usual
Saturday night mixer in their attempt
to rennovate Freshman orientation
week. Programs next year, according
to co-chairman Pete Haas, will be
aimed at integrating incoming stu
dents, quelling their anxieties and
familiarizing them with the oppor
tunities available in the Stanford com
munity.
"Eliminating the dance is perhaps
the biggest change in the Pre-Reg
schedule," said co-chairman Sandy
Shapiro. "We felt, as many of the
past committees did, that the dance
placed unnecessary emphasis on the
infamous ratio, encouraged upper
classmen to attempt to lure Fresh
men girls to fraternity parties, and
did not provide an atmosphere con
dusive to relaxed mixing."
Evening at Tresidder
Instead of the dance, the Pre-Reg
Committee is planning an "Evening
At Tresidder" during which many
small and large group activities will
be going on simultaneously. Haas ex
plained that jazz artist Jon Hendricks
may be the main feature of the eve
ning. He will present an informal
performance and then lead a discus
sion about modern jazz.
In addition the committee plans to
set up a gambling casino, a "sensory
awareness" room, jig saw puzzles, a
display on the Bay Area, experimental
films, music listening room, folk danc
ing and singing, and some entertain
ment in the Union coffee house, Mem
What. Miss Shapiro added that the
program committee was trying to ob
tain the Bell Telephone Hour's color
film about San Francisco which was
televised last month.
The "Evening at Tresidder" pro
gram, according to Haas, will be one
way to break the Freshmen into
smaller groups. He explained that this
"dividing process" is perhaps the best
way to alleviate the depersonalization
caused by the large class enrollment.
"Whenever possible during the
week," Haas said, "we will try to
encourage small-group discussions,
lectures, hostels, picnics with upper
classmen, and similar activities. We're
planning a number of optional
speeches with discussions to follow to
expose Freshmen to the academic side

of the University and challenge them
to begin thinking about the various
scholastic disciplines."
The faculty hostel program begun
last year will be expanded this year.
Miss Shapiro said that the committee
will try to arrange for every Fresh
man to visit a faculty home following
a symposium to be led by Dean of
the Chapel B. Davie Napier.
More Counseling
One of the most common com
plaints of past freshmen concerns the
small amount of time allotted to coun
selling during Pre-Reg, Hass noted.
Next fall a special orientation pro
gram will be added to the schedule
to explain to Freshmen the basic
General Studies Requirements and the
Overseas Campuses Program. These
explanations will take place in several
Freshmen living groups prior to meet
ings with General Studies advisors.
"Much of a student's attitude to
ward Stanford and his class is de
termined during his first week on
campus," summarized Miss Shapiro.
"We're trying this year to introduce
Freshmen to the cultural, academic,
and social opportunities here without
turning the week into Camp Granada
revisited."

More Counseling
One of the most common com
plaints of past freshmen concerns the
small amount of time allotted to coun
selling during Pre-Reg, Hass noted.
Next fall a special orientation pro
gram will be added to the schedule
to explain to Freshmen the basic
General Studies Requirements and the
Overseas Campuses Program. These
explanations will take place in several
Freshmen living groups prior to meet
ings with General Studies advisors.
"Much of a student's attitude to
ward Stanford and his class is de
termined during his first week on
campus," summarized Miss Shapiro.
"We're trying this year to introduce
Freshmen to the cultural, academic,
and social opportunities here without
turning the week into Camp Granada
revisited."
Next year's Freshman Class will
not be herded into Tresidder for the
traditional Jolly Up dance.
The 1967 Pre-Registration Commit
tee has decided to abandon the usual
Saturday night mixer in their attempt
to rennovate Freshman orientation
week. Programs next year, according
to co-chairman Pete Haas, will be
aimed at integrating incoming stu
dents, quelling their anxieties and
familiarizing them with the oppor
tunities available in the Stanford com
munity.
"Eliminating the dance is perhaps
the biggest change in the Pre-Reg
schedule," said co-chairman Sandy
Shapiro. "We felt, as many of the
past committees did, that the dance
placed unnecessary emphasis on the
infamous ratio, encouraged upper
classmen to attempt to lure Fresh
men girls to fraternity parties, and
did not provide an atmosphere con
dusive to relaxed mixing."
Evening at Tresidder
Instead of the dance, the Pre-Reg
Committee is planning an "Evening
At Tresidder" during which many
small and large group activities will
be going on simultaneously. Haas ex
plained that jazz artist Jon Hendricks
may be the main feature of the eve
ning. He will present an informal
performance and then lead a discus
sion about modern jazz.
In addition the committee plans to
set up a gambling casino, a "sensory
awareness" room, jig saw puzzles, a
display on the Bay Area, experimental
films, music listening room, folk danc
ing and singing, and some entertain
ment in the Union coffee house, Mem
What. Miss Shapiro added that the
program committee was trying to ob
tain the Bell Telephone Hour's color
film about San Francisco which was
televised last month.
The "Evening at Tresidder" pro
gram, according to Haas, will be one
way to break the Freshmen into
smaller groups. He explained that this
"dividing process" is perhaps the best
way to alleviate the depersonalization
caused by the large class enrollment.
"Whenever possible during the
week," Haas said, "we will try to
encourage small-group discussions,
lectures, hostels, picnics with upper
classmen, and similar activities. We're
planning a number of optional
speeches with discussions to follow to
expose Freshmen to the academic side

of the University and challenge them
to begin thinking about the various
scholastic disciplines."
The faculty hostel program begun
last year will be expanded this year.
Miss Shapiro said that the committee
will try to arrange for every Fresh
man to visit a faculty home following
a symposium to be led by Dean of
the Chapel B. Davie Napier.
