# Wis. Law Men Try To Enact Morality
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” The Wisconsin state
legislature has threatened budg
etary punishment of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin unless the
school's administration exerts
more control over the "moral
climate" of the university.
Reacting to a violent student
demonstration coupled with
three "immoral" articles printed
in the student newspaper, legis
lators have passed a resolution
calling for University President
Fred H. Harrington to conduct
a study of the school.
J. Curtis McKay, majority
floor leader of the Assembly,
said that state legislators feel
that Wisconsin administrators
have no real authority or con
trol over students and faculty
on the Madison campus.
He said that if "some broad
guidelines set up by the legisla
ture" to regulate and define uni
versity policy are not made, "the
university operating budget will
be cut."
The state assembly's resolu
tion was seen as a reaction to
articles printed in the student
newspaper, The Daily Cardinal,
which caused one state assem
blyman to comment, "From
what I've been reading they
have no moral standards."
The Cardinal printed a movie
review which used a four-letter
word several times. According
to a former staffer on The Car
dinal, the review was "lousy,"
but the editor decided that the
word was necessary for the
critique, r
Several legislators complained
about an article reviewing the
book, Human Sexual Response,
by Dr. William Masters. One
student said that the article was
"very frank" in telling "exactly"
what Masters wrote. This arti
cle, coupled with an editorial
advocating the legalization of
marijuana, triggered the Assem
bly to threaten a university
budget cut.
Said state Assemblyman Paul
Alfonsi, "We don't feel the kind
of tripe they printed was the
kind of tripe students should
read."

Alfonsi stated that recent stu
dent demonstrations protesting
Dow Chemical Company recruit
ers on campus were "just toe
much for the cooks to stomach.'
The demonstration caused a
state-wide uproar when 17 stu
dents were arrested for occupy
ing a building where the Dow
recruiters were interviewing stu
dents.
The Wisconsin chapter of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS) which organized the dem
onstration, was subsequently
banned from campus by the Stu
dent Life and Interests Commit
tee (SLIC), composed of stu
dents and faculty.
