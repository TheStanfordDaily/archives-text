# Two Boxers Win Titles
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Though represented by only
three members, the Stanford
boxing team walked away with
two championships and an over
all second place finish in the
CCBC Boving Championships
held at Chico State College at
the end of last quarter.
Chico State College won the
team championship in this meet
that featured all four schools in
the country that still compete
in intercollegiate boxing.
Two National Champions
Thus the tourney could sym
bolize a national championship
for Stanford's Dave Oswald, box
ing the heavyweight division,
and Tom Jenks at 172. Jenks, a
junior, was defending the title
he won last year as a sopho
more.
Stanford's Jim Marlar made it
to the finals of the tourney be
fore losing to the defending
champion at 156, Mike Schellin
of Nevada.
Stanford's two victories placed
the Indians in a three-way sec
ond place tie with California and
Nevada, leaving only the con
sideration of what might have
happened had other top Stanford
boxers been entered in the meet.
Bill Thomas, 147, John Price,
165, Dave Hibbitts, 139, and Mike
Palmer, 180, were not entered
due to injuries and other con
flicts.
Marlar In Opening Win
Stanford's first win of the
tourney came when Marlar
soundly defeated Jim Ishida of
Chico State in the opening
night's action at 156.
In his semi-final bout, Jenks
defeated Cal's Bill Neyland, win
ning a close but decisive deci
sion.
Oswald got the shortest work
out of any of the Stanford box
ers ending his bout after one
minute of the first round.
A one-two combination rocked
Chico's Rich Penaluna and a
right hand shot ended it all.
Finals Excitement
The second night's tourney ac
tion saw a packed house in the
Chico gymnasium and three
Stanford boxers in the finals.
Captain Marlar was the first
up for Stanford and his toe-to
toe battle with Schellin had the
spectators up the entire bout.

Though he lost the match in
the end, Marlar fought a game
fight and almost stopped Schel
lin with a cut eye in the second
round.
Jenks left little question in
anyone's mind as to who was to
wear the 172 pound crown. He
dropped Steve Byers of Chico
to the mat for an eight count
after one minute of the first
round-
Byers was up only to run into
a right hand bomb, the most
devastating single punch thrown
in the tournament. There was
no need for a referees count.
In the Heavyweight final it
was Stanford's gargantuan Dave
Oswald on the chase throughout
the bout with Gary Silverman
of Nevada.
Oswald, undefeated in his two
years for Stanford, piled up
points to win an easy decision.
"One of Best"
Stanford Coach Ray Lunny,
in his twentieth year of coach
ing at Stanford, called this year's
team "One of the best I've had."
The team won all duel meets,
in terms of total victories, but
for the Cal duals. Forfeiting four
matches the team dropped a 5-4
decision to Chico earlier in the
season, but soundly defeated ex
champion Nevada, 6%4 x k, for
the season's highlight.
