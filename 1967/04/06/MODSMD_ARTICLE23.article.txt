Hitting, pitching and fielding
—all you need for a good base
ball team. Stanford boast statis
tics In these areas which are
more awesome than Lew Alcin
dor stuffing a basketball.
The Tribe baseball express
which took a successful 5-0
swing Into Southern California
during spring break is back on
campus and ready to challenge
the best.
Friday afternoon at 2:30 the
Indians play the American
League's California Angels in
the Sunken Diamond. Whether
they'll be awed remains to be
seen.
Saturday, the Tribe faces Air
Force in a doubleheader.
The Tribe's statistics bear out
its 13-1 record. They fattened
them in San Diego against the
San Diego Marines three times,
San Diego State once, and Cal
Poly of San Luis Obispo once
for the five wins during the vaca
tion.
Big Guns
The big guns for the Indians
are two sophomores — Ron
Shotts and Mark Marquess.
They lead a team hitting .281 as
a whole.
Shotts, who plays right field,
is hitting .452 and has knocked
in nine runs, is second on
the team. Marquess has explod
ed lately and despite a slow
start is now hitting .448.
Marquess has scored 10 runs
on only 29 at bats and has come
through with several crucial hits
to earn himself the reputation of
clutch player.
The Indians aren't a two man

team however. There are three
other regulars hitting over .400
and two other starters hitting
.300 plus.
And hitting isn't the only
thing Stanford has, either. The
pitching staff has a combined
record of 13-1 and an overall
ERA of 1.09.
Sandy Vance, Don Rose, and
Daro Quiring have done most
of the Tribe's pitching throwing
85 of 124 innings. The Indians
also have big league depth,
and Coach Dutch Fehring plans
to pitch Quiring for the first
two innings against the Angels,

and then throw a different pitch
er each inning after that.
Afield Stanford has left op
posing coaches despairingly en
vious. Second baseman Dick
Swan, who is also hitting .400,
has handled the ball 55 times
without an error.
At first base, where Marquess
and Marty Erck are fighting for
a position, there have been no
errors in 142 chances.
These two, along with third
baseman Bob Boone, shortstop
Frank Duffy and catcher Mike
Schomaker form for the Tribe a
practically air-tight infield.
