# Eight Indians Swim For Pan-Am Berths
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Several members of Stanford's
NCAA champion swimming
team seek berths on the 1967
Pan American Games team at
the Indor AAU National Cham
pionships at SMU's pool in Dal
las today through Saturday.
Most of the Indian swimmers
will compete for their summer
allegiance, the all-powerful San
ta Clara Swim Club.
Greg Buckingham, Dick Roth,
Luis Nicolao, Mike Wall, Bob
Momsen, Bill Meyer, and Pete
Siebert will be shooting for the
coveted Pan Am position while
they are scoring points for San
ta Clara.
Freshman butterflier Jim
Nickoloff will swim for the Los
Angeles Athletic Club.
SU Frosh Third
Last year, the Stanford frosh
went to the nationals as a team
and brought back third place.
USC won the meet.
In the AAU's, unlike the
NCAA's, one team can enter any
number of relays in a certain
race. Points are scored only

through eighth place. Santa
Clara is likely to place three re
lay teams in the top eight, and
this A-B-C punch is hard to beat.
Buckingham, who holds 3
American records and one world
record, will concentrate on the
200 and 500 freestyle. Dick Roth,
world record holder for 400 me
ters individual medley, aims to
retain his control over the 200
and 400 IM.
Wall Guns For 1650
Wall's best chance for the Pan
Am team lies in the 1650, and
Momsen will rest his case on the
200 breaststroke. Siebort hopes
to go with Roth in the two In
dividual medleys. Meyer is
shooting for the 100 freestyle
and the relays.
Nickoloff hopes to prove him
self in the 200 butterfly.
The meet will be televised
over ABC's "Wide World of
Sports" this Sunday afternoon.
Since the Pan Am games will
bo held in Winnipeg before the
US summer nationals, the in
door national championships
will be used as the trials.


The swimming team's manager Wells Shoemaker is shown above relaxing after the NCAA's in
Michigan. The team celebrated its championship by tossing Shoemaker, who gave rubdowns
all season long, into the pool. Shoemaker is covering the AAU meet in Dallas for the Daily
this weekend.
