# Credit Where Due
## 
### 
The Committee on Residential Policy of the
Study of Education deserves to be commended
for its endorsement of a modified version of the
Wilbur Experiment for next year. The plan it
has suggested is every bit as good as the one
originally proposed by the ASSU Housing
cut Commission, except, unfortunately, that its
scope has been cut approximately in half. It
calls for three coeducational and integrated
houses in Wilbur, instead of the eight suggested
in the original Wilbur Experiment, as well as
other revisions necessary to accommodate the
freshmen who would have normally been in
Wilbur.
The SES Steering Committee, desiring more
information on the purposes of the experiment,
took no action on the proposal at its Tuesday

meeting, but indications are that it will prob
ably give its approval before the next meeting.
We certainly hope so.
Perhaps the most significant aspect of the
residence committee's recommendation is that
it involves approval of a project which was con
ceived by a student-faculty committee set up
by the ASSU under David Harris, and, there
fore, ultimate passage of the modified Wilbur
Experiment, if it does occur, will above all be
a credit to this group.
This reaffirms the fact that if educational in
novation is to take hold in this University, it
will be the result of student and faculty con
cern, rather than the product of the myriads of
administrators in Inner Quad.
