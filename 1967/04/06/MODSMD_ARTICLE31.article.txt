## What Degree Of Stanford Involvement? 
### Kirk Hanson 
Yesterday's editorial entitled
"Myths Exposed" betrays a veil
ed concern not so much over a
myth about the President's role,
but over the stands the Presi
dent takes or the author feels he
is taking.
President Sterling has never
promised he will express him
self only on education at Stan
ford. He has informally said he

prefers not to take stands on
major issues not directly related
to education at Stanford, but
this hardly constitutes a myth
contradicted every time the
President participates in an or
ganization or expresses an opin
ion of his own.
No Isolation
What it means to take a stand
is lost in the polemics of the edi

torial. To live in the United
States or to remain an American
citizen is to opt for American
government over that of the So
viet Union or England. It is to
take a stand in one sense. We
could hardly ask Stanford's
President to isolate himself in
Building 10 and fear to drink
water, an action by which he
would obviously be supporting

flouridation.
But when does • involvement
constitute a "stand," and more
important, when will such a
stand be interpreted as the of
ficial position of Stanford Uni
versity? Most intelligent people
realize that the individual has
the right to take a stand and
that statements of Wallace Ster
ling are his own, unless they are

reflected in the concrete policy
of the University.
However, society often does
interpret statements by elected
or appointed officials as policy
of the organization, and so the
official must decide when such
statements become "stands" that
will be misinterpreted by the
people.
More Complex
Yesterday's editorial has made
the decision for President Ster
ling that his involvement with
the Asia Foundation does reflect
the official position of Stanford
University in the eyes of society.
But CIA financing, as Gabriel
Almond pointed out yesterday in
a letter to The Daily, is "a com
plex issue."
The involvement by the CIA
in the Asia Foundation can hard
ly be seen as Stanford's endorse
ment of CIA control of private
organizations. It is questionable
that this involvement can imply
that even President Sterling en
dorses the CIA financing. The
issue hardly has the simplified
nature the editorial ascribes to it.
President Sterling obviously
felt that his involvement would
not commit Stanford in any way,
and so he did not feel he had to
free himself of this association.
He did not take a stand in viola
tion of a commitment to abstain
from taking any stands. Such
a violation and myth is present
only in the spirit of yesterday's
editorial.

this hardly constitutes a myth
contradicted every time the
President participates in an or
ganization or expresses an opin
ion of his own.
No Isolation
What it means to take a stand
is lost in the polemics of the edi

torial. To live in the United
States or to remain an American
citizen is to opt for American
government over that of the So
viet Union or England. It is to
take a stand in one sense. We
could hardly ask Stanford's
President to isolate himself in
Building 10 and fear to drink
water, an action by which he
would obviously be supporting

flouridation.
But when does • involvement
constitute a "stand," and more
important, when will such a
stand be interpreted as the of
ficial position of Stanford Uni
versity? Most intelligent people
realize that the individual has
the right to take a stand and
that statements of Wallace Ster
ling are his own, unless they are

reflected in the concrete policy
of the University.
However, society often does
interpret statements by elected
or appointed officials as policy
of the organization, and so the
official must decide when such
statements become "stands" that
will be misinterpreted by the
people.
More Complex
Yesterday's editorial has made
the decision for President Ster
ling that his involvement with
the Asia Foundation does reflect
the official position of Stanford
University in the eyes of society.
But CIA financing, as Gabriel
Almond pointed out yesterday in
a letter to The Daily, is "a com
plex issue."
The involvement by the CIA
in the Asia Foundation can hard
ly be seen as Stanford's endorse
ment of CIA control of private
organizations. It is questionable
that this involvement can imply
that even President Sterling en
dorses the CIA financing. The
issue hardly has the simplified
nature the editorial ascribes to it.
President Sterling obviously
felt that his involvement would
not commit Stanford in any way,
and so he did not feel he had to
free himself of this association.
He did not take a stand in viola
tion of a commitment to abstain
from taking any stands. Such
a violation and myth is present
only in the spirit of yesterday's
editorial.
Yesterday's editorial entitled
"Myths Exposed" betrays a veil
ed concern not so much over a
myth about the President's role,
but over the stands the Presi
dent takes or the author feels he
is taking.
President Sterling has never
promised he will express him
self only on education at Stan
ford. He has informally said he

prefers not to take stands on
major issues not directly related
to education at Stanford, but
this hardly constitutes a myth
contradicted every time the
President participates in an or
ganization or expresses an opin
ion of his own.
