# The 						Capitol Scene
## Blimey, Mates, Stop Bombing! 
### Art Buchwald 
It has not been publicized but
a very highly emotional scene
took place last week between
British Prime Minister Harold
Wilson and a Member of Par
liament.
The dispute was over Wilson's
decision to bomb the Torrey
Canyon, the wrecked tanker that
was hung up on a reef off
Land's End.
The M.P. had come out against
the bombing and was called into
Wilson's office for a serious
chowing out. Wilson angrily told
the M.P. that his speech about
suspending the bombing of the
Torrey Canyon had given aid
and comfort to the oil that was
still left in the stricken ship.
The M.P. retorted that on the
contrary, by bombing the tank
er, the prime minister was
spreading the oil rather than
containing it, and he was invit
ing wider and wider slicks all
the time.
No Other Option
The prime minister told the
M.P. that he had done every
thing possible to find some oth
er solution to the tanker prob
lem, but the oil wasn't respond
ing. The prime minister said he
was willing to stop the bombing
if the oil in the tanker stopped

infiltrating the beaches and
coastline.
Wilson pointed out that he did
not put the tanker on the reef,
and if he had his choice he
might never have put it there.
But since it was there he had
no option but to bomb it.
The prime minister produced
a poll showing that 85 percent
of all the British people support
ed him in his war against the
oil and many called for heavier
air raids rather than a lessening
of the bombing strikes.
The M.P. accused the prime
minister of upping the terms for
finding a peaceful settlement to
the oil slicks.
Brings Escalation
Wilson retorted that he held
off on the bombing for one full
week, and the broken tanker
used the time to put more oil on
the beaches. He is said to have
told the M.P., "I used every de
tergent I could think of, but it
did not good. The only thing the
oil responds to is napalm."
The M.P. said that the bomb
ing, rather than weakening the
oil slicks, has strengthened
them, and the more the RAF
bombed the tanker the more the
oil escalated and polluted the
beaches.

The prime minister, livid with
rage, said that the oil was kill
ing British birds and fishes and
it had to be taught a lesson.
"Any time the oil wants to stop
heading for shore, we'll stop the
bombing."
Threat Spreads
The M.P. said that the Royal
Air Force had an insatiable ap
petite and after it got finished
bombing the Torrey Canyon it
would demand other targets to
bomb, including the refineries
where the oil was being shipped.
Wilson said that as long as he
was prime minister he would
only permit the bombing of
tankers hung up on reefs.

The M.P. wanted to know it it
was true that the prime minis
ter intended to mine Cornwall
Harbor.
"I must be allowed to keep all
my options open," Wilson re
plied.
The prime minister also told
the M.P. if he persisted in his
attacks on the bombing, the
M.P.'s political career would be
finished in six months.
The M.P. denied a Time maga
zine story that he called the
prime minister any names.
Asked by reporters if he would
oppose the prime minister in the
1968 elections, the M.P. replied,
"It's too oily to say."

The prime minister also told
the M.P. if he persisted in his
attacks on the bombing, the
M.P.'s political career would be
finished in six months.
The M.P. denied a Time maga
zine story that he called the
prime minister any names.
Asked by reporters if he would
oppose the prime minister in the
1968 elections, the M.P. replied,
"It's too oily to say."
It has not been publicized but
a very highly emotional scene
took place last week between
British Prime Minister Harold
Wilson and a Member of Par
liament.
The dispute was over Wilson's
decision to bomb the Torrey
Canyon, the wrecked tanker that
was hung up on a reef off
Land's End.
The M.P. had come out against
the bombing and was called into
Wilson's office for a serious
chowing out. Wilson angrily told
the M.P. that his speech about
suspending the bombing of the
Torrey Canyon had given aid
and comfort to the oil that was
still left in the stricken ship.
The M.P. retorted that on the
contrary, by bombing the tank
er, the prime minister was
spreading the oil rather than
containing it, and he was invit
ing wider and wider slicks all
the time.
No Other Option
The prime minister told the
M.P. that he had done every
thing possible to find some oth
er solution to the tanker prob
lem, but the oil wasn't respond
ing. The prime minister said he
was willing to stop the bombing
if the oil in the tanker stopped

infiltrating the beaches and
coastline.
Wilson pointed out that he did
not put the tanker on the reef,
and if he had his choice he
might never have put it there.
But since it was there he had
no option but to bomb it.
The prime minister produced
a poll showing that 85 percent
of all the British people support
ed him in his war against the
oil and many called for heavier
air raids rather than a lessening
of the bombing strikes.
The M.P. accused the prime
minister of upping the terms for
finding a peaceful settlement to
the oil slicks.
Brings Escalation
Wilson retorted that he held
off on the bombing for one full
week, and the broken tanker
used the time to put more oil on
the beaches. He is said to have
told the M.P., "I used every de
tergent I could think of, but it
did not good. The only thing the
oil responds to is napalm."
The M.P. said that the bomb
ing, rather than weakening the
oil slicks, has strengthened
them, and the more the RAF
bombed the tanker the more the
oil escalated and polluted the
beaches.

The prime minister, livid with
rage, said that the oil was kill
ing British birds and fishes and
it had to be taught a lesson.
"Any time the oil wants to stop
heading for shore, we'll stop the
bombing."
Threat Spreads
The M.P. said that the Royal
Air Force had an insatiable ap
petite and after it got finished
bombing the Torrey Canyon it
would demand other targets to
bomb, including the refineries
where the oil was being shipped.
Wilson said that as long as he
was prime minister he would
only permit the bombing of
tankers hung up on reefs.

The M.P. wanted to know it it
was true that the prime minis
ter intended to mine Cornwall
Harbor.
"I must be allowed to keep all
my options open," Wilson re
plied.
