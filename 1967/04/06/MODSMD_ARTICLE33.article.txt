## SRT Resignations Cloud The Real Issue 
### Robert E. Stone 
It is not often that a colum
nist takes his editor to task. The
hazards of such a course can
well be disastrous, but in refer
ence to "The Proverbial Maze"
(The Daily, April 4) the record
should be set straight.
Everything said in that edito
rial is basically true. The things
that are not said, however, are
the things that we should be

worrying about. There is no
question that giving the Stan
ford Repertory Theater autono
my from the administrative
processes of the University will
make it easier for SRT to op
erate. The question that must
be answered is, "What other re
sults can be expected from such
a move?"
The basic issue in the current

controversy is not the artistic
content or method of instruction
that SRT employs in its show
and its courses. The candidates
for the Master of Fine Arts de
gree do enough grumbling about
these areas to make it unneces
sary to discuss them here. The
basic issue that must be resolved
is scheduling of Memorial Audi
torium.
At the moment there are four
organizations that would like
more time In Mem Aud than
they are getting; SRT, Ram's
Head, the ASSU Concert Com
mission, and the Committee on
Public Exercises. While schedu
ling of Memorial Auditorium is
hypothetically handled by the
Committee on Public Exercises,
the attitudes and positions of
some administrators, notably
Provost Lyman, have in effect
given control of Mem Aud to
SRT and made it necessary for
other groups to schedule their
activities around the schedule
handed down by SRT.
This is not the place to get
into an argument about the
right to use Mem Aud or which
organization offers the most to
the University community. It is,
however, important to point out
that the Administration has been
more than fair in its relations
with SRT, a condition that has
caused serious rumblings among
the other groups.
Solutions
There are three solutions to
the problem. The first is to get
rid of SRT, a decision that would
cause little weeping among
groups who must compete with
it, and would save the Univer
sity tens of thousands of dollars
a year. The second is to elimi
nate all the other groups who
seek time and space in Mem
Aud, a decision which would
cause little weeping by SRT.
The third is to proceed as rapid
ly as possible with the construc
tion of a new theater.
Current University plans call
for a new theater sometime af
ter 1970. Officials point out, how
ever, that the new pavilion will
be completed within the next
three years, and add that cer
tain performances could be put
on there. You cannot, however,
ask a visiting dignitary to speak
in a sweat-stained hall.
Until a new theater is built
for SRT, it would be foolish,
perhaps even dangerous, to give
them greater autonomy than
they now have. For anything at
all to take place in Mem Aud, a
spirit of co-operation must be
maintained, a spirit that could
not exist with only one man
making the decisions. Perhaps
it might be wiser to seek ways
to solve the scheduling problems
that exist in Mem Aud now,
than to complain because one
group out of four has to share
space with the others.

the problem. The first is to get
rid of SRT, a decision that would
cause little weeping among
groups who must compete with
it, and would save the Univer
sity tens of thousands of dollars
a year. The second is to elimi
nate all the other groups who
seek time and space in Mem
Aud, a decision which would
cause little weeping by SRT.
The third is to proceed as rapid
ly as possible with the construc
tion of a new theater.
Current University plans call
for a new theater sometime af
ter 1970. Officials point out, how
ever, that the new pavilion will
be completed within the next
three years, and add that cer
tain performances could be put
on there. You cannot, however,
ask a visiting dignitary to speak
in a sweat-stained hall.
Until a new theater is built
for SRT, it would be foolish,
perhaps even dangerous, to give
them greater autonomy than
they now have. For anything at
all to take place in Mem Aud, a
spirit of co-operation must be
maintained, a spirit that could
not exist with only one man
making the decisions. Perhaps
it might be wiser to seek ways
to solve the scheduling problems
that exist in Mem Aud now,
than to complain because one
group out of four has to share
space with the others.
It is not often that a colum
nist takes his editor to task. The
hazards of such a course can
well be disastrous, but in refer
ence to "The Proverbial Maze"
(The Daily, April 4) the record
should be set straight.
Everything said in that edito
rial is basically true. The things
that are not said, however, are
the things that we should be

worrying about. There is no
question that giving the Stan
ford Repertory Theater autono
my from the administrative
processes of the University will
make it easier for SRT to op
erate. The question that must
be answered is, "What other re
sults can be expected from such
a move?"
The basic issue in the current

controversy is not the artistic
content or method of instruction
that SRT employs in its show
and its courses. The candidates
for the Master of Fine Arts de
gree do enough grumbling about
these areas to make it unneces
sary to discuss them here. The
basic issue that must be resolved
is scheduling of Memorial Audi
torium.
At the moment there are four
organizations that would like
more time In Mem Aud than
they are getting; SRT, Ram's
Head, the ASSU Concert Com
mission, and the Committee on
Public Exercises. While schedu
ling of Memorial Auditorium is
hypothetically handled by the
Committee on Public Exercises,
the attitudes and positions of
some administrators, notably
Provost Lyman, have in effect
given control of Mem Aud to
SRT and made it necessary for
other groups to schedule their
activities around the schedule
handed down by SRT.
This is not the place to get
into an argument about the
right to use Mem Aud or which
organization offers the most to
the University community. It is,
however, important to point out
that the Administration has been
more than fair in its relations
with SRT, a condition that has
caused serious rumblings among
the other groups.
Solutions
There are three solutions to
the problem. The first is to get
rid of SRT, a decision that would
cause little weeping among
groups who must compete with
it, and would save the Univer
sity tens of thousands of dollars
a year. The second is to elimi
