# Ed And Biz Schools Work With People
## 
### 
Education and community service
aims are combined in programs of
Stanford's Law School and Graduate
School of Business.
The Business School joins forces
with the Peace Corps and Peruvian
agencies to assist development of
small business and management in
Peru. The new venture, first of its
kind undertaken by the Peace Corps,
will be supported by a $150,000 con
tract with the Business School.
The Law School currently conducts
a program in East Menlo Park for
the study of legal problems of the
poor. The program, which links the
classroom and neighborhood legal of
fice, has recently been awarded a
grant of over $45,000 from the Asso
ciation of American Law Schools. The
grant covers a three-year period
through December, 1969.
Second and third-year law students
can participate in the program in con
nection with a seminar taught by
Prof. Jack Friedffnthal of the Law
School.
Prof. Friedenthal is assisted by a

teaching fellow, Roy J. Schmidt, who
graduated from Stanford Law School
in 1966 and is a member of the Cali
fornia Bar. Schmidt supervises the
students in addition to his own work
with legal aid cases.
"The teaching fellow who will suc
ceed Schmidt will be drawn from the
students in the current seminar," said
Friedenthal. "Hopefully this pattern
will repeat itself each year."
The program is run in co-operation
with San Mateo County Legal Aid So
ciety and the federal Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity. Directors of the
Legal Aid Society enthusiastically en
dorsed the program," said Frieden
thal. "Simon Rosenthal, the Society's
executive director and Thelton Hend
erson, chief attorney of the East Men
lo Park office, worked closely with
the Law School in devising program
details," he said.
Robert Fastov is president of the
Law School's Legal Aid Society, and
Richard Kuhns is chairman of the
East Palo Alto student group.
Stanford's Business School pro
gram, in conjunction with the Peace

Corps, will work in Peru "to promote
a healthy, viable competitive small
business sector, or aid in the forma
tion and operation of producing, mar
keting or consumer cooperatives, ac
cording to Prof. Frank Shallenberger,
who will supervise the program.
Prof. Shallenberger, who teaches
production and small business man
agement, will be assisted with the pro
gram by Bob Roberts. Roberts gradu
ated from Stanford in political science
in 1960 and earned a master's degree
in business administration from Co
lumbia University. He served with
the Peace Corps in Peru from 1962 to
1964 and until last year was regional
director for the Peace Corps in Bo
livia.
Present plans call for 30 volunteers,
10 of whom are married. Wives will
work in ongoing programs in the
areas where their husbands will be
located.
Before going to Peru, the volun
teers will live with Spanish-speaking
families and work with Mexican-
American businessmen in Santa Clara

County in the same manner they will
in Peru.
Peru is the home of the Graduate
School of Business' overseas venture,
ESAN (La Escuela de Administracion
de Negorios para Graduados), the
Peruvian Graduate School of Business
in Lima.
Volunteers for the new program
will stay with ESAN in Lima for four
weeks after their eight weeks' train
ing at Stanford between July 6 and
August 31.
To quality for the program, candi
dates should have a master's degree in
business administration or a graduate
degree in industrial engineering. Man
agement experience and knowledge of
Spanish is desirable.
But education requirements are
flexible. Candidates who have com
pleted one year of work toward the
MBA or who hold an AB degree in
business or industrial engineering and
have five years of business experience
are also welcome. Anyone with out
standing personal and experience
qualifications may apply.
