# NBC Series To Present John Hawkes' 'Questions'
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
As part of its series Experiment in
Television, NBC will present "The
Questions," a one-act play by novelist
John Hawkes, on Sunday, April 9 at
4 p.m.
The world premiere of the play took
place in early January of last year
when the Stanford Repertory Theater
presented it in conjunction with
lonesco's "The Chairs."
Robert Loper, producing director of
the theater and director for the play,
described it as having "many qualities
which mark Hawkes' best novels."
These qualities, according to Loper,
include "a frightened sense of reality
which is made ambiguous by dream
elements, a rare combination of gen
tleness and violence, and a clarity and
directness of statement that gives his
strange world an abrupt immediacy."
In a review of his collection of his
four plays, The Innocent Party (Four
Short Plays), Newsweek said of "The
Questions": "A young girl fights to
salvage her blighted innocence while
her analyst attempts her psychologi
cal rape."
"A few of the critical reactions to

the Stanford production," Hawkes
said, seemed to question whether this
is a play."
"It seems to me that the piece has
decided action in that the man tries
to win the girl's love and force her to
acknowledge her father. In the pro
cess he tries to force her to face up to
reality, or what he fancies to be
reality."
"I see the man as either her father
or as functioning as her father. How
ever, some people didn't seem to see
this father relationship."
Hawke's added that he "purposedly
left the description of the man
vague so that it could be portrayed in
a number of different ways."
Hawkes describes the girl's role as
"trying to win the man's love, and, of
course, to defend her father."
The television version of the play
will be about fifty minutes long as op
posed to the approximately hour and
ton minutes that it took for the Stan
ford Repertory Theater's production.
Hawkes participated in all the edit
ing of the script, but, as yet, has not
seen the production. He feels, "The
pace must be much quicker. And I
think generally it is a better play."

Throe of his novel's, The Cannibal,
The Lime Twig Tree and Second Skin,
have established Hawke's as one of
America's most original fiction writ
ers. But it is only recent reaction to
his short plays that has identified him
as "one of America's most significant
avant-garde dramatists."
After finishing his year as a Voice
Project instructor here at Stanford,
Hawkes intends to take the year off
before returning to Brown University.
"If I have some more time after work
ing on my fiction, I would like to
write a longer play.
