"Damn Yankees" will massage them like no TV show ever
has. The music from this all-time Broadway smash has
been completely rescored, arranged for a great new sound.
The visual techniques take the step beyond "pop" and
"op." It's the kind of innovation you associate with GE
and that's why we're part of it. That's why we're putting
"Damn Yankees" on the air. Don't miss it.
