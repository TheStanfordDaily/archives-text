I WHAT IS A HONDA GUARANTEED BUY BACK PLAN? I
House of Honda's exclusive guaranteed buy back plan makes it impossible for you to buy a
new Honda and not be able to sell it when you are ready. How does it work?
We certify in writing we will repurchase any new Honda purchased from us regardless of age. Repurchase price shall
iy; be at the AVERAGE RETAIL price listed in the Jones Motorcycle and scooter Blue Book for the year of Buy-Back. Re
hd purchase will be at average retail price. Average retail priceis the price paid for a Honda which is ready to be resold im
mediately without reconditioning or adding of new parts to replace old or damaged ones. We reserve the right to de
duct the costs of parts and labor to bring your Buy-Back Honda back to top resale condition.
How can you go wrong!

V I parking that goes with it yet be assured of selling your Honda at the end of the quarter. Hence,
p your purchase adds up to the equivalent of a "rental" coming back to you in CASH when you
need it most. We can even write short term
insurance protection for you while you
