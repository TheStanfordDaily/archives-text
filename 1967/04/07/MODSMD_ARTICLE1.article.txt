# Class Of '71 Chosen From Record Applicants
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Stanford's Admissions Office has
completed selection of next year's
freshman class and letters of accept
ance will be mailed next Friday,
April 14.
Total applications numbered 8040
this year, the highest ever, compared
to last year's 7700. To make up the
desired freshman class of 1290, accept
ances will be mailed to 1800. Rixford
K. Snyder, Director of Admissions, ex
pects 72 per cent of those accepted
to be here in September.
The 5334 men and 2706 women who
applied met a March 1 deadline for
filing. Since then only 250-300 have
'received confirmation of their ac
ceptance. Although Stanford has no
formal early acceptance program, a
number of outstanding applicants are
notified informally that they will be
admitted to the freshman class, and
that any financial need they have will
be met .
The number of applications to Stan-

ford has grown consistently in the
past ten years. In 1957 they numbered
4766 and this year hit the high of
8040. With this tremendous growth
in number of applications, what quali
ties is Stanford looking for in an
applicant?
The Admissions office presently
uses high school grades and Schol
astic Aptitude Test scores to predict
what grade point an applicant will
achieve as a freshman at Stanford.
The applicants are rated A through
E on this basis and then each is also
rated on what the Admissions Office
calls the "personal dimension," from
1 through 8. An "A-l" is the best ap
plicant and an E-8 is the least likely
to gain acceptance.
There is no set geographic distribu
tion or state quotas for choosing the
freshmen, but a consistent 50 per cent
of the class each year does come from
California. Snyder reports that the
one area Stanford seeks students is
the Deep South.

Certain groups do receive special
consideration in admissions policy.
Douglas R. Walker, Director of Fresh
man Admissions, has said that the son
or daughter of an alumnus will gain
admission in 4 out of 10 cases while
others gain admission on a 1 in 5
ratio. It is unclear whether this is
due to the superior records of sons
and daughters of alumni, or because
of favorable treatment.
The Admissions Office does discrim
inate in favor of Negroes. "We try to
get as many qualified Negroes as we
can," says Dr. Snyder, "if they can
do satisfactory work here, we don't
expect them to meet the admissions
competition."
Seven representatives of the Admis
sions Office visited schools in 40 states
to interview applicants for next fall's
class. They interview between two
thousand and three thousand students
on the road and another 3500 were
interviewed in the Admissions Office
on campus.

"Stanford is about as difficult as
any university in the country for
women's admissions," says Dr. Sny
der, "and it is among the top for
men."
Report On Class Of 1970
What will the new class be like?
No statistical survey is yet possible
on the class of 1971, but a report
recently completed by John D. Black,
Director of Counseling and Testing,
gives an indication of what Stanford's
admission policies produce. His re
port, based on a questionnaire de
veloped by the American Council on
Education given last autumn to this
year's freshman class, is presented in
April's Stanford Observer, to be dis
tributed Monday.
This year's freshman class comes
from relatively wealthy families. Over
80 per cent comes from families with
parental income of over $10,000 a year
and over 20 per cent of them from
families with incomes of over $30,000
yearly. These figures differ strikingly

from figures the same questionnaire
determined for private universities
generally. For all private universities
surveyed, just over 50 per cent come
from families of $10,000 income or
more.
Religious backgrounds also differed
considerably from national averages.
While one in five Stanford freshmen
claims no religious preference, 66 per
cent list Protestant. Both Roman
Catholic and Jewish percentages at
Satnford are lower than any norm
figures, at 14.4 per cent and 6.8 per
cent. The figures for all private uni
versities are 31.6 and 17.7 per cent.
High School Records
Over 70 per cent of the class comes
from public high schools with 27.6 per
cent from private schools. In high
school 95 per cent had a B average or
above and 39.4 per cent reported A
or A-plus averages. Almost 60 per
cent were president of one or more
student organizations in high school.
Over half won a varsity letter in a
sport and one in five edited either a

school newspaper, yearbook, or lit
erary magazine.
And what does the Class of 1970
intend to do while they are at Stan
ford and after? Dr. Black's report
shows that almost 85 per cent intend
to work for some sort of advanced
degree and 44 per cent plan to get
a doctorate. The largest group intends
to major in history or political sci
ence (15.7 per cent) and other large
groups plan to major in engineering
(9.9 per cent), mathematics (8.2 per
cent), and pre-professional (14.2 per
cent).
Asked to rate themselves on their
personal traits, the individuals In the
freshman class were particularly
high in academic ability, athletic
ability, the drive to achieve, leader
ship, mathematical ability, originality,
popularity, and modesty.
Admissions policies and criteria are
to be studied by the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford now in progress.
They will make use of this report and
other surveys of recent classes.
