# Stage And Screen

Each Friday local and San Francisco entertainment will be an
nounced and described in this column.
Here at Stanford, after quite a crisis in the administrative ranks
of the two year old Repertory Theater, the English playwright John
Osborne's "Inadmissible Evidence" is being given a 12 performance
run in the Little Theater on campus. It opened Wednesday night
to a small group of radio, T.V. and newspaper critics who had come
to see its Northern California premiere.
Eichelbaum, reviewing the SRT show in the San Francisco Ex
aminer, felt that it was 'diffuse, flat and synthetic.'
On a happier note, the American Conservatory Theater con
tinued its amazing and contagious San Francisco season with a
"Charley's Aunt" in the Marines' Memorial Theater on Wednesday
evening. The Palo Alto Times found it "an excruciatingly hilarious
production . . . virtuoso performance of the Brandon Thomas
classic." Rene Auberjonois, Tartuffe one moment, then in "End
game", "Man And Superman" and now the lead in "Charley's Aunt,"
might elicit the "dangerous word": genius.
Another ACT offering of this week is Arthur Miller's "Death Of
A Salesman," playing in the Geary Theater, San Francisco and cer
tainly worth a couple of bucks.
The farce "The Odd Couple" is around for the third time in San
Francisco. See an apparently scintillating version of the Neil Simon
comedy at the San Carlos Circle Star Theater near the metropolis.
The ever fertile Palo Alto Art Club artists will show their latest
stuff, free, at San Francisco Federal Savings Office, 2401 El Camino.
This show will last through June.
Drama plots are one thing. Politics in professional companies
are quite another. While SRT flops, the year or so old Oakland
National Repertory Theater founded by a gentleman with a name
not his own, but as long as his talent is short, Rachel von Avram,
positively collapsed. ACT, ever thoughtful, have filled the breach
with almost Shakespearean fettle.
Their übiquitous "Beyond The Fringe," which even came up to
Palo Alto's High School auditorium while we were indulging the
flesh at Tijuana over Easter, will be the salve. ACT will play
"Fringe" and collect the fringe benefits and possibly help out the
Oakland Theater. But their bell seems to have tolled.
The ambitious Hilbarn Theatre, which you can find tucked away
at Ralston and Alameda de las Pulgas, Belmont, is cashing in on
"A Man For All Seasons," Bolt's highly successful tragedy about
' the Renaissance genius Thomas More. Cashing in, because the
screen version by Fred Zinnemann has a triumphant run at the
' Mason, S.F., and 8 academy award nominations. "Marat/Sade,"
"The Bible," "Doctor Zhivago" and the rest are all in the big city
too.
The Stanford Rep. wants 'lovely girls' for their forthcoming
"Once In A Lifetime." The Kaufman and Hart Hollywood farce
will wind up the company's season later this quarter.
"Macbird": Who has not heard of the sad flutterings of this
pseudo-Shakers butterfly? But the Committee will open it at two
: special shows this evening. The thing will be reviewed in the Daily
on Monday.
Bertolt Brecht at the Playhouse: "Mother Courage and Her Chil
dren" has been adapted for the American stage by Eric Bentley,
the sole translator and commentator of Brecht who knows what
he is about. Carol Campbell will be Mother Courage, and Keith
Reagan, no relation, will also play. David Lindeman is directing,
I conspicuous last year for a "Waiting For Godot" which found ap
t* proval on this very page.
Real Shakespeare is around, but has not been treated too kindly
by the critics.
"Volpone," Ben Jonson's goody, will soon be at the San Fran
-1 cisco Playhouse, after Mother Courage has had her say against
the Nazis who hemmed in the cultured country, Switzerland, that
dared to premiere it in the war against a back cloth of Panzer
" ■ divisions in the East.
Jazz: Next Thursday, April 13, the Jon Hendricks Quartet will
start off the Tresidder Union music casual series for Spring quarter,
Tresidder large lounge at 4 p.m. We are told that Hendricks is a
singer who has close audience contact, response and tremendous
range and vitality. Tickets for the 'casual' in question are available
. at the Tresidder Box Office, IV4 bucks.
Folk Singing: That vintage Palo Alto product Joan Baez is to
• -l>iVe one performance at the Berkeley Community Theater on April
16. She too has close audience contact, but maybe not with Stanford
squares.
