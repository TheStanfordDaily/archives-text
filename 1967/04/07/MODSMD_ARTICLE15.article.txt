# Farm To Host Angels...If Gods Clear Skies
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's high flying and
much rained on Indians are hop
ing for a break in the weather
so that they can challenge the
California Angels this afternoon
at 2:30 in Sunken Diamond.
Althought the game was can
celled at noon yesterday, when
the weather cleared yesterday
afternoon the Tribe and the An
gels decided to play. If it doesn't
rain today, the contest will go
on.
Stanford's band will play the
National Anthem at the start of
the game. The band and Dollies
will also be at the track meet
this weekend.
Itigney to Start Best
Angel Manager Bill Rigney
has promised to start his first
stringers and will throw his
number one pitcher George Bru
net.
Needless to say Stanford
coach Dutch Fehring plans to

use his best. Senior Daro Quir
ing will pitch the first two in
nings. He will be followed by
seven other pitchers from the
deep Tribe staff.
Hard throwing Sandy Vance
and clever Don Rose will throw
against the Air Force Academy
in Saturday's double header
which begins at noon.
Overflow Expected
The big one is Friday, though,
and an overflow crowd of some
5,000 people is expected.
The Indians compare favor
ably to the Angels who are one
of the best teams in the majors
up the middle. With all-stars Jim
Fregosi and Bobby Knoop as
the double play combo, Bob
Rodgers behind the plate, and
fleet Jose Cardenal in center,
California is pretty tough
against the opposition.
Lead by two of the slickest
collegiate fielders on the coast,
Frank Duffy and Dick Swan,

Stanford can handle the double
play with the best. Behind the
plate Mike Schomaker has a ri
fle arm, and center fielder Jell
Rohlfing provides the power. lie
is hitting .412 with nine RBIs in
17 at bats.
Angel Power
The muscle in the Angel at
tack is provided by Rick Reich*
ardt in left, Jim Hall in right
and Don Minchner at first.
The Angels also have two ex-
Stanford players on their roster
â€”Jim Hibbs and Steve Hovely.
Hibbs is playing second string
catcher in his second year as a
pro. Hovely, who would have
played centerfield for the In
dians this year if he hadn't
signed, will probably see action
as a pinch hitter.
Indian Power
The Tribe will answer Califor
nia power with some of their
own. Leftfielder Bill Holt and
Rightfielder Ron Shotts are the
leading sluggers on the team.

Holt has 12 RBIs and 2 home
runs in his 35 at bats.
Big Bob Boone at third can
also send the ball a long way.
This will be one of the An
gel's last exhibition games be

fore their regular season opener
Monday.
It is also one of the Indian's
last as they start league play
next weekend against Oregon
and Oregon State.
