# Card Lacrossers Face Marin Club
## 
### 
The Stanford Lacrosse Te.yn
will play the second game of its
1967 schedule Sunday at 1:30
against the Marin Lacrosse Club,
at Marin College.
This year's team is Stanford's
strongest in its short history of
lacrosse, and could, if it can keep
up the pace that downed the
California Bears 11-1 three
weeks ago, win the Northern
California Lacrosse Association
championship away from rival
Palo Alto.
Included in the schedule for
the Spring are a trip to Colorado
next week, with games scheduled
against Colorado University,
Denver University, the Air Force
Academy, and Colorado College.
Also, there will be a League
all-star encounter with the Aus
tralian All-Stars, en route to
Expo-67 in Montreal, and another
all-star game in Los Angeles
with the Southern California
All-Stars, as well as six other
League Games.

Most of the money for the sea
son was raised by the members
of the toam, since the Univer
sity's aid covered only 20 per
cent of the year's expenses. The
coming classical guitar concert
with The Romeros on April 21
will be a part of the effort to
promote lacrosse on the Stan
ford campus. Anyone interested
in playing lacrosse, contact (un
dergraduates) Mel Ellis at 327-
9989, or (graduates) Jim Kallis
at 327-2920, Crothers Hall.
