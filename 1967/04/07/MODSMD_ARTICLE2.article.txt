# IFB Decision Reversed
## Smith Rules No Phi Delt Rush 
### 
Dean of Students Joel Smith yester
day ruled that Phi Delta Theta would
not be allowed to hold rush this quar
ter, despite a recent Interfraternity
Board (IFB) ruling to the contrary.
He announced his decision at a spe
cial meeting of the IFB.
Smith later explained that the Phi
Delt suspension announced by Presi
dent Wallace Sterling last November
"must carry with it a prohibition
against rushing." He said that, since
the suspension would run until the
end of the academic year, he could
not allow rush this quarter.
Meeting To Explain
A group of Phi Delts, however, an
nounced in Wilbur dining rooms last
night that they would hold a meeting
"to explain the ruling." They said
Dean Smith would not allow them to
hold any more rush, and also men
tioned that it was important for them
to get a good pledge class for next
year.
Between 10 and 15 Phi Delts met
with approximately 20 freshmen at
Lathrop house later in the evening.
At the end of Winter quarter, the

IFB approved a request by Phi Delt
actives, alumni, and national officers
to let them hold rush. IFB President
Drennen Jones at that time explained
the decision by stating that the pro
vision forbidding rush "had nothing to
do with the suspension itself."
No Vote
The IFB did not take a vote on
Smith's reversal of their decision.
Jones refused to comment on any as
pect of the controversy.
The Interfraternity Board is com
posed of 10 student fraternity mem
bers and five faculty members, with
an additional five deans and faculty
members serving ex-officio.
The direct action of Dean Smith in
reversing the IFB decision after it
had already been implemented raises
questions about the role and powers
of that body.
Smith explained that the prohibi
tion against rush had not been ex
plicitly stated when Phi Delta Theta
was suspended, but said it had been
understood by all at the time. "The
purpose of suspension was to have

them disbanded for the rest of the
year," he added.
Jeopardize Future
When asked if he thought the rul
ing against rush would harm the fra
ternity to the point of jeopardizing
their future, Smith said he hoped not.
He emphasized that the decision was
not aimed at destroying the group
permanently.
Smith said Phi Delt rush in the fall
remains an open question. He men
tioned that before the fraternity
could even be reinstated he would
have to be persuaded that the sus
pension had had a rehabilitative ef
fect on the group and added that the
burden of persuasion rested with the
Phi Delts.
A steering committee of alumni and
faculty has been set up to work with
the Phi Delts in anticipation of next
year. Smith said he had high expecta
tions of this committee.
Jeffrey Thigpen, president-elect of
Phi Delta Thata, could not be reached
for comment last night. Smith had
communicated his decision to the Phi
Delts through him.
