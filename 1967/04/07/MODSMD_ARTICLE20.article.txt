# Personal Battles To Highlight Tribe-Beavers Track Contest
## Daily Sports 
### JIM MALLERY 
Stanford faces a greatly im
proved Oregon State track squad
Saturday in their first AAWU
meet of the 1967 season. The
Beavers, though carrying 25
sophomores on the varsity, are
expected to reverse the Tribe's
81-64 victory last year.
Weather permitting, the meet
will be held in the Stanford
stadium, beginning at 1:30 p.m.
Should the track be too soggy,
the competition will be trans
fered to Foothill J.C.'s all-weath
er track.
Meet Records In Danger
The high jump and pole vault
should provide great individual
duals to highlight the meet.
OSU's Dick Fosbury who has
leaped 6'-10", will be facing Stan
ford's Peter Boyce, a sophomore
and already the school record
holder at 6'-ll". If the weather
improves, the old meet record of
6'-6" seems sure of falling.
Jim Eshelman, with a best of
16'-liy 4 ", will again go for that
elusive 17' barrier in the pole
vault. Dennis Philips with a best
of 16'-8%", will give him a tough
battle for first place honors.
Like the high jump, whoever
wins should break the meet rec
ord as set by Eshelman last year
at 15-5%".
Oregon State's Steve Pancoast
is the favorite in the 220 and
440 yard dashes. His times of
21.5 and 46.7 overshadow Stan
ford's best, Jim Ward. Ward has
been clocked in 21.7 and 48.2
this year, and has a best of 47.0
in the 440.
OSU will also be tough in the

distance races, though Tracy
Smith, their world record hold
er in the indoor 3-mile, quit
school. Another Smith, Terry, is
rising fast to take his place.
Terry Smith will double in the
mile and 2-mile, where he has
already posted times of 4:07.9
and 9:08. He is over 15 seconds
ahead of Stanford's best com
petitor in the mile, but should
meet his match with Jim Let
terer in the 2-mile. Jim has run
the distance in 9:11, and Smith
is known to have difficulty com
ing back in the 2-mile after run
ning the mile.
Top Long Jump Field
The long jump also shapes up
to be a great battle. Craig
Vaughn has the best distance
going into the meet with 24'-
6 but is closely followed by
Mike Jackson of OSU at 24'-
4V2". Another Beaver, Sopho
more Charlie Olds, has done 24-
3Va".
Bud Walsh, who has also been
over 24' this year is still a ques
tion mark in this event. If a
muscle pull suffered two weeks

ago in the Easter Relays has
healed sufficiently, he will com
pete. Otherwise Stanford may
lose valuable points.
School record holder in the
triple jump lan Arnold is the
favorite in this event. George
May has leaped over 46' but is
still far away from Arnold's 49'-
5V2" effort. Lan should also
eclipse the meet record of 46'-
2V2" set last year.
Building Year For Tribe
This year has been termed a
building year for the Indians.
With fourteen sophomores and
only seven seniors, their true
strength is yet to be shown. To
morrow will be a sign of Stan
ford's future in track. If the
sophomores do well, it could
mean a strong team for the next
three years.
Frosh Go For Second Win
The Frosh track team makes
its second appearance of the sea
son this afternoon when they
go against Reedley College on
Angell Field at 4:00. In their
first meet March 8, they defeat
ed Santa Rosa J.C. 101-29.
