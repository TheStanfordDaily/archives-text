# Indians Scared To Race?
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The following
column, written by Jim Street,
Sports Editor of San Jose State's
Spartan Daily, appeared Tues
day. It came to the attention of
the Daily through a San Jose
student who exalted over his
winning a bet with his father.
His father is a Stanford alum
nus.
We may reply as soon as
and/or If we can stop laughing
at the editor's column.
Stanford University and the
Soviet Union track teams have
something in common. First,
both the Indians and the Rus
sians wear Red uniforms, and
second, they pull out of track
meets.
The Russians refused to come
to the U.S. last summer because
they were afraid of getting
trounced by the Americans. That
is the way it was reported in
many cases. Yesterday Stanford
pulled an a la Russia by refus
ing to meet the Spartans in the
long-standing dual meet series.
Stanford did offer a reason for
cancelling the meet. "We are
registering for the spring se
mester," a Stanford official
stated.
Register For Fifteen Years
What he forgot to mention,
however, was that Stanford has
been on the same quarter sys
tem for some 15 years and the
traditional SJS-Stanford track
fest has been scheduled at the
same time—and before this year
was always run, even if it took
several days.
"We have held meets as late
as Tuesday or Wednesday," SJS
head Coach Bud Winter said.
"Our track is in excellent
shape," Winter continued, "and
today (Monday) the weather is
perfect."
The conditions couldn't have
been better for the meet, even
if some of the luster was gone
after a steady build up to Sat
urday.
There was no reason why
Stanford could not have come
to SJS for the meet if their
track was in such terrible shape.
We can understand why Stan
ford couldn't use their field be

cause it was covered with about
two feet of water Friday night.
Stanford A Rare Visitor
Stanford has come to SJS be
fore—but the visits are indeed
rare.
The meet cancellation was of
utmost disappointment to the
seniors of the team who were
set on defeating the Indians for
the first time in their stay at
SJS.

Winter said the team held a
meeting Sunday night and made
it clear that the meet would just
be forgotten and it wouldn't af
fect their performances and at
titude.
"We really needed the compe
tition," Winter said, "and so did
they."
It is clear to us that Stanford
was SCARED to meet SJS this
season.

It is clear to us that Stanford
was SCARED to meet SJS this
season.
Editor's Note: The following
column, written by Jim Street,
Sports Editor of San Jose State's
Spartan Daily, appeared Tues
day. It came to the attention of
the Daily through a San Jose
student who exalted over his
winning a bet with his father.
His father is a Stanford alum
nus.
We may reply as soon as
and/or If we can stop laughing
at the editor's column.
Stanford University and the
Soviet Union track teams have
something in common. First,
both the Indians and the Rus
sians wear Red uniforms, and
second, they pull out of track
meets.
The Russians refused to come
to the U.S. last summer because
they were afraid of getting
trounced by the Americans. That
is the way it was reported in
many cases. Yesterday Stanford
pulled an a la Russia by refus
ing to meet the Spartans in the
long-standing dual meet series.
Stanford did offer a reason for
cancelling the meet. "We are
registering for the spring se
mester," a Stanford official
stated.
Register For Fifteen Years
What he forgot to mention,
however, was that Stanford has
been on the same quarter sys
tem for some 15 years and the
traditional SJS-Stanford track
fest has been scheduled at the
same time—and before this year
was always run, even if it took
several days.
"We have held meets as late
as Tuesday or Wednesday," SJS
head Coach Bud Winter said.
"Our track is in excellent
shape," Winter continued, "and
today (Monday) the weather is
perfect."
The conditions couldn't have
been better for the meet, even
if some of the luster was gone
after a steady build up to Sat
urday.
There was no reason why
Stanford could not have come
to SJS for the meet if their
track was in such terrible shape.
We can understand why Stan
ford couldn't use their field be

cause it was covered with about
two feet of water Friday night.
Stanford A Rare Visitor
Stanford has come to SJS be
fore—but the visits are indeed
rare.
The meet cancellation was of
utmost disappointment to the
seniors of the team who were
set on defeating the Indians for
the first time in their stay at
SJS.

Winter said the team held a
meeting Sunday night and made
it clear that the meet would just
be forgotten and it wouldn't af
fect their performances and at
titude.
"We really needed the compe
tition," Winter said, "and so did
they."
