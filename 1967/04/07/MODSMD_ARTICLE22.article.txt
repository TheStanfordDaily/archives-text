# Golfers Heavy Favorites Over Cal
## 
### BOB FINGER 
The varsity and freshman golf
teams, both holding 3-1 dual
meet records, travel to M i r a
Vista C.C. today to play respec
tive teams from the University
of California at Berkeley.
Both teams also face alumni
teams tomorrow at the Stanford
course starting at noon.
Stanford handily won both en
counters with Cal last year en
route to a second place finish in
conference dual meet play. Stan
ford lost to conference champion
USC by only one point in the
dual meet at USC last year,
while losing by only three
strokes out of 1186 to USC in
the conference meet, held at
Stanford last year.
Heavy Odds
Cal lost every conference
match last year and finished
more than 60 strokes behind

Stanford in the conference meet.
To top this, Stanford boasts
every varsity player from last
year plus an excellent freshman
team that won 10 and lost only
one match last year.
Stanford lost its only match
of this season to the University
of San Francisco, 15-12, when
playing in 40-degree tempera
tures, high winds and continual
rain at the opponents' home
course. Stanford picked up a ma
jority of the individual match
points, 9V2-BV2, but dropped
6V2 out of 9 best ball points to
lost that match.
Rounding out the winter quar
ter schedule, Stanford easily
handled San Francisco State
22V2AV2. Medalists for the meet,
with 74's, were Pitzer and Pi
card. Leith Anderson and Terry
Curran carded 75, while Bob
Bouchier shot a 76.
