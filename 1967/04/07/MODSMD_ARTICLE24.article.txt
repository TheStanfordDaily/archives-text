## Hall: FBI No Longer See Files 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
An article in Wednesday's
Daily, bearing your byline,
states: "The Registrar's office
allows FBI agents to see stu
dent transcripts without permis
sion."
This has been the case until
quite recently, but is no longer
the case. In accordance with a
recent directive from President
Sterling, we have now termi
nated the practice of permitting
properly identified government
investigators to inspect student
records.

• More FBI
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Smith was rather per
turbed by my Daily letter of
April 2, in which I alleged that
the F. 8.1, has free access to con
fidential student files. Accord
ing to Dean Smith the informa
tion obtained by the F. 8.1, in
my case was provided by him
self on the judgement that it
was in my best interests.
The F. 8.1, report that I re
ceived states "a note in his files
..." The Dean claims that this
note was in the Registrar's files
(not considered confidential)
and that he (the Dean) was
subsequently questioned regard
ing the matter.
I have no way of knowing
the extent of Dean Smith's dis
cussions with the F. 8.1, in my
case though I do not doubt that
he believed he was acting in my
best interests.
I only hope that he is acting
in someone's best interests on
Monday, April 10 when he prose
cutes his appeal against the de
cision of the student Judicial
Council before the IJB. I am
sure he will find it hard to be
lieve that he is helping me, or
the student body in attempting
to obtain a reversal of the Judic
ial Council position.
I must say that the issue of

access to "confidential" files can
not possibly be rectified until the
Administration at least spells
out publicly what is in these
files, why they are kept, who
has access to them, and why
University Administrators co
operate with outside agencies in
any matters of personal import
ance without the knowledge or
conesnt of the student involved.

• Judas?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to object to the
title of Undergraduate Special
163: "Stanford University in
American Society," which should
be called "A Seminar to Collect
Evidence of the Heinous Crimes
of Wallace Sterling, the Trus
tees, and the SRI."
Assuming that the title of this
course accurately represented
its contents, I registered for it.
At the first meeting, some of the
student organizers of the course
explained to me that, as a mem
ber of the course, I would have
a unique opportunity to go to
the business school library and
do "research" on the Stanford
and SRI contracts associated
with the development of means
of warfare, on the associations
of Stanford administrators and
faculty members with such de
velopment, and even on the con
tributions to the war effort of
corporations in which the Uni
versity is a stockholder. After
the members of the course had
collected the information, it was
to be published, and a march
upon the SRI was to follow the
publication. I was generously in
formed that the march was not
a course requirement, however.
"Wouldn't they be mad if they
knew what they were giving us
credit for?" chuckled one stu
dent.
I was troubled not only by the
misleading title of the course,

but also by the use of the word
"research," which implies an
open-minded approach to a prob
lem. In this case, the conclu
sions from the "research" which
I was to help conduct had al
ready been made, and the march
had been planned.
Even complete acceptance of
the proposition that the Vietnam
war is totally evil cannot in any
sense justify calling the activi
ties of this course "research,"
since there was to be no at
tempt to investigate the posi
tive aspects of the position of
Stanford in American society. I
doubt seriously that the student
organizers of the course made a
very accurate representation of
their plans to Mr. Drekmeier
when he was asked to become
the official sponsor of the course.
Confident that, unlike Pontius
Pilate, Wallace Sterling will not
seek vengeance upon my sub
versive colleagues, I offer them
this kiss of Judas.

• Complexity
Editor, The Dally:
Avoiding unwanted conclu
sions by invoking that helpful
goddess, the "complexity of the
problem," is a habit of college
professors. If the events and
motivations surrounding secret

CIA financing of a variety of
supposedly independent activi
ties is doubtless complex, the
moral issue is clearcut.
Professor Almond argues that
"this mistake (the "policy of
covert financing" or its accept
ance) was made by a very great
many liberal, responsible and
public-spirited men and that the
appropriate reaction to this ac
tivity, instead of efforts at moral
pillorying, ought to be 'there
but for the grace of God go
I.'" And further, that "the CIA
supported a great many liberal
causes." But shouldn't the sup
port of undercover CIA money
make us reconsider whether the
individuals involved are in fact
"liberal, responsible and public
spirited"? How useful and how
liberal are kept "liberal" causes
or groups, financially dependent
on a secret police while hiding
that fact?
That those who supported this
unhappy state of affairs should
be "morally pilloried," if by that
is meant energetic and un
equivocal condemnation, seems
to me very much in order. Con
demnation need not be accom
panied by arrogance. Tout com
prendre n'est point tout par
doner.
