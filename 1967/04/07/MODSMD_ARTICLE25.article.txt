## Mixed Blessings For Moore 
### Clay L. Miller 
Plans to foist onto the Resi
dence University still another in
the woeful succession of cast
plaster and chromium shack-ups
that began with Stern Hall and
will probably never end, have
been shelved. Last term, to the
astonished glee of practically
everyone, the construction of
Moore Hall was postponed.
(Please Note: The Moore Hall
in question is not, for the time
being at least, to be confused
with Florence Moore Hall, con
structed some years ago and
presently the home of the im
mortal Eleanor Watkins. You
may rest assured, however, that
should Moore Hall ever be per
petrated, the two will be so near
ly indistinquishable in stark
aluminum monotony, as well as
in name, as to effect mind-bog
gling mix-ups in virtually limit
less variety.)
Anti-Wilbur
No one has asked the writer,
during this deliberative interim,
to clutter the public prints with
his own erratic conception of a
dormitory on which the Univer
sity might best spend its mon
ey. It was an idea he made up,
right in his own head, one night
when he found himself, quite
unexpectedly, writing down
ideas for campus housing, re
sulting not only from three
term's spiritual bivouac in Wil
bur Hall, but also encounters
with campus buildings general
ly for twice as long. From these
notes he derived the following
seven-step description of a hypo

thetical dream-house he envi
sioned first during his freshman
year, with a poignant, yearning
clarity fully understandable only
to those who have lived in Wil
bur Hall.
One. The house has a capacity
of no more than fifty students
and is separate and distinct
from its neighbors. This works
for cluster fraternities, so it can
work for independents and
freshmen.
Two. Inside and out, the house
is designed to look like a large,
comfortable private home. The
architects responsible for it
know how to build department
stores, maximum-security men
tal hospitals and small airports,
too, but experience has taught
them the differences in aesthetic
sense between college students
and Piper Cub airplanes and
they seldom confuse the two.
Traditional
Three. Since the house is de
signed for at least a century of
continual use, the architects
would rather have starved than
design it to look as ugly and
graceless in advanced age as a
"'ten-thousand dollar" Eichler.
The over-all design, then, is tra
ditional, in the sense of mellow
timelessness.
Four. The construction
throughout is staunch and dur
able as the oak front door at
ATO. Aluminum is involved
only in door knobs, with narry
a scrap of plastic, fiberglass or
orange-glazed m a so n i t e any
where to be found, and only

enough glass for good lighting
and plenty of fresh air.
Inside
Five. The floors are carpeted
throughout; only savages and
those having a good deal in
common with them are inter
ested in bare floors. Linoleum
squares can be convenient as
easily portable writing surfaces,
make very adequate oil paint
palettes and with just a little
modification in design you
could probably serve noodle
soup in them, but they have no
business on floors. Wherever
possible in the house, the walls
are panelled — with dark ve
neer, never with raw pine or
that peculiar green stuff found
in some of the Wilbur lounges.
Six. The individual rooms are
Quads — two small bedrooms
with two students each and a
common sitting room. No par
ticular reason for this arrange
ment except that it sounds like
a good idea and people who have
it, at Stanford and other schools,
wouldn't swap for anything else.
Seven. There are plenty of
small "public" rooms for semi
nars, billiards, discussions, and
storing bourbon in case lots.
The house is intended as a place
to live, not a filing cabinet for
people.
These are the points most ircv
portant to the writer. You'll
probably think of others, but
please, isn't it possible to have
a Residence University be liv
able?

Anti-Wilbur
No one has asked the writer,
during this deliberative interim,
to clutter the public prints with
his own erratic conception of a
dormitory on which the Univer
sity might best spend its mon
ey. It was an idea he made up,
right in his own head, one night
when he found himself, quite
unexpectedly, writing down
ideas for campus housing, re
sulting not only from three
term's spiritual bivouac in Wil
bur Hall, but also encounters
with campus buildings general
ly for twice as long. From these
notes he derived the following
seven-step description of a hypo

thetical dream-house he envi
sioned first during his freshman
year, with a poignant, yearning
clarity fully understandable only
to those who have lived in Wil
bur Hall.
One. The house has a capacity
of no more than fifty students
and is separate and distinct
from its neighbors. This works
for cluster fraternities, so it can
work for independents and
freshmen.
Two. Inside and out, the house
is designed to look like a large,
comfortable private home. The
architects responsible for it
know how to build department
stores, maximum-security men
tal hospitals and small airports,
too, but experience has taught
them the differences in aesthetic
sense between college students
and Piper Cub airplanes and
they seldom confuse the two.
Traditional
Three. Since the house is de
signed for at least a century of
continual use, the architects
would rather have starved than
design it to look as ugly and
graceless in advanced age as a
"'ten-thousand dollar" Eichler.
The over-all design, then, is tra
ditional, in the sense of mellow
timelessness.
Four. The construction
throughout is staunch and dur
able as the oak front door at
ATO. Aluminum is involved
only in door knobs, with narry
a scrap of plastic, fiberglass or
orange-glazed m a so n i t e any
where to be found, and only

enough glass for good lighting
and plenty of fresh air.
