# Two Minutes of Haight
## Adjusting To The Space-City 
### Tim Haight 
Two stories seem to be say
ing something contradictory
about human nature in our
space-city world. One is credited
to Ken Kesey and goes as fol
lows:
A guy hears an ad on the ra
dio for a deodorant soap which',
if used, will cause beautiful
women to fall all over him. He
buys it, uses it, and it doesn't
produce any special results. Nat
urally, he feels disappointed.
In analysing his situation, ac

cording to Kesey, the guy does
not say "What crummy soap
and what a fraudulent ad." In
stead, he somehow feels that he
has failed to measure up to the
soap.
The other story is simply a
memory of what I used to do
when I struck out at Little
League. I blamed my poor per
formance on the weight of the
bat. Now, when I play pool, I
find myself compulsively clean
ing my glasses.
The dilemma here is this: Are
the frustrations, disappoint
ments, hang-ups, and neuroses
of modern space-city America
the result of some flaws of the
social structure, such as manip
ulation of the individual by the
mass media, or are they simply
failures of the individual to ad
just?
The main trend of American
thought today seems to endorse
the latter. People need counsel
ing, group therapy, job place
ment on the basis of psychologi
cal tests, etc. When a woman is
an alcoholic we may blame it on
her husband, but not on her hus
band's employer. If we take such
factors as neighborhood environ
ment, education, or health into
consideration it is only when
these are "substandard" as in a
ghetto. Then we can wag our
heads and say, "She didn't have
a chance."
But what guarantees that the
"successful" people in our so
ciety really have any better
chance? They may be better
fed, housed in cleaner and bet
ter-heated quarters, and quite
able to battle complex abstract
problems over extended periods
of time, but do these benefits
really have much to do with the
happiness of the human animal?
In fact, would it be going too
far to say that society had a
real interest in keeping the
wealthy people in a mildly neu
rotic state? Try this simple test.
Watch television. Count the
commercials that fall into this
pattern: "Solve your personal
problems by buying something."
Just think what would happen
to the economy if people were

really able to find solace in an
aesthetic religion. If they had
no real need for worldly goods,
having found their place in the
rhythm of God and nature, the
ensuing cataclysm would be
worse for industry than even
the onset of world peace. We
would have Marx's fabeled "cri
sis of overabundance."
But to look at the other side:
What is to say that the gripes
of the New Left and the Hippies
are not just a mass expression
of an "adolescent adjustment
reaction?" Is not the task sim
ply to show these people that
their real pleasure lies in a fruit
ful existence within the demands
of the "reality principle?"
To some extent, this must be
true. When a man murders, we
will not cure him by closing
General Motors down. He has
decided that his need to murder
is more important than an
other's need to live, a decision
that any society cannot allow
an individual to make. To that
extent, he must adjust.
But we are "adjusting" today
for the sake of a human life?
Watch television some more.
Notice how all the time is being
taken out of eating and cooking
(Carnation instant breakfast,
Metrecal for lunch-bunch, TV
Dinners, instant coffee, 5-minute

mucky rice). Notice how easy it
is to build a model airplane,
clean house, or drive around the
golf course.
We are saving a lot of time,
but for what? So we can work
or watch TV. We buy things,
even, to make our leisure less
challenging (boats that drive like
cars, hunting guns with super
sights and automatic every
thingâ€”nice shot, Joe, you flipped
that switch just right.) We trim
down on eating, sleeping, mak
ing love, being with the chil
dren, breathing clean air, and
knowing what animals look and
smell like.
A few blessed souls really gain
pleasure from social involve
ments such as medicine, social
work, research, teaching, and
entertainment, but according to
a recent survey 60 percent of
college graduates are employed
below their intellectual capacity.
I still feel embarrassed by
wiping my glasses when I play
pool, but at least that is a game
I choose to play. Are we so sure
that the exploitative-model so
ciety in which we live is a game
human animals really want, or
have, to play? Or is the "reality
principle" really the "producer
consumer-space - city - how-to-be
come-a-robot-and - fit - in" princi
ple?
