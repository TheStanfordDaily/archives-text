## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
A crowd of sixty thousand should
gather at Kezar Stadium in San Fran
cisco on April 15 to protest the war in
Vietnam, according to Edward Keat
ing, Editor of Ramparts magazine and
Vice-Chairman of the Spring Mobili
zation Committee.
Speaking at a press conference yes
terday, Keating told newsmen that
the purpose of the rally and the fore
going march down Market Street is to
launch a movement among the large
number of Americans who have not
actively protested the war in the past
as well as those who are already
members of groups opposing the war.
He expects 150,000 at a simultaneous
march on the U.N. in New York.
The Founding Declaration of "Mo
bilization" calls for "all Americans to
unite and mobilize in a movement to
end the senseless slaughter of Amer
ican GFs and the mass murder of
Vietnamese." The declaration goes on
to demand that the money now being
spent in Vietnam instead "be em
ployed in a fight against the real ene
mies of man — hunger, hopeless
ness, ignorance, hate, fear, discrimi
nation, and inequality."
The declaration is endorsed by a
long list of authors, politicians, actors,
and other prominent Americans.
The March Mobilizer, a bulletin
published by the Committee, sum
marizes movements around the coun
try and outlines several proposals.
Plans are reportedly being made in
Ithaca, New York for 500 students to
burn their draft cards, also on April
15. Members of the Committee urge
support for those "young men of con
science who refuse to be drafted and
soldiers who refuse to fight an unjust
war."
Mobilizer continues: "It is the right

of the American people to make their
own peaceful settlement when the
establishment is hell-bent on a mili
tary solution."
In a Daily interview after the con
ference, Keating underscored the ne
cessity for a "unilateral withdrawal
of American troops." He said, "His
tory has shown that in the face of
every 'peace offensive' (in the Viet
nam War) the U.S. has escalated." He

wonders if the outcome of the war
will be like that of Korea—which be
came a permanent U.S. military in
stallation— or if Vietnam is being
used as a springboard from which to
launch an offensive against. Red
China.
Charging the U.S. with intervening
in a Civil War, Keating said that the
present administration had steadfast
ly refused to negotiate. He advocates

support of the 1953 Geneva Accord
or a return to a representative civili
an government in Vietnam.
When asked if any communists are
members of the Committee, Keating
replied, "There may be since we are
a non-exclusive group. I invite any
one to call me a communist, because
I will sue them for libel. This includes
any Congressmen who wish to shed
their congressional immunity.

wonders if the outcome of the war
will be like that of Korea—which be
came a permanent U.S. military in
stallation— or if Vietnam is being
used as a springboard from which to
launch an offensive against. Red
