## Communist Calls Firing Political 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
An employee of Stanford Press who
has recently been dismissed from his
job is charging that the reason for
his dismissal is his membership in
the Communist party.
James R. (Bob) Lindsay, a candi
date for the San Jose City Council,
was given notice by the press follow
ing his announcement of his affilia
tion. Press Director Leon Seltzer says
the two are unconnected.
Lindsay issued an open letter to
the Stanford community yesterday,
which reads in part as follows:
"Recently I was notified that my
employment with Stanford University
Press would end on Friday, April 14.
"Although Leon Seltzer, director of
the press, now claims that my em
ployment has been 'on a temporary
basis,' it became 'temporary' only
following the news that I was a can
didate for the San Jose City Council
and a publicly acknowledged member
of the Communist Party. Before that,
I had been considered a 'member of

the family' and indeed was paid above
the union scale to induce me to re
main. Mr. Seltzer says 'Our employ
ment needs are, of course, unrelated
to your political activities or convic
tions.' I assert most strongly that this
is just not so ... .
Public Declaration
"After some twenty years of Party
membership, I made it public in the
belief that open discussion of social
ism and of the ideas of the Commu
nists was a good thing and that I
could still survive politically and eco
nomically. I still think so.
"Since Febraury 18 of this year an
underground struggle has been waged
over my job. Now that the termina
tion is official. . . I think it is timely
for the members of the Stanford
community to intervene if they desire
to do so."
Lindsay told The Daily that after
the San Jose News printed his an
nouncement of Party membership, he
was told by fellow workers that "the
front office was after my job." Later,

the shop tried to replace him, giving
the excuse that he cost them too much
money since he was paid above union
scale. He replied with a letter to the
superintendent of the plant saying he
was willing to take union pay. "At
that time," he said, "I was told that
someone else had already been hired
to take my place. Later the foreman
told me no one had really been hired."
Leon Seltzer, director of the press
denied that this was the case.
"I was glad when I found out he
was running." he said. "I didn't know
he was a Communist, and I couldn't
care less. It's unfortunate that he
sees the stiuation this way."
Mixed Contentions
Seltzer contended that Lindsay had
asked to be relieved from his job be
cause the work was too hard for him.
A replacement was found but Lindsay
was asked to stay on until the shop
caught up with its work. Lindsay
agreed on the condition that he be
paid above union wages, and the shop,
rather than find another man, agreed.

When the back work had been
caught up, Seltzer added, Lindsay was
asked to stay on until the foreman
of the shop returned from the hos
pital. "It was understood," he said,
"that Lindsay would be looking for
a job."
Requests Reinstatement
Following his announcement, Lind
say wrote a letter requesting that he
be paid regular union wages to do
away with this excuse for firing him.
Seltzer agreed, but did not answer
the letter because "it was absurd."
Later, when Lindsay stated in a news
paper that he feared for his job be
cause of his politics, Seltzer wrote
him a letter denying this.
Now that the foreman is returning,
Seltzer said, "I suppose the assistant
foreman has given Lindsay notice."
Seltzer said that although Lindsay's
co-workers may have told him his
job was in danger, that the front
office had no such idea. "We treated
him the same as we would have in
any case," he said.
