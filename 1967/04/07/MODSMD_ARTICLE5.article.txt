# Baez, Sandperl For Non-Violent, Active Resistance To War Effort
##

"It's a schizophrenic world," said
Joan Baez. "No one is apolitical;
you'll have to make a decision in 1967
. . . to take part in the war machine
or not have anything to do with it."
Accompanied by a large white
shaggy canine, Miss Baez and her

guru, former Palo Alto schoolteacher
Ira Sandperl, spoke to a damp near
capacity crowd in Memorial Audito
rium yesterday.
Miss Baez has of late turned from
her endeavors in the entertainment
field and devoted energies to speaking
out against the war in Vietnam. In
1965 she founded in Carmel the In
stitute for the Study of Non-Violence,
of which Sandperl serves as president.
Former UndergTad
A former undergraduate at Stan
ford, Sandperl called himself the
"original drop-out" and advised stu
dents also to drop out of "places like
Stanford which serve as mechanisms
of the cold war," . . . places where
no learning takes place."
"No one believes in violence," said
Sandperl. "The Americans believe in
individual freedom and the commu
nists believe in social justice; every
one is for self-defense but not vio
lence." He added that such policies

as that the U.S. is pursuing in Viet
nam constitute a denial of the "fun
damental freedom . . . the freedom to
live. We're now building a non-violent
society; that's why we have to kill
guys who don't believe in it," he said.
Aggressive Nation
Miss Baez suggested that the U.S.,
"the most aggressive nation in the
world, should unilaterally get out of
Vietnam, just as we unilaterally got
in." She added that non-violent phi
losophy applied in such a situation in
volves active means of resistance
rather than passive acceptance or am
bivalence toward government poli
cies.
She suggested conscientious objec
tion to the draft and refusal to pay
the portion of income taxes going for
defense spending as two methods of
resistance. Miss Baez herself has re
peatedly refused to pay a large por
tion of her income tax els a protest to
the war effort. "I just couldn't volun-

teer the money for war," she said,
but added that the government has
"unlimited powers of confiscation,"
and those which follow such a course
must be prepared to face the conse
quence of fines or jail sentence.
Sandperl explained organized non
violence as a fairly recent movement,
developing within this century and
most eloquently demonstrated by
Gandhi. "Gandhi's major contribution
was organizing. This wasn't an end to
conflict but it showed a civilized way
of dealing with violence," he said.
Both Miss Baez and Sandperl assert
that non-violence has no guarantee
that it will work in any given hypo
thetical situation. "You won't get
push button non-violence," said Sand
perl. Yet he emphasized that there
must be an effort to find political,
economic and social alternatives to
war. "War is not an aberration; it Is
perfectly endemic to the kind of world
we live in," he said.
