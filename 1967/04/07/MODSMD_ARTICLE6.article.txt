# No Phones, No Regs: Branner Experiment Highlights Ambiguity
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Fifty undergraduate women stayed
in Branner Hall during Spring break
as part of an experiment in women's
housing. In past years they have
been forced to move out of their dor
mitories during vacations.
The Branner experiment is now be
ing studied as part of a staff analysis
which may lead to a change in the
current housing policy, according to
Daniel Nowak, Associate Dean of Stu
dent Counseling.
The current policy is ambiguous.

Men's dormitories are kept open dur
ing vacations; women's dormitories
are closed. The men are allowed to
stay in their own rooms, and for no
extra charge.
Most of the 50 women who were in
Branner ordinarily live in other dormi
tories. They had to be out of their
other residences by noon, Saturday,
March 25 and were not allowed to
move back in until 8 a.m., Sunday,
April 2. They were charged $1 for
linen during their stay in Branner.
Huston House
According to Nowak, in past years,
the women have been allowed to stay
in Huston House. However, Huston
House has only 19 spaces available
and is now providing temporary lodg
ing for Alpha Sigma Phi.
Some of the girls who moved to
Branner for the vacation felt that
they should not have been locked out
of their dormitories. "It's a big pain
to move in and out," according to
Natalie Strombeck, a Florence Moore
sophomore.
Ying Ying Wu, Miss Strombeck's
roommate in Florence Moore, com
plained that the service in Branner
was inadequate. "Nobody can reach
you here, because the switchboard
isn't operating," she said.
The University provided no switch-

board service because the Branner
experiment was a "minimal opera
tion," according to Dean Nowak.
Other complaints centered around
the lack of supervision in Branner,
although some of the girls liked this
aspect of the situation best. Carol
Christ, a Lagunita senior, commented,
"They told us the girls had to have
supervision, but there isn't much su
pervision here."
Branner Director
Miss Christ revealed that the Bran
ner director during Spring break, Mrs.
Obera Van Rosen, was not living at
Branner and was seldom seen there.
Mrs. Van Rosen did place a sign on
top of the switchboard, however,
which told where she could be reached
"in case of an emergency."
"It's unfair for us to move in on
these girls who live in Branner dur
ing the rest of the year," Miss Christ
continued, "and it's unfair to make
us move."
Pam Lawrence, a Lagunita junior,
said that the social regulations at
Branner were "pretty hang-loose." All
of the girls had keys to the front door,
she added, "and we could come and go
anytime."
However, the social regulations
were no different than those presently
in effect at Lagunita, according to
Miss Lawrence. "I would have pre
ferred to stay in my own room at La
gunita," she concluded.
Financial Reasons
The reasons for closing most of the
women's residences are mainly finan
cial, according to Dean Nowak. "It is
unfeasible to request the staff to be
on hand during vacations," he said.
Alan Cummings, the Manager of
Women's Residences, admitted that
"most of the costs continue during
vacation periods," but he did not give
any figures.
