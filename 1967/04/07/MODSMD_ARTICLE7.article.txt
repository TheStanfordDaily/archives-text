# Academic Council Will Meet Today
## 
### 
The Academic Council will meet to
day to discuss methods of selecting a
committee to consider a successor to
President Sterling.
In other action, the Council will not
consider the tenure proposal that has
been presented because, according to
Ernst Hilgard of the Executive Com
mittee, there are still too many un
certainties about it.
There will also be a report from
President Sterling.
