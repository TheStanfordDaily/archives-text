# Vienna Diplomatic Academy
## European Internationalism Tackled 
### ROBERT JOHNSTON The Collegiate Press Service 
PRINCETON, N.J. (CPS) —
When Ernst Winter returned to
Vienna seven years ago after
twenty years in the United
States, his first problem was to
find a place to live, no mean feat
for a man who needed housing
not only for his wife (one of the
von I'rapp daughters, immortal
ized in "The Sound of Music")
but for five children and 10,000
books. Characteristically, he
soon arranged for a loan from
an international service organi
zation to buy a handsome cha
teau on the edge of town.
This left him free to tackle
his second problem, his new ap
pointment to the Vienna Diplo
matic Academy, which consisled
of 55-60 students drawn from all
over Europe and was housed in

another chateau in the center of
the city.
European Integration
Winter soon decided that,
American cold feet to the
contrary, a rigidly parti
tioned Europe was an anach
ronism that would sooner or
later be discarded. Now, half his
Academy's graduates go to work
on the problems of European
integration from within the
numerous and rapidly expand
ing international organizations
in Europe; the rest tackle the
same problems from within the
individual countries' diplomatic
corps.
Visiting Princeton University
recently on the last leg of a
four-week trip through the
United States, Winter described
the Diplomatic Academy's pro
gram as "a little more rigorous"
than higher education in Ameri
ca and contrasted this country's
alienated youth with the vigor,

enthusiasm and optimism of stu
dents in Europe.
Internationalism
Europeans are beginning to
see themselves as a new inter
national entity, he said; nation
alities are no longer central in
their thinking. The Chinese and
Vietnamese turmoil has direct
ed the hot light of world atten
tion to Asia, Winter explained,
leaving Western Europe to
quietly and unobtrusively con
struct a political and economic
reintegration with Eastern Eur
ope, including .Russia
"lntegration has proceeded
much farther than anyone
would have thought possible a
few years ago," he said. He
added by way of example that
he was having to cut short his
U.S. trip in order to hurry back
to Vienna for meetings there
with French general Andre
Beaufre. General Beaufre was
apparently interested in explor

ing the possibilities for Euro
pean neutralization, a startling
new approach for a man long
dedicated to the idea of a strong
European defense against Com
munism.
Winter wants to prepare the
Academy's students to set the
style for this new internation
alism in European statecraft.
Educational Innovations
His educational philosophy
isn't exactly conventional.
"We don't have any perma
nent faculty at the Academy,"
Winter explained, "Everything
is decided by the students.
Twice a year they meet for a
week to decide what they need
to be studying. They are very
future-oriented and try to think
of what skills and training will
be valuable to them ten years
from now." By then, he said,
a new Europe, interdependent
from London to Moscow, will be
well-advanced, and they are
very excited about this prospect.
"We invite people from all
over Europe to come in for
two weeks to three months
at a time to teach. We espec
ially try to avoid anything that
has been taught before."
And a rigorous two-year pro
gram it is. One suspects that the
graduates are much like Winter
himself—at home in any en
vironment, from the stuffiest
diplomatic chancellories with the
most exacting standards of
bearing and behavior to the in
tellectualism of the university
ivory tower.
As an example of the Acad
emy's up-to-dateness, Winter
pointed to its computer pro
gramming courses. "We have
our own computer and every
one has to know how to use it."
On the other hand, swimming,
fencing, horseback riding and
tennis are an integral part of be
fore-breakfast and before-dinner
student activity, again with fa
cilities on the grounds, "to save
time."
Language Requirements
Winter thought the program
worked out well—lots of work,
lots of sport, and "not much
sleep." From eight to one, he
said, "every morning with no
vacations," are the language
classes. The Academy requires
five for graduation, including
English, French, German and
Russian.
One Princeton student asked
Winter why the Academy had
only a few American students.
"They never pass the entrance
exam," he replied. Asked what it

consists of, he said, "Applicants
visit the school for three days.
The first day we speak French,
the second German, with English
on the third. The Americans nev
er seem to make it to the third
day."
All afternoon classes are four
hours "with no coffee breaks,"
Winter said. Each day a new
problem in economics, political
science or history, among others,
is taken up, he explained.
Diplomatic Futures
Noting that about half of the
Academy's graduates go into the
various European diplomatic
corps, Winter quickly added that
these corps are very different
from the U.S. State Department.
"The State Department is still
domestically oriented," he main
tained. The European corps are
"way ahead of it" in their inter
national orientation, working on
the integration of Europe across
old barriers of distrust and red
tape.
He pointed, for example, to the
U.S. success, "until recently," in
keeping trade between Eastern
and Western Europe to virtually
nothing. Now, he said, barriers
are falling right and left. "New
ties with the West are all they
talk about."
"The twenty Communist coun
tries and twenty-one non-Com
munist countries of Europe see
co-existence among themselves
as already well-established,"
Winter said. Now they are look
ing to much broader integration
into a "post-industrial society,
the United States, which the stu
dents look to for inspiration."
Technopols
In post-industrial Europe, he
continued, the computer will pro
vide the "common language."
Czech students, for example, are
no longer interested in becoming
technocrats, Winter pointed out,
but have coined a new word to
describe their aspirations, "tech
nopol." Rather than taking sec
ond place to the social engineers,
they want to be politicians that
can understand (hence, "pol"),
and therefore critically influence
the technical decisions.
"No country in Europe can live
by itself any longer," Winter
said, "and they all recognize this
even Russia."
His students at the Vienna
Diplomatic Academy are care
fully and thoroughly planning to
form an international corps of
"technopols" guiding and shap
ing this common European
future.
