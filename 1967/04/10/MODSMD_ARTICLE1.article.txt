# Lack Of Dean Not Seen As Cause For Fear
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
The Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Education, created in 1964, has been vacant
since September. This fact does not mean
that the functions of the office are no longer
being carried out, merely that no one man
is now responsible for those functions.
The functions of the Dean of Undergraduate
Education are currently being handled by
three men; Dean of Students Joel Smith, As
sociate Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert Hind, and Provost Richard Lyman. All
three of these men have expressed the opin
ion that "concern that affairs of the under
graduate are not being properly looked after
is groundless." According to Dean Smith,
"It is not necessary to have a Dean in order
to have a very active concern about under
graduates."
Although there is no Dean of Undergradu
ate Education, the Office of the Dean, cur
rently headed by Dean Hind, is very much
alive and active. One of the prime functions
of the office, according to Dean Hind, is co
ordination of undergraduate affairs with the
Committee on Undergraduate Education

(CUE). One of the big areas which the office
is involved in is the study of the Packer Com
mittee. "It is evident that the Packer Commit
tee is going to go very deeply into areas of
undergraduate education, and is going to
make as much use as possible of CUE mem
bers and CUE iself "
Efficiency
One of the functions of the Packer Com
mittee is to make recommendations aimed at
improving the effciency of the Administration
in regard to undergraduate education. Until
such time as the committee makes its report,
the administration of undergraduate affairs
will remain in what Provost Lyman calls "an
interim state."
Lyman added that there were three reasons
for not moving ahead on ending the interim
situation: "1) We don't want to forclose the
possibility of filling the office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education; 2) We don't want
to make any more changes until the Packer
Committee has completed its study; and 3)
We don't want to create a misleading impres
sion, that is that the undergraduate is not be
ing represented."

The interim state was brought about last
fall by the resignation of then Dean, Robert
Wert. In an effort to protect the undergradu
ate, among other things, the office of the Dean
of Students was expanded in order to make
the Dean an Associate Provost, and Joel
Smith assumed the newly-created office. Ac
cording to Provost Lyman, "The Dean of Stu
dents became an Associate Provost in order
to bridge the gap between the administrative
duties of the Dean of Students office and the
academic functions of the Dean of Under
graduate Education's office."
Risk
Dean Smith is the first to admit that there
is a certain risk involved in the interim state
and that is that questions of undergraduate
affairs may go unattended simply because
there is not enough time in the day for him
and his staff to attend to all the problems that
go along with the office. "I am very con
cerned with the time spent on visible prob
lems, ones which mainly deal with activist ele
ments. It must be possible for me to spend
time with fraternities, residences, eating
clubs, and organizations that aren't as no

ticeable as activist groups. I have to share
my time."
While the Dean of Students has to share
his time, undergraduate affairs must share
their administration among half a dozen com
mittees. These include CUE, the Committee
on General Studies, the Academic Council,
the Committee on Student Affairs and Ser
vices, the Packer Committee, the Committee
of 15, and others. Each of these committees
have representatives from all departments
which affect undergraduate policies, and each
of these committees has overlapping juris
diction insofar as undergraduate policies are
concerned.
Packer Committee
Many solutions to the problems of admini
stering undergraduate affairs are currently
being examined by the Packer Committee. One
of these is an idea to establish a separate un
dergraduate college after the models of Har
vard and Yale. According to Provost Lyman
the concept of establishing such a college
has been discussed before. "While there are
many exciting aspects to such a plan," Ly
man said, "I am categorically opposed to es

tablishing an undergraduate college with a
separate faculty. The quality of undergradu
ate education can only suffer from such a
separation."
Separate faculties is only one item charac
teristic of a basic problem inherent in all uni
versities, conflicts between undergraduate and
graduate education. The current administra
tors of undergraduate education are all hope
ful that administration during the interim
state and the recommendations of the Packer
Committee will serve to minimize these prob
lems.
In spite of the fact that there is no Dean
of Undergraduate Education, there is a deep
concern for the undergraduate. Deans Smith
and Hind, and Provost Lyman all consider
undergraduates to be their special interest,
above or in addition to all other aspects of
their jobs. There is no indication of how
long the interim period will last, but until a
new system is innovated, all three men con
cerned with administering undergraduate af
fairs are confident that there will be no lapse
in effective administration of those areas of
importance to Stanford undergraduates.

sion, that is that the undergraduate is not be
ing represented."

The interim state was brought about last
fall by the resignation of then Dean, Robert
Wert. In an effort to protect the undergradu
ate, among other things, the office of the Dean
of Students was expanded in order to make
the Dean an Associate Provost, and Joel
Smith assumed the newly-created office. Ac
cording to Provost Lyman, "The Dean of Stu
dents became an Associate Provost in order
to bridge the gap between the administrative
duties of the Dean of Students office and the
academic functions of the Dean of Under
graduate Education's office."
Risk
Dean Smith is the first to admit that there
is a certain risk involved in the interim state
and that is that questions of undergraduate
affairs may go unattended simply because
there is not enough time in the day for him
and his staff to attend to all the problems that
go along with the office. "I am very con
cerned with the time spent on visible prob
lems, ones which mainly deal with activist ele
ments. It must be possible for me to spend
time with fraternities, residences, eating
clubs, and organizations that aren't as no

ticeable as activist groups. I have to share
my time."
While the Dean of Students has to share
his time, undergraduate affairs must share
their administration among half a dozen com
mittees. These include CUE, the Committee
on General Studies, the Academic Council,
the Committee on Student Affairs and Ser
vices, the Packer Committee, the Committee
of 15, and others. Each of these committees
have representatives from all departments
which affect undergraduate policies, and each
of these committees has overlapping juris
diction insofar as undergraduate policies are
concerned.
Packer Committee
Many solutions to the problems of admini
stering undergraduate affairs are currently
being examined by the Packer Committee. One
of these is an idea to establish a separate un
dergraduate college after the models of Har
vard and Yale. According to Provost Lyman
the concept of establishing such a college
has been discussed before. "While there are
many exciting aspects to such a plan," Ly
man said, "I am categorically opposed to es

tablishing an undergraduate college with a
separate faculty. The quality of undergradu
ate education can only suffer from such a
separation."
Separate faculties is only one item charac
teristic of a basic problem inherent in all uni
versities, conflicts between undergraduate and
graduate education. The current administra
tors of undergraduate education are all hope
ful that administration during the interim
state and the recommendations of the Packer
Committee will serve to minimize these prob
lems.
In spite of the fact that there is no Dean
of Undergraduate Education, there is a deep
concern for the undergraduate. Deans Smith
and Hind, and Provost Lyman all consider
undergraduates to be their special interest,
above or in addition to all other aspects of
their jobs. There is no indication of how
long the interim period will last, but until a
new system is innovated, all three men con
cerned with administering undergraduate af
fairs are confident that there will be no lapse
in effective administration of those areas of
importance to Stanford undergraduates.
The Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Education, created in 1964, has been vacant
since September. This fact does not mean
that the functions of the office are no longer
being carried out, merely that no one man
is now responsible for those functions.
The functions of the Dean of Undergraduate
Education are currently being handled by
three men; Dean of Students Joel Smith, As
sociate Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert Hind, and Provost Richard Lyman. All
three of these men have expressed the opin
ion that "concern that affairs of the under
graduate are not being properly looked after
is groundless." According to Dean Smith,
"It is not necessary to have a Dean in order
to have a very active concern about under
graduates."
Although there is no Dean of Undergradu
ate Education, the Office of the Dean, cur
rently headed by Dean Hind, is very much
alive and active. One of the prime functions
of the office, according to Dean Hind, is co
ordination of undergraduate affairs with the
Committee on Undergraduate Education

(CUE). One of the big areas which the office
is involved in is the study of the Packer Com
mittee. "It is evident that the Packer Commit
tee is going to go very deeply into areas of
undergraduate education, and is going to
make as much use as possible of CUE mem
bers and CUE iself "
Efficiency
One of the functions of the Packer Com
mittee is to make recommendations aimed at
improving the effciency of the Administration
in regard to undergraduate education. Until
such time as the committee makes its report,
the administration of undergraduate affairs
will remain in what Provost Lyman calls "an
interim state."
Lyman added that there were three reasons
for not moving ahead on ending the interim
situation: "1) We don't want to forclose the
possibility of filling the office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education; 2) We don't want
to make any more changes until the Packer
Committee has completed its study; and 3)
We don't want to create a misleading impres
sion, that is that the undergraduate is not be

has been discussed before. "While there are
many exciting aspects to such a plan," Ly
man said, "I am categorically opposed to es

tablishing an undergraduate college with a
separate faculty. The quality of undergradu
ate education can only suffer from such a
separation."
Separate faculties is only one item charac
teristic of a basic problem inherent in all uni
versities, conflicts between undergraduate and
graduate education. The current administra
tors of undergraduate education are all hope
ful that administration during the interim
state and the recommendations of the Packer
Committee will serve to minimize these prob
lems.
In spite of the fact that there is no Dean
of Undergraduate Education, there is a deep
concern for the undergraduate. Deans Smith
and Hind, and Provost Lyman all consider
undergraduates to be their special interest,
above or in addition to all other aspects of
their jobs. There is no indication of how
long the interim period will last, but until a
new system is innovated, all three men con
cerned with administering undergraduate af
fairs are confident that there will be no lapse
in effective administration of those areas of
importance to Stanford undergraduates.
The Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Education, created in 1964, has been vacant
since September. This fact does not mean
that the functions of the office are no longer
being carried out, merely that no one man
is now responsible for those functions.
The functions of the Dean of Undergraduate
Education are currently being handled by
three men; Dean of Students Joel Smith, As
sociate Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert Hind, and Provost Richard Lyman. All
three of these men have expressed the opin
ion that "concern that affairs of the under
graduate are not being properly looked after
is groundless." According to Dean Smith,
"It is not necessary to have a Dean in order
to have a very active concern about under
graduates."
Although there is no Dean of Undergradu
ate Education, the Office of the Dean, cur
rently headed by Dean Hind, is very much
alive and active. One of the prime functions
of the office, according to Dean Hind, is co
ordination of undergraduate affairs with the
Committee on Undergraduate Education

(CUE). One of the big areas which the office
is involved in is the study of the Packer Com
mittee. "It is evident that the Packer Commit
tee is going to go very deeply into areas of
undergraduate education, and is going to
make as much use as possible of CUE mem
bers and CUE iself "
Efficiency
One of the functions of the Packer Com
mittee is to make recommendations aimed at
improving the effciency of the Administration
in regard to undergraduate education. Until
such time as the committee makes its report,
the administration of undergraduate affairs
will remain in what Provost Lyman calls "an
interim state."
Lyman added that there were three reasons
for not moving ahead on ending the interim
situation: "1) We don't want to forclose the
possibility of filling the office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education; 2) We don't want
to make any more changes until the Packer
Committee has completed its study; and 3)
We don't want to create a misleading impres
sion, that is that the undergraduate is not be
ing represented."

The interim state was brought about last
fall by the resignation of then Dean, Robert
Wert. In an effort to protect the undergradu
ate, among other things, the office of the Dean
of Students was expanded in order to make
the Dean an Associate Provost, and Joel
Smith assumed the newly-created office. Ac
cording to Provost Lyman, "The Dean of Stu
dents became an Associate Provost in order
to bridge the gap between the administrative
duties of the Dean of Students office and the
academic functions of the Dean of Under
graduate Education's office."
Risk
Dean Smith is the first to admit that there
is a certain risk involved in the interim state
and that is that questions of undergraduate
affairs may go unattended simply because
there is not enough time in the day for him
and his staff to attend to all the problems that
go along with the office. "I am very con
cerned with the time spent on visible prob
lems, ones which mainly deal with activist ele
ments. It must be possible for me to spend
time with fraternities, residences, eating
clubs, and organizations that aren't as no

ticeable as activist groups. I have to share
my time."
While the Dean of Students has to share
his time, undergraduate affairs must share
their administration among half a dozen com
mittees. These include CUE, the Committee
on General Studies, the Academic Council,
the Committee on Student Affairs and Ser
vices, the Packer Committee, the Committee
of 15, and others. Each of these committees
have representatives from all departments
which affect undergraduate policies, and each
of these committees has overlapping juris
diction insofar as undergraduate policies are
concerned.
Packer Committee
Many solutions to the problems of admini
stering undergraduate affairs are currently
being examined by the Packer Committee. One
of these is an idea to establish a separate un
dergraduate college after the models of Har
vard and Yale. According to Provost Lyman
the concept of establishing such a college
has been discussed before. "While there are
many exciting aspects to such a plan," Ly
man said, "I am categorically opposed to es

tablishing an undergraduate college with a
