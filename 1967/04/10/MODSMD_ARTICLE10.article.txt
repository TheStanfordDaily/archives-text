# Quaker Debates Diplomat

Vietnam is not "President
Johnson's war," a sharp critic
and a State Department officer
agreed Saturday (April 8) at
Stanford.
Russell Johnson, Quaker inter
national affairs representative
in South East Asia, recently re
turned from Vietnam, said the
American presence there is the
result of "a calculated, very de
liberate policy" of 50 years dura
tion.
Occupation Force
"Americans are in Vietnam as
an occupation force," he de
clared. "We're ready to destroy
that country rather than con
cede it to communism. In es
sence, our interest is imperialist,
the same as the French."
Marshall Brement, foreign ser
vice officer specializing in Far
Eastern and Russian affairs,
now at Stanford on a public af
fairs fellowship, said President
Johnson is using the "same
team" for key decisions in Viet
nam that President Kennedy
had.
The basic U.S. position is that
"you can't send troops across
the border to propagate commu
nism," whether it's in Korea,
Berlin, or Vietnam, he said. In
like manner, the U.S. would
not permit West German troops
to invade East Germany.
The "overwhelming fact" is
the need for the U.S. to keep its
international commitments, he

added. "Once there's doubt about
commitment, then we live in a
world where we're all insecure.
The task of diplomacy is to keep
us safe."
Johnson said North Vietnam
regards the U.S. presence in
Vietnam "the same as the
French," noting that this coun
try paid 80 per cent of France's
bills for the Indo-China war and
that Premier Ky served as a
French aviator against the Al
gerians.
Great Myth
It's a "great myth" that the
U.S. stands against colonialism,
he added. "We intervene for self
interest, mouthing liberal slo
gans.
"There's no way might can
make right."
Brement said the French with
drawal from Indo-China was
caused more by internal political
factors than the military defeat
at Dien Bien Phu. "The North
Vietnamese see us in terms of
the French. That's a great trag
edy, for they're finding out we're
not the French."
The Japanese made a similar
miscalculation before Pearl Har
bor, he noted. Reading about
pacifist demonstrations and see
ing the draft pass Congress by
a single vote, they foresaw a
cheap victory in prospect, as
happened earlier against the
Russians.
Where the U.S. was careful to

leave Russia other options dur
ing the Cuban missile crisis, he
added, "Ho is not willing to give
us options. He reads opposition
to our policies in the U.S. as
signs of great internal weak
ness."
A staff member at the Amer
ican embassy in Moscow from
1964 to 1966, Brement said: "De
spite all the propaganda in the
Soviet Union, many Soviet
friends say we're doing the right
thing in Vietnam." In fact, some
take the same position as Curtis
LeMay, saying we should go in
there and get it over with.
"You hear a lot of vocal pub
lic condemnation, but a lot of
Asian politicians say in private
they support us," he said.
Johnson said America's pres
ence in Vietnam results from a
long-term drive to preserve a
world-wide "American empire."
"Most of our cousins have laid
down that (white man's) bur
den, but we've picked it up."
China
While U.S. leaders have
warned of Chinese aggression,
"there's no Chinese soldier out
side China," he added. American
submarine and planes circle the
globe.
Brement said there's been
"some exaggeration" of China's
aggressiveness. Alone among the
nations of the world, it has
failed to raise national output
during the past decade, while its

population has risen by 100 mil
lion. "China's not the model it
once seemed to be" to Asian and
Latin American countries, he de
clared.

tion.
Occupation Force
"Americans are in Vietnam as
an occupation force," he de
clared. "We're ready to destroy
that country rather than con
cede it to communism. In es
sence, our interest is imperialist,
the same as the French."
Marshall Brement, foreign ser
vice officer specializing in Far
Eastern and Russian affairs,
now at Stanford on a public af
fairs fellowship, said President
Johnson is using the "same
team" for key decisions in Viet
nam that President Kennedy
had.
The basic U.S. position is that
"you can't send troops across
the border to propagate commu
nism," whether it's in Korea,
Berlin, or Vietnam, he said. In
like manner, the U.S. would
not permit West German troops
to invade East Germany.
The "overwhelming fact" is
the need for the U.S. to keep its
international commitments, he

added. "Once there's doubt about
commitment, then we live in a
world where we're all insecure.
The task of diplomacy is to keep
us safe."
Johnson said North Vietnam
regards the U.S. presence in
Vietnam "the same as the
French," noting that this coun
try paid 80 per cent of France's
bills for the Indo-China war and
that Premier Ky served as a
French aviator against the Al
gerians.
Great Myth
It's a "great myth" that the
U.S. stands against colonialism,
he added. "We intervene for self
interest, mouthing liberal slo
gans.
"There's no way might can
make right."
Brement said the French with
drawal from Indo-China was
caused more by internal political
factors than the military defeat
at Dien Bien Phu. "The North
Vietnamese see us in terms of
the French. That's a great trag
edy, for they're finding out we're
not the French."
The Japanese made a similar
miscalculation before Pearl Har
bor, he noted. Reading about
pacifist demonstrations and see
ing the draft pass Congress by
a single vote, they foresaw a
cheap victory in prospect, as
happened earlier against the
Russians.
Where the U.S. was careful to

leave Russia other options dur
ing the Cuban missile crisis, he
added, "Ho is not willing to give
us options. He reads opposition
to our policies in the U.S. as
signs of great internal weak
ness."
A staff member at the Amer
ican embassy in Moscow from
1964 to 1966, Brement said: "De
spite all the propaganda in the
Soviet Union, many Soviet
friends say we're doing the right
thing in Vietnam." In fact, some
take the same position as Curtis
LeMay, saying we should go in
there and get it over with.
"You hear a lot of vocal pub
lic condemnation, but a lot of
Asian politicians say in private
they support us," he said.
Johnson said America's pres
ence in Vietnam results from a
long-term drive to preserve a
world-wide "American empire."
"Most of our cousins have laid
down that (white man's) bur
den, but we've picked it up."
China
While U.S. leaders have
warned of Chinese aggression,
"there's no Chinese soldier out
side China," he added. American
submarine and planes circle the
globe.
Brement said there's been
"some exaggeration" of China's
aggressiveness. Alone among the
nations of the world, it has
failed to raise national output
during the past decade, while its

population has risen by 100 mil
lion. "China's not the model it
once seemed to be" to Asian and
Latin American countries, he de
clared.

Eastern and Russian affairs,
now at Stanford on a public af
fairs fellowship, said President
Johnson is using the "same
team" for key decisions in Viet
nam that President Kennedy
had.
The basic U.S. position is that
"you can't send troops across
the border to propagate commu
nism," whether it's in Korea,
Berlin, or Vietnam, he said. In
like manner, the U.S. would
not permit West German troops
to invade East Germany.
The "overwhelming fact" is
the need for the U.S. to keep its
international commitments, he

added. "Once there's doubt about
commitment, then we live in a
world where we're all insecure.
The task of diplomacy is to keep
us safe."
Johnson said North Vietnam
regards the U.S. presence in
Vietnam "the same as the
French," noting that this coun
try paid 80 per cent of France's
bills for the Indo-China war and
that Premier Ky served as a
French aviator against the Al
gerians.
Great Myth
It's a "great myth" that the
U.S. stands against colonialism,
he added. "We intervene for self
interest, mouthing liberal slo
gans.
"There's no way might can
make right."
Brement said the French with
drawal from Indo-China was
caused more by internal political
factors than the military defeat
at Dien Bien Phu. "The North
Vietnamese see us in terms of
the French. That's a great trag
edy, for they're finding out we're
not the French."
The Japanese made a similar
miscalculation before Pearl Har
bor, he noted. Reading about
pacifist demonstrations and see
ing the draft pass Congress by
a single vote, they foresaw a
cheap victory in prospect, as
happened earlier against the
Russians.
Where the U.S. was careful to

leave Russia other options dur
ing the Cuban missile crisis, he
added, "Ho is not willing to give
us options. He reads opposition
to our policies in the U.S. as
signs of great internal weak
ness."
A staff member at the Amer
ican embassy in Moscow from
1964 to 1966, Brement said: "De
spite all the propaganda in the
Soviet Union, many Soviet
friends say we're doing the right
thing in Vietnam." In fact, some
take the same position as Curtis
LeMay, saying we should go in
there and get it over with.
"You hear a lot of vocal pub
lic condemnation, but a lot of
Asian politicians say in private
they support us," he said.
Johnson said America's pres
ence in Vietnam results from a
long-term drive to preserve a
world-wide "American empire."
"Most of our cousins have laid
down that (white man's) bur
den, but we've picked it up."
China
While U.S. leaders have
warned of Chinese aggression,
"there's no Chinese soldier out
side China," he added. American
submarine and planes circle the
globe.
Brement said there's been
"some exaggeration" of China's
aggressiveness. Alone among the
nations of the world, it has
failed to raise national output
during the past decade, while its

population has risen by 100 mil
lion. "China's not the model it
once seemed to be" to Asian and
Latin American countries, he de
clared.
