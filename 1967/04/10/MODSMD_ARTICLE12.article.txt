Students marching on Sacra
mento to protest Governor Rea
gan's "demolition plans for high
er education in California" re
cently decided to meet more oft
en and become organized.
Last week students from 19
colleges through the state held a
two-day conference at the Uni
versity of California at Santa
Barbara to begin a movement
for a state-wide federation of
students.
The resultant organization —
the California Federation of Stu
dents (CFS) — states that its
broad purposes are,
"To maintain and further free
ly accessible quality higher edu
cation in California,
"To promote, protect and en
rich the pursuit of academic ex
cellence,
"To affirm the obligation of
students as citizens to partici
pate in the society of California,
"To enable students to take an
active and constructive part in
establishing policy vital to an
educational environment."
CFS is already operating a
state coordinating office with a
legislative lobbyist in Sacramen
to and is currently carrying out
recruitment drives on most large
campuses In California, and it
plans a membership from "every
campus, public and private,
four-year and two-year. Plans
are to hold a state constitutional
convention before a summer va
cation.
Ted Jacqueney, Chairman of
the Stanford Chapter of CFS,
emphasized that it is not merely
a "new left" organization. Rath
er, as Jack Corbit stated, "many
students have axes to grind, so
let's have a common grind
stone."
What started as a protest
march has evolved, as junior po
litical science major Randy
Fields put it, into a forum for
"expressing the student's will."
Jacqueney feels a "pressing
need for state-wide organiza
tion" with each chapter working
on its own needs, plus the state
wide group to foster many con
sensual ideas, like expanding
free education top-to-bottom and
bringing education to the ghet

tos, as in the Upward Bound
program.
At San Francisco State where
the chapter is going strong, for
example, a speaker bureau Is
approaching many community
organizations such as the Rotary
Club to discuss student prob
lems and needs, the principal
problem now being the student
financial crisis created by Rea
gan's tuition proposals.
In addition, CFS has started
radio-talk shows with good re

sults. The first show netted 10,-
000 telephone calls from inter
ested listeners.
Extremism is the last thing
desired. "Above all else," Fields
said, CFS is "an organization of
mixed feelings, amorphous, beg
ging for ideas."
So, for purposes of getting
ideas and recruiting new mem
bers, CFS is holding an open
meeting at noon tomorrow in
room 267 of Tresidder. All stu
dents are invited.
