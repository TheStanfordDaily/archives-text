# Threat To Burn Gets Action At Cornell
## 
### 
(CPS) — Nine undergradu
ates at Cornell University have
been suspended by their admini
stration for soliciting pledges
for a draft card burning sche
duled for April 15.
The action preceded a deci
sion of the Undergraduate Judi
ciary Board (UJB) to discipline
ten students who solicited
pledges to destroy draft cards.
The Cornell University Faculty
Committee on Student Conduct
(FCSC) upheld the UJB action
last Friday and issued a state
ment saying that it "rejects for
cibly the proposition that action
in accordance with high moral
purpose justifies summary vio
lation of University rules with
out resort to available proce
dures."
The decision by the admini
stration to discipline the stu
dents has threatened a cam
paign by Cornell students to
find 500 collegians willing to
destroy their draft cards at an
April 15 demonstration of the
Spring Mobilization Committee
to End the War in Vietnam in
New York City.
Organizers of the student cam

paign began circulating the
pledge at several college cam
puses early in March. It states,
"We are fully aware that our
action makes us liable for penal
ties of up to five years in prison
and $10,000 in fines. We believe,
however, that the more people
who take part in this action, the
more difficult it will be for the
government to prosecute."
According to the organizers,
"the pledge does not become
binding until 500 people across
the country have signed it."
Robert Greenblatt, executive
vice-president of Spring Mobili
zation, said that by the middle
of March more than 40 Cornell
students signed the pledge de
spite warnings from the college
that setting up recruiting tables
for the action is a violation of
federal laws.
Cornell President James A.
Perkins announced last week
that he supported disciplining
the students. Perkins added that
the university is committed to
the principle that "the primacy
of the university as an open so
ciety and as a place of learning
shall not be subordinated to po
litical and social action."
