# Academic Promise Psychiatric Guide

WASHINGTON, (CPS)—Har
vard students who have shown
great academic promise before
entering college have the high
est likelihood of dropping out
for psychiatric reasons.
So reports Dr. Armand M.
Nicholi, Jr., who made a study
of 1,454 undergraduate men who
dropped out of Harvard during
1955-1960.
According to Nicholi, "the per
centage of students who seek
psychiatric help is four times
greater among the dropouts than
among the general undergrad
uate population." The Harvard
study showed that 38.3 per cent
of the students dropping out of

school consulted a psychiatrist
prior to their withdrawal.
Only eight to ten per cent of
the general undergraduate pop
ulation consulted a psychiatrist
during the five-year period in
which Nicholi's study was con
ducted.
Low Performance
"Although those who drop out
for psychiatric reasons have the
highest academic potential rat
ing of all dropouts, they have
the lowest performance rating,"
Nicholi commented.
Another finding of the Har
vard study was "a highly sig
nificant difference in the rate of
dropout between students with
private school backgrounds and
students with public school
backgrounds. A higher percent
age of private school students
drop out for all reasons."
Students majoring in mathe
matics or the biological sciences
were found to have the highest
academic potential of those who
dropped out, as well as the high
est probability of having drop
ped out for psychiatric reasons.
Those dropouts who had ma
jored in history, government, or
economics had the lowest aca
demic potential and the lowest
probability of dropping out for
psychiatric reasons.
Nicholi noted that "appraxl
mately 24 per cent of each enter
ing class dropped out of Har
vard over a four-year period."
Of this group, 49 per cent re
turned to graduate from Har
vard, while "of the 51 per cent
who did not graduate from Har
vard, approximately 29 per cent
attended and graduated from
other college."
