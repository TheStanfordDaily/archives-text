### 
(CPS) — College neswpaper
editors have traditionally been
plagued by charges of irrespon
sible treatment of letters to the
editor, but a new variation on
the theme has appeared at the
University of Wisconsin at Mil
waukee (UWM).
D. Edward Bolton, a Negro
student at the school, held a one
man picket recently, protesting
that the UWM POST had syste
matically edited the term "black
power" out of a letter submitted
to the paper.
Carrying a sign with the slo
gan, "Is the POST Racially Bi
ased?", Bolton distributed flyers
which contained the complete
text of his letter. He said the

deletions had changed and
clouded his letter's meaning.
Bolton said that "black
power" was the real subject
matter of his letter. In one of
the portions omitted by the
POST, he stated that white
power was a reality and that it
had spawned "black power."
POST editor Patricia Kleiber
commented, "Occasionally let
ters have to be cut when pages
are being made up for lack of
space, which was the case in
this letter."
Kleiber said she suggested to
Bolton that he submit another
letter to the POST, explaining
his complaints. "He said that
he would," she stated.
