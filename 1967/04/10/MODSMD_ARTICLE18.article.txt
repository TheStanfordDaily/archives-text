# Trans Century Tries To Instill Ideals
## 
### STEVEN A. BOOKSHESTER 
The Collegiate Press Service
Few young Americans have
ever mentioned idealism and
earning a good living in the
same breath. But in a Washing
ton slum store-front office, War
ren W. Wiggins is working to
make social change an econo
mically viable career choice.
Formerly deputy director of
the Peace Corps, Wiggins is the
founder and moving force of
TransCentury Corporation,
where the "concern is transi
tion" and the "business is peo
ple—anywhere in the world."
The Harvard-trained econo
mist has designed TransCentury
to "offer services blending man
agement, training and man
power for clients who are en
gaged in the business of the
last third of this century: re
building cities, assisting devel
oping nations, expanding the
opportunities for elimination of
poverty."
Wiggins plans largely to use
former Peace Corps and VISTA
volunteers as TransCentury "as
sociates," but he notes that the
corporation is also interested in
utilizing the skills of students
who have worked in civil rights
and tutorial projects.
As long as they are people
who have "proven themselves
outside the classroom," Trans-
Century's office staff will be
"the last people to be dogmatic
on education or experience," he
states.
Several Hundred Applicants
There appears to be no short
age of these potential staffers.
Several hundred young people
have already indicated their de
sire to serve with TransCen
tury, and the organization is
only three weeks old.
By the end of the year, Wig
gins hopes to have on file the
names of thousands of skilled
individuals able to fill Trans-
Century contracts. While this in
formation is being compiled, the
search for clients is growing.
Diverse Clients
On a recent day, representa
tives of both a major metals
corporation and a controversial
Southern anti-poverty project
were at lunch in Wiggins' head
quarters at 1520 Seventh Street,
N. W.
The presence of such diverse

guests indicates Wiggins' desire
to join forces with any group
involved in "organized, planned,
directed social and economic
change." Possible users of
TransCentury "associates" are
seen as "American cities, local
and state governments, agencies
of the United States, foreign
governments, private corpora
tions, universities and founda
tions."
As Wiggins sees it, Trans-
Century will "guarantee to
young people that the project
has a reasonable chance of suc
cess" and "guarantee to the em
player that the person knows
his business."
Clients Carefully Selected
Clients will not be accepted
if the projects involved do not
fit into the value systems of
TransCentury's young em
ployees. Currently, discussions
are underway for jobs ranging
from participation in the re
development of Brooklyn's pre
dominantly Negro Bedford •
Stuyvesant slum area — in
volving the "reorganization of a
whole community" — to the
training of secretaries, account
ants,clerks, and mechanics for
mining concerns in northern
Nigeria.
Wiggins hopes that his busi
ness will eventually be evenly
divided between domestic and
foreign contracts. In its initial
phase, however, the greatest
effort is being put into finding
clients in the United States.
Aid To South
In the South, TransCentury
may participate in an on-the-job
training program operated by
an association of manufac
turers; and discussions are also
underway for a program which
would aid farmers in the tran

sition from cotton to vegetable
crops.
Other potential Southern proj
ects include the design of a
Job Corps center in cooperation
with an electronics firm and a
large university ,and the de
velopment of several community
action and Head Start programs.
All of these projects are seen
as a way to utilize the "real
availability of people who want
to earn good pay and maintain
involvement in social change,"
Wiggins says.
Committed to Commitment
In a recent speech to a cam
pus audience, Wiggins com
mented, "Our society is not
comfortable with zealots. We
are embarrassed by the deeply
committed and involved. Emo
tion is not in vogue ... especial
ly if involved in raising ques
tions about values. But we need
more people willing to commit
those sins."
Now, with the advent of
TransCentury, Wiggins is try
ing to find a place within society
for those who "venture outside"
the "context of the majority."
Wiggins hopes that, "having
the resources and the income,
America will increasingly be
able to spend more in the area
of social change." He believes
that, as the nature of the society
is increasingly debated, the op
portunities for TransCentury
will grow.
"We are beginning to pay at
tention to those who are, almost
in a heretical sense, raising is
sues about value systems," Wig
gins said in an interview this
week. This concern with dissent,
he stated, "is a tribute to the
enjoined dissenter."
For some of those Americans
who disagree with the status
quo, Wiggins thinks TransCen
tury might serve as a vehicle to
"build a community of interests
that can be a very viable en
tity." It is a community that
might include "a Berkeley pro
fessor, a returned Peace Corps
volunteer from East Pakistan, a
student who has been working
on tutorials, a VISTA volun
teer."
Peace Corps Planner
Sargent Shriver stated, "More
than any other man, Warren W.
Wiggins is responsible for the
miracle of planning and organi
zation that has brought the
Peace Corps into being."
In 1962, Wiggins was a recip
ient of the Arthur S. Fleming
Award as one of the "Ten Out
standing Young Men" in Fed
eral government. He is a Har
vard-trained economist and
served as a foreign aid admini
strator.
Interested in "the design proc
ess" with which he was involved
in the Peace Corps, Wiggins
noted that the creation of an in
novating organization like
TransCentury was the "finest
opportunity I had" in "seeking

out another thing to try and
do."
Former PCV's Enthusiastic
His one-room office receives a
steady stream of former Peace
Corps volunteers and staffers
who are, in the words of one
Peace Corps employee, "ready
to do anything to work with
Wiggins."
Wiggins started TransCen
tury "knowing it's a problem of
how far you can go and still
be wanted." There are govern
mental bodies, he noted, which
will be unwilling to work with
the kind of young people who
are interested in associating
themselves with the new corp
oration.
And his impressive record of
government service is no guar
antee that the contracts of
TransCentury needs to survive
will present themselves. But
there is also a statement he
made to a group of college stu
dents:

"... There are those, who
with the receipt of honor, grow
in strength and independence
and provide a new leadership —
a leadership respected in part
because it was honored — a new
leadership that dares to risk
past honor in the hope of future
gains for society."
For such individuals, Wiggins
told the students, the reward,
"... — at home and abroad —
will be a world more fit to live
in. Their monument will be
children who love instead of
fear. Their honor will be found
in the lives of human beings
who have learned how not to
fight and how not to starve.
Their followers will be legion."
