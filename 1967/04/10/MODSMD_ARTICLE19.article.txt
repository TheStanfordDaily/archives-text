### 
The Committee for Political
Studies of the Institute for the
Study of Contemporary Cultures
has completed, under the direc
tion of Chairman Larry Orwig,
an intensive analysis of the
structure and organizational re
quirements of the lIR. The Com
mittee began its study in Feb
ruary at the request of lIR Fi
nancial Director Ronald Royce,
and has incorporated its findings
in a new constitution for the
lIR.
The previous lIR Constitution
has not been operative for sev
eral years. The new constitution
specifies five administrative di
visions, and includes procedures
for instituting projects, electing
officers, and forming joint proj
ects. It will go into effect when
approved by the Policy Board of
the lIR, and when portions of it
have been accepted by the Stu
dent Legislature.
Continuing its reorganization
for the coming year, the lIR has
elected James Ching, a junior
majoring in English and Politi
cal Science as its new president.
As president, Ching has control
of appointments of lIR depart
ment heads.
