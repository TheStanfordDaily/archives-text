### 
It's "back to the scene of a
triumph" this summer when the
American Conservatory Theatre
returns to attend the 1967 Stan
ford Summer Festival for four
weeks, July 18 through Aug. 13.
Three totally new productions
-—and a minimum of six works
—will be offered in repertory by
the versatile ACT for its contri
bution to the "Focus on Ameri
ca" theme of Stanford's fourth
annual Summer Festival pro
gram.
Announcing the return en
gagement of the celebrated thea
ter company, Festival Director
Virgil K. Whitaker said, "We
are concerned this summer with
surveying American artistic am
bition and genius, and we are
delighted to have this exciting
theater company with us again."
ACT made its first West Coast
appearance one year ago at
Stanford's 1960 Summer Festi
val with a dazzling repertory of
nine productions. Critics and
theater goers alike were stunned
at the consistent excellence of
the troupe.
