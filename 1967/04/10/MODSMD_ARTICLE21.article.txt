# Marquess, Duffy Power Tribe Wins
## Teamwork Leapin' Lizzards! 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The hot bats of Mark Marquess and
Frank Duffy carried Stanford to a
pair of 7-3 victories over the Air Force
Academy in a doubleheader Saturday.
Friday's game with the California
Angels was rained out.
Marquess went 5 for 7 including an
opposite field home run in the second
game. Marquess has boosted his aver
age to a sizzling .500. Unofficially he is
18 for 36.
Duffy showed promise of returning
to last year's all-league form with his
four hits in the doubleheader and his
fine glove work.
Bad Maneuvers
With the help of some sloppy Air
Force fielding, Stanford scored three

runs In the fourth inning of the first
game to set the day's pace. The Tribe
added single runs in the sixth and
seventh and a pair of runs on Ron
Shotts long double in the eighth.
In the second game it was Duffy
and Marquess who fittingly enough
started the scoring for the Indians.
Duffy lead off with a line single, and
Dick Swan then belted a line drive to
deep left for an out. Marquess fol
lowed with a high fly over the left
field fence.
It was Marquess again in the third
when Stanford added three more runs.
Marquess walked, advanced to third
on Shotts' single and stole home when
the catcher tried to throw out Shotts
who was stealing second.

Duffy adcted two more Indian scoret
in the sixth. He singled in Marty Erck,
stole second and scored on a single by
Mike Ammirate.
It was a rough day for pitchers ais
many walks were issued by Stanford
hurlers. Part of the problem has beett
the weather which has kept the pitch
ers out of acti .n the last few week&
The final preleague tune up takeii
place Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. against
USF at San Francisco.
