# OSU Drubs Card Trackmen 98-47
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
Seven meet records were broken
and one tied Saturday as the Oregon
State Beavers romped to a 98-47 vic
tory over Stanford at Foothill College.
The Beaver's win evened the series
between the two schools at two wins
apiece.
Pancoast Stars
OSU's Steve Pancoast had a hand in
three of the record performances. He
defeated Stanford's Jim Ward in the
440 with a time of 46.4 to crack the
previous mark, set by Ward last year.
Ward's second place time of 47.4 tied
that mark.
Pancoast came back to tie the 220
mark with a winning time of 21.5 and
also anchored the 440 relay team to a
time of 40.8, eclipsing the old record
of 41.6, held by Stanford. The Tribe
also broke the record, running 41.4.
Bud Walsh and Jim Letterer pro
vided Stanford enthusiasts with some
of their few thrills of the day.
Walsh Sets Long Jump Mark
Walsh, a doubtful competitor for the
meet earlier this week, won the long
jump with a tremendous leap of 25'-
2Vt", breaking the meet record and
placing him fourth in Stanford history
in that event. Bud then came back in
the high hurdles to win going away
with a time of 14.8. Craig Vaughan
also had the best jump of his life,
taking second with 24'-ll%".
Letterer won the only other running

event for the Cards, covering the 2-
mile distance in 9:05.4 to break the old
meet standard of 9:09.8 held by Boyd
of Oregon State. Jim picked up the
tempo after a very slow beginning
and came home with a blazing 60.0
final lap.
The duel between Letterer and Ter
ry Smith in the 2-mile didn't develop
when Smith chose to forego the long
er race in favor of the 880.
New Half-mile Record
Smith may have found a new event
in the half mile. He won it by over
two seconds with a 1:49.2 clocking.
Jack O'Brien continued to improve for
Stanford as he took third in 1:52.0.
The two other meet records were
set by Stanford.
Lan Arnold took one jump in the
triple-jump to win at 47'-ll 1 /&", eclip
sing the old mark of 46'-2 1 /4" set by
Tony Albin of OSU. Lan then retired
for the day to pamper a severe heal
bruise, one of the hazards of the leg
shattering event.
Peter Boyce won the high jump at
6'-10" to break the old mark of 4".
Kelly of the Beavers also cleared 6'-
10", but Boyce was awarded first on
the basis of fevvter misses.
Jim Eshelman saved both himself
and Stanford embarrassment by win
ning the pole vault at the paltry
height of 15'-3".
Eshelman passed all the heights un

til 15'-3" and when it came time for
him to vault, he found that all three
Oregon State men were out of the
competition after failing to clear 15'.
Dennis Philips, who was supposed to
give Jim a run for the money, dropped
out after landing on his head outside
the pit on his first vault.
By this time all the other events
were over, and quick mental tabula
tion showed that, unless Eshelman
won, the Beavers would score over
100 points, the score in track circles

that spells a complete stomping.
The suspense grew as Eshelman,
who has done missed his first
try badly. The large crowd, which had
shifted to the pole vault pit at the end
of the mile relay, began to wonder if
it was going to be a bad day for him.
After a brief rest, Jim again charged
down the runway and this time sailed
over the bar with feet to spare.
The crowd cheered and everybody
went home, especially Oregon State
with their 98-47 victory.
