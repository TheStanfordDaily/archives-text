# Three Indians To Swim In Pan-Ams
## Second Best Breast 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
DALLAS, Texas, April B—Three
Stanford swimmers qualified for the
1967 Pan American Team while the
nucleus of Stanford's swimming team
pulled the Santa Clara Swim Club to
its first Indoor National AAU champ
ionship at Southern Methodist Uni
versity.
Dick Roth won the 400 individual
medley in 4:09.5 his best time by 2Vi
second, sand took second in the 200
IM. Bob Momsen repeated his second
place NCAA performance in the 200
breaststroke to earn a ticket to Winni
peg-
Greg Buckingham was stricken

with food poisoning after qualifying
in the 500 free style in 4:40.9, and had
to scratch the finals. After a sleepless
night at the SMU infirmary, Bucking
ham took second in the 200 freestyle
in 1:42.2 to qualify for the Pan Am
team.
Schollander Wins
Yale's Don Schollander won the 200
in 1:41.2, shading Buckingham's Amer
ican record by .1 second. Schollander
took third in the 100 free and also
anchored Yale's winning 400 and 800
free relays.
Mike Burton of UCLA shattered his
American record for 1650 freestyle
with an incredible 16:08.0 ... an aver
age of 58.6 for each 100. The nearest
competitor was more than 30 seconds
back. Burton won the 500 in 4:37.0
and also took second in the 200 fly
in 1:52.3.
The real surprise of the meet had to
be the performances of George Haines'
Santa Clara High School swimmers,
which include a number of Stanford
hopefuls.
High School Prodigy
Mark Spitz, a junior, established
himself as the fastest butterflier in
the world as he won the 200 in 1:50.6
and later broke the 50 second barrier

with a 49.9 100 fly. Spitz also swam
a 1:56.6 200 IM.
Fred Haywood won the 100 back
stroke with a jaw-dropping 52.6—
faster than his national high school
record by a second and a half and the
second fastest in the world.
Haywood didn't qualify in the 200
back, but his teammate Mitch Ivey
took over with a 1:56.7, good for fourth
place behind USC freshman Mark
Mader's record 1:54.4.
Bob Jamison, a Santa Clara senior,
blasted out a 467 100 freestyle to take
sixth place.
Fastest Medley Ever
Santa Clara High school has the
awesome (and imminent) potential to
smash the American record for the 400
medley relay by two seconds UCLA
holds it now, 3:29.5.
High school students must swim
"unattached" in the winter AAU's, and
consequently cannot enter a relay nor
score points as a team.
Santa Clara High School would have
taken fourth in the AAU's and had the
high schoolers been able to compete
for the Santa Clara Swim Club, the
meet score would have been some
form cf sadism.
Santa Clara's 400 medley relay took
the Swim Club's only first place aside

from Roth's 400 IM performance. Jim
Malley of Colorado State led -off with
a 54.4 backstroke, and then Stanford
took over.
Mom en I? oaks 1:00
Momsen broke a minute for the first
time with a 59.6 breaststroke, but
Santa Clara was washing in third
place. Luis Nlcolao ate up the field
with a 50.1 butterfly leg. Bill Meyer
anchored in 4G.2, holding off USC's 100
freestyle champion, Don Havens.
Stanford's Mike Wall swam the fast
est of his life, 4:43.2, to take"flfth'"in
the 500 but ?id not equal his NCAA
times in the 200 free or 1650. Luis
Nicolao, BiJl hvjyer, and Pete Siebeyt
likewise could not repeat their NCAA
peak efforts.
Free Relays ftcore
Santa Clara's 'A' and 'B' 400 free re
lays—including 6 Stanford swimmers
—took fourth and sixth. The two 800
relays took second and fourth. *
Santa Clara Swim Club overcarpe
a 20 point deficit to Indiana's divers to
beat the Hoosiers, 65-63, in the final
relay. Yale finished third with 50
points, ridmg on strong sprint -per
formances, USC : whose depth- could
not show through in a meet where OTily
the top six pl-us scored, tooJCCparth
with 43 points. j •
