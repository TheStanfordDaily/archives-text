# For Education
## 
### 
It is no new discovery that Stanford's resi
dence system hardly contributes to the educa
tional experience expected in a university. Very
little educational interaction takes place in the
context of the dormitory or fraternity house.
For undergraduates, graduate student contact
is limited to resident assistants, while faculty
contact is virtually non-existent. Freshmen are
only allowed contact with upperclassmen in a
ratio of thirty to one, while many upperclass
men are denied the potentially invigorating
influence of freshmen in their residences. And
separation of the sexes is, of course, still official
policy.
In many cases, Wilbur Hall being the most
notorious though not the only example, the
physical facilities themselves are a near-insur
mountable obstacle. The residences most con
ducive to education and development are the
cluster houses presently used by a number of
fraternities. They have the advantage of allow
ing students to live in pleasant surroundings
rather than in a concrete jungle. They provide
better facilities for gathering in places other
than student rooms and are the only men's resi
dences providing two rooms for two students.
But their greatest merit lies in that they are
arranged to house an optimal number of stu
dents for meaningful group interaction.
Unfortunately, the opportunity to live in this,
type of residence is limited to those who prefer
(raternity living. Male students not interested
in joining a fraternity, but desiring to live on
campus, find themselves restricted to deper
sonalized cell-blocks.
Ironically, the fraternities have not even
taken advantage of the educational potential
of their facilities. It took the Grove Project
to demonstrate that the aspects of a residential
education so blatantly lacking everywhere else
on campus can be combined to create a stimu
lating residence in which education has come
to mean more than just creating classrooms in

a dormitory. And what is also very apparent at
the Grove is that the physical surroundings
have much to do with the achievement of an
educational environment.
The Grove Project is now faced with the
possibility of dissolution, simply because the
Phi Delts may have to move back into their
house next Fall. It has been suggested that
the Grove Project be continued in a Wilbur
house next year, but this is certainly not an
inviting solution.
The University will soon have to decide the
fate of both the Phi Delts and the Grove Proj
ect. Regardless of whether it wants to, it will
be deciding what is best for education at
Stanford, the return of a fraternity which does
not promise to contribute to the professed
aims of the University or continuation of a bold
and successful experiment. In the last three
months, the Grove has demonstrated that the
concept of residence education can be more
than a myth; the Phi Delts have demonstrated
only that they can violate probation indiscri
minately.
The University has no legal obligation to
allow the Phi Delts to return to their former
house; but it is under pressure from alumni
who contributed large amounts to build that
house five years ago. If the University does de
cide to allow the Phi Delts back on campus,
it should give serious consideration to the al
ternative of housing them in a Wilbur house,
rather than the Grove Project.
Stanford has very actively built quantites of
attractive housing for fraternities, but it has
continually stalled in providing anything com
parable for other living groups. It is time for
the University to redress this inequity and be
gin making decisions on the basis of educa
tional merit, rather than alumni dollars. Guar
anteeing continuation of the Grove Project in
its present house would be a very worthwhile
start.
