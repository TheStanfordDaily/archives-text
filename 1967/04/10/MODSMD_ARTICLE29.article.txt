## How Fair Are Admissions? 
### Bob Fishman 
After the Stanford Admissions
Office mails out 8,040 letters
this week, most of the 6,240 re
jectees will join students and
faculty here on the campus in
doubting the wisdom and the
fairness of the present admis
sions policy.
Statistics gathered by Dr.
John Black, director of Counsel
ing and Testing, lend some cre
dence to these doubts, especially
those showing the relatively
small percentage of Jews, Ro
man Catholics and Negroes who
are admitted each year.
But most campus criticism
deals with more than simple
discrimination. Professor Albert
Guerard, for example, suggested
that"We need students who are
neither athletes nor student
body presidents but have real
creative talents."
(According to Dr. Black,
57.3% of the Class of '70 were
presidents of one or more stu
dent organization; 50.2% of the
men won a varsity letter in a
sport; but only 4.5% of all fresh
men won a price or award in
art.)
Extroverted Athlete-Leaders
The best description of the ex
troverted athlete-leaders, that
Holy Grail of the Admissions Of
fice, was offered by Rixford
Snyder himself in an article
written for the October '61 issue
of the Stanford Review.
In order to guide those alum
ni who might be interested in
recommending a promising high
school student, he presented two
actual applications, a boy's and
a girl's, as standards against
which the alums could measure
their potential proteges.
The boy, whom Snyder named
"John Paul Jones," was cap
tain of the varsity football team,
president of the student body,

and valedictorian with a 4.0
GPA.
His counselor remarks, "John
was captain of the football team
and an inspired leader at all
times."
Pure Charm
The girl, "Betsy Ann Ross,"
is perhaps less outstanding sco
lastically, but, as her counselor
points out, "she is a delightful
combination of intellectual abi
lity and pure charm."
She was Homecoming Queen,
Student Body Secretary, and
star of the Girls' Tennis Team.
Snyder hastens to assure
doubting alumni that these two
"prototypes" are not atypical
of our student body.
Stanford students, he claims,
disprove the time-worn cliche
that brains, beauty, brawn, per
sonality and leadership cannot
be found in the same person."
To prove his point, Snyder
cites these characteristics of the
men of the Class of '65:
Football Galore
"Of the 916 boys in the class,
244, or 26.6 per cent, won var
sity letters in high school foot
ball; 214 achieved this in track
(21.4%) and 176 in basketball
(19.7%); 107 served as student
body presidents and all 916
were active in some phase of
high school life."
This "wide range of interests
and talents" is perhaps more in
teresting for what it leaves out
than for what it includes.
Though Dr. Snyder's space was
limited, he might have men
tioned that the guy who spends
his afternoons reading Dostoev
sky or devising a new proof for
the Pythagorean Theorem often
makes a more outstanding con
tribution to Stanford than do
many student body presidents.
He might have pointed out,
as Dr. Black has done recently,

that for many straight-A stu
dents, "getting A's acquires a
compulsive quality ... Such stu
dents contribute disproportion
ately to a grade-oriented atmo
sphere, and they lack the flex
ibility and courage to learn for
learnings' sake."
Who Leads?
He might have remarked that
"leadership" all-too-often means
conforming most thoroughly to
the expectations of ones peers
and teachers.
And he might have suggested
that astronomic GPA's and ex
ultant recommendations are less
impressive in the context of
high schools whose stock-in
trade is a brand of anti-intellec
tualism that encourages stu
dents to turn their intellects into
tools for their own advance
ment.
The high school student who
insists on thinking critically is
soon labeled a "rebel," and his
grades, his recommendations,
and his chances for admission
to Stanford suffer. And yet,
what Stanford and any other
university needs is more "reb
els."
Dr. Snyder might have men
tioned all this and more, but he
did not. I think it's time some
one in authority did.


"Wait â€” nobody's perfect!"
