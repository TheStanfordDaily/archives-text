# Ford Grant To Aid PhD Students
## 
### 
Stanford, the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, and eight other
leading universities will receive grants
totaling $41.5 million from the Ford
Foundation to strengthen and accel
erate doctoral education in the social
sciences and humanities over the next
seven years, the Foundation disclosed
in New York yesterday.
Stanford will receive $4 million, en
abling it to provide full, four-year
financial support to all entering Ph.D.
students in humanities and social
sciences, starting this fall. Berkeley
will receive $4.3 million to finance an
experimental 15-quarter Ph.D. pro
gram in eight departments.
The Ford grant will help establish
a pattern of continuous, full-time
study and apprentice teaching, in most
cases by a regular four-year program
leading to the Ph.D. Some 10,500 stu
dents will be directly affected by the
program.
In a joint statement, Graduate Dean
Virgil Whitaker of Stanford, Sanford
S. Elbert of Berkeley, and eight others
who will administer the funds at re
cipient institutions said:
"The major current weakness in
doctoral education is its profligate
wastage of the nation's finest talent.
This is particularly evident in the hu
manities and social sciences. Even in
leading institutions fewer than half
of the students embarking on doctoral
studies in these fields eventually re
ceive the Ph.D. degree.
"Those who succeed take a dispro
portionately long time to do so. The
median Ph.D. now takes seven-and-a
half years from the time the student
begins graduate work (compared to

five years in the natural sciences).
Fewer than 15 per cent complete the
doctorate in four years.
"These figures reflect traditional
patterns of doctoral education which
no longer commensurate with the
needs of higher education in the latter
half of the 20th century. They work
hardships on our best students. The
result is an inadequate inflow of new
young scholars into teaching and re
search in the humanities and social
sciences. They lead to a lowering of
morale throughout the academic pro
fession."
The program provides for close
faculty supervison of Ph.D. candi
dates throughout their study program,
which will normally include a period
of training as apprentice university
teachers.
In several of the participating uni
versities, including Stanford, the pro
gram will embrace virtually all doctor
al students in the humanities and soc
ial sciences. In the others a substan
tial proportion of such students will be
covered.
In their statement, the deans said:
"The pilot program should permit
the departmental facilities to achieve
in doctoral education what many have
long wanted. The availablility of finan
cial support for continuous study
should enable them to establish a regu
larized schedule for the completion of
all degree reguirements (including
course work, comprehensive examin
ations and the dissertation).
"They should be able to improve the
supervision of doctoral candidates by
faculty advisers. We hope that the
pilot program will have the following
specific effects:

" —To raise the quality of the Ph.D.
degree by making more effective use
of faculty resources.
" —To reduce the number of drop
outs through attrition.
" —To minimize p os t-admission
wastage by promoting stricter admis
sions, review, and retention policies.
" —To improve the quality of college
teaching. In contrast to present prac

tices whereby graduate students us
ually interrupt their doctoral studies
to teach or to divide their time between
teaching and study, the teaching re
quirement in the public program will
be integrated with the student's de
gree studies. Improved teacher train
ing, through better supervision of
graduate apprentices by regular fac
ulty, will be emphasized."
