# Letters To The Editor
## A. Christian Defense Of War Debates 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I write this because I feel it
my duty to do so. I admire the
courage, though I dispute the
wisdom with which Professors
Robert M. Brown, Michael No
vak, and many others on the
campus have publicly declared
their opposition to the present
war in Vietnam. Brown and No
vak in particular have, as pro
fessed Christians, performed the
hard yet salutary task of com
pelling other professed Chris
tians to declare themselves. They
have in fact shamed me into
. peaking.
I do not, however, believe that
they are right or theologically
correct. Let there be no mistake,
first of all, about the profoundly
unchristian character of all war.
The language of the Sermon on
the Mount is unequivocal. How,
then, can a Christian ever advo
cate any war? I will not pretend
that a short, simple answer can
be adequate but I will say that
the best short, simple answer I
now know is this: war is justifi
able in Christian terms only
when the alternative is worse.
In some sense, I think this was
true of the war against the
Nazis; in a more qualified sense,
also of the American Civil War
and of some other wars, —espe-
cially those that prevented the
domination of whole peoples by
palpably unjust, cruel and tryan
nical regimes.
I do not think that even such
wars are wholly and always
justifiable particularly if they
may involve the controlled or un
controlled use of genocidal wea
pons such as atomic bombs. Yet
I believe that absolute pacifism
is indefensible in a world where
such pacificism may mean the
predominance of preventable
and extreme evil. What is called
original sin means just this, —
that we cannot practice an abso
lute ethic because we must in
fact choose between quite rela
tive ethics in each of which
there is a very considerable
amount of wrong. I am old

enough to have witnessed pacif
ist opposition to any sort of re
armament against Nazi Ger
many: surely such opposition
)must take some responsibility
for what happened to several
million Jews. Pacificists also are
sinners.
Vietnam
The present war in Vietnam is
very different from the second
World War. The issues, for one
thing, are much less clearcut. I
cannot here attempt to discuss
the vast literature of the subject.
But I will venture the opinion
(for which certainly a great deal
of support can be adduced) that
it is unique not so much for its
complicated origins as for the
uncompromising determination
with which it has been waged.
Every day brings its rumors as
to the chances of negotiation
with North Vietnam but the
overwhelming evidence is that
North Vietnam will not negoti
ate. It has thus put the United
States on a spot.
That the United States has
spurned, spurns or wants to
spurn the chance of negotiation
seems on the face of it unlikely
even if only for the reason that
the Johnson administration has
been steadily losing prestige as
the war has gone on. (Witness
the last public opinion polls). On
the other hand there is no evi
dence that the main (Republic
an) opposition to Johnson wants
to drop the war: on the con
trary, it is the thesis of several
leading .Republicans that we
must fight to win and win quick
ly though the cost may be escal
ation beyond anything now
known.
But the fact remains that the
present United States govern
ment seems, on all the evidence
available to us, to regard the
war as an inevitable alternative
to an unthinkable surrender. One
can, of course, argue that the
conduct of the war should be
altered in any one of numerous
particulars but it would be sheer
hypocrisy to pretend that war,

however conducted, is not a pro
cess of killing, maiming and
otherwise destroying human be
ings. One can also argue for uni
lateral withdrawal. In either
case, the consequences, as I see
it are likely to be extremely un
pleasant in both the short and
long runs. Any responsible gov
ernment must weigh these con
sequences especially in the light
of their effect upon an eventual
nuclear war. What, for example,
would unilateral withdrawal do
to South Vietnam, to world opin
ion and just as important, to
United States politics? What will
continuance of the war do in all
these same respects?
Answers?
Now I do not pretend that I
know the answers to these ques
tions. What I think I know is
that the answers are not easy.
What I fear is that the self
righteousness and violence of
some pacifists and warresist
ers may contribute very effect
ively to the victory of the most
irresponsible and bellicose ele
ments in our country. In a very
small and petty way, we have
seen this happen in the recent
Humphrey visit to the campus.
This does not mean that I ap
prove of all that the Johnson ad
ministration has done in Viet
nam. What I am now pleading
for, however, is more honesty
and less self-righteousness here
at Stanford. I do not myself
think that either Lyndon John
sun or Hubert Humphrey are dis
honest men. It is conceivable,
however, that they need help. A
Christian act would be to help
them right here by means of spe
cific, reasonable, tolerant, public
and reiterated debate. But that
is not the kind of thing we have
recently seen on this campus.
I would, therefore, remind my
fellow Christians that they also
are sinners. And I would plead
most earnestly for a series of
serious public debates leading to
the formulation of a quite spe
cific 'Stanford paper on Viet
nam'. This is a life and death

matter on which Stanford at its
informed best should speak a
word.
The time for both silence and
noisy intolerance has passed. For
once, let the winds of freedom
blow somewhere to some pur
pose.

Editor, The Daily:
Since Mr. Smith chooses to
communicate with me solely
through the pages of the Daily
(the medium is the message, evi
dently), I shall reply to him in
your pages. The first meeting of
US 163, as he should have
learned last week, is scheduled
for tomorrow night. At that
time he will learn that the con
clusions of whatever research
he wishes to conduct are not go
ing to be dictated by anybody.
In the meantime, if he wishes to
do some research on research,
he would do well to read Elinor
Langer's series in the issues of

• Stern Shaft
Editor, The Dally:
The purpose of this letter is
to ask the administration what
is going to happen to Stern
Hall if the recent proposals for
coeducational housing at Wil
bur are put into effect next fall.
From what I can gather by
reading The Daily, it has been
assumed that although women
would help improve morale, etc.
at Wilbur, they would not have
the same effect on Stern Hall.
Speaking strictly for myself, I
would like to say that this as
sumption is unfounded. I have
no doubt that my morale, etc.
would rise considerably and
often if the administration
would move some women in
around here. In fact if women
are moved into Wilbur and not

into Stern I will quite likely
pick up my morale, etc. and try
to move into Wilbur with them.
And I would have serious doubts
about the morale or etc. of any
Stern men who didn't follow
my excellent example. In short,
if the University does not great
ly increase the number of enter
ing eunuchs in next year's
freshmen class Stern Hall may
be empty.
Why don't we have some
women living in Stern, officially,
next fall? Why isn't Grove Pro
ject going to be moved into
Stern next fall? If you haven't
guessed, my unbiased opniion is
that while Wilbur is getting the
women, Stern is getting the
shaft.

• Bad For Business
Editor, The Daily:
Bravos to Jerry Hiken and the
Inadmissable Evidence cast — to
have affected Mr. Sanchez so
deeply that he was unable to
cerebrate for the frustration and
pain he carried out of the thea

But please, Daily, either ask
Mr. Sanchez to wait until morn
ing to write his reviews in the
future, or find someone else with
more head than heart. It's bad
for business.

Answers?
Now I do not pretend that I
know the answers to these ques
tions. What I think I know is
that the answers are not easy.
What I fear is that the self
righteousness and violence of
some pacifists and warresist
ers may contribute very effect
ively to the victory of the most
irresponsible and bellicose ele
ments in our country. In a very
small and petty way, we have
seen this happen in the recent
Humphrey visit to the campus.
This does not mean that I ap
prove of all that the Johnson ad
ministration has done in Viet
nam. What I am now pleading
for, however, is more honesty
and less self-righteousness here
at Stanford. I do not myself
think that either Lyndon John
sun or Hubert Humphrey are dis
honest men. It is conceivable,
however, that they need help. A
Christian act would be to help
them right here by means of spe
cific, reasonable, tolerant, public
and reiterated debate. But that
is not the kind of thing we have
recently seen on this campus.
I would, therefore, remind my
fellow Christians that they also
are sinners. And I would plead
most earnestly for a series of
serious public debates leading to
the formulation of a quite spe
cific 'Stanford paper on Viet
nam'. This is a life and death

matter on which Stanford at its
informed best should speak a
word.
The time for both silence and
noisy intolerance has passed. For
once, let the winds of freedom
blow somewhere to some pur
pose.

Editor, The Dally:
The purpose of this letter is
to ask the administration what
is going to happen to Stern
Hall if the recent proposals for
coeducational housing at Wil
bur are put into effect next fall.
From what I can gather by
reading The Daily, it has been
assumed that although women
would help improve morale, etc.
at Wilbur, they would not have
the same effect on Stern Hall.
Speaking strictly for myself, I
would like to say that this as
sumption is unfounded. I have
no doubt that my morale, etc.
would rise considerably and
often if the administration
would move some women in
around here. In fact if women
are moved into Wilbur and not

into Stern I will quite likely
pick up my morale, etc. and try
to move into Wilbur with them.
And I would have serious doubts
about the morale or etc. of any
Stern men who didn't follow
my excellent example. In short,
if the University does not great
ly increase the number of enter
ing eunuchs in next year's
freshmen class Stern Hall may
be empty.
Why don't we have some
women living in Stern, officially,
next fall? Why isn't Grove Pro

Stern next fall? If you haven't

that while Wilbur is getting the

THMOAS C. MOSER
Executive Head,
Department of English
Editor, The Dally:
I write this because I feel it
my duty to do so. I admire the
courage, though I dispute the
wisdom with which Professors
Robert M. Brown, Michael No
vak, and many others on the
campus have publicly declared
their opposition to the present
war in Vietnam. Brown and No
vak in particular have, as pro
fessed Christians, performed the
hard yet salutary task of com
pelling other professed Chris
tians to declare themselves. They
have in fact shamed me into
. peaking.
I do not, however, believe that
they are right or theologically
correct. Let there be no mistake,
first of all, about the profoundly
unchristian character of all war.
The language of the Sermon on
the Mount is unequivocal. How,
then, can a Christian ever advo
cate any war? I will not pretend
that a short, simple answer can
be adequate but I will say that
the best short, simple answer I
now know is this: war is justifi
able in Christian terms only
when the alternative is worse.
In some sense, I think this was
true of the war against the
Nazis; in a more qualified sense,
also of the American Civil War
and of some other wars, —espe-
cially those that prevented the
domination of whole peoples by
palpably unjust, cruel and tryan
nical regimes.
I do not think that even such
wars are wholly and always
justifiable particularly if they
may involve the controlled or un
controlled use of genocidal wea
pons such as atomic bombs. Yet
I believe that absolute pacifism
is indefensible in a world where
such pacificism may mean the
predominance of preventable
and extreme evil. What is called
original sin means just this, —
that we cannot practice an abso
lute ethic because we must in
fact choose between quite rela
tive ethics in each of which
there is a very considerable
amount of wrong. I am old

enough to have witnessed pacif
ist opposition to any sort of re
armament against Nazi Ger
many: surely such opposition
)must take some responsibility
for what happened to several
million Jews. Pacificists also are
sinners.
Vietnam
The present war in Vietnam is
very different from the second
World War. The issues, for one
thing, are much less clearcut. I
cannot here attempt to discuss
the vast literature of the subject.
But I will venture the opinion
(for which certainly a great deal
of support can be adduced) that
it is unique not so much for its
complicated origins as for the
uncompromising determination
with which it has been waged.
Every day brings its rumors as
to the chances of negotiation
with North Vietnam but the
overwhelming evidence is that
North Vietnam will not negoti
ate. It has thus put the United
States on a spot.
That the United States has
spurned, spurns or wants to
spurn the chance of negotiation
seems on the face of it unlikely
even if only for the reason that
the Johnson administration has
been steadily losing prestige as
the war has gone on. (Witness
the last public opinion polls). On
the other hand there is no evi
dence that the main (Republic
an) opposition to Johnson wants
to drop the war: on the con
trary, it is the thesis of several
leading .Republicans that we
must fight to win and win quick
ly though the cost may be escal
ation beyond anything now
known.
But the fact remains that the
present United States govern
ment seems, on all the evidence
available to us, to regard the
war as an inevitable alternative
to an unthinkable surrender. One
can, of course, argue that the
conduct of the war should be
altered in any one of numerous
particulars but it would be sheer
hypocrisy to pretend that war,

however conducted, is not a pro
cess of killing, maiming and
otherwise destroying human be
ings. One can also argue for uni
lateral withdrawal. In either
case, the consequences, as I see
it are likely to be extremely un
pleasant in both the short and
long runs. Any responsible gov
ernment must weigh these con
sequences especially in the light
of their effect upon an eventual
nuclear war. What, for example,
would unilateral withdrawal do
to South Vietnam, to world opin
ion and just as important, to
United States politics? What will
continuance of the war do in all
these same respects?
Answers?
Now I do not pretend that I
know the answers to these ques
tions. What I think I know is
that the answers are not easy.
What I fear is that the self
righteousness and violence of
some pacifists and warresist
ers may contribute very effect

• Superb
Editor, The Daily:
In case anyone either took

fully acted.
THMOAS C. MOSER
Executive Head,
Department of English
Editor, The Dally:
I write this because I feel it
my duty to do so. I admire the
courage, though I dispute the
wisdom with which Professors
Robert M. Brown, Michael No
vak, and many others on the
campus have publicly declared
their opposition to the present
war in Vietnam. Brown and No
vak in particular have, as pro
fessed Christians, performed the
hard yet salutary task of com
pelling other professed Chris
tians to declare themselves. They
have in fact shamed me into
. peaking.
I do not, however, believe that
they are right or theologically
correct. Let there be no mistake,
first of all, about the profoundly
unchristian character of all war.
The language of the Sermon on
the Mount is unequivocal. How,
then, can a Christian ever advo
cate any war? I will not pretend
that a short, simple answer can
be adequate but I will say that
the best short, simple answer I
now know is this: war is justifi
able in Christian terms only
when the alternative is worse.
In some sense, I think this was
true of the war against the
Nazis; in a more qualified sense,
also of the American Civil War
and of some other wars, —espe-
cially those that prevented the
domination of whole peoples by
palpably unjust, cruel and tryan
nical regimes.
I do not think that even such
wars are wholly and always
justifiable particularly if they
may involve the controlled or un
controlled use of genocidal wea
pons such as atomic bombs. Yet
I believe that absolute pacifism
is indefensible in a world where
such pacificism may mean the
predominance of preventable
and extreme evil. What is called
original sin means just this, —
that we cannot practice an abso
lute ethic because we must in
fact choose between quite rela
tive ethics in each of which
there is a very considerable
amount of wrong. I am old

enough to have witnessed pacif
ist opposition to any sort of re
armament against Nazi Ger
many: surely such opposition
)must take some responsibility
for what happened to several
million Jews. Pacificists also are
sinners.
Vietnam
The present war in Vietnam is
very different from the second
World War. The issues, for one
thing, are much less clearcut. I
cannot here attempt to discuss
the vast literature of the subject.
But I will venture the opinion
(for which certainly a great deal
of support can be adduced) that
it is unique not so much for its
complicated origins as for the
uncompromising determination
with which it has been waged.
Every day brings its rumors as
to the chances of negotiation
with North Vietnam but the
overwhelming evidence is that
North Vietnam will not negoti
ate. It has thus put the United
States on a spot.
That the United States has
spurned, spurns or wants to
spurn the chance of negotiation
seems on the face of it unlikely
even if only for the reason that
the Johnson administration has
been steadily losing prestige as
the war has gone on. (Witness
the last public opinion polls). On
the other hand there is no evi
dence that the main (Republic
an) opposition to Johnson wants
to drop the war: on the con
trary, it is the thesis of several
leading .Republicans that we
must fight to win and win quick
ly though the cost may be escal
ation beyond anything now
known.
But the fact remains that the
present United States govern
ment seems, on all the evidence
available to us, to regard the
war as an inevitable alternative
to an unthinkable surrender. One
can, of course, argue that the
conduct of the war should be
altered in any one of numerous
particulars but it would be sheer
hypocrisy to pretend that war,

however conducted, is not a pro
cess of killing, maiming and
otherwise destroying human be
ings. One can also argue for uni
lateral withdrawal. In either
case, the consequences, as I see
it are likely to be extremely un
pleasant in both the short and
long runs. Any responsible gov
ernment must weigh these con
sequences especially in the light
of their effect upon an eventual
nuclear war. What, for example,
would unilateral withdrawal do
to South Vietnam, to world opin
ion and just as important, to
United States politics? What will
continuance of the war do in all
these same respects?
Answers?
Now I do not pretend that I
know the answers to these ques
tions. What I think I know is
that the answers are not easy.
What I fear is that the self
righteousness and violence of
some pacifists and warresist
ers may contribute very effect
ively to the victory of the most
irresponsible and bellicose ele
ments in our country. In a very
small and petty way, we have
seen this happen in the recent
Humphrey visit to the campus.
This does not mean that I ap
prove of all that the Johnson ad
ministration has done in Viet
nam. What I am now pleading
for, however, is more honesty
and less self-righteousness here
at Stanford. I do not myself
think that either Lyndon John
sun or Hubert Humphrey are dis
honest men. It is conceivable,
however, that they need help. A
Christian act would be to help
them right here by means of spe
cific, reasonable, tolerant, public
and reiterated debate. But that
is not the kind of thing we have
recently seen on this campus.
I would, therefore, remind my
fellow Christians that they also
are sinners. And I would plead
most earnestly for a series of
serious public debates leading to
the formulation of a quite spe
cific 'Stanford paper on Viet
nam'. This is a life and death

matter on which Stanford at its
informed best should speak a
word.
The time for both silence and
noisy intolerance has passed. For
once, let the winds of freedom
blow somewhere to some pur
pose.

• Stern Shaft
Editor, The Dally:
The purpose of this letter is
to ask the administration what
is going to happen to Stern
Hall if the recent proposals for
coeducational housing at Wil
bur are put into effect next fall.
From what I can gather by
reading The Daily, it has been
assumed that although women
would help improve morale, etc.
at Wilbur, they would not have
the same effect on Stern Hall.
Speaking strictly for myself, I
would like to say that this as
sumption is unfounded. I have
no doubt that my morale, etc.
would rise considerably and
often if the administration
would move some women in
around here. In fact if women
are moved into Wilbur and not

into Stern I will quite likely
pick up my morale, etc. and try
to move into Wilbur with them.
And I would have serious doubts
about the morale or etc. of any
Stern men who didn't follow
my excellent example. In short,
if the University does not great
ly increase the number of enter
ing eunuchs in next year's
freshmen class Stern Hall may
be empty.
Why don't we have some
women living in Stern, officially,
next fall? Why isn't Grove Pro
ject going to be moved into
Stern next fall? If you haven't
guessed, my unbiased opniion is
that while Wilbur is getting the
women, Stern is getting the

it are likely to be extremely un
pleasant in both the short and
long runs. Any responsible gov
ernment must weigh these con
sequences especially in the light
of their effect upon an eventual
nuclear war. What, for example,
would unilateral withdrawal do
to South Vietnam, to world opin
ion and just as important, to
United States politics? What will
continuance of the war do in all
these same respects?
Answers?
Now I do not pretend that I
know the answers to these ques
tions. What I think I know is
that the answers are not easy.
What I fear is that the self
righteousness and violence of
some pacifists and warresist
ers may contribute very effect
ively to the victory of the most
irresponsible and bellicose ele
ments in our country. In a very
small and petty way, we have
seen this happen in the recent
Humphrey visit to the campus.
This does not mean that I ap
prove of all that the Johnson ad
ministration has done in Viet
nam. What I am now pleading
for, however, is more honesty
and less self-righteousness here
at Stanford. I do not myself
think that either Lyndon John
sun or Hubert Humphrey are dis
honest men. It is conceivable,
however, that they need help. A
Christian act would be to help
them right here by means of spe
cific, reasonable, tolerant, public
and reiterated debate. But that
is not the kind of thing we have
recently seen on this campus.
I would, therefore, remind my
fellow Christians that they also
are sinners. And I would plead
most earnestly for a series of
serious public debates leading to
the formulation of a quite spe
cific 'Stanford paper on Viet
nam'. This is a life and death

matter on which Stanford at its
informed best should speak a
word.
The time for both silence and
noisy intolerance has passed. For
once, let the winds of freedom
blow somewhere to some pur
pose.

Editor, The Dally:
The purpose of this letter is
to ask the administration what
is going to happen to Stern
Hall if the recent proposals for
coeducational housing at Wil
bur are put into effect next fall.
From what I can gather by
reading The Daily, it has been
assumed that although women
would help improve morale, etc.
at Wilbur, they would not have
the same effect on Stern Hall.
Speaking strictly for myself, I
would like to say that this as
sumption is unfounded. I have
no doubt that my morale, etc.
would rise considerably and
often if the administration
would move some women in
around here. In fact if women
are moved into Wilbur and not

into Stern I will quite likely
pick up my morale, etc. and try
to move into Wilbur with them.
And I would have serious doubts
about the morale or etc. of any
Stern men who didn't follow
my excellent example. In short,
if the University does not great
ly increase the number of enter
ing eunuchs in next year's
freshmen class Stern Hall may
be empty.
Why don't we have some
women living in Stern, officially,
next fall? Why isn't Grove Pro

that while Wilbur is getting the

THMOAS C. MOSER
Executive Head,
Department of English
Editor, The Dally:
I write this because I feel it
my duty to do so. I admire the
courage, though I dispute the
wisdom with which Professors
Robert M. Brown, Michael No
vak, and many others on the
campus have publicly declared
their opposition to the present
war in Vietnam. Brown and No
vak in particular have, as pro
fessed Christians, performed the
hard yet salutary task of com
pelling other professed Chris
tians to declare themselves. They
have in fact shamed me into
. peaking.
I do not, however, believe that
they are right or theologically
correct. Let there be no mistake,
first of all, about the profoundly
unchristian character of all war.
The language of the Sermon on
the Mount is unequivocal. How,
then, can a Christian ever advo
cate any war? I will not pretend
that a short, simple answer can
be adequate but I will say that
the best short, simple answer I
now know is this: war is justifi
able in Christian terms only
when the alternative is worse.
In some sense, I think this was
true of the war against the
Nazis; in a more qualified sense,
also of the American Civil War
and of some other wars, —espe-
cially those that prevented the
domination of whole peoples by
palpably unjust, cruel and tryan
nical regimes.
I do not think that even such
wars are wholly and always
justifiable particularly if they
may involve the controlled or un
controlled use of genocidal wea
pons such as atomic bombs. Yet
I believe that absolute pacifism
is indefensible in a world where
such pacificism may mean the
predominance of preventable
and extreme evil. What is called
original sin means just this, —
that we cannot practice an abso
lute ethic because we must in
fact choose between quite rela
tive ethics in each of which
there is a very considerable
amount of wrong. I am old

enough to have witnessed pacif
ist opposition to any sort of re
armament against Nazi Ger
many: surely such opposition
)must take some responsibility
for what happened to several
million Jews. Pacificists also are
sinners.
Vietnam
The present war in Vietnam is
very different from the second
World War. The issues, for one
thing, are much less clearcut. I
cannot here attempt to discuss
the vast literature of the subject.
But I will venture the opinion
(for which certainly a great deal
of support can be adduced) that
it is unique not so much for its
complicated origins as for the
uncompromising determination
with which it has been waged.
Every day brings its rumors as
to the chances of negotiation
with North Vietnam but the
overwhelming evidence is that
North Vietnam will not negoti
ate. It has thus put the United
States on a spot.
That the United States has
spurned, spurns or wants to
spurn the chance of negotiation
seems on the face of it unlikely
even if only for the reason that
the Johnson administration has
been steadily losing prestige as
the war has gone on. (Witness
the last public opinion polls). On
the other hand there is no evi
dence that the main (Republic
an) opposition to Johnson wants
to drop the war: on the con
trary, it is the thesis of several
leading .Republicans that we
must fight to win and win quick
ly though the cost may be escal
ation beyond anything now
known.
But the fact remains that the
present United States govern
ment seems, on all the evidence
available to us, to regard the
war as an inevitable alternative
to an unthinkable surrender. One
can, of course, argue that the
conduct of the war should be
altered in any one of numerous
particulars but it would be sheer
hypocrisy to pretend that war,

however conducted, is not a pro
cess of killing, maiming and
otherwise destroying human be
ings. One can also argue for uni
lateral withdrawal. In either
case, the consequences, as I see
it are likely to be extremely un
pleasant in both the short and
long runs. Any responsible gov
ernment must weigh these con
sequences especially in the light
of their effect upon an eventual
nuclear war. What, for example,
would unilateral withdrawal do
to South Vietnam, to world opin

Editor, The Daily:
Bravos to Jerry Hiken and the
Inadmissable Evidence cast — to
have affected Mr. Sanchez so
deeply that he was unable to
cerebrate for the frustration and
pain he carried out of the thea
ter. Osborne would be satisfied.
But please, Daily, either ask
Mr. Sanchez to wait until morn
ing to write his reviews in the
future, or find someone else with
more head than heart. It's bad
for business.

In case anyone either took
seriously Merry and Sanchez or
missed Wasserman in the Chron

missible Evidence is superb thea

fully acted.
THMOAS C. MOSER
Executive Head,
Department of English
Editor, The Dally:
I write this because I feel it
my duty to do so. I admire the
courage, though I dispute the
wisdom with which Professors
Robert M. Brown, Michael No
vak, and many others on the
campus have publicly declared
their opposition to the present
war in Vietnam. Brown and No
vak in particular have, as pro
fessed Christians, performed the
hard yet salutary task of com
pelling other professed Chris
tians to declare themselves. They
have in fact shamed me into
. peaking.
I do not, however, believe that
they are right or theologically
correct. Let there be no mistake,
first of all, about the profoundly
unchristian character of all war.
The language of the Sermon on
the Mount is unequivocal. How,
then, can a Christian ever advo
cate any war? I will not pretend
that a short, simple answer can
be adequate but I will say that
the best short, simple answer I
now know is this: war is justifi
able in Christian terms only
when the alternative is worse.
In some sense, I think this was
true of the war against the
Nazis; in a more qualified sense,
also of the American Civil War
and of some other wars, —espe-
cially those that prevented the
domination of whole peoples by
palpably unjust, cruel and tryan
nical regimes.
I do not think that even such
wars are wholly and always
justifiable particularly if they
may involve the controlled or un
controlled use of genocidal wea
pons such as atomic bombs. Yet
I believe that absolute pacifism
is indefensible in a world where
such pacificism may mean the
predominance of preventable
and extreme evil. What is called
original sin means just this, —
that we cannot practice an abso
lute ethic because we must in
fact choose between quite rela
tive ethics in each of which
there is a very considerable
amount of wrong. I am old

enough to have witnessed pacif
ist opposition to any sort of re
armament against Nazi Ger
many: surely such opposition
)must take some responsibility
for what happened to several
million Jews. Pacificists also are
sinners.
Vietnam
The present war in Vietnam is
very different from the second
World War. The issues, for one
thing, are much less clearcut. I
cannot here attempt to discuss
the vast literature of the subject.
But I will venture the opinion
(for which certainly a great deal
of support can be adduced) that
it is unique not so much for its
complicated origins as for the
uncompromising determination
with which it has been waged.
Every day brings its rumors as
to the chances of negotiation
with North Vietnam but the
overwhelming evidence is that
North Vietnam will not negoti
ate. It has thus put the United
States on a spot.
That the United States has
spurned, spurns or wants to
spurn the chance of negotiation
seems on the face of it unlikely
even if only for the reason that
the Johnson administration has
been steadily losing prestige as
the war has gone on. (Witness
the last public opinion polls). On
the other hand there is no evi
dence that the main (Republic
an) opposition to Johnson wants
to drop the war: on the con
trary, it is the thesis of several
leading .Republicans that we
must fight to win and win quick
ly though the cost may be escal
ation beyond anything now
known.
But the fact remains that the
present United States govern
ment seems, on all the evidence
available to us, to regard the
war as an inevitable alternative
to an unthinkable surrender. One
can, of course, argue that the
conduct of the war should be
altered in any one of numerous
particulars but it would be sheer
hypocrisy to pretend that war,

however conducted, is not a pro
cess of killing, maiming and
otherwise destroying human be
ings. One can also argue for uni
lateral withdrawal. In either
case, the consequences, as I see
it are likely to be extremely un
pleasant in both the short and
long runs. Any responsible gov
ernment must weigh these con
sequences especially in the light
of their effect upon an eventual
nuclear war. What, for example,
would unilateral withdrawal do
to South Vietnam, to world opin
ion and just as important, to
United States politics? What will
continuance of the war do in all
these same respects?
Answers?
Now I do not pretend that I
know the answers to these ques
tions. What I think I know is
that the answers are not easy.
What I fear is that the self
righteousness and violence of
some pacifists and warresist
ers may contribute very effect
ively to the victory of the most
irresponsible and bellicose ele
ments in our country. In a very
small and petty way, we have
seen this happen in the recent
Humphrey visit to the campus.
This does not mean that I ap
prove of all that the Johnson ad
ministration has done in Viet
nam. What I am now pleading
for, however, is more honesty
and less self-righteousness here
at Stanford. I do not myself
think that either Lyndon John
sun or Hubert Humphrey are dis
honest men. It is conceivable,
however, that they need help. A
Christian act would be to help
them right here by means of spe
cific, reasonable, tolerant, public
and reiterated debate. But that
is not the kind of thing we have
recently seen on this campus.
I would, therefore, remind my
fellow Christians that they also
are sinners. And I would plead
most earnestly for a series of
serious public debates leading to
the formulation of a quite spe
cific 'Stanford paper on Viet
nam'. This is a life and death

matter on which Stanford at its
informed best should speak a
word.
The time for both silence and
noisy intolerance has passed. For
once, let the winds of freedom
blow somewhere to some pur
pose.

• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
Since Mr. Smith chooses to
communicate with me solely
through the pages of the Daily
(the medium is the message, evi
dently), I shall reply to him in
your pages. The first meeting of
US 163, as he should have
learned last week, is scheduled
for tomorrow night. At that
time he will learn that the con
clusions of whatever research
he wishes to conduct are not go
ing to be dictated by anybody.
In the meantime, if he wishes to
do some research on research,
he would do well to read Elinor
Langer's series in the issues of
Science dated January 13 and 20.

• Stern Shaft
Editor, The Dally:
The purpose of this letter is
to ask the administration what
is going to happen to Stern
Hall if the recent proposals for
coeducational housing at Wil
bur are put into effect next fall.
From what I can gather by
reading The Daily, it has been
assumed that although women
would help improve morale, etc.
at Wilbur, they would not have
the same effect on Stern Hall.
Speaking strictly for myself, I
would like to say that this as
sumption is unfounded. I have
no doubt that my morale, etc.
would rise considerably and
often if the administration
would move some women in
around here. In fact if women
are moved into Wilbur and not

into Stern I will quite likely
pick up my morale, etc. and try
to move into Wilbur with them.
And I would have serious doubts
about the morale or etc. of any
Stern men who didn't follow
my excellent example. In short,
if the University does not great
ly increase the number of enter
ing eunuchs in next year's
freshmen class Stern Hall may
be empty.
Why don't we have some
women living in Stern, officially,
next fall? Why isn't Grove Pro
ject going to be moved into
Stern next fall? If you haven't
guessed, my unbiased opniion is
that while Wilbur is getting the
women, Stern is getting the
shaft.
