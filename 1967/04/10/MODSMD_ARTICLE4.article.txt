# Alpine Club Hikers Lost In Yosemite
## 
### 
Yosemite National Park Rangers re
ported last evening that two mem
bers of the Stanford Alpine Club were
missing somewhere in the park. The
two are Larry Greene a graduate stu
dent from Los Altos, and Ed Her
manns, a graduate student from
Pensylvania.
According to a report given the
Dally by Club Secretary Margo Perci
val, park rangers called President
Mike Humphreys and told him that
the two hikers had gone into the park
and had not come out.
The two hikers have been missing
since the end of March and a search
was begun early last week. At the
moment rangers are beginning to

search for the two hikers. An earlier
air search has been called off.
Greene and Hermanns were
checked out to hike to Aweaha Point,
near Half Dome. The point is an
easy day's hike from the valley.
The search was instituted when the
two hikers failed to turn in their
checkout form.
There is a possibility that the two
forgot about the form and left the
park without turning it in.
Park Rangers are anxious to know
if the hikers had snow shoes, skis, or
sleeping bags, and what color parkas
they were wearing. If anyone knows
the answers to these questions, or has
seen either of the two hikers, they are
asked to contact Humphreys immed
iately at University extension 2968.
