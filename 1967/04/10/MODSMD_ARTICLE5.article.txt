## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
The Academic Council at its regu
lar meeting Friday expanded pass
fail grading to cover certain entire
classes when the instructor desires
and established a procedure for elect
ing a seven-man faculty advisory com
mittee.
Instructors in freshman seminars,
senior colloquia, undergraduate spe
cial seminars, and specified activity
classes now have the option of
grading their entire classes on a
pass-fail basis.
The change, effective for this quar
ter, will still allow students who de
sire to take the course pass-fail to do
so even when the instructor has not
stipulated pass-fail for the whole
class.
If the professor determines that the
course will be graded pass-fail, it will
not count toward the present maxi
mum of one pass-fail course per

quarter and a maximum of 27 pass
fail units before graduation.
Biology professor Winslow Briggs,
chairman of the Registrar's Advisory
Committee, said the changes that his
group recommended to the Council
were "a logical extension" of the
pass-fail system instituted last fall
and met with little opposition from
the faculty.

ters.
The activity courses included in
the new ruling are the Music 160
series, including band, choir, chorus,
and glee club, Communication 121,
Political Science 99, and all physical
education courses.
The Council also provided that
courses other than the seminars and
activity courses specifically provided
for in Friday's resolution could also
be made pass-fail at the option of the
instructor if they were recommended
by the department and approved by
the Registrar's Advisory Committee.
The Academic Council at its regu
lar meeting Friday expanded pass
fail grading to cover certain entire
classes when the instructor desires
and established a procedure for elect
ing a seven-man faculty advisory com
mittee.
Instructors in freshman seminars,
senior colloquia, undergraduate spe
cial seminars, and specified activity
classes now have the option of
grading their entire classes on a
pass-fail basis.
The change, effective for this quar
ter, will still allow students who de
sire to take the course pass-fail to do
so even when the instructor has not
stipulated pass-fail for the whole
class.
If the professor determines that the
course will be graded pass-fail, it will
not count toward the present maxi
mum of one pass-fail course per

quarter and a maximum of 27 pass
fail units before graduation.
Biology professor Winslow Briggs,
chairman of the Registrar's Advisory
Committee, said the changes that his
group recommended to the Council
were "a logical extension" of the
pass-fail system instituted last fall
and met with little opposition from
the faculty.
