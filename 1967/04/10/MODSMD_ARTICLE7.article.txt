# Athletic Recruiting: Fair Or Foul?
## 
### NICHOLAS SELBY (First in a Series) 
Does Stanford lure athletes to the
Farm through promises of easy ad
mission, financial gifts, and an easy
academic load? Is Stanford's recruit
ing policy basically ethical?
Will Stanford's athletic recruiting
destroy all balance between athletes
and non-athletes in the student-body?
Could Stanford unilaterally end re
cruiting?
These questions are the subject of
a series of articles this week investi
gating Stanford's athletic recruiting
policy.
To answer these questions, it is
important to understand exactly how
the athletic recruiting process func
tions.
As Director of Athletics Charles
(Chuck) Taylor points out, the term
"recruiting" has acquired the bad
connotation of luring an athlete to a
school through aggressive sales pres
sures. Mr. Taylor feels instead that
recruiting is mainly a case of prior
investigation.
Prior Investigation
Prior investigation is extremely im
portant to Stanford because the Ath
letic Department must find students
who have excellent academic records
in high school and are also good ath
letes. State schools, which can accept
anyone from the state with a high
school diploma, and schools with less
competitive admission stardards than
Stanford are not as limited in their
number of potential candidates.
Reports and recommendations, both
as to the athletic ability and academic
standing of the young student-athlete,
come from many of the high school
and junior college coaches, as well as
from many alumni. Further investi
gation goes on with high school coun
selors, teachers, and administrators in
an effort to determine whether those
who seem to have athletic ability a. so
qualify for. admission.
While receiving this information,
the coaches request films of contests
in which those recommended have
competed. They study these exten
sively
John Ralston, head football coach,
adds that his assistants look for three

things in the films: 1) how much the
boy likes physical contact, 2) how
fast he is, and 3) his attitude, his de
sire for improvement, and his coach
ability.
At some point in this preliminary
screening process, the recommended
prospect is contacted and encouraged
to request an application from the
Admissions Office and to apply for
mally for admission to Stanford.
Admissions Cutback
The Admissions Office receives ap
plications from approximately 200
student athletes who have been con
tacted by the Athletic Department.
Of this number about 40 will even
tually qualify for admission. The Ad
missions Office informs the Athletic
Department as soon as possible after
the applications are received and eval
uated as to whether or not it is worth
while to maintain a contact with the
prospect.
Investigation is carried on by the
coach of each sport. Ralston states
that he and his coaches are directly
in touch with 800 high school coaches
in California and indirectly in touch
with several hundred in the rest of
the country.
The investigative process is similar
for other sports. However, in con
trast to Ralston's reliance on coaches'
reports, basketball coach Howard
Dallmar says that the alumni do the
major part of his searching for bas
ketball talent. All coaches also use
several publications which give run
downs on high school players.
Competitive Stage
After preliminary evaluations have
come from the Admissions Office, the
recruiting process enters the competi
tive stage. "Everyone wants the qual
ity of boy we are after," says Ral
ston. "These boys are extremely
sought after. They can go to any
school west of Chicago." The Admis
sions Office adds that they probably
can go to any other school in the
country, including the top Ivy League
schools of Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and Dartmouth.
The first part of this competition is
to give the recruit a visit to the cam
pus. AAWU rules limit the number
of visits to three for an instate boy
and two for an out of state boy. The

school is permitted to pay for the
cost of transportation of one trip for
the boy alone and only to the campus
itself, not to a place where the school
is competing. When parents visit
Stanford with the boy, the Athletic
Department talks to them about Stan
ford and may provide several meals.
During the visit, the prospective
Stanford athlete is given a tour of the
campus. His guide is usually a Stan
ford athlete. Recruits last quarter
were taken to the Washington and
Washington State basketball games
and to the UCLA and USC swimming
meets, for example. They also had a
barbecue. As will be explained in a
later article, the recruit himself de
cides whether to visit any classes.
The recruits stayed with their stu
dent-athlete guides in either the
guides' rooms. Usually, recruits will
stay in Wilbur during their first visit,

and in a fraternity the second. The
guides are paid $2.25 an hour for
their service, or up to $22.50 for the
weekend.
During the 48 hour visit, the Ath
letic Department is not permitted to
test the recruits in any way concern
ing their athletic ability.
The schools of the AAWU are
limited to two off-campus visits with
the boy and his parents, but may send
letters to encourage the boy to attend
their school. Coaches may not, how
ever, give any clothing or equipment,
including shirts with the school's
name on them.
"We give the boys and their parents
three to four months of 'sales talk,'"
concludes Ralston. "Hopefully, 20-25
of the 35-40 will attend Stanford.
Some schools don't enroll any. Two
years ago, we enrolled 29 of 35."
The Stanford athletic recruit
ers stress the top educational
opportunities at Stanford.
Howie Dallmar says that he
"lets Stanford sell itself." Swim
ming coach Jim Gaughran
agrees on the point. Both mean
that Stanford's academic repu
tation is sufficient by itself. Dall
mar also explained that he will
show a boy that both academics
and athletics are possible at
Stanford.
Coach Ralston likes to show
as proof of Stanford's academic
attractions a Newsweek article
which reports that Stanford
stands as the third choice
among winners of Merit Schol
arships among men and first
among women.
The next important thing that
the coaches try to convince a
recruit of is the excellence of

the athletic program. Coach
Gaughran states that for swim
ming a good training program
which has the visible results of
nationally ranked teams and/or
swimmers is a recruiting pro
gram in itself. The fight for
good swimmers is narrowed to
the top swimming schools of
Yale, Indiana, USC, and Stan
ford.
Gaughran states that Stan
ford's current swimming honors
are due to a fifth place finish in
the NCAA's two years ago. "It
showed boys we had a good
program and were serious
about swimming competitively."
Gaughran's desk is now piled
with letters from high school
swimming student - athletes af
ter winning the NCAA cham
pionship.

Says Gaughran, "we lose
most of our recruits to Yale,
which, like Stanford, has a top
academic program."
John Ralston concurs: "We
sometimes lose boys because
they believe that another school
has a better athletic image. At
18 years old, a boy considers
which school may get him into
the Rose Bowl or pro-football
better. For this reason, we must
show him the athletic oppor
tunities."
Other things the coaches
stress is the physical pleasant
ness of Stanford's campus, the
realxed atmosphere among the
students, and the small student
body.
Note: Tomorrow's article will
describe the awarding of grants
in-aid to student-athletes.

as to the athletic ability and academic
standing of the young student-athlete,
come from many of the high school
and junior college coaches, as well as
from many alumni. Further investi
gation goes on with high school coun
selors, teachers, and administrators in
an effort to determine whether those
who seem to have athletic ability a. so
qualify for. admission.
While receiving this information,
the coaches request films of contests
in which those recommended have
competed. They study these exten
sively
John Ralston, head football coach,
adds that his assistants look for three

things in the films: 1) how much the
boy likes physical contact, 2) how
fast he is, and 3) his attitude, his de
sire for improvement, and his coach
ability.
At some point in this preliminary
screening process, the recommended
prospect is contacted and encouraged
to request an application from the
Admissions Office and to apply for
mally for admission to Stanford.
Admissions Cutback
The Admissions Office receives ap
plications from approximately 200
student athletes who have been con
tacted by the Athletic Department.
Of this number about 40 will even
tually qualify for admission. The Ad
missions Office informs the Athletic
Department as soon as possible after
the applications are received and eval
uated as to whether or not it is worth
while to maintain a contact with the
prospect.
Investigation is carried on by the
coach of each sport. Ralston states
that he and his coaches are directly
in touch with 800 high school coaches
in California and indirectly in touch
with several hundred in the rest of
the country.
The investigative process is similar
for other sports. However, in con
trast to Ralston's reliance on coaches'
reports, basketball coach Howard
Dallmar says that the alumni do the
major part of his searching for bas
ketball talent. All coaches also use
several publications which give run
downs on high school players.
Competitive Stage
After preliminary evaluations have
come from the Admissions Office, the
recruiting process enters the competi
tive stage. "Everyone wants the qual
ity of boy we are after," says Ral
ston. "These boys are extremely
sought after. They can go to any
school west of Chicago." The Admis
sions Office adds that they probably
can go to any other school in the
country, including the top Ivy League
schools of Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and Dartmouth.
The first part of this competition is
to give the recruit a visit to the cam
pus. AAWU rules limit the number
of visits to three for an instate boy
and two for an out of state boy. The

school is permitted to pay for the
cost of transportation of one trip for
the boy alone and only to the campus
itself, not to a place where the school
is competing. When parents visit
Stanford with the boy, the Athletic
Department talks to them about Stan
ford and may provide several meals.
During the visit, the prospective
Stanford athlete is given a tour of the
campus. His guide is usually a Stan
ford athlete. Recruits last quarter
were taken to the Washington and
Washington State basketball games
and to the UCLA and USC swimming
meets, for example. They also had a
barbecue. As will be explained in a
later article, the recruit himself de
cides whether to visit any classes.
The recruits stayed with their stu
dent-athlete guides in either the
guides' rooms. Usually, recruits will
stay in Wilbur during their first visit,

and in a fraternity the second. The
guides are paid $2.25 an hour for
their service, or up to $22.50 for the
weekend.
During the 48 hour visit, the Ath
letic Department is not permitted to
test the recruits in any way concern
ing their athletic ability.
The schools of the AAWU are
limited to two off-campus visits with
the boy and his parents, but may send
letters to encourage the boy to attend
their school. Coaches may not, how
ever, give any clothing or equipment,
including shirts with the school's
name on them.
"We give the boys and their parents
three to four months of 'sales talk,'"
concludes Ralston. "Hopefully, 20-25
of the 35-40 will attend Stanford.
Some schools don't enroll any. Two
years ago, we enrolled 29 of 35."
The Stanford athletic recruit
ers stress the top educational
opportunities at Stanford.
Howie Dallmar says that he
"lets Stanford sell itself." Swim
ming coach Jim Gaughran
agrees on the point. Both mean
that Stanford's academic repu
tation is sufficient by itself. Dall
mar also explained that he will
show a boy that both academics
and athletics are possible at
Stanford.
Coach Ralston likes to show
as proof of Stanford's academic
attractions a Newsweek article
which reports that Stanford
stands as the third choice
among winners of Merit Schol
arships among men and first
among women.
The next important thing that
the coaches try to convince a
recruit of is the excellence of

the athletic program. Coach
Gaughran states that for swim
ming a good training program
which has the visible results of
nationally ranked teams and/or
swimmers is a recruiting pro
gram in itself. The fight for
good swimmers is narrowed to
the top swimming schools of
Yale, Indiana, USC, and Stan
ford.
Gaughran states that Stan
ford's current swimming honors
are due to a fifth place finish in
the NCAA's two years ago. "It
showed boys we had a good
program and were serious
about swimming competitively."
Gaughran's desk is now piled
with letters from high school
swimming student - athletes af
ter winning the NCAA cham
pionship.

Says Gaughran, "we lose
most of our recruits to Yale,
which, like Stanford, has a top
academic program."
John Ralston concurs: "We
sometimes lose boys because
they believe that another school
has a better athletic image. At
18 years old, a boy considers
which school may get him into
the Rose Bowl or pro-football
better. For this reason, we must
show him the athletic oppor
tunities."
Other things the coaches
stress is the physical pleasant
ness of Stanford's campus, the
realxed atmosphere among the
students, and the small student
body.
Note: Tomorrow's article will
describe the awarding of grants
in-aid to student-athletes.
Does Stanford lure athletes to the
Farm through promises of easy ad
mission, financial gifts, and an easy
academic load? Is Stanford's recruit
ing policy basically ethical?
Will Stanford's athletic recruiting
destroy all balance between athletes
and non-athletes in the student-body?
Could Stanford unilaterally end re
cruiting?
These questions are the subject of
a series of articles this week investi
gating Stanford's athletic recruiting
policy.
To answer these questions, it is
important to understand exactly how
the athletic recruiting process func
tions.
As Director of Athletics Charles
(Chuck) Taylor points out, the term
"recruiting" has acquired the bad
connotation of luring an athlete to a
school through aggressive sales pres
sures. Mr. Taylor feels instead that
recruiting is mainly a case of prior
investigation.
Prior Investigation
Prior investigation is extremely im
portant to Stanford because the Ath
letic Department must find students
who have excellent academic records
in high school and are also good ath
letes. State schools, which can accept
anyone from the state with a high
school diploma, and schools with less
competitive admission stardards than
Stanford are not as limited in their
number of potential candidates.
Reports and recommendations, both
as to the athletic ability and academic

and junior college coaches, as well as

uated as to whether or not it is worth
while to maintain a contact with the
prospect.
Investigation is carried on by the
coach of each sport. Ralston states
that he and his coaches are directly
in touch with 800 high school coaches
in California and indirectly in touch
with several hundred in the rest of
the country.
The investigative process is similar
for other sports. However, in con
trast to Ralston's reliance on coaches'
reports, basketball coach Howard
Dallmar says that the alumni do the
major part of his searching for bas
ketball talent. All coaches also use
several publications which give run
downs on high school players.
Competitive Stage
After preliminary evaluations have
come from the Admissions Office, the
recruiting process enters the competi
tive stage. "Everyone wants the qual
ity of boy we are after," says Ral
ston. "These boys are extremely
sought after. They can go to any
school west of Chicago." The Admis
sions Office adds that they probably
can go to any other school in the
country, including the top Ivy League
schools of Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and Dartmouth.
The first part of this competition is
to give the recruit a visit to the cam
pus. AAWU rules limit the number
of visits to three for an instate boy
and two for an out of state boy. The

school is permitted to pay for the
cost of transportation of one trip for
the boy alone and only to the campus
itself, not to a place where the school
is competing. When parents visit
Stanford with the boy, the Athletic
Department talks to them about Stan
ford and may provide several meals.
During the visit, the prospective
Stanford athlete is given a tour of the
campus. His guide is usually a Stan
ford athlete. Recruits last quarter
were taken to the Washington and
Washington State basketball games
and to the UCLA and USC swimming
meets, for example. They also had a
barbecue. As will be explained in a
later article, the recruit himself de
cides whether to visit any classes.
The recruits stayed with their stu
dent-athlete guides in either the
guides' rooms. Usually, recruits will
stay in Wilbur during their first visit,

and in a fraternity the second. The
guides are paid $2.25 an hour for
their service, or up to $22.50 for the
weekend.
During the 48 hour visit, the Ath
letic Department is not permitted to
test the recruits in any way concern
ing their athletic ability.
The schools of the AAWU are
limited to two off-campus visits with
the boy and his parents, but may send
letters to encourage the boy to attend
their school. Coaches may not, how
ever, give any clothing or equipment,
including shirts with the school's
name on them.
"We give the boys and their parents
three to four months of 'sales talk,'"
concludes Ralston. "Hopefully, 20-25
of the 35-40 will attend Stanford.
Some schools don't enroll any. Two
years ago, we enrolled 29 of 35."
The Stanford athletic recruit
ers stress the top educational
opportunities at Stanford.
Howie Dallmar says that he
"lets Stanford sell itself." Swim
ming coach Jim Gaughran
agrees on the point. Both mean
that Stanford's academic repu
tation is sufficient by itself. Dall
mar also explained that he will
show a boy that both academics
and athletics are possible at
Stanford.
Coach Ralston likes to show
as proof of Stanford's academic
attractions a Newsweek article
which reports that Stanford
stands as the third choice
among winners of Merit Schol
arships among men and first
among women.
The next important thing that
the coaches try to convince a
recruit of is the excellence of

the athletic program. Coach
Gaughran states that for swim
ming a good training program
which has the visible results of
nationally ranked teams and/or
swimmers is a recruiting pro
gram in itself. The fight for
good swimmers is narrowed to
the top swimming schools of
Yale, Indiana, USC, and Stan
ford.
Gaughran states that Stan
ford's current swimming honors
are due to a fifth place finish in
the NCAA's two years ago. "It
showed boys we had a good
program and were serious
about swimming competitively."
Gaughran's desk is now piled
with letters from high school
swimming student - athletes af
ter winning the NCAA cham
pionship.

Says Gaughran, "we lose
most of our recruits to Yale,
which, like Stanford, has a top
academic program."
John Ralston concurs: "We
sometimes lose boys because
they believe that another school
has a better athletic image. At
18 years old, a boy considers
which school may get him into
the Rose Bowl or pro-football
better. For this reason, we must
show him the athletic oppor
tunities."
Other things the coaches
stress is the physical pleasant
ness of Stanford's campus, the
realxed atmosphere among the
students, and the small student
body.
Note: Tomorrow's article will
describe the awarding of grants
in-aid to student-athletes.
Does Stanford lure athletes to the
Farm through promises of easy ad
mission, financial gifts, and an easy
academic load? Is Stanford's recruit
ing policy basically ethical?
Will Stanford's athletic recruiting
destroy all balance between athletes
and non-athletes in the student-body?
Could Stanford unilaterally end re
cruiting?
These questions are the subject of
a series of articles this week investi
gating Stanford's athletic recruiting
policy.
To answer these questions, it is
important to understand exactly how
the athletic recruiting process func
tions.
As Director of Athletics Charles
(Chuck) Taylor points out, the term
"recruiting" has acquired the bad
connotation of luring an athlete to a
school through aggressive sales pres
sures. Mr. Taylor feels instead that
recruiting is mainly a case of prior
investigation.
Prior Investigation
Prior investigation is extremely im
portant to Stanford because the Ath
letic Department must find students
who have excellent academic records
in high school and are also good ath
letes. State schools, which can accept
anyone from the state with a high
school diploma, and schools with less
competitive admission stardards than
Stanford are not as limited in their
number of potential candidates.
Reports and recommendations, both
as to the athletic ability and academic
standing of the young student-athlete,
come from many of the high school
and junior college coaches, as well as
from many alumni. Further investi
gation goes on with high school coun
selors, teachers, and administrators in
an effort to determine whether those
who seem to have athletic ability a. so
qualify for. admission.
While receiving this information,
the coaches request films of contests
in which those recommended have
competed. They study these exten
sively
John Ralston, head football coach,
adds that his assistants look for three

things in the films: 1) how much the
boy likes physical contact, 2) how
fast he is, and 3) his attitude, his de
sire for improvement, and his coach
ability.
At some point in this preliminary
screening process, the recommended
prospect is contacted and encouraged
to request an application from the
Admissions Office and to apply for
mally for admission to Stanford.
Admissions Cutback
The Admissions Office receives ap
plications from approximately 200
student athletes who have been con
tacted by the Athletic Department.
Of this number about 40 will even
tually qualify for admission. The Ad
missions Office informs the Athletic
Department as soon as possible after
the applications are received and eval
uated as to whether or not it is worth
while to maintain a contact with the
prospect.

of visits to three for an instate boy
and two for an out of state boy. The

school is permitted to pay for the
cost of transportation of one trip for
the boy alone and only to the campus
itself, not to a place where the school
is competing. When parents visit
Stanford with the boy, the Athletic
Department talks to them about Stan
ford and may provide several meals.
During the visit, the prospective
Stanford athlete is given a tour of the
campus. His guide is usually a Stan
ford athlete. Recruits last quarter
were taken to the Washington and
Washington State basketball games
and to the UCLA and USC swimming
meets, for example. They also had a
barbecue. As will be explained in a
later article, the recruit himself de
cides whether to visit any classes.
The recruits stayed with their stu
dent-athlete guides in either the
guides' rooms. Usually, recruits will
stay in Wilbur during their first visit,

and in a fraternity the second. The
guides are paid $2.25 an hour for
their service, or up to $22.50 for the
weekend.
During the 48 hour visit, the Ath
letic Department is not permitted to
test the recruits in any way concern
ing their athletic ability.
The schools of the AAWU are
limited to two off-campus visits with
the boy and his parents, but may send
letters to encourage the boy to attend
their school. Coaches may not, how
ever, give any clothing or equipment,
including shirts with the school's
name on them.
"We give the boys and their parents
three to four months of 'sales talk,'"
concludes Ralston. "Hopefully, 20-25
of the 35-40 will attend Stanford.
Some schools don't enroll any. Two
years ago, we enrolled 29 of 35."
The Stanford athletic recruit
ers stress the top educational
opportunities at Stanford.
Howie Dallmar says that he
"lets Stanford sell itself." Swim
ming coach Jim Gaughran
agrees on the point. Both mean
that Stanford's academic repu
tation is sufficient by itself. Dall
mar also explained that he will
show a boy that both academics
and athletics are possible at
Stanford.
Coach Ralston likes to show
as proof of Stanford's academic
attractions a Newsweek article
which reports that Stanford
stands as the third choice
among winners of Merit Schol
arships among men and first
among women.
The next important thing that
the coaches try to convince a
recruit of is the excellence of

the athletic program. Coach
Gaughran states that for swim
ming a good training program
which has the visible results of
nationally ranked teams and/or
swimmers is a recruiting pro
gram in itself. The fight for
good swimmers is narrowed to
the top swimming schools of
Yale, Indiana, USC, and Stan
ford.
Gaughran states that Stan
ford's current swimming honors
are due to a fifth place finish in
the NCAA's two years ago. "It
showed boys we had a good
program and were serious
about swimming competitively."
Gaughran's desk is now piled
with letters from high school
swimming student - athletes af
ter winning the NCAA cham
pionship.

Says Gaughran, "we lose
most of our recruits to Yale,
which, like Stanford, has a top
academic program."
John Ralston concurs: "We
sometimes lose boys because
they believe that another school
has a better athletic image. At
18 years old, a boy considers
which school may get him into
the Rose Bowl or pro-football
better. For this reason, we must
show him the athletic oppor
tunities."
Other things the coaches
stress is the physical pleasant
ness of Stanford's campus, the
realxed atmosphere among the
students, and the small student
body.
Note: Tomorrow's article will
describe the awarding of grants
in-aid to student-athletes.
Does Stanford lure athletes to the
Farm through promises of easy ad
mission, financial gifts, and an easy
academic load? Is Stanford's recruit
ing policy basically ethical?
Will Stanford's athletic recruiting
destroy all balance between athletes
and non-athletes in the student-body?
Could Stanford unilaterally end re
cruiting?
These questions are the subject of
a series of articles this week investi
gating Stanford's athletic recruiting
policy.
To answer these questions, it is
important to understand exactly how
the athletic recruiting process func
tions.
As Director of Athletics Charles
(Chuck) Taylor points out, the term
"recruiting" has acquired the bad
connotation of luring an athlete to a
school through aggressive sales pres
sures. Mr. Taylor feels instead that
recruiting is mainly a case of prior
investigation.
Prior Investigation
Prior investigation is extremely im
portant to Stanford because the Ath
letic Department must find students
who have excellent academic records
in high school and are also good ath
letes. State schools, which can accept
anyone from the state with a high
school diploma, and schools with less
competitive admission stardards than
Stanford are not as limited in their
number of potential candidates.
Reports and recommendations, both
as to the athletic ability and academic
standing of the young student-athlete,
come from many of the high school
and junior college coaches, as well as
from many alumni. Further investi
gation goes on with high school coun
selors, teachers, and administrators in
an effort to determine whether those
who seem to have athletic ability a. so
qualify for. admission.
While receiving this information,
the coaches request films of contests
in which those recommended have
competed. They study these exten
sively
John Ralston, head football coach,
adds that his assistants look for three

things in the films: 1) how much the
boy likes physical contact, 2) how
fast he is, and 3) his attitude, his de
sire for improvement, and his coach
ability.
At some point in this preliminary
screening process, the recommended
prospect is contacted and encouraged
to request an application from the
Admissions Office and to apply for
mally for admission to Stanford.
Admissions Cutback
The Admissions Office receives ap
plications from approximately 200
student athletes who have been con
tacted by the Athletic Department.
Of this number about 40 will even
tually qualify for admission. The Ad
missions Office informs the Athletic
Department as soon as possible after
the applications are received and eval
uated as to whether or not it is worth
while to maintain a contact with the
prospect.
Investigation is carried on by the
coach of each sport. Ralston states
that he and his coaches are directly
in touch with 800 high school coaches
in California and indirectly in touch
with several hundred in the rest of
the country.
The investigative process is similar
for other sports. However, in con
trast to Ralston's reliance on coaches'
reports, basketball coach Howard
Dallmar says that the alumni do the
major part of his searching for bas
ketball talent. All coaches also use
several publications which give run
downs on high school players.
Competitive Stage
After preliminary evaluations have
come from the Admissions Office, the
recruiting process enters the competi
tive stage. "Everyone wants the qual
ity of boy we are after," says Ral
ston. "These boys are extremely
sought after. They can go to any
school west of Chicago." The Admis
sions Office adds that they probably
can go to any other school in the
country, including the top Ivy League
schools of Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and Dartmouth.
The first part of this competition is
to give the recruit a visit to the cam
pus. AAWU rules limit the number
of visits to three for an instate boy
and two for an out of state boy. The

school is permitted to pay for the
cost of transportation of one trip for
