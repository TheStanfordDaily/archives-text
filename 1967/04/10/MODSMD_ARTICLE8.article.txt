# 'Experiment' To Seek Votes Of Confidence
## 
### 
The Experiment will circulate a
petition this week which urges the
Stanford administration to find an on
campus location for the 325-member
organization next year. The Experi
ment must leave its present home, the
former RBR and Western Civ Libe,
on May 30 to make way for the Stan
ford Placement Service.
The petition reads: "We, the under
signed faculty, staff, and students be
lieve that The Experiment is helping
to fulfill an important need at Stan
ford by its efforts to create a con
cerned and active campus community.
We therefore strongly urge that The
Experiment be given an on campus
location next year that is suitable to
its needs, preferably at least part of
the building it now occupies."
"We are aware," says Experiment
Coordinator Barry Greenberg, "that
the space situation at Stanford is ex
tremely tight. We met with several
administrators last quarter and they

explained that the problem is a prac
tical and not a political one. Never
theless, we feel that a strong show of
support by the University community
in our behalf might convince the Ad
ministration to change its list of
space priorities and to find us at
least a little space in which to con
tinue our operations."
"The petition also can be inter
preted," continues Greenberg, "as a
vote of confidence. While we are by
far the largest and I think the most
active student group, we have very
little knowledge of what most indivi
duals at Stanford think of what we
are doing and are trying to accom
plish. If only a small number of
persons signs the petition, perhaps we
ought to consider putting The Ex
periment to rest."
The petition will be available all
week in front of Tresldder Union, in
The Experiment building, and also in
most major living groups.
