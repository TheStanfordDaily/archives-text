# College YR's Veto Anti-Kuchel Drive

### MICHAEL KUHL 
"You can gain the attention
of the press; you can cause a
ripple on what is otherwise a
smooth political surface. But
if you think that you speak for
the majority of Republicans in
the state, it is a misuse of the
name Republican."
These remarks by Dennis
Carpenter, Vice-Chairman of
the Republican State Central
Committee, to the convention of
The California Young Republi
can College Federation (CYR
CF) cautioned the group
against discrediting U.S. Sena
tor Kuchel.
The Stanford Club, which is
twice as large as any other
club in the state, was one of
the leading critics of action
which caused the over-all mem
bership in the organization to
dwindle from 15,000 to 4,000 in
the last four years.
In conjunction with large del
egations from San Jose State
and Berkeley, Stanford support
ed the successful campaigns of
Jim McKinney from San Diego
State and Darl Preacher of Long
Beach State for the office's of
Chairman and Vice-Chairman.
In addition, two Stanford can
didates, Robert Clark for Trea
surer and Michael Wolf for Re
gion II Vice-President, were suc
cessful in their campaigns.
Critical of Kuchel
McKinney, while he was criti
cal of U.S. Senator Thomas Ku
chel's past record, insisted that
he would "support any Repub
lican candidate in the general
election."
Preacher stressed his at

tempts at Long Beach State to
convince students there that
"there are intellectuals in the
Republican party."
A lengthy credentials fight
consumed so much time that
the delegates from 68 colleges
adjourned the convention late
Sunday afternoon after election
of officers without adopting
any resolutions or a platform.
Max Rafferty
The central issue in the reso
lutions committee was the drive
by some delegations to support
State Superintendent of Schools
Max Rafferty in unseating Ku
chel in the primary.
The overwhelming defeat of
this resolution was accompanied
by the defeat of an amendment
opposing Parkinson's "eleventh
commandment." The majority
of the delegates felt that the
rule that "Thou shalt not speak
ill of another Republican" was
necessary to maintain party
solidarity.
