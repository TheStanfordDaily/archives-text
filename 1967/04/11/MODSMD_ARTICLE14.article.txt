# DRAMA REVIEW
## MacBird: Comic And Outrageous 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The "Pox Americana" is a
reality. The "Smooth Society"
is here to stay. Kennedy is rot
ting in his grave and a pseudo-
Shakespearean pun for L.B.J,
put him there.
Macßird is a brilliant political
satire, the first America has
published, and Barbara Garson
is to be thanked for a script
which is both gifted and out
rageous.
Lyndon Johnson is cast in the
Macbeth role, John F. Kennedy
is the Duncan figure and Ro
bert Kennedy is a combination
Malcolm-Macduff. The allegory
is seditious and far-fetched, no
doubt about that, but it is high
ly entertaining and that is all
that matters.
But don't get me wrong. The
Committee's current perfor
mance is appallingly bad, sham
ateur and dilettante in the ex
treme. Perhaps their move to
a hip-hip, mini-skirted, beard
toting joint in Montgomery
spoiled them.
Bad seating, poor lighting, no
props and cheap costumes with
Brechtian face masks accom
panied their offering. Obviously,
such economizing in the theater
is convenient for funds and sup
posed at the same time to be
Haightashburyesque; in fact it
is merely mean.
The American flag was
draped back and over the wood
en stage; slides of L.B.J.'s I
think rather dumb and friendly
face were shown either side of
the Stars and Stripes as a proof

of his nasty warmongering.
The play itself was murdered.
In the intermissions an earnest
voice told us that polls had
been taken in the audience with
the result that 1 person wanted
Romney as next U.S. president,
1 wanted Goldwater, Fulbright
had scored 13, Stokely Car
michael 1, Johnson 14, Kennedy
38 and "all others" 60.
Mrs. Garson's radical voice,
emerging from the same Un
derground as Mario Sovio, is
full and legitmate. Her play
seems to center on the struggle
for power before and after Ken
nedy's assassination.
The three witches that open
Mac Beth become a black Mus
lin with "Muhammed Speaks"
on his arm (Mel Stewart), a
Trotskyite schemer (Del Close)
and Jessica Myerson as a blue
stocking hippie ultraist.
After galavanting around
front-stage, this remarkable
trio retires to a raised table
(the podium at a Convention)
and watches the action from
behind copies of "Peking Re
view." Later on they cavort
round trash cans singing a nice
parody of Swanee Ribber.
While the political plot hums
along with a splendid farrago
of Shakespearanisms (drawn
from all the plays, for example:
"He has a fat, yet hungry look.
Such men are dangerous.") the
Committee did its best to justi
fy Edgar Hoover's latest pro
nouncement in the F. 8.1. Law
Enforcement Bulletin.
Missing the point, Hoover

said: "We should be alarmed
when widespread recognition
and monetary awards go to a
person who writes a 'satirical'
piece of trash which malicious
ly defames the President of our
country and insinuates he mur
dered his successor."
In the final analysis, Macßird
is innocuous. Its strength, rec
ognized by such eminent critics
as Eric Bentley, the Brechtian

scholar and Robert Lowell, poet,
lies in the language, not in its
confused and rather naive po
litical tub-thumping.
Thus John Brent was superb
with a Texan drawl and lines
like: "I gotta hand it to me. /
I sure got style. Macßird, you're
so damn sharp."
On home politics the "Smooth
Society" oration by Brent was
equally funny. And so, when

Lady Macßird gets anxious
about the opinion polls, her hus
band drawls back: "I plan to
call a national day of prayer.
We'll get the biggest preacher
in the country. You know the
one I mean — the guy's got
class. We'll make it hightoned,
dignified, and solemn. Organs,
choirs, pictures of me ponderin'.
Now that's the sort of thing
builds confidence."

the result that 1 person wanted
Romney as next U.S. president,

38 and "all others" 60.
Mrs. Garson's radical voice,
emerging from the same Un
derground as Mario Sovio, is
full and legitmate. Her play
seems to center on the struggle
for power before and after Ken

The three witches that open
Mac Beth become a black Mus
lin with "Muhammed Speaks"
on his arm (Mel Stewart), a
Trotskyite schemer (Del Close)
and Jessica Myerson as a blue
stocking hippie ultraist.
After galavanting around
front-stage, this remarkable
trio retires to a raised table
(the podium at a Convention)
and watches the action from
behind copies of "Peking Re
view." Later on they cavort
round trash cans singing a nice
parody of Swanee Ribber.
While the political plot hums
along with a splendid farrago
of Shakespearanisms (drawn
from all the plays, for example:
"He has a fat, yet hungry look.
Such men are dangerous.") the
Committee did its best to justi
fy Edgar Hoover's latest pro
nouncement in the F. 8.1. Law
Enforcement Bulletin.
Missing the point, Hoover

said: "We should be alarmed
when widespread recognition
and monetary awards go to a
person who writes a 'satirical'
piece of trash which malicious
ly defames the President of our
country and insinuates he mur
dered his successor."
In the final analysis, Macßird
is innocuous. Its strength, rec
ognized by such eminent critics
as Eric Bentley, the Brechtian

scholar and Robert Lowell, poet,
lies in the language, not in its
confused and rather naive po
litical tub-thumping.
Thus John Brent was superb
with a Texan drawl and lines
like: "I gotta hand it to me. /
I sure got style. Macßird, you're
so damn sharp."
On home politics the "Smooth
Society" oration by Brent was
equally funny. And so, when

Lady Macßird gets anxious
about the opinion polls, her hus
band drawls back: "I plan to
call a national day of prayer.
We'll get the biggest preacher
in the country. You know the
one I mean — the guy's got
class. We'll make it hightoned,
dignified, and solemn. Organs,
choirs, pictures of me ponderin'.
Now that's the sort of thing
builds confidence."
The "Pox Americana" is a
reality. The "Smooth Society"
is here to stay. Kennedy is rot
ting in his grave and a pseudo-
Shakespearean pun for L.B.J,
put him there.
Macßird is a brilliant political
satire, the first America has
published, and Barbara Garson
is to be thanked for a script
which is both gifted and out
rageous.
Lyndon Johnson is cast in the
Macbeth role, John F. Kennedy
is the Duncan figure and Ro
bert Kennedy is a combination
Malcolm-Macduff. The allegory
is seditious and far-fetched, no
doubt about that, but it is high
ly entertaining and that is all
that matters.
But don't get me wrong. The
Committee's current perfor
mance is appallingly bad, sham
ateur and dilettante in the ex
treme. Perhaps their move to
a hip-hip, mini-skirted, beard
toting joint in Montgomery
spoiled them.
Bad seating, poor lighting, no
props and cheap costumes with
Brechtian face masks accom
panied their offering. Obviously,
such economizing in the theater
is convenient for funds and sup
posed at the same time to be
Haightashburyesque; in fact it
is merely mean.
The American flag was
draped back and over the wood
en stage; slides of L.B.J.'s I
think rather dumb and friendly
face were shown either side of
the Stars and Stripes as a proof

of his nasty warmongering.
The play itself was murdered.

In the final analysis, Macßird
is innocuous. Its strength, rec
ognized by such eminent critics
as Eric Bentley, the Brechtian

scholar and Robert Lowell, poet,
lies in the language, not in its
confused and rather naive po
litical tub-thumping.
Thus John Brent was superb
with a Texan drawl and lines
like: "I gotta hand it to me. /
I sure got style. Macßird, you're
so damn sharp."
On home politics the "Smooth
Society" oration by Brent was
equally funny. And so, when

Lady Macßird gets anxious
about the opinion polls, her hus
band drawls back: "I plan to
call a national day of prayer.
We'll get the biggest preacher
in the country. You know the
one I mean — the guy's got
class. We'll make it hightoned,
dignified, and solemn. Organs,
choirs, pictures of me ponderin'.
Now that's the sort of thing
builds confidence."
