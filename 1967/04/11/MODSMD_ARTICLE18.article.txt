# Four-Team Race
## Neutrinos Hold Mural Lead Daily Sports 
### STEVE SUOMI 
After two quarters of intra
mural activity the Neutrinos led
the University standings with a
total of 239 intramural points.
Closely following the group of
physics grad students are the
Theta Delts with 236 points,
with Sigma Chi Omega and SAE
still very much in the running
for University Champions with
218 and 200 points respectively.
Chiefly responsible for the
Neutrinos' first place standing
were their firsts in bowling and

billiards. Their bowling team set
an intramural record with 4303
total pins, ahead of the second
place Kappa Sigs. The billiards
final with Theta Chi was far
more exciting, the tournament
being decided by the final three
balls.
Chi's Win Basketball
Sigma Chi Omega won the
major team championship of the
quarter, basketball, as they eas
ily disposed of ATO in the finals,
57-33. Balanced scoring, led by
Tracy with 16 and Osburn with

10 allowed the Chi's to pull away
from a 24-15 half-time score and
turn the game into a rout.
The ATO's, who came into the
finals unblemished save for a
previous season loss to the Chi's
and an upset by Theta Xi, held
their own on the boards, but
could not keep up with Sigma
Chi Omega's blistering fast
break.
The other two divisional cham
pionships fell to Delta Chi in
wrestling and the Theta Delts in
weightlifting. The top ten teams
after two quarters of action are:

Neutrinos 239
Theta Delts 230
Sigma Chi Omega 218
SAE 200
Phi Kaps 182
El Toro 159
Donner 139
Kappa Alpha US
Delts 105
Delta Chi 95
