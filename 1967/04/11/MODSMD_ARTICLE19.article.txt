# Muddy Frosh Trackmen Swamp Reedley JC, 91-44
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
The Stanford freshman romped
through the mud last Friday
afternoon to destroy Reedley
College 91-44 for their second
win of the season.
Though performances were
slowed by the sloppy conditions,
the Papooses rejoiced at the
chance to run. Their last com
petition had been against Santa
Rosa J. C. nearly a month be
fore, and the San Jose meet had
been rained out.
Donart Leads
Jim Donart continued to be
the top sprinter for the Cards,
winning both the 100 and 220
with times of 10.0 and 22.6 re
spectively. Against Santa Rosa,
Jim was clocked in 9.8 for the
century.
Charlie Carrero won the triple
jump with a bound of 42-7",. He
also took second in the long

jump with 22'. He led until Reed
ley's Don Kimura leaped 22'-B*Â£"
on his last jump.
Record For Ostrander
Clint Ostrander, who set a
new freshman pole vault record
of 15' against Santa Rosa, also
won his specialty with 14'-6".
Tony Rogers, the leading 440
man, was slowed by a pulled
hamstring muscle and finished
second with a time of 53.6, far
off his best time of 50.8. Dan Ji
menez won the event with a
52.4.
Stanford's flying freshman,
s'-9V2" Dave Harper was first in
the high jump with a leap of s'-
10%", far off his best of 6-
7%".
For the second meet in a row,
the competition had no javelin
throwers. Neill Heller had the
best toss among the three Stan
ford chuckers with 187-11".
