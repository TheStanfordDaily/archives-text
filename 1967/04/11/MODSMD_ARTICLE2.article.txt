# Luce Outlines I.V.S. Role
## Volunteer Work Successful In Vietnam 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Thefe is a "growing hostility" to
ward American voh inteers in Viet
nam, yet International 1 Voluntary Ser
vices workers stay on maintaining
their paradoxical pc sition of work
ing in the wake of \ nilitary destruc
tion.
"We should be more concerned
about the Vietnamese ; and their prob
lems than about oi ir own national
conscience," said Do n Luce, director
of I.V.S. in Vietnam.
In an interview yesterday, Luce
told of the work of 1.V.5., a private,
international organi; :ation formed in
1957. An independe nt group, it re
ceives support from private sources
and the U.S. goverr iment, but main
tains a non-political status.
I.V.S. conducts pr ojects similar to
that of the Peace C< irps, the primary
difference between t! tie two being the
independent nature â–  Df I.V.S. and the

size of the organization. At present
there are about 50 volunteers work
ing as English teachers, 25 working
in agriculture, and 45 in community
development.
Luce said that the organization will
expand to include about 200 volun
teers, but plans no further large
scale growth. "We don't want to get
involved in the general escalation in
Vietnam," he said. "It's better to
get the Vietnamese involved in do
ing things and have one volunteer
stimulate organization than have
two or three volunteers do the work
themselves."
How do the Vietnamese villagers
view these "round-eyes"? Working in
refugee villages, many volunteers
have found that they are eventually
"judged as individuals", according to
Luce, yet it is increasingly difficult
to surmount the natural hostility to
the presence of any Americans.

"It's easier to communicate with
the younger people," he said. Yet once
the barriers are initially broken, the
volunteers may become a regular part
of community life. "The people see all
Americans at first as being very
rich . . . then they see us as volun
teers, and subsequently become more
open in their relationships," he said.
Despite the success of the organi
zation's work, the economic and social
deterioration of Vietnamese life pro
vides considerable hazards to volun
teer projects. Luce explained that
the national pride of the people has
been damaged considerably as people
are forced to sacrifice their integrity
in order to make a living.
Luce added that such corruption
and disruption of the traditional way
of life will provide the major barriers
to readjustment when the war ends.
The men who have existed as camp
followers and the girls who have

become prostitutes will "find it hard
to go back to producing rice," he
said.
Yet the Vietnamese show initiative
in reconstructing areas in their
damaged country. Luce cites the
growing participation of youth
groups as an indication of efforts
on the part of Vietnamese to rebuild
their country. In 1964 a group of 600
students organized to help in an area
of central Vietnam severely damaged
by floods. The next year, over 5,000
youths organized themselves into a
Summer Youth Program and estab
lished work camp projects through
out the country. In 1966 this program
expanded to include over 12,000
youths. Most of these students are of
high school age, between 15 and 18
and come from the provincial capi
tals, Luce explained. (Young people
in the villages seldom get an oppor
tunity for a high school education.)
Luce will speak on "The Economic
and Social Problems of Vietnam" to
night at 7:30 in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
