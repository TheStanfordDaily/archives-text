# Athletic Recruiting
## Grants-In-Aid, Work Pay For Need Cases

How important is the offer of a grant-in-aid or scholarship in
attracting a student-athlete to a school?
In certain cases, where a boy's parents are totally unable to meet
the costs of college, the recruit is obviously going to search for the
best opportunity he can get in financing his education, says Ath
letic Director Taylor.
At Stanford, the problem of paying for education is increased be
cause of the much higher cost of tuition, room, and board for the
individual. What Stanford offers in grants-in-aid would more than
pay only the cost of tuition at Stanford. This money factor is an
important element in a policy which aims at preventing Stanford's
recruiting process from degenerating into a buying contest with
other schools.
Stanford's athletic scholarships are really grants-in-aid. The
money for this program comes from the Buck Club, an organiza
tion of Stanford Alumni formed in 1934 to help pay the costs of
Stanford for student-athletes who can not afford it. Its 3600 mem
bers contributed $217,000 last year for 128 student-athletes repre
senting nine different sports.
Achievement Awards
Also, Stanford University can give Achievement Awards up to
16 a year to those student-athletes who excel in both academics and
athletics. There are ten boys receiving those awards now. The aca
demic standard for these awards is for all intents and purposes
the same as for an academic award. These awards are recognized
by the NCAA and AAWU and pay for tuition, room, and board.
The money for both types of awards is supervised by the Finan
cial Aids Office, whose job is to police the entire program and justi
fy each award. It checks to see that all conditions for aid are met,
and that all information is supplied. No one can receive aid from
Buck Club funds without a recommendation from the Athletic De
partment and a formal application for aid, according to Dr. Robert
Huff, Director of the Financial Aids Office.
The recruiter from the Athletic Department can only tell a boy
exactly what he will receive from the University and he must offer
no more than what the University can give. He also can not inquire
into any other school's terms of aid, which by NCAA bylaws can
not exceed the actual cost of tuition, room, and board at school
rates.
All AAWU awards are awarded for a period of one year, and
may be suspended during this period only for failure to attend
class or maintain satisfactory grades, or for signing a professional
athletics contract.
Award Continuation
The awards are renewable each spring fro the next year. A stu
dent-athlete must have a 2.0 average for this renewal, however. If
the boy decides not to compete, Taylor says, he almost never ap
pj'ss for the renewal of Buck Club Aid again. In certain cases,
wnere the boy is completely destitute, the Athletic Department ex
tends the award until the boy is able to pay for his education or
qualifies for other types of university aid. "I don't know of any
situation where a decision not to compete has resulted in the loss
of his grant-in-aid for the period in which it was awarded.
Taylor stated that in the Pat Morrison case, Morrison was re
ceiving his grant and would continue to receive it because of spe
cial AAU and international rules due to Morrison's British citizen
ship. "The grant-in-aid is in no way a lever to make him compete,"
Taylor stated.
The recruiter is involved in the recruiting process in the follow
ing manner: first, the recruiter can tell the boy he will be recom
mended for an award by the Athletic Department; second, after
he has talked with the Admissions Office and the Financial Aids
Office, the recruiter can tell the boy exactly what he can expect in
aid. "Because of this process," Dr. Huff states, "there is a very
close, formal working relationship between the three departments."
More Than Needed?
The question of need enters into all awards of grants-in-aid, but
the Financial Aids Office can give, on recommendation from the
Athletic Department, full tuition grants even though the need for
a full grant does not exist. There is a conference limit of 16 of these
grants. This limit is never reached at Stanford both because of the
limited amount of money available and University policy. This
policy attempts to keep an overall balance in the awards program
as to need vs. grant. "The present policy does not stick out as a
sore thumb," Dr. Huff states.
He adds, "I do not want to give the impression that athletes are
not a needy group, because the majority do need the grants. There
are a few, however, who do get more than they would get if the
awards were made on the basis of absolute need computation."
Dr. Huff explains that the formula for assistance is not that pre
cise that someone can say, "Here is someone getting more than he
should get." He adds that there is a more liberal standard for com
putation of the Buck Club award needs.
That a more liberal standard exists is justified, Dr. Huff says,
by the fact the funds for these Buck Club awards exist. "Remem
ber that the Buck Club funds are contributed solely for athletic pur
poses. I doubt that the money would come to the University if
the donor did not have any control over his gift. The fact that the
money is there allows a greater freedom in awards."
"Stanford will never go in the direction of buying athletes," he
concludes.
Work Situation
In many cases, the notification of a grant-in-aid award tells the
student-athlete that he will have to work for his room and board.
Last year, the Athletic Department paid $27,000 for work to 160
different boys at some point during the year. The student-athlete
can work as a hasher or do work in the Athletics Department cor
poration yard. The corp yard jobs involve normal maintenance of
athletic department facilities and grounds, and pay $2.25 an hour.
The amounts earned in the corp yard varied from $9 to $690 last
year. The student-athletes have preference for the corp yard jobs
because the Athletics Department insures the job opportunity
along with the Buck Club grant-in-aid. Student-athletes also have
priority in a limited number of hashing jobs.
Two other sources of money exist for the student-athletes. He
can work as a ticket taker or in related work at Athletic contests.
He may also qualify for Buck Club "hashing grants" which pay up
to 45% or that part of meal costs not earned. Taylor says that,
taken in the context of the entire University, the Athletic Depart
ment work is in no way unique, because a University employment
service helps anyone find jobs. He concludes, "Despite some situa
tions where supervision flaws allow some loafing, we think our
work program is the best in the conference, a very honest pro
gram."
In the final analysis, Dr. Huff feels, the Buck Club program is
an addition to the University, for it provides money which helps
the University free unrestricted money. This freed money is then
used to offer more scholarships to students. Ideally, however, the
Financial Aids Office would like to see all awards on the same need
basis, with less expectation of family support. In other words, he
hopes for more liberal awards in all areas.

Admissions Office and the Athletics Director.

policy attempts to keep an overall balance in the awards program
as to need vs. grant. "The present policy does not stick out as a
sore thumb," Dr. Huff states.
He adds, "I do not want to give the impression that athletes are
not a needy group, because the majority do need the grants. There
are a few, however, who do get more than they would get if the
awards were made on the basis of absolute need computation."
Dr. Huff explains that the formula for assistance is not that pre
cise that someone can say, "Here is someone getting more than he
should get." He adds that there is a more liberal standard for com
putation of the Buck Club award needs.
That a more liberal standard exists is justified, Dr. Huff says,
by the fact the funds for these Buck Club awards exist. "Remem
ber that the Buck Club funds are contributed solely for athletic pur
poses. I doubt that the money would come to the University if
the donor did not have any control over his gift. The fact that the
money is there allows a greater freedom in awards."
"Stanford will never go in the direction of buying athletes," he
concludes.
Work Situation
In many cases, the notification of a grant-in-aid award tells the
student-athlete that he will have to work for his room and board.
Last year, the Athletic Department paid $27,000 for work to 160
different boys at some point during the year. The student-athlete
can work as a hasher or do work in the Athletics Department cor
poration yard. The corp yard jobs involve normal maintenance of
athletic department facilities and grounds, and pay $2.25 an hour.
The amounts earned in the corp yard varied from $9 to $690 last
year. The student-athletes have preference for the corp yard jobs
because the Athletics Department insures the job opportunity
along with the Buck Club grant-in-aid. Student-athletes also have
priority in a limited number of hashing jobs.
Two other sources of money exist for the student-athletes. He
can work as a ticket taker or in related work at Athletic contests.
He may also qualify for Buck Club "hashing grants" which pay up
to 45% or that part of meal costs not earned. Taylor says that,
taken in the context of the entire University, the Athletic Depart
ment work is in no way unique, because a University employment
service helps anyone find jobs. He concludes, "Despite some situa
tions where supervision flaws allow some loafing, we think our
work program is the best in the conference, a very honest pro
gram."
In the final analysis, Dr. Huff feels, the Buck Club program is
an addition to the University, for it provides money which helps
the University free unrestricted money. This freed money is then
used to offer more scholarships to students. Ideally, however, the
Financial Aids Office would like to see all awards on the same need
basis, with less expectation of family support. In other words, he
hopes for more liberal awards in all areas.

How important is the offer of a grant-in-aid or scholarship in
attracting a student-athlete to a school?
In certain cases, where a boy's parents are totally unable to meet
the costs of college, the recruit is obviously going to search for the
best opportunity he can get in financing his education, says Ath
letic Director Taylor.
At Stanford, the problem of paying for education is increased be
cause of the much higher cost of tuition, room, and board for the
individual. What Stanford offers in grants-in-aid would more than
pay only the cost of tuition at Stanford. This money factor is an
important element in a policy which aims at preventing Stanford's
recruiting process from degenerating into a buying contest with
other schools.
Stanford's athletic scholarships are really grants-in-aid. The
money for this program comes from the Buck Club, an organiza
tion of Stanford Alumni formed in 1934 to help pay the costs of
Stanford for student-athletes who can not afford it. Its 3600 mem
bers contributed $217,000 last year for 128 student-athletes repre
senting nine different sports.
Achievement Awards
Also, Stanford University can give Achievement Awards up to
16 a year to those student-athletes who excel in both academics and
athletics. There are ten boys receiving those awards now. The aca
demic standard for these awards is for all intents and purposes
the same as for an academic award. These awards are recognized
by the NCAA and AAWU and pay for tuition, room, and board.
The money for both types of awards is supervised by the Finan
cial Aids Office, whose job is to police the entire program and justi
fy each award. It checks to see that all conditions for aid are met,
and that all information is supplied. No one can receive aid from
Buck Club funds without a recommendation from the Athletic De
partment and a formal application for aid, according to Dr. Robert
Huff, Director of the Financial Aids Office.
The recruiter from the Athletic Department can only tell a boy
exactly what he will receive from the University and he must offer
no more than what the University can give. He also can not inquire
into any other school's terms of aid, which by NCAA bylaws can
not exceed the actual cost of tuition, room, and board at school
rates.
All AAWU awards are awarded for a period of one year, and
may be suspended during this period only for failure to attend
class or maintain satisfactory grades, or for signing a professional
athletics contract.
Award Continuation
The awards are renewable each spring fro the next year. A stu
dent-athlete must have a 2.0 average for this renewal, however. If
the boy decides not to compete, Taylor says, he almost never ap
pj'ss for the renewal of Buck Club Aid again. In certain cases,
wnere the boy is completely destitute, the Athletic Department ex
tends the award until the boy is able to pay for his education or
qualifies for other types of university aid. "I don't know of any
situation where a decision not to compete has resulted in the loss
of his grant-in-aid for the period in which it was awarded.
Taylor stated that in the Pat Morrison case, Morrison was re
ceiving his grant and would continue to receive it because of spe
cial AAU and international rules due to Morrison's British citizen
ship. "The grant-in-aid is in no way a lever to make him compete,"
Taylor stated.
The recruiter is involved in the recruiting process in the follow
ing manner: first, the recruiter can tell the boy he will be recom
mended for an award by the Athletic Department; second, after
he has talked with the Admissions Office and the Financial Aids
Office, the recruiter can tell the boy exactly what he can expect in
aid. "Because of this process," Dr. Huff states, "there is a very
close, formal working relationship between the three departments."
More Than Needed?
The question of need enters into all awards of grants-in-aid, but
the Financial Aids Office can give, on recommendation from the
Athletic Department, full tuition grants even though the need for
a full grant does not exist. There is a conference limit of 16 of these
grants. This limit is never reached at Stanford both because of the
limited amount of money available and University policy. This
policy attempts to keep an overall balance in the awards program
as to need vs. grant. "The present policy does not stick out as a
sore thumb," Dr. Huff states.

Also, Stanford University can give Achievement Awards up to
16 a year to those student-athletes who excel in both academics and
athletics. There are ten boys receiving those awards now. The aca
demic standard for these awards is for all intents and purposes
the same as for an academic award. These awards are recognized
by the NCAA and AAWU and pay for tuition, room, and board.
The money for both types of awards is supervised by the Finan
cial Aids Office, whose job is to police the entire program and justi
fy each award. It checks to see that all conditions for aid are met,
and that all information is supplied. No one can receive aid from
Buck Club funds without a recommendation from the Athletic De
partment and a formal application for aid, according to Dr. Robert
Huff, Director of the Financial Aids Office.
The recruiter from the Athletic Department can only tell a boy
exactly what he will receive from the University and he must offer
no more than what the University can give. He also can not inquire
into any other school's terms of aid, which by NCAA bylaws can
not exceed the actual cost of tuition, room, and board at school
rates.
All AAWU awards are awarded for a period of one year, and
may be suspended during this period only for failure to attend
class or maintain satisfactory grades, or for signing a professional
athletics contract.
Award Continuation
The awards are renewable each spring fro the next year. A stu
dent-athlete must have a 2.0 average for this renewal, however. If
the boy decides not to compete, Taylor says, he almost never ap
pj'ss for the renewal of Buck Club Aid again. In certain cases,
wnere the boy is completely destitute, the Athletic Department ex
tends the award until the boy is able to pay for his education or
qualifies for other types of university aid. "I don't know of any
situation where a decision not to compete has resulted in the loss
of his grant-in-aid for the period in which it was awarded.
Taylor stated that in the Pat Morrison case, Morrison was re
ceiving his grant and would continue to receive it because of spe
cial AAU and international rules due to Morrison's British citizen
ship. "The grant-in-aid is in no way a lever to make him compete,"
Taylor stated.
The recruiter is involved in the recruiting process in the follow
ing manner: first, the recruiter can tell the boy he will be recom
mended for an award by the Athletic Department; second, after
he has talked with the Admissions Office and the Financial Aids
Office, the recruiter can tell the boy exactly what he can expect in
aid. "Because of this process," Dr. Huff states, "there is a very
close, formal working relationship between the three departments."
More Than Needed?
The question of need enters into all awards of grants-in-aid, but
the Financial Aids Office can give, on recommendation from the
Athletic Department, full tuition grants even though the need for
a full grant does not exist. There is a conference limit of 16 of these
grants. This limit is never reached at Stanford both because of the
limited amount of money available and University policy. This
policy attempts to keep an overall balance in the awards program
as to need vs. grant. "The present policy does not stick out as a
sore thumb," Dr. Huff states.
He adds, "I do not want to give the impression that athletes are
not a needy group, because the majority do need the grants. There
are a few, however, who do get more than they would get if the
awards were made on the basis of absolute need computation."
Dr. Huff explains that the formula for assistance is not that pre
cise that someone can say, "Here is someone getting more than he
should get." He adds that there is a more liberal standard for com
putation of the Buck Club award needs.
That a more liberal standard exists is justified, Dr. Huff says,
by the fact the funds for these Buck Club awards exist. "Remem
ber that the Buck Club funds are contributed solely for athletic pur
poses. I doubt that the money would come to the University if
the donor did not have any control over his gift. The fact that the
money is there allows a greater freedom in awards."
"Stanford will never go in the direction of buying athletes," he
concludes.
Work Situation
In many cases, the notification of a grant-in-aid award tells the
student-athlete that he will have to work for his room and board.
Last year, the Athletic Department paid $27,000 for work to 160
different boys at some point during the year. The student-athlete
can work as a hasher or do work in the Athletics Department cor
poration yard. The corp yard jobs involve normal maintenance of
athletic department facilities and grounds, and pay $2.25 an hour.
The amounts earned in the corp yard varied from $9 to $690 last
year. The student-athletes have preference for the corp yard jobs
because the Athletics Department insures the job opportunity
along with the Buck Club grant-in-aid. Student-athletes also have
priority in a limited number of hashing jobs.
Two other sources of money exist for the student-athletes. He
can work as a ticket taker or in related work at Athletic contests.
He may also qualify for Buck Club "hashing grants" which pay up
to 45% or that part of meal costs not earned. Taylor says that,
taken in the context of the entire University, the Athletic Depart
ment work is in no way unique, because a University employment
service helps anyone find jobs. He concludes, "Despite some situa
tions where supervision flaws allow some loafing, we think our
work program is the best in the conference, a very honest pro
gram."
In the final analysis, Dr. Huff feels, the Buck Club program is
an addition to the University, for it provides money which helps
the University free unrestricted money. This freed money is then
used to offer more scholarships to students. Ideally, however, the
Financial Aids Office would like to see all awards on the same need
basis, with less expectation of family support. In other words, he
hopes for more liberal awards in all areas.

How important is the offer of a grant-in-aid or scholarship in
attracting a student-athlete to a school?
In certain cases, where a boy's parents are totally unable to meet
the costs of college, the recruit is obviously going to search for the
best opportunity he can get in financing his education, says Ath
letic Director Taylor.
At Stanford, the problem of paying for education is increased be
cause of the much higher cost of tuition, room, and board for the
individual. What Stanford offers in grants-in-aid would more than
pay only the cost of tuition at Stanford. This money factor is an
important element in a policy which aims at preventing Stanford's
recruiting process from degenerating into a buying contest with
other schools.
Stanford's athletic scholarships are really grants-in-aid. The
money for this program comes from the Buck Club, an organiza
tion of Stanford Alumni formed in 1934 to help pay the costs of
Stanford for student-athletes who can not afford it. Its 3600 mem
bers contributed $217,000 last year for 128 student-athletes repre
senting nine different sports.

student-athlete that he will have to work for his room and board.
Last year, the Athletic Department paid $27,000 for work to 160
different boys at some point during the year. The student-athlete
can work as a hasher or do work in the Athletics Department cor
poration yard. The corp yard jobs involve normal maintenance of
athletic department facilities and grounds, and pay $2.25 an hour.
The amounts earned in the corp yard varied from $9 to $690 last
year. The student-athletes have preference for the corp yard jobs
because the Athletics Department insures the job opportunity
along with the Buck Club grant-in-aid. Student-athletes also have
priority in a limited number of hashing jobs.
Two other sources of money exist for the student-athletes. He
can work as a ticket taker or in related work at Athletic contests.
He may also qualify for Buck Club "hashing grants" which pay up
to 45% or that part of meal costs not earned. Taylor says that,
taken in the context of the entire University, the Athletic Depart
ment work is in no way unique, because a University employment
service helps anyone find jobs. He concludes, "Despite some situa
tions where supervision flaws allow some loafing, we think our
work program is the best in the conference, a very honest pro
gram."
In the final analysis, Dr. Huff feels, the Buck Club program is
an addition to the University, for it provides money which helps
the University free unrestricted money. This freed money is then
used to offer more scholarships to students. Ideally, however, the
Financial Aids Office would like to see all awards on the same need
basis, with less expectation of family support. In other words, he
hopes for more liberal awards in all areas.

How important is the offer of a grant-in-aid or scholarship in
attracting a student-athlete to a school?
In certain cases, where a boy's parents are totally unable to meet
the costs of college, the recruit is obviously going to search for the
best opportunity he can get in financing his education, says Ath
letic Director Taylor.
At Stanford, the problem of paying for education is increased be
cause of the much higher cost of tuition, room, and board for the
individual. What Stanford offers in grants-in-aid would more than
pay only the cost of tuition at Stanford. This money factor is an
important element in a policy which aims at preventing Stanford's
recruiting process from degenerating into a buying contest with
other schools.
Stanford's athletic scholarships are really grants-in-aid. The
money for this program comes from the Buck Club, an organiza
tion of Stanford Alumni formed in 1934 to help pay the costs of
Stanford for student-athletes who can not afford it. Its 3600 mem
bers contributed $217,000 last year for 128 student-athletes repre
senting nine different sports.
Achievement Awards
Also, Stanford University can give Achievement Awards up to
16 a year to those student-athletes who excel in both academics and
athletics. There are ten boys receiving those awards now. The aca
demic standard for these awards is for all intents and purposes
the same as for an academic award. These awards are recognized
by the NCAA and AAWU and pay for tuition, room, and board.
The money for both types of awards is supervised by the Finan
cial Aids Office, whose job is to police the entire program and justi
fy each award. It checks to see that all conditions for aid are met,
and that all information is supplied. No one can receive aid from
Buck Club funds without a recommendation from the Athletic De
partment and a formal application for aid, according to Dr. Robert
Huff, Director of the Financial Aids Office.
The recruiter from the Athletic Department can only tell a boy
exactly what he will receive from the University and he must offer
no more than what the University can give. He also can not inquire
into any other school's terms of aid, which by NCAA bylaws can
not exceed the actual cost of tuition, room, and board at school
rates.
All AAWU awards are awarded for a period of one year, and
may be suspended during this period only for failure to attend
class or maintain satisfactory grades, or for signing a professional
athletics contract.
Award Continuation
The awards are renewable each spring fro the next year. A stu
dent-athlete must have a 2.0 average for this renewal, however. If
the boy decides not to compete, Taylor says, he almost never ap
pj'ss for the renewal of Buck Club Aid again. In certain cases,
wnere the boy is completely destitute, the Athletic Department ex
tends the award until the boy is able to pay for his education or
qualifies for other types of university aid. "I don't know of any
situation where a decision not to compete has resulted in the loss
of his grant-in-aid for the period in which it was awarded.
Taylor stated that in the Pat Morrison case, Morrison was re
ceiving his grant and would continue to receive it because of spe
cial AAU and international rules due to Morrison's British citizen
ship. "The grant-in-aid is in no way a lever to make him compete,"
Taylor stated.
The recruiter is involved in the recruiting process in the follow
ing manner: first, the recruiter can tell the boy he will be recom
mended for an award by the Athletic Department; second, after
he has talked with the Admissions Office and the Financial Aids
Office, the recruiter can tell the boy exactly what he can expect in
aid. "Because of this process," Dr. Huff states, "there is a very
close, formal working relationship between the three departments."
More Than Needed?
The question of need enters into all awards of grants-in-aid, but
the Financial Aids Office can give, on recommendation from the
Athletic Department, full tuition grants even though the need for
a full grant does not exist. There is a conference limit of 16 of these
grants. This limit is never reached at Stanford both because of the
limited amount of money available and University policy. This
policy attempts to keep an overall balance in the awards program
as to need vs. grant. "The present policy does not stick out as a
sore thumb," Dr. Huff states.
He adds, "I do not want to give the impression that athletes are
not a needy group, because the majority do need the grants. There
are a few, however, who do get more than they would get if the
awards were made on the basis of absolute need computation."
Dr. Huff explains that the formula for assistance is not that pre
cise that someone can say, "Here is someone getting more than he
should get." He adds that there is a more liberal standard for com
putation of the Buck Club award needs.
That a more liberal standard exists is justified, Dr. Huff says,
by the fact the funds for these Buck Club awards exist. "Remem
ber that the Buck Club funds are contributed solely for athletic pur
poses. I doubt that the money would come to the University if
the donor did not have any control over his gift. The fact that the
money is there allows a greater freedom in awards."
"Stanford will never go in the direction of buying athletes," he
concludes.
