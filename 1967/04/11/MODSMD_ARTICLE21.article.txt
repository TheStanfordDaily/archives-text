# Sailing Team Wins Kennedy Cup
## 
### PAT KLEIN 
Stanford's ocean racing crew,
skippered by senior Skip Allan,
won the Kennedy Cup races Sun
day in Annapolis, Md. by a slim
two points.
The team won two of the four
races, including the deciding fi
nal race for victory.
The National Intercollegiate
Racing Association (NIYRA) re
gards the Kennedy Regatta as
the national ocean racing cham
pionships.
Final Race Drama
Within an hour of the final
race an extremely tight contest
had developed. Stanford and
Harvard were tied with 27
points, and U.S.C. had 25. The
winner of the last race would
capture the cup.
All three contenders got off to
excellent starts. U.S.C. was
plagued with spinaker prob
lems, although Harvard made
few mistakes. Neither team was
able to forge ahead of the Indian
boat.
Stanford finished one minute
ahead of U.S.C. and Harvard,
and finished third.

Tom McCarthy, freshman
member of the crew spoke for
his six crewmates when he said:
"Skip's (Allan's) starts are al
most incredible. His timing and
directions are perfect. He really
did a great job leading us."
Prelim Races
Shifting winds and strong cur
rents made the first race a
shambles. Stanford took the
lead, lost it and went to last
position four times during the
race.
At the finish, Tufts won, fol
lowed by Princeton, Harvard,
and Stanford.
The teams exchanged boats
for the second race. Despite even
worse conditions, the team deter
mined to make a shambles of
the second race competition.
Again Allan made a perfect
start, and Stanford led the en
tire race. Wisconsin finished sec
ond. U.S.C. was third. The third
race was cancelled due to no
wind.
A slow start and spinaker
problems in the first race Sun
day morning spelled a fourth
place for the Tribe. U.S.C., mak
ing a fierce bid for the cham
pionship, won.
Champagne Ceremonies
The elated national champions
filled their huge silver bowl with
champagne and sipped their win
ners' spoils in the Academy ad
miral's quarters.
Crew members for the Tribe
boat included Kim Desenberg,
first mate and alternate helms
man; Ray Wilde, cockpit; Craig
McCabe, cockpit; Dick Emersen,
navigator; Steve Richard, cock
pit; Bruce Wright, foredeck; and
Tom McCarthy, foredeck.
Stanford had 38 points, Har
vard had 36, U.S.C. had 35, Tufts
28, Princeton 27, Wisconsin 26,
Georgetown 25, Navy 20, Florida
