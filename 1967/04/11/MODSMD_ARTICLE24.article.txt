The Ford Foundation's $4 million grant to fi
nance the education of Stanford's Ph.D. candi
dates in humanities and sciences should result
in a significant improvement of doctoral pro
grams.
At present, it takes an average of over seven
years for these candidates to receive their de
grees, although Stanford has long been commit
ted to a four-year Ph.D. program. Unfortunately,
a large number of graduate students have found
it necessary to interrupt their studies and take
on teaching jobs to finance the rest of their edu
cation. This has placed an unreasonable burden
upon young scholars in humanities and sciences,
resulting in an unusually high attrition rate.
In providing full, four-year financial support
to all entering Ph.D. candidates in humanities
and sciences, Stanford should be able to increase

the quality of its graduate students. The new
program will attract a number of outstanding
candidates who would otherwise not have been
able to afford to pursue their studies at this level
and will also considerably improve the Ph.D. pro
grams by providing a regularized schedule for
the completion of all requirements, as well as
integration of teaching and study.
But the quality of graduate students will not
improve simply because there is money available
to pay for their educations. We hope Stanford
will use this opportunity to reevaluate its admis
sion standards to be sure to get the most quali
fied students, now that the number of applicants
will undoubtedly increase. We also hope the Uni
versity will not cut back the funds it is already
allocating to support Ph.D. candidates in the
humanities and sciences.
