# Experiment Petition
## 
### 
The University has apparently decidcd it
needs centrally located office space more than
students need the Experiment. The decision not
to allow the Experiment to keep its present
quarters is based on practical, not political,
grounds, it says.
If the administration is sincere in its convic
tion, then we must question its sense of priori
ties. The Experiment offers students an exciting

complement, within the framework of the Uni
versity, to the ordinary university education.
The administration should encourage this kind
of activity.
The Experiment is circulating a petition ask
ing the administration to find a new location for
it. We urge the members of this community to
give the Experiment a vote of confidence by
signing the petition.
