# The 						Capitol Scene
## 'Run For President? Me?' 
### Art Buchwald 
This is the time of year when
everyone is checking on the
1968 Republican nominees for
President. It isn't easy when
you speak to them to guess
then intentions, as I discovered
talking to one politician whose
good name has been bandied
about.
"Sir," I said, "your name has
been mentioned as a possible
Presidential candidate for 1968.
What do you have to say about
this?"
"It's absolute nonsense. I
have enough to do serving the
good people of my state for the
next four years and I have no
Presidential aspirations at this
time."
"But there have been 20 Glotz
for President offices opened up
around the country," I said.
Just Not Interested
"Twenty-three, to be exact.
There are two more opening
next week. I would like to say
I strongly disapprove of these
activities started by many well
meaning supporters. I have re
peatedly told them at fund
raising dinners, rallies and
press conferences that I am not
interested in running for the
Presidential office in 1968. Un
fortunately, I cannot control
what any private citizen wants
to do on his own."
"Yes, sir. I went to your cam
paign headquarters at 1750
Pennsylvania Ave."
"You mean 1755, don't you?

The phone number is Arizona
2-3456. What about it?"
"Well, they seemed to indi
cate that you had no objection
to their starting the bandwagon
rolling at this time."
"Well, they're wrong. I told
them at a strategy meeting the
other night that I did not wish
to be considered a candidate
and I would hope they'd respect
my wishes in this respect. I
further told them I would only
accept nonpolitical speeches to
GOP delegates and Young Re
publican clubs. I reminded
them there were so many bet
ter candidates than myself.
Like Who?
"Gov. Klonk, for example.
You know, the one who bank
rupted his state. I think he'd
make a fine candidate. And Sen.
Zap. He's young, attractive, has
tremendous sex appeal, and I
don't think his inexperience in
government should be held
against him.
"Then there's Sen. Zilch, who
certainly has a great deal of
strength in the Black Power
areas. I could support Sen.
Zilch with a clear conscience,
even though I would hate the
religious issue to come up in
1968."
"What about former Vice-
President Zimmer?"
"Zimmer has worked very
hard for the Republican Party
since he was Vice-President and
should be given another shot at
the big job. The fact he hasn't

even been able to get elected to
Blue Cross in the last four
years should not be considered.
He's just had a series of bad
breaks."
Dark Horse
"Sir, there's some talk that
Gov. Rhubarb might be a dark
horse candidate."
"I've known Gov. Rhubarb
and I have the highest respect
for him. I also feel strongly
that a man who has been divor
ced three times would make
just as good a candidate as a
man who has only been married
once, so I hope no one will
bring that up at the conven
tion."
"Well, it appears you're really
working for other candidates
rather than for yourself."
"You bet I am. I promised
Ray Bliss that no matter what
I did, I would not attack any
Republican publicly and en
danger our chances in 1968."
"In case of a deadlock, would
you consider a draft for your
self?"
"I think I've made my posi
tion clear that I am not inter
ested in the job. Of course, if
President Eisenhower asked me
to run. .. "

"Sir," I said, "your name has
been mentioned as a possible
Presidential candidate for 1968.
What do you have to say about
this?"
"It's absolute nonsense. I
have enough to do serving the
good people of my state for the
next four years and I have no
Presidential aspirations at this
time."
"But there have been 20 Glotz
for President offices opened up
around the country," I said.
Just Not Interested
"Twenty-three, to be exact.
There are two more opening
next week. I would like to say
I strongly disapprove of these
activities started by many well
meaning supporters. I have re
peatedly told them at fund
raising dinners, rallies and
press conferences that I am not
interested in running for the
Presidential office in 1968. Un
fortunately, I cannot control
what any private citizen wants
to do on his own."
"Yes, sir. I went to your cam
paign headquarters at 1750
Pennsylvania Ave."
"You mean 1755, don't you?

The phone number is Arizona
2-3456. What about it?"
"Well, they seemed to indi
cate that you had no objection
to their starting the bandwagon
rolling at this time."
"Well, they're wrong. I told
them at a strategy meeting the
other night that I did not wish
to be considered a candidate
and I would hope they'd respect
my wishes in this respect. I
further told them I would only
accept nonpolitical speeches to
GOP delegates and Young Re
publican clubs. I reminded
them there were so many bet
ter candidates than myself.
Like Who?
"Gov. Klonk, for example.
You know, the one who bank
rupted his state. I think he'd
make a fine candidate. And Sen.
Zap. He's young, attractive, has
tremendous sex appeal, and I
don't think his inexperience in
government should be held
against him.
"Then there's Sen. Zilch, who
certainly has a great deal of
strength in the Black Power
areas. I could support Sen.
Zilch with a clear conscience,
even though I would hate the
religious issue to come up in
1968."
"What about former Vice-
President Zimmer?"
"Zimmer has worked very
hard for the Republican Party
since he was Vice-President and
should be given another shot at
the big job. The fact he hasn't

even been able to get elected to
Blue Cross in the last four
years should not be considered.
He's just had a series of bad
breaks."
Dark Horse
"Sir, there's some talk that
Gov. Rhubarb might be a dark
horse candidate."
"I've known Gov. Rhubarb
and I have the highest respect
for him. I also feel strongly
that a man who has been divor
ced three times would make
just as good a candidate as a
man who has only been married
once, so I hope no one will
bring that up at the conven
tion."
"Well, it appears you're really
working for other candidates
rather than for yourself."
"You bet I am. I promised
Ray Bliss that no matter what
I did, I would not attack any
Republican publicly and en
danger our chances in 1968."
"In case of a deadlock, would
you consider a draft for your
self?"
"I think I've made my posi
tion clear that I am not inter
ested in the job. Of course, if
President Eisenhower asked me
to run. .. "
This is the time of year when
everyone is checking on the
1968 Republican nominees for
President. It isn't easy when
you speak to them to guess
then intentions, as I discovered
talking to one politician whose
good name has been bandied
