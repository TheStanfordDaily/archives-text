# Letters To The Editor
## Staley Denies Viet Link 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Because of liberal and inter
nationalist views I have some
times been accused of "com
munism," so now to be accused
of "simple anti-communism"
perhaps should be taken as re
storing the balance. The truth is
considerably more complex. But
the purpose of this letter is not
to expound my political philo
sophy. It is only to note a few
of the many errors and distor
tions in materials recently cir
culated on campus and sum
marized in your April 4 issue,
with respect to matters on
which I happen to have direct
knowledge.
My mission to Vietnam in
1961 was not for SRI, from
which I was on leave. No one
from SRI worked with me in
Vietnam, contrary to the April
4 story. I headed an interde
partmental "Special Financial
Group" from the U.S. govern
ment sent by President Ken
nedy at the request of President
Diem. We worked out with our
counterparts of the South Viet
namese government a joint fin
ancial plan for the next year
and a half, including some high
ly delicate issues related to the
exchange rate.
Cost Estimates
In order to arrive at a finan
cial plan, we prepared estimates
for amounts and costs of mili
tary and security forces, for a
short-range economic-social ac
tion program seeking immedi
ate improvement especially in
the villages, and for starting or
continuing various aspects of
a longer-range effort of econo
mic and social development to
the extent that conditions in the
country would permit.
We urged very strongly that
security measures and econo
mic-social measures ought to be
regarded as two sides of the
same coin. Security cannot be
achieved without economic-so
cial reform, nor economic and
social progress without secur
ity. We put great weight on
"civic action" as an important
part of the duty of the military,
on establishing better commu
nication with the villages, on
medical and health aid, on
schools, and on agricultural and
industrial development pro
grams.
Strategic Hamlet
I should say a little more on
one item because it has been
seized upon and, on the basis of
erroneous information, inflated
into an allegation that I (and
therefore Stanford) was respon
sible for the ill-starred "strate
gic hamlet" program. The facts
are these:
For a couple of years Presi
dent Diem's government had
been experimenting with what
he called "agrovilles." These
consisted of central civic util
ities — shops, offices, schools,
etc. — constructed on a modest
but well-designed basis, and
around them plots with fish
ponds and gardens and houses
of the local type. In the Mekong
Delta many people live in scat
tered houses along the canals
or watercourses; it was thought
that the "agroville" would have
the dual advantage of (1) in
creasing their defensibility
against Viet-Cong terrorism and
(2) making it feasible to pro
vide more and better schools,
clinics, pure water, etc.
Raise Living; Level
The designs were being work
ed out by a talented young Viet
namese architect and city plan
ner (I say "talented" because
in Europe he ha' 1 won a Prix de
Rome). On visits to two of the
completed "agrovilles," he ex
plained to me enthusiastically
how thrilled he was to be able
to do this sort of work to raise
the level of living.
After checking with people
supposed to have expert and
local knowledge, it was our view
that the idea was in principle a
good one, or least worth pur

suing further. But we also
learned that some of Diem's of
ficials had given the "agrovil
les" a bad reputation by lack of
consideration for peasants' in
terests — for example, forcing
them to labor at the construc
tion when they should have
been harvesting.
Reduce Labor
Also, the amount of heavy la
bor in constructing the canals,
fishponds, and all was very con
siderable. We proposed financ
ing additional "agrovilles," but
with more attention to peasant
interests and with study and
experimentation designed to
find ways to reduce the onerous
labor requirements. For ex
ample, we suggested efforts to
adapt earth-moving and ditch
digging machinery to the diffi
cult environment of the Delta.
I have no direct knowledge of
the "strategic hamlet" program
that was embarked upon later,
and had no part in planning or
implementing it. Judging from
what I have heard, it was not
the sort of thing we had in
mind, and also it was apparent
ly pushed much too fast.
It is certainly not true, as
alleged on the basis of a very
erroneous story by a French
writer, that Ngo Dinh Nhu
"sold" me a strategic hamlet
idea or any other idea. I never
met Nhu, he and Mme. Nhu
were in Europe or North Africa
during the entire time of my
mission. Incidentally, I have al
ways suspected that we were
able to get further in negotia
tions with President Diem on
certain issues because brother
Nhu was not there.

Editor, The Daily:
So far as I know, William
Bredo did not work "in Viet
nam" with Eugene Staley,
though The Daily's saying so in
reporting my discussion of
SRl's involvement in Vietnam
(in Resistance) may have re
sulted from ambiguity on my
part.
In 1961, at the time of Prof.
Staley's mission to Vietnam,
both he and Dr. Bredo were
senior economists at SRI. In
1960 Dr. Bredo published a book
for SRl's International Indus
trial Development Center, of
which Staley was Director, and
Staley wrote the introduction.
Since publishing my report
on SRI, I have learned that its
ACTIV project in Saigon was
apparently an on-the-spot exten
sion of the Fort Ord Combat
Development Experimentation
Center . . . and that things can
be sent from Stanford to SRI

Editor, The Daily:
I do not wish to appear in
cestuous by supporting the con
tentions of The Daily's drama
critic on SRT's latest show, In
admissible Evidence. I also saw
their show and incidentally dis
liked it.
But when interested specta
tors like Thomas Moser, Ex
ecutive Head in the Department
of English, start squealing be
cause their friends and collea
gues in SRT get bad newspaper
notices, then it is time to answer
the faculty back.
Professor Moser feels that he
can prove this point by citing
the Chronicle drama critic, Was
serman, who called the show
'superb.' However, Wasserman's
opinion is at least discredited
by the fact that he thinks the
opening trial sequence of the
play is real and that the rest is

a flashback. In reality, Osborne's
opening scene is a nightmare
dreamt by the lawyer on the
sofa in his office after a surfeit
of ladies and booze. Perhaps if
Wasserman were to read his
next piece of work, Professor
Moser will get better testimony
from that particular quarter.
If he really wants good sup
port for Inadmissible Evidence,
Moser should listen to Leon
Katz (also ex-Stanford, there
fore not entirely unbiased) on
Channel 9 next Thursday. Katz,
who I am told might return to
Stanford, says the Stanford pro
duction is so 'magnificent' that
he will devote twenty whole
minutes of television to it. Hap

perhaps should be taken as re
storing the balance. The truth is
considerably more complex. But
the purpose of this letter is not
to expound my political philo
sophy. It is only to note a few
of the many errors and distor
tions in materials recently cir
culated on campus and sum
marized in your April 4 issue,
with respect to matters on
which I happen to have direct
knowledge.
My mission to Vietnam in
1961 was not for SRI, from
which I was on leave. No one
from SRI worked with me in
Vietnam, contrary to the April
4 story. I headed an interde
partmental "Special Financial
Group" from the U.S. govern
ment sent by President Ken
nedy at the request of President
Diem. We worked out with our
counterparts of the South Viet
namese government a joint fin
ancial plan for the next year
and a half, including some high
ly delicate issues related to the
exchange rate.
Cost Estimates
In order to arrive at a finan
cial plan, we prepared estimates
for amounts and costs of mili
tary and security forces, for a
short-range economic-social ac
tion program seeking immedi
ate improvement especially in
the villages, and for starting or
continuing various aspects of
a longer-range effort of econo
mic and social development to
the extent that conditions in the
country would permit.
We urged very strongly that
security measures and econo
mic-social measures ought to be
regarded as two sides of the
same coin. Security cannot be
achieved without economic-so
cial reform, nor economic and
social progress without secur
ity. We put great weight on
"civic action" as an important
part of the duty of the military,
on establishing better commu
nication with the villages, on
medical and health aid, on
schools, and on agricultural and
industrial development pro
grams.
Strategic Hamlet
I should say a little more on
one item because it has been
seized upon and, on the basis of
erroneous information, inflated
into an allegation that I (and
therefore Stanford) was respon
sible for the ill-starred "strate
gic hamlet" program. The facts
are these:
For a couple of years Presi
dent Diem's government had
been experimenting with what
he called "agrovilles." These
consisted of central civic util
ities — shops, offices, schools,
etc. — constructed on a modest
but well-designed basis, and
around them plots with fish
ponds and gardens and houses
of the local type. In the Mekong
Delta many people live in scat
tered houses along the canals
or watercourses; it was thought
that the "agroville" would have
the dual advantage of (1) in
creasing their defensibility
against Viet-Cong terrorism and
(2) making it feasible to pro
vide more and better schools,
clinics, pure water, etc.
Raise Living; Level
The designs were being work
ed out by a talented young Viet
namese architect and city plan
ner (I say "talented" because
in Europe he ha' 1 won a Prix de
Rome). On visits to two of the
completed "agrovilles," he ex
plained to me enthusiastically
how thrilled he was to be able
to do this sort of work to raise
the level of living.
After checking with people
supposed to have expert and
local knowledge, it was our view
that the idea was in principle a
good one, or least worth pur

suing further. But we also
learned that some of Diem's of
ficials had given the "agrovil
les" a bad reputation by lack of
consideration for peasants' in
terests — for example, forcing
them to labor at the construc
tion when they should have
been harvesting.
Reduce Labor
Also, the amount of heavy la
bor in constructing the canals,
fishponds, and all was very con
siderable. We proposed financ
ing additional "agrovilles," but
with more attention to peasant
interests and with study and
experimentation designed to
find ways to reduce the onerous
labor requirements. For ex
ample, we suggested efforts to
adapt earth-moving and ditch
digging machinery to the diffi
cult environment of the Delta.
I have no direct knowledge of
the "strategic hamlet" program
that was embarked upon later,
and had no part in planning or
implementing it. Judging from
what I have heard, it was not
the sort of thing we had in
mind, and also it was apparent
ly pushed much too fast.
It is certainly not true, as
alleged on the basis of a very
erroneous story by a French
writer, that Ngo Dinh Nhu
"sold" me a strategic hamlet
idea or any other idea. I never
met Nhu, he and Mme. Nhu
were in Europe or North Africa
during the entire time of my
mission. Incidentally, I have al
ways suspected that we were
able to get further in negotia
tions with President Diem on
certain issues because brother
Nhu was not there.

of the many errors and distor
tions in materials recently cir
culated on campus and sum
marized in your April 4 issue,
with respect to matters on
which I happen to have direct
knowledge.
My mission to Vietnam in
1961 was not for SRI, from
which I was on leave. No one
from SRI worked with me in
Vietnam, contrary to the April
4 story. I headed an interde
partmental "Special Financial
Group" from the U.S. govern
ment sent by President Ken
nedy at the request of President
Diem. We worked out with our
counterparts of the South Viet
namese government a joint fin
ancial plan for the next year
and a half, including some high
ly delicate issues related to the
exchange rate.
Cost Estimates
In order to arrive at a finan
cial plan, we prepared estimates
for amounts and costs of mili
tary and security forces, for a
short-range economic-social ac
tion program seeking immedi
ate improvement especially in
the villages, and for starting or
continuing various aspects of
a longer-range effort of econo
mic and social development to
the extent that conditions in the
country would permit.
We urged very strongly that
security measures and econo
mic-social measures ought to be
regarded as two sides of the
same coin. Security cannot be
achieved without economic-so
cial reform, nor economic and
social progress without secur
ity. We put great weight on
"civic action" as an important
part of the duty of the military,
on establishing better commu
nication with the villages, on
medical and health aid, on
schools, and on agricultural and
industrial development pro
grams.
Strategic Hamlet
I should say a little more on
one item because it has been
seized upon and, on the basis of
erroneous information, inflated
into an allegation that I (and
therefore Stanford) was respon
sible for the ill-starred "strate
gic hamlet" program. The facts
are these:
For a couple of years Presi
dent Diem's government had
been experimenting with what
he called "agrovilles." These
consisted of central civic util
ities — shops, offices, schools,
etc. — constructed on a modest
but well-designed basis, and
around them plots with fish
ponds and gardens and houses
of the local type. In the Mekong
Delta many people live in scat
tered houses along the canals
or watercourses; it was thought
that the "agroville" would have
the dual advantage of (1) in
creasing their defensibility
against Viet-Cong terrorism and
(2) making it feasible to pro
vide more and better schools,
clinics, pure water, etc.
Raise Living; Level
The designs were being work
ed out by a talented young Viet
namese architect and city plan
ner (I say "talented" because
in Europe he ha' 1 won a Prix de
Rome). On visits to two of the
completed "agrovilles," he ex
plained to me enthusiastically
how thrilled he was to be able
to do this sort of work to raise
the level of living.
After checking with people
supposed to have expert and
local knowledge, it was our view
that the idea was in principle a
good one, or least worth pur

suing further. But we also
learned that some of Diem's of
ficials had given the "agrovil
les" a bad reputation by lack of
consideration for peasants' in
terests — for example, forcing
them to labor at the construc
tion when they should have
been harvesting.
Reduce Labor
Also, the amount of heavy la
bor in constructing the canals,
fishponds, and all was very con
siderable. We proposed financ
ing additional "agrovilles," but
with more attention to peasant
interests and with study and
experimentation designed to
find ways to reduce the onerous
labor requirements. For ex
ample, we suggested efforts to
adapt earth-moving and ditch
digging machinery to the diffi
cult environment of the Delta.
I have no direct knowledge of
the "strategic hamlet" program
that was embarked upon later,
and had no part in planning or
implementing it. Judging from
what I have heard, it was not
the sort of thing we had in
mind, and also it was apparent
ly pushed much too fast.
It is certainly not true, as
alleged on the basis of a very
erroneous story by a French
writer, that Ngo Dinh Nhu
"sold" me a strategic hamlet
idea or any other idea. I never
met Nhu, he and Mme. Nhu
were in Europe or North Africa
during the entire time of my
mission. Incidentally, I have al
ways suspected that we were
able to get further in negotia
tions with President Diem on
certain issues because brother
Nhu was not there.

My mission to Vietnam in
1961 was not for SRI, from
which I was on leave. No one
from SRI worked with me in
Vietnam, contrary to the April
4 story. I headed an interde
partmental "Special Financial
Group" from the U.S. govern
ment sent by President Ken
nedy at the request of President
Diem. We worked out with our
counterparts of the South Viet
namese government a joint fin
ancial plan for the next year
and a half, including some high
ly delicate issues related to the
exchange rate.
Cost Estimates
In order to arrive at a finan
cial plan, we prepared estimates
for amounts and costs of mili
tary and security forces, for a
short-range economic-social ac
tion program seeking immedi
ate improvement especially in
the villages, and for starting or
continuing various aspects of
a longer-range effort of econo
mic and social development to
the extent that conditions in the
country would permit.
We urged very strongly that
security measures and econo
mic-social measures ought to be
regarded as two sides of the
same coin. Security cannot be
achieved without economic-so
cial reform, nor economic and
social progress without secur
ity. We put great weight on
"civic action" as an important
part of the duty of the military,
on establishing better commu
nication with the villages, on
medical and health aid, on
schools, and on agricultural and
industrial development pro
grams.
Strategic Hamlet
I should say a little more on
one item because it has been
seized upon and, on the basis of
erroneous information, inflated
into an allegation that I (and
therefore Stanford) was respon
sible for the ill-starred "strate
gic hamlet" program. The facts
are these:
For a couple of years Presi
dent Diem's government had
been experimenting with what
he called "agrovilles." These
consisted of central civic util
ities — shops, offices, schools,
etc. — constructed on a modest
but well-designed basis, and
around them plots with fish
ponds and gardens and houses
of the local type. In the Mekong
Delta many people live in scat
tered houses along the canals
or watercourses; it was thought
that the "agroville" would have
the dual advantage of (1) in
creasing their defensibility
against Viet-Cong terrorism and
(2) making it feasible to pro
vide more and better schools,
clinics, pure water, etc.
Raise Living; Level
The designs were being work
ed out by a talented young Viet
namese architect and city plan
ner (I say "talented" because
in Europe he ha' 1 won a Prix de
Rome). On visits to two of the
completed "agrovilles," he ex
plained to me enthusiastically
how thrilled he was to be able
to do this sort of work to raise
the level of living.
After checking with people
supposed to have expert and
local knowledge, it was our view
that the idea was in principle a
good one, or least worth pur

suing further. But we also
learned that some of Diem's of
ficials had given the "agrovil
les" a bad reputation by lack of
consideration for peasants' in
terests — for example, forcing
them to labor at the construc
tion when they should have
been harvesting.
Reduce Labor
Also, the amount of heavy la
bor in constructing the canals,
fishponds, and all was very con
siderable. We proposed financ
ing additional "agrovilles," but
with more attention to peasant
interests and with study and
experimentation designed to
find ways to reduce the onerous
labor requirements. For ex
ample, we suggested efforts to
adapt earth-moving and ditch
digging machinery to the diffi
cult environment of the Delta.
I have no direct knowledge of
the "strategic hamlet" program
that was embarked upon later,
and had no part in planning or
implementing it. Judging from
what I have heard, it was not
the sort of thing we had in
mind, and also it was apparent
ly pushed much too fast.
It is certainly not true, as
alleged on the basis of a very
erroneous story by a French
writer, that Ngo Dinh Nhu
"sold" me a strategic hamlet
idea or any other idea. I never
met Nhu, he and Mme. Nhu
were in Europe or North Africa
during the entire time of my
mission. Incidentally, I have al
ways suspected that we were
able to get further in negotia
tions with President Diem on
certain issues because brother
Nhu was not there.

So far as I know, William
Bredo did not work "in Viet

though The Daily's saying so in
reporting my discussion of
SRl's involvement in Vietnam
(in Resistance) may have re

In 1961, at the time of Prof.

both he and Dr. Bredo were

1960 Dr. Bredo published a book

Staley wrote the introduction.
Since publishing my report

I do not wish to appear in

tentions of The Daily's drama
critic on SRT's latest show, In
admissible Evidence. I also saw
their show and incidentally dis
liked it.
But when interested specta
tors like Thomas Moser, Ex
ecutive Head in the Department
of English, start squealing be
cause their friends and collea
gues in SRT get bad newspaper
notices, then it is time to answer
the faculty back.
Professor Moser feels that he
can prove this point by citing
the Chronicle drama critic, Was
serman, who called the show
'superb.' However, Wasserman's
opinion is at least discredited
by the fact that he thinks the
opening trial sequence of the
play is real and that the rest is

a flashback. In reality, Osborne's
opening scene is a nightmare
dreamt by the lawyer on the
sofa in his office after a surfeit
of ladies and booze. Perhaps if
Wasserman were to read his
next piece of work, Professor
Moser will get better testimony
from that particular quarter.
If he really wants good sup

Moser should listen to Leon
