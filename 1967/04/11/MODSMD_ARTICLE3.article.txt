# Dean Smith Appeals Sapir Sit-in; 'Must Enforce University Policy'
## 
### GAIL AN DERSON 
Questions of con 13ict of law and
interpretation of t he Fundamental
Standard dominated the Interim Ju
dicial Board's hearing of the Sapir
sit-in case last night .
Dean of Students Joel Smith was
appealing the Judicial Council's de
cision that medica I student Marc
Sapir, by his part icipation in the
sit-in last spring, dii 1 not violate the
Fundamental Stand Â£ ird.
Sapir, who had a; nnounced earlier
that he would not api pear at the hear
ing, came up to pre sent a statement
which read in part: 1 'Tonight you are
being asked by the President of this
University ... to si t in moral judg
ment of a student because he has
challenged the moral ity of that Presi
dent. ..." He mair itained that only
considerations of power enabled a
student to be moral] y condemned by
those who were inv< >lved in immoral
actions concerning t he CIA and the
war in Vietnam. Fol lowing his state
ment, Sapir left the hearing.
Dean Smith cont < ended that the

facts of the case were not in dis
pute and appealed on two bases: sec
tion 11-C-2 of the IJB bylaws, provid
ing for appeal if the Judicial Council
acts capriciously or without under
standing, and section 11-C-1-e, provid
ing for appeal if a Council decision
conflicts with regulations or law.
Smith presented the view that al
though the ASSU Constitution and
By-laws provides for recognition of
University policy except in case of
conflict, that the Council decision that
a violation of University of policy was
not a violation of the Fundamental
Standord apparently meant that the
Fundamental Standard subsumed all
University policy.
Policy Violated?
Asked about the policy violated,
Smith admitted that it appeared in
wide circulation only in the 1967 Bul
letin, and was unable to say where
or how it had appeared prior to the
time on the sit-in.
Judicial Council chairman Martin
Gerry replied first of all that no con
flict of law could be declared because

there was no provision of the ASSU
Constitution and By-laws which con
flicted with the University policy.
"The council cannot certify a con
flict," he said, "unless it knows what
conflicts with what." Secondly, he
said that the duty of the Judicial
Council was to enforce the Funda
mental Standard, not any law or reg
ulation apart from the Standard.
Smith replied that the conflict was
between the University policy and the
Council decision. Sneed and Gerry
then pointed out that this is not con
cerned with statutory conflict and
furthermore that this would mean
an situation in which the
Council had to know the outcome of
its trial before the trial could be
held.
Smith summarized his contention
by saying that if no conflict of law
was declared, the Judicial Council,
had to enforce the violation of Uni
versity policy even if it was not a
violation of the Fundamental Stand
ard. "It is irrelevant," he said, wheth
er or not the Fundamental Standard
has been violated."
