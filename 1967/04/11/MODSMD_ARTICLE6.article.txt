# Dean Gordon To Resign; Takes Post At Tennessee
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Robert G. Gordon, Associate Dean
of Students, has been appointed Vice
President for Student Affairs of the
University of Tennessee, effective
September 1. His selection was an
nounced yesterday by Tennessee
President Andrew Holt.
Gordon came to Stanford in 1963
as Dean of Men and became Associate
Dean of Students in an office reor
ganization in the fall of 1965.
In his new position at Tennessee,
a state university with an enrollment
of 25,000, he will head such student
services as counseling, health services,
dean of students, religious activities,
admissions and registrar, housing,
and student center. The university,
in Knoxville, is integrated and has
experienced no racial violence.
"It will be an opportunity to work

with student leaders to develop an
environment for learning which
stresses excellence," says Gordon. "I
will be happy to be working in the
developmental side rather than just
in putting out fires."
"The University of Tennessee is one
of the most rapidly moving universi
ties in the Southeast. It has a great
readiness for institutional change."
Commenting on Gordon's new posi
tion, Stanford Provost Richard Ly
man said: "We'll miss Bob Gordon.
In his work with the residence pro
gram, in matters that go beyond the
normal routine—such as his aid to
the committee on religious activities
during a period when we were mak
ing significant changes in that area—
he has given service and made a
host of friends at Stanford. I wish
him every good fortune in his chal
lenging new position."
The Dean of Students office has
changed radically since Gordon came
in 1963. "We went from a traditional
Dean of Men and Dean of Women
to a functional approach. We felt
the students did not need a parental
approach." He cites the abolishing
of year end R.A. reports on each stu
dent, the hiring of younger dormitory
directors, and more emphasis on coun
seling as evidences of this trend.
Gordon puts much emphasis on
"community" as the great need of
Stanford. "One should have a chance
to make the laws of the community
in which he lives," he says."The big
change that has to come to have a
community is government.
Students Should Make Decisions
I think student government is an
achronistic. The time must come
when students are seen as more than
kindergarteners playing with blocks
and are made a part of the university.
Students ought to be part of the de
cision-making process."
Asked if he thought Stanford might
adopt some type of broad university
government, he said: "It is working
effectively in small liberal arts col
leges, I think it can work here." He

continued: "I think we are at a point
where this is more than an ideal
to be wished. This is not done so that
students will get their way but so
that student perceptions will assist
in meeting student needs, such as new
curriculum and residential educa
tion."
Dean Gordon puts great emphasis
on involvement beyond the university,
and himself serves as Vice President
of the Palo Alto YMCA, Chairman of
the Board of the Methodist Church
in Palo Alto, and with the Palo Alto
Red Cross.
"The college world is sometimes
not the real world," he says. "There
ought to be a laboratory in the local
community to test out ideas. It's on<
thing to talk of humanitarian princi
ples, and another to be involved i
humanitarian projects." Gordon hcJ
advocated the establishment of
Stanford Service Corps, for soci;.
work outside the campus to be direc l
ly related to academic programs.
Gordon came to Stanford fror-i
Washington, D.C. where he was N
tional Director of Educational Rela
tions for the American Red Cros
Earlier he was Dean of Men an
Dean of Students at the Univenr
of Southern California, Assoc* it •
Dean of Students at the University
of Texas, and Dean of Men at the
University of Redlands.
