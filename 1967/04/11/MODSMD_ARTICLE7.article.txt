# Groups Protest Plans For The Stern Houses
## 
### BOB DAVIS 
House presidents and a number of
other residents of the Stem Houses
have expressed dissatisfaction recent
ly over the endorsement of a modified
version of the Wilbur Experiment
plan by the housing subcommittee of
the Packer Study of Education at
Stanford (SES).
The modified Wilbur Experiment
calls for converting two houses in „
Stern into exclusively freshman resi
dences, with no provisions for coedu
cation in any of the houses.
The plan is expected to go to the
steering committee of SES on April
17 for a final vote of approval.
Presidents Send Letters
House presidents are sending let
ters detailing their objections to Pres
ident Wallace Sterling, Herbert Pack
er, and Dean of Students Joel Smith.
A petition and letter signed by some
seventy members of Muir House to be
given to Smith states, "We believe
that the Independent Houses, in order

to maintain their integrity and de
sirability as residences, must continue
to represent all undergraduate
classes."
Hank Eide, Larkin House Presi
dent, said yesterday, "To me, it seems
that the Stern Houses provide the
most logical location for coeduca
tional living. I'd like to hear some
answers to why this idea was ig
nored."
Dean Joel Smith has agr • i to
hold an after-dinner discussion in
Stern tomorrow night on the hous
ing question.
The original ASSU Housing Cc
mittee Report called for incn ig
the number of freshmen in Stem £-
ter Wilbur was made coeducatio
Stern House presidents m<
early this Winter Quarter voted '
ject formally to what they thou;
would be the "dissolution" of ie
Stern Houses if the plan were cat
out.
Last Priority
A statement being circulated by
several students in the Stern Hou
has charged that the "interests of
Stern students have been given
priority in current plans."
The statement asks what the c
sequences for the Stern Houses 1
be when they become "the least c
sirable living situation," having no
coeducational facilities.
In commenting on proposed plans
William Leland, Director of the Stern
Houses remarked that "change in tl ■
residence program at Stanford
called for. I had hoped that change
would be preceded by a thorough ex
amination by the Packer Committee
of the residence situation and determ
ination of long range goals."
"While we at Stern show conceir
about the proposal, it should be under
stood the we endorse the principles
of coed and integrated housing. How
ever, we stress that the implication?
for other residences must be exam
ined."
Try For Coeducation
An attempt was made last quarter
to effect a limited coeducation pro
gram in Holladay House. One floor in
Holladay was prepared to exchange
places with one floor of Loro in
Florence Moore Hall.
The ASSU Housing Committee in
dicated their support of the plan, as
well as the Stern Housing Committee.
A court ruling on the Florence
Moore will would be necessary and
the Committee on Undergraduate Ed
ucation decided not to take the mat
ter to court.
Permission for women to live in
Stern would have to be obtained from
Walter Haas, executor of the Lucie
Stern estate. He is said to have recent
ly expressed an interest in housing
the Grove Project in Stern Hall. Onr
administration official has reportedly
remarked that the general issue of
coeducation in Stern has not been
pursued with Haas.
