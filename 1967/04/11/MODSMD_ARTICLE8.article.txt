# South Vietnamese Education: No Real 'Nationhood' Sense

### HOWARD MOFFETT The Collegiate Press Service 
SAIGON, South Vietnam
(CPS) —"We have no national
education," a young high school
teacher said here recently. He
was bothered by a problem that
will plague South Vietnamese
governments for years to come,
in war and in peace.
* Simply stated, the national
curriculum for public high
schools, drawn up by the Min
istry of Education in Saigon
and used in each of the coun
try's public schools, is French.
The program is French, the
administrative techniques are
French, most of the textbooks
are French, many of the teach
ers are French-trained, and by
the time they graduate the
brightest students have learned
to think in French.
- By its own admission, one of
the government's most pressing
needs is the development of a
sense of nationhood among
$outh Vietnam's dozens of
<?thnic, religious, cultural and
Regional groups. Yet its most
Obvious potential tool—public
fducatioh — systematically
tjaches young Vietnamese that
Western values and institutions
Ire superior to their own na
■onal heritage.
ft Nationalism
"■For 40 years nationalism has
been the burning issue in Viet
namese politics. Now the Viet
cong are trying to drive out the
Americans and their lackeys in
the name of nationalism, and in
the name of nationalism non-
Communist Vietnamese vow
they will never submit to a Com
munist takeover of South Viet
nam. Ironically, to continue the
struggle both sides have become
increasingly dependent on for
eign arms, foreign supplies, for
eign training and foreign per
sonnel.
Thus, unfortunately for those
Vietnamese who want neither
Communism nor Americanism,
a nationalist solution to the war
is no longer possible here. But
even if it were, South Vietnam
would still be in hock to foreign
influence for some time to come.
Peace will only bring more for
eigners to build back what other
foreigners have destroyed. A
look at one of the country's
best public high schools shows
why.
The Quoc Hos, or National
High School, fronts on the south
bank of the River of Perfumes
hi Hue, across Le Loi Boulevard
from a long green garden mall.
. . . Beyond the main gate of
.nodified Chinese design is a
quadrangle of two-story build
ings in French colonial pink.
Clumps of bamboo and other
exotic shrubs dot the grounds.
The school was founded as a
French lycee in 1896. For many
years there was no better pedi
gree in Vietnam; among the
Quoc Hoe's most illustrious
graduates were Ngo Dinh Diem
and Vo Nguyen Giap. In 1947
the French turned it over to the
Vietnamese, and it has since
been run as the best of Hue's
seven public high schools. The
French shadow lingers, but the
greatness of the past is gone.
Even the interscholastic athletic
program has been abandoned.
There are 1800 boys at the
Quoc Hoc. The earnest young
vice principal Hong Giu Luu,
expalins that 1900 were enrolled
at the beginning of the year.
"But many have been drafted.
Some have to work to support
their families. Some cannot
come into Hue from their vil
liages — they are controlled by
the Viet Cong." This last ex
planation of course may be in
terpreted in several different
ways.
Upper Forms, Lower Forms
Students are classified into
three lower and three upper
forms, which correspond rough
ly to American junior and sen
ior high school. Upper form stu
dents are asked to choose be
fween three major programs:
mathematics, the experimental
sciences, or letters. Fully 65 per
cent choose math, 23 per cent
opt for the sciences, and letters
gets the remaining 12 per cent.
There appear to be several
reasons for this imbalance. In
past years math was the most
challenging program, since en

gineering and related fields
were the most prestigious pro
fessional careers open to a Viet
namese under the French. Sec
ondly, by common consent the
letters program, especially the
all-important final examination
or baccalaureate, is much more
taxing; the sciences require too
much memorization; math by
comparison is the gut course,
though Mr. Luu estimated that
only 20 per cent of the students
can follow it easily.
(One young teacher com
plains that all three programs
suffer from a heavy emphasis
on rote learning arther than in
dependent thinking. He cites
this as a major reason for the
atrophied character of many
Vietnamese institutions, from
government bureaucracies and
Constituent Assemblies to daily
newspapers.) Finally, in these
uncertain times, math is simply
a lot safer than programs
which might take the bright
student into the whirlwind of
politics and public affairs.
11 Subjects
But no matter which major
a student chooses, he must
study 11 subjects at once; this
is true of every public high
school in South Vietnam. The
scattershot national curriculum
requires that each year an up
per form student must be ex
posed to: Vietnamese, English,
French, history, geography,
mathematics, physics, chemis
try, natural sciences (meaning
biology), civics, and physical
education.
Even the Quoc Hoc has a criti
cal shortage of decent texts.
There are no standard school
books. Each teacher suggests
his own preferences and the stu
dents must then buy them them
selves. The expenses run an av
erage of eight to ten dollars
yearly, more than many can
afford.
Vietnamese textbooks began
to appear in numbers in the pub
lic schools only in 1957-58, and
the upper forms still rely heav
ily on French and English books.
A large percentage of the few
Vietnamese textbooks are mere
ly translations from the French.
English students use an abomin
able series of paperbacks called
"English for Today," which sell
for 45 piastres or about 30 cents
apiece.
But the curriculum shows
even more clearly that Viet
namese high school students are
getting a foreign education. One
might expect that the math and
science programs would have
little bias, either foreign or pa
triotic. Yet most of the texts
are either French or transla
tions from the French: the math
is French math; the chemistry
comes out of French laborator
ies; and the physics texts often
refer to technical problems that
would challenge a French boy,
but leave a Vietnamese boy cold.
Foreign Letters
In letters, where the times de
mand a nationalist bias, foreign
influence is even more pro
nounced. (Indeed, though no one
interviewed would admit it, this
may be an important reason
why only a fraction major in
letters.)
Trung and Thanh are two sec
ond form (11th grade) letters
students. They spend four hours
a day, six days a week, in class.
Eight of these hours are in En
glish language and literature,
six in French, five in Vietna
mese. Right away then, more
than half of their education is
devoted to the cultures of two
Western powers.
The seven remaining subjects
—math, physics, chemistry, biol
ogy, history, geography and
civics — are squeezed into five
hours per week. Surely they
learn something of their own
country in history and geogra
phy. But no. In government high
schools these are world studies,
not national ones. This liberal
ism would be admirable except
that, from what many teachers
say, Vietnamese high school stu
dents often know virtually noth
ing of their own country's back
ground and resources.

It's no wonder. With an hour
or two a week, and little em
phasis on Vietnamese history
and geography in the French
oriented baccalaureate exam,
why should they take them ser
iously? Yet the South Vietna
mese government is supposedly
trying to build some conscious
ness of national culture, as a
prerequisite for putting a na
tion together.
Civics
Civics too requires only an
hour or two of listening per
week. In five years, a Quoc Hoc
student is exposed to: (1) fam
ily relationships; ancestor wor
ship and filial piety; and traffic
regulations. (2) school relation
ships; duty to teachers, discip
line, dress etiquette; and more
traffic regulations. (3) social re
lationships; language, customs
and religious institutions. (4)
the Rights of Man (from the
United Nations Charter, 1948);
political theories of democracy,
socialism, and communism; and
national institutions—the con
stitution, the draft, elections,
taxes, etc. (5) economics (free
trade, currency, etc.) and politi
cal science.
Political science covers "the
Eastern democratic spirit" (Con
fucius, Mencius, Sun Yat-sen
and Vietnamese village coun
cils), "the Western democratic
spirit" (Britain's constitutional
monarchy, the American revolu
tion and the republican-federal
system, and the Third and
Fourth French Republics — but
not the Fifth), and Dictatorship
(Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy,
and Communism in Russia and
Eastern Europe — but not in
China or North Vietnam).
Letters majors get the cream
of the philosophical crop. "Gen
eral philosophy" introduces
them to epistemology and meta
physics, European style. A sec
tion on Eastern philosophy is
devoted to Confucius, Lao Tzu,
and primitive Buddhism. (This
sub-section of a minor course,
which only 12 per cent of the
students take, is probably that
part of Quoc Hoc education
which is most relevant to the
daily lives of the Vietnamese.
Until the French came, of
course, it would have been vir
tually the whole curriculum.)
The desire to go to America
for college raises the next spec
ter over Vietnamese "national"
education. Hundreds of South
Vietnam's best students are go
ing to the U.S. every year on
American government scholar
ships. Many of those who return
will want to incorporate Ameri
can ideas into the curriculum.
Already a number of professors

in the country's five universities
want to change the language of
instruction—not from French to
Vietnamese, but from French to
English.
But for the moment, Ameri
can influence in secondary edu
cation is only beginning to be
felt. The dominant strain is still
French, and it probably will be
for years to come. As Nguyen
Due Mai, an outspoken science
teacher at Quoc Hoc, says: "Not
only do we have a French edu
cational system, but it's 20 years
old. It was copied from the
French in 1947, and hasn't been
changed since it was instituted.
I still must explain to my stu
dents that Lavoisier is not the
last word in chemistry."

for college raises the next spec
ter over Vietnamese "national"
education. Hundreds of South
Vietnam's best students are go
ing to the U.S. every year on
American government scholar
ships. Many of those who return
will want to incorporate Ameri
can ideas into the curriculum.
Already a number of professors

in the country's five universities
want to change the language of
instruction—not from French to
Vietnamese, but from French to
English.
But for the moment, Ameri
can influence in secondary edu
cation is only beginning to be
felt. The dominant strain is still
French, and it probably will be
for years to come. As Nguyen
Due Mai, an outspoken science
teacher at Quoc Hoc, says: "Not
only do we have a French edu
cational system, but it's 20 years
old. It was copied from the
French in 1947, and hasn't been
changed since it was instituted.
I still must explain to my stu

last word in chemistry."
SAIGON, South Vietnam
(CPS) —"We have no national
education," a young high school
teacher said here recently. He
was bothered by a problem that
will plague South Vietnamese
governments for years to come,
in war and in peace.
* Simply stated, the national
curriculum for public high
schools, drawn up by the Min
istry of Education in Saigon
and used in each of the coun
try's public schools, is French.
The program is French, the
administrative techniques are
French, most of the textbooks
are French, many of the teach
ers are French-trained, and by
the time they graduate the
brightest students have learned
to think in French.
- By its own admission, one of
the government's most pressing
needs is the development of a
sense of nationhood among
$outh Vietnam's dozens of
<?thnic, religious, cultural and
Regional groups. Yet its most
Obvious potential tool—public
fducatioh — systematically
tjaches young Vietnamese that
Western values and institutions
Ire superior to their own na
■onal heritage.
ft Nationalism
"■For 40 years nationalism has
been the burning issue in Viet
namese politics. Now the Viet
cong are trying to drive out the
Americans and their lackeys in
the name of nationalism, and in
the name of nationalism non-
Communist Vietnamese vow
they will never submit to a Com
munist takeover of South Viet
nam. Ironically, to continue the
struggle both sides have become
increasingly dependent on for
eign arms, foreign supplies, for
eign training and foreign per
sonnel.
Thus, unfortunately for those
Vietnamese who want neither
Communism nor Americanism,
a nationalist solution to the war
is no longer possible here. But
even if it were, South Vietnam
would still be in hock to foreign
influence for some time to come.
Peace will only bring more for
eigners to build back what other
foreigners have destroyed. A
look at one of the country's
best public high schools shows
why.
The Quoc Hos, or National
High School, fronts on the south
bank of the River of Perfumes
hi Hue, across Le Loi Boulevard
from a long green garden mall.
. . . Beyond the main gate of
.nodified Chinese design is a
quadrangle of two-story build
ings in French colonial pink.
Clumps of bamboo and other
exotic shrubs dot the grounds.
The school was founded as a
French lycee in 1896. For many
years there was no better pedi
gree in Vietnam; among the
Quoc Hoe's most illustrious
graduates were Ngo Dinh Diem
and Vo Nguyen Giap. In 1947
the French turned it over to the
Vietnamese, and it has since
been run as the best of Hue's
seven public high schools. The
French shadow lingers, but the
greatness of the past is gone.
Even the interscholastic athletic
program has been abandoned.
There are 1800 boys at the
Quoc Hoc. The earnest young
vice principal Hong Giu Luu,
expalins that 1900 were enrolled
at the beginning of the year.
"But many have been drafted.
Some have to work to support
their families. Some cannot
come into Hue from their vil
liages — they are controlled by
the Viet Cong." This last ex
planation of course may be in
terpreted in several different
ways.
Upper Forms, Lower Forms
Students are classified into
three lower and three upper
forms, which correspond rough
ly to American junior and sen
ior high school. Upper form stu
dents are asked to choose be
fween three major programs:
mathematics, the experimental
sciences, or letters. Fully 65 per
cent choose math, 23 per cent
opt for the sciences, and letters
gets the remaining 12 per cent.
There appear to be several
reasons for this imbalance. In
past years math was the most
challenging program, since en

gineering and related fields
were the most prestigious pro
fessional careers open to a Viet
namese under the French. Sec
ondly, by common consent the
letters program, especially the
all-important final examination
or baccalaureate, is much more
taxing; the sciences require too
much memorization; math by
comparison is the gut course,
though Mr. Luu estimated that
only 20 per cent of the students
can follow it easily.
(One young teacher com
plains that all three programs
suffer from a heavy emphasis
on rote learning arther than in
dependent thinking. He cites
this as a major reason for the
atrophied character of many
Vietnamese institutions, from
government bureaucracies and
Constituent Assemblies to daily
newspapers.) Finally, in these
uncertain times, math is simply
a lot safer than programs
which might take the bright
student into the whirlwind of
politics and public affairs.
11 Subjects
But no matter which major
a student chooses, he must
study 11 subjects at once; this
is true of every public high
school in South Vietnam. The
scattershot national curriculum
requires that each year an up
per form student must be ex
posed to: Vietnamese, English,
French, history, geography,
mathematics, physics, chemis
try, natural sciences (meaning
biology), civics, and physical
education.
Even the Quoc Hoc has a criti
cal shortage of decent texts.
There are no standard school
books. Each teacher suggests
his own preferences and the stu
dents must then buy them them
selves. The expenses run an av
erage of eight to ten dollars
yearly, more than many can
afford.
Vietnamese textbooks began
to appear in numbers in the pub
lic schools only in 1957-58, and
the upper forms still rely heav
ily on French and English books.
A large percentage of the few
Vietnamese textbooks are mere
ly translations from the French.
English students use an abomin
able series of paperbacks called
"English for Today," which sell
for 45 piastres or about 30 cents
apiece.
But the curriculum shows
even more clearly that Viet
namese high school students are
getting a foreign education. One
might expect that the math and
science programs would have
little bias, either foreign or pa
triotic. Yet most of the texts
are either French or transla
tions from the French: the math
is French math; the chemistry
comes out of French laborator
ies; and the physics texts often
refer to technical problems that
would challenge a French boy,
but leave a Vietnamese boy cold.
Foreign Letters
In letters, where the times de
mand a nationalist bias, foreign
influence is even more pro
nounced. (Indeed, though no one
interviewed would admit it, this
may be an important reason
why only a fraction major in
letters.)
Trung and Thanh are two sec
ond form (11th grade) letters
students. They spend four hours
a day, six days a week, in class.
Eight of these hours are in En
glish language and literature,
six in French, five in Vietna
mese. Right away then, more
than half of their education is
devoted to the cultures of two
Western powers.
The seven remaining subjects
—math, physics, chemistry, biol
ogy, history, geography and
civics — are squeezed into five
hours per week. Surely they
learn something of their own
country in history and geogra
phy. But no. In government high
schools these are world studies,
not national ones. This liberal
ism would be admirable except
that, from what many teachers
say, Vietnamese high school stu
dents often know virtually noth
ing of their own country's back
ground and resources.

It's no wonder. With an hour
or two a week, and little em
phasis on Vietnamese history
and geography in the French
oriented baccalaureate exam,
why should they take them ser
iously? Yet the South Vietna
mese government is supposedly
trying to build some conscious
ness of national culture, as a
prerequisite for putting a na
tion together.
Civics
Civics too requires only an
hour or two of listening per
week. In five years, a Quoc Hoc
student is exposed to: (1) fam
ily relationships; ancestor wor
ship and filial piety; and traffic
regulations. (2) school relation
ships; duty to teachers, discip
line, dress etiquette; and more
traffic regulations. (3) social re
lationships; language, customs
and religious institutions. (4)
the Rights of Man (from the
United Nations Charter, 1948);
political theories of democracy,
socialism, and communism; and
national institutions—the con
stitution, the draft, elections,
taxes, etc. (5) economics (free
trade, currency, etc.) and politi
cal science.
Political science covers "the
Eastern democratic spirit" (Con
fucius, Mencius, Sun Yat-sen
and Vietnamese village coun
cils), "the Western democratic
spirit" (Britain's constitutional
monarchy, the American revolu
tion and the republican-federal
system, and the Third and
Fourth French Republics — but
not the Fifth), and Dictatorship
(Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy,
and Communism in Russia and
Eastern Europe — but not in
China or North Vietnam).
Letters majors get the cream
of the philosophical crop. "Gen
eral philosophy" introduces
them to epistemology and meta
physics, European style. A sec
tion on Eastern philosophy is
devoted to Confucius, Lao Tzu,
and primitive Buddhism. (This
sub-section of a minor course,
which only 12 per cent of the
students take, is probably that
part of Quoc Hoc education
which is most relevant to the
daily lives of the Vietnamese.
Until the French came, of
course, it would have been vir
tually the whole curriculum.)

SAIGON, South Vietnam
(CPS) —"We have no national
education," a young high school
teacher said here recently. He
was bothered by a problem that
will plague South Vietnamese
governments for years to come,
in war and in peace.
* Simply stated, the national
curriculum for public high
schools, drawn up by the Min
istry of Education in Saigon
and used in each of the coun
try's public schools, is French.
The program is French, the
administrative techniques are
French, most of the textbooks
are French, many of the teach
ers are French-trained, and by
the time they graduate the
brightest students have learned
to think in French.
- By its own admission, one of
the government's most pressing
needs is the development of a
sense of nationhood among
$outh Vietnam's dozens of
<?thnic, religious, cultural and
Regional groups. Yet its most
Obvious potential tool—public
fducatioh — systematically
tjaches young Vietnamese that
Western values and institutions

ft Nationalism
"■For 40 years nationalism has
been the burning issue in Viet
namese politics. Now the Viet
cong are trying to drive out the
Americans and their lackeys in
the name of nationalism, and in
the name of nationalism non-
Communist Vietnamese vow
they will never submit to a Com
munist takeover of South Viet
nam. Ironically, to continue the
struggle both sides have become
increasingly dependent on for
eign arms, foreign supplies, for
eign training and foreign per
sonnel.
Thus, unfortunately for those
Vietnamese who want neither
Communism nor Americanism,
a nationalist solution to the war
is no longer possible here. But
even if it were, South Vietnam
would still be in hock to foreign
influence for some time to come.
Peace will only bring more for
eigners to build back what other
foreigners have destroyed. A
look at one of the country's
best public high schools shows
why.
The Quoc Hos, or National
High School, fronts on the south
bank of the River of Perfumes
hi Hue, across Le Loi Boulevard
from a long green garden mall.
. . . Beyond the main gate of
.nodified Chinese design is a
quadrangle of two-story build
ings in French colonial pink.
Clumps of bamboo and other
exotic shrubs dot the grounds.
The school was founded as a
French lycee in 1896. For many
years there was no better pedi
gree in Vietnam; among the
Quoc Hoe's most illustrious
graduates were Ngo Dinh Diem
and Vo Nguyen Giap. In 1947
the French turned it over to the
Vietnamese, and it has since
been run as the best of Hue's
seven public high schools. The
French shadow lingers, but the
greatness of the past is gone.
Even the interscholastic athletic
program has been abandoned.
There are 1800 boys at the
Quoc Hoc. The earnest young
vice principal Hong Giu Luu,
expalins that 1900 were enrolled
at the beginning of the year.
"But many have been drafted.
Some have to work to support
their families. Some cannot
come into Hue from their vil
liages — they are controlled by
the Viet Cong." This last ex
planation of course may be in
terpreted in several different
ways.
Upper Forms, Lower Forms
Students are classified into
three lower and three upper
forms, which correspond rough
ly to American junior and sen
ior high school. Upper form stu
dents are asked to choose be
fween three major programs:
mathematics, the experimental
sciences, or letters. Fully 65 per
cent choose math, 23 per cent
opt for the sciences, and letters
gets the remaining 12 per cent.
There appear to be several
reasons for this imbalance. In
past years math was the most
challenging program, since en

gineering and related fields
were the most prestigious pro
fessional careers open to a Viet
namese under the French. Sec
ondly, by common consent the
letters program, especially the
all-important final examination
or baccalaureate, is much more
taxing; the sciences require too
much memorization; math by
comparison is the gut course,
though Mr. Luu estimated that
only 20 per cent of the students
can follow it easily.
(One young teacher com
plains that all three programs
suffer from a heavy emphasis
on rote learning arther than in
dependent thinking. He cites
this as a major reason for the
atrophied character of many
Vietnamese institutions, from
government bureaucracies and
Constituent Assemblies to daily
newspapers.) Finally, in these
uncertain times, math is simply
a lot safer than programs
which might take the bright
student into the whirlwind of
politics and public affairs.
11 Subjects
But no matter which major
a student chooses, he must
study 11 subjects at once; this
is true of every public high
school in South Vietnam. The
scattershot national curriculum
requires that each year an up
per form student must be ex
posed to: Vietnamese, English,
French, history, geography,
mathematics, physics, chemis
try, natural sciences (meaning
biology), civics, and physical
education.
Even the Quoc Hoc has a criti
cal shortage of decent texts.
There are no standard school
books. Each teacher suggests
his own preferences and the stu
dents must then buy them them
selves. The expenses run an av
erage of eight to ten dollars
yearly, more than many can
afford.
Vietnamese textbooks began
to appear in numbers in the pub
lic schools only in 1957-58, and
the upper forms still rely heav
ily on French and English books.
A large percentage of the few
Vietnamese textbooks are mere
ly translations from the French.
English students use an abomin
able series of paperbacks called
"English for Today," which sell
for 45 piastres or about 30 cents
apiece.
But the curriculum shows
even more clearly that Viet
namese high school students are
getting a foreign education. One
might expect that the math and
science programs would have
little bias, either foreign or pa
triotic. Yet most of the texts
are either French or transla
tions from the French: the math
is French math; the chemistry
comes out of French laborator
ies; and the physics texts often
refer to technical problems that
would challenge a French boy,
but leave a Vietnamese boy cold.
Foreign Letters
In letters, where the times de
mand a nationalist bias, foreign
influence is even more pro
nounced. (Indeed, though no one
interviewed would admit it, this
may be an important reason
why only a fraction major in
letters.)
Trung and Thanh are two sec
ond form (11th grade) letters
students. They spend four hours
a day, six days a week, in class.
Eight of these hours are in En
glish language and literature,
six in French, five in Vietna
mese. Right away then, more
than half of their education is
devoted to the cultures of two
Western powers.
The seven remaining subjects
—math, physics, chemistry, biol
ogy, history, geography and
civics — are squeezed into five
hours per week. Surely they
learn something of their own
country in history and geogra
phy. But no. In government high
schools these are world studies,
not national ones. This liberal
ism would be admirable except
that, from what many teachers
say, Vietnamese high school stu
dents often know virtually noth
ing of their own country's back
ground and resources.

It's no wonder. With an hour
or two a week, and little em
phasis on Vietnamese history
and geography in the French
oriented baccalaureate exam,
why should they take them ser
iously? Yet the South Vietna
mese government is supposedly
trying to build some conscious
ness of national culture, as a
prerequisite for putting a na
tion together.
Civics
Civics too requires only an
hour or two of listening per
week. In five years, a Quoc Hoc
student is exposed to: (1) fam
ily relationships; ancestor wor
ship and filial piety; and traffic
regulations. (2) school relation
ships; duty to teachers, discip
line, dress etiquette; and more
traffic regulations. (3) social re
lationships; language, customs
and religious institutions. (4)
the Rights of Man (from the
United Nations Charter, 1948);
political theories of democracy,
socialism, and communism; and
national institutions—the con
stitution, the draft, elections,
taxes, etc. (5) economics (free
trade, currency, etc.) and politi
cal science.

iously? Yet the South Vietna
mese government is supposedly
trying to build some conscious
ness of national culture, as a
prerequisite for putting a na
tion together.
Civics
Civics too requires only an
hour or two of listening per
week. In five years, a Quoc Hoc
student is exposed to: (1) fam
ily relationships; ancestor wor
ship and filial piety; and traffic
regulations. (2) school relation
ships; duty to teachers, discip
line, dress etiquette; and more
traffic regulations. (3) social re
lationships; language, customs
and religious institutions. (4)
the Rights of Man (from the
United Nations Charter, 1948);
political theories of democracy,
socialism, and communism; and
national institutions—the con
stitution, the draft, elections,
taxes, etc. (5) economics (free
trade, currency, etc.) and politi
cal science.
Political science covers "the
Eastern democratic spirit" (Con
fucius, Mencius, Sun Yat-sen
and Vietnamese village coun
cils), "the Western democratic
spirit" (Britain's constitutional
monarchy, the American revolu
tion and the republican-federal
system, and the Third and
Fourth French Republics — but
not the Fifth), and Dictatorship
(Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy,
and Communism in Russia and
Eastern Europe — but not in
China or North Vietnam).
Letters majors get the cream
of the philosophical crop. "Gen
eral philosophy" introduces
them to epistemology and meta
physics, European style. A sec
tion on Eastern philosophy is
devoted to Confucius, Lao Tzu,
and primitive Buddhism. (This
sub-section of a minor course,
which only 12 per cent of the
students take, is probably that
part of Quoc Hoc education
which is most relevant to the
daily lives of the Vietnamese.
Until the French came, of
course, it would have been vir
tually the whole curriculum.)
The desire to go to America
for college raises the next spec
ter over Vietnamese "national"
education. Hundreds of South
Vietnam's best students are go
ing to the U.S. every year on
American government scholar
ships. Many of those who return
will want to incorporate Ameri
can ideas into the curriculum.
Already a number of professors

in the country's five universities
want to change the language of
instruction—not from French to
Vietnamese, but from French to
English.
But for the moment, Ameri
can influence in secondary edu
cation is only beginning to be
felt. The dominant strain is still
French, and it probably will be
for years to come. As Nguyen
Due Mai, an outspoken science
teacher at Quoc Hoc, says: "Not
only do we have a French edu
cational system, but it's 20 years
old. It was copied from the
French in 1947, and hasn't been
changed since it was instituted.
I still must explain to my stu
dents that Lavoisier is not the
last word in chemistry."
SAIGON, South Vietnam
(CPS) —"We have no national
education," a young high school
teacher said here recently. He
was bothered by a problem that
will plague South Vietnamese
governments for years to come,
in war and in peace.
* Simply stated, the national
curriculum for public high
schools, drawn up by the Min
istry of Education in Saigon
and used in each of the coun
try's public schools, is French.
The program is French, the
administrative techniques are
French, most of the textbooks
are French, many of the teach
ers are French-trained, and by
the time they graduate the
brightest students have learned
to think in French.
- By its own admission, one of
the government's most pressing
needs is the development of a
sense of nationhood among
$outh Vietnam's dozens of
<?thnic, religious, cultural and
Regional groups. Yet its most
Obvious potential tool—public
fducatioh — systematically
tjaches young Vietnamese that
Western values and institutions
Ire superior to their own na
■onal heritage.
ft Nationalism
"■For 40 years nationalism has
been the burning issue in Viet
namese politics. Now the Viet
cong are trying to drive out the
Americans and their lackeys in
the name of nationalism, and in
the name of nationalism non-
Communist Vietnamese vow
they will never submit to a Com
munist takeover of South Viet
nam. Ironically, to continue the
struggle both sides have become
increasingly dependent on for
eign arms, foreign supplies, for
eign training and foreign per
sonnel.
Thus, unfortunately for those
Vietnamese who want neither
Communism nor Americanism,
a nationalist solution to the war
is no longer possible here. But
even if it were, South Vietnam
would still be in hock to foreign
influence for some time to come.
Peace will only bring more for
eigners to build back what other
foreigners have destroyed. A
look at one of the country's
best public high schools shows
why.
The Quoc Hos, or National
High School, fronts on the south
bank of the River of Perfumes
hi Hue, across Le Loi Boulevard
from a long green garden mall.
. . . Beyond the main gate of
.nodified Chinese design is a
quadrangle of two-story build
ings in French colonial pink.
Clumps of bamboo and other
exotic shrubs dot the grounds.
The school was founded as a
French lycee in 1896. For many
years there was no better pedi
gree in Vietnam; among the
Quoc Hoe's most illustrious
graduates were Ngo Dinh Diem
and Vo Nguyen Giap. In 1947
the French turned it over to the
Vietnamese, and it has since
been run as the best of Hue's
seven public high schools. The
French shadow lingers, but the
greatness of the past is gone.
Even the interscholastic athletic
program has been abandoned.
There are 1800 boys at the
Quoc Hoc. The earnest young
vice principal Hong Giu Luu,
expalins that 1900 were enrolled
at the beginning of the year.
"But many have been drafted.
Some have to work to support
their families. Some cannot
come into Hue from their vil
liages — they are controlled by
the Viet Cong." This last ex
planation of course may be in
terpreted in several different
ways.
Upper Forms, Lower Forms
Students are classified into
three lower and three upper
forms, which correspond rough
ly to American junior and sen
ior high school. Upper form stu
dents are asked to choose be
fween three major programs:
mathematics, the experimental
sciences, or letters. Fully 65 per
cent choose math, 23 per cent
opt for the sciences, and letters
gets the remaining 12 per cent.
There appear to be several
reasons for this imbalance. In
past years math was the most
challenging program, since en

gineering and related fields
were the most prestigious pro
fessional careers open to a Viet
namese under the French. Sec
ondly, by common consent the
letters program, especially the
all-important final examination
or baccalaureate, is much more
taxing; the sciences require too
much memorization; math by
comparison is the gut course,
though Mr. Luu estimated that
only 20 per cent of the students
can follow it easily.
(One young teacher com
plains that all three programs
suffer from a heavy emphasis
on rote learning arther than in
dependent thinking. He cites
this as a major reason for the
atrophied character of many
Vietnamese institutions, from
government bureaucracies and
Constituent Assemblies to daily
newspapers.) Finally, in these
uncertain times, math is simply
a lot safer than programs
which might take the bright
student into the whirlwind of
politics and public affairs.
11 Subjects
But no matter which major
a student chooses, he must
study 11 subjects at once; this
is true of every public high
school in South Vietnam. The
scattershot national curriculum
requires that each year an up
per form student must be ex
posed to: Vietnamese, English,
French, history, geography,
mathematics, physics, chemis
try, natural sciences (meaning
biology), civics, and physical
education.
Even the Quoc Hoc has a criti
cal shortage of decent texts.
There are no standard school
books. Each teacher suggests
his own preferences and the stu
dents must then buy them them
selves. The expenses run an av
erage of eight to ten dollars
yearly, more than many can
afford.
Vietnamese textbooks began
to appear in numbers in the pub
lic schools only in 1957-58, and
the upper forms still rely heav
ily on French and English books.
A large percentage of the few
Vietnamese textbooks are mere
ly translations from the French.
English students use an abomin
able series of paperbacks called
"English for Today," which sell
for 45 piastres or about 30 cents
apiece.
But the curriculum shows
even more clearly that Viet
namese high school students are
getting a foreign education. One
might expect that the math and
science programs would have
little bias, either foreign or pa
triotic. Yet most of the texts
are either French or transla
tions from the French: the math
is French math; the chemistry
comes out of French laborator
ies; and the physics texts often
refer to technical problems that
would challenge a French boy,
but leave a Vietnamese boy cold.
Foreign Letters
In letters, where the times de
mand a nationalist bias, foreign
influence is even more pro
nounced. (Indeed, though no one
interviewed would admit it, this
may be an important reason
why only a fraction major in
letters.)
Trung and Thanh are two sec
ond form (11th grade) letters
students. They spend four hours
a day, six days a week, in class.
Eight of these hours are in En
glish language and literature,
six in French, five in Vietna
mese. Right away then, more
than half of their education is
devoted to the cultures of two
Western powers.
The seven remaining subjects
—math, physics, chemistry, biol
ogy, history, geography and
civics — are squeezed into five
hours per week. Surely they
learn something of their own
country in history and geogra
phy. But no. In government high
schools these are world studies,
not national ones. This liberal
ism would be admirable except
that, from what many teachers
say, Vietnamese high school stu
dents often know virtually noth
ing of their own country's back
ground and resources.

It's no wonder. With an hour
or two a week, and little em
phasis on Vietnamese history
and geography in the French
oriented baccalaureate exam,
why should they take them ser
iously? Yet the South Vietna
mese government is supposedly
trying to build some conscious

students. They spend four hours
a day, six days a week, in class.
Eight of these hours are in En
glish language and literature,
six in French, five in Vietna
mese. Right away then, more
than half of their education is
devoted to the cultures of two
Western powers.
The seven remaining subjects
—math, physics, chemistry, biol
ogy, history, geography and
civics — are squeezed into five
hours per week. Surely they
learn something of their own
country in history and geogra
phy. But no. In government high
schools these are world studies,
not national ones. This liberal
ism would be admirable except
that, from what many teachers
say, Vietnamese high school stu
dents often know virtually noth
ing of their own country's back
ground and resources.

It's no wonder. With an hour
or two a week, and little em
phasis on Vietnamese history
and geography in the French
oriented baccalaureate exam,
why should they take them ser
iously? Yet the South Vietna
mese government is supposedly
trying to build some conscious
ness of national culture, as a
prerequisite for putting a na
tion together.
Civics
Civics too requires only an
hour or two of listening per
week. In five years, a Quoc Hoc
student is exposed to: (1) fam
ily relationships; ancestor wor
ship and filial piety; and traffic
regulations. (2) school relation
ships; duty to teachers, discip
line, dress etiquette; and more
traffic regulations. (3) social re
lationships; language, customs
and religious institutions. (4)
the Rights of Man (from the
United Nations Charter, 1948);
political theories of democracy,
socialism, and communism; and
national institutions—the con
stitution, the draft, elections,
taxes, etc. (5) economics (free
trade, currency, etc.) and politi
cal science.
Political science covers "the
Eastern democratic spirit" (Con
fucius, Mencius, Sun Yat-sen
and Vietnamese village coun
cils), "the Western democratic
spirit" (Britain's constitutional
monarchy, the American revolu
tion and the republican-federal
system, and the Third and
Fourth French Republics — but
not the Fifth), and Dictatorship
(Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy,
and Communism in Russia and
Eastern Europe — but not in
China or North Vietnam).
Letters majors get the cream
of the philosophical crop. "Gen
eral philosophy" introduces
them to epistemology and meta
physics, European style. A sec
tion on Eastern philosophy is
devoted to Confucius, Lao Tzu,
and primitive Buddhism. (This
sub-section of a minor course,
which only 12 per cent of the
students take, is probably that
part of Quoc Hoc education
which is most relevant to the
daily lives of the Vietnamese.
Until the French came, of
course, it would have been vir
tually the whole curriculum.)
The desire to go to America
for college raises the next spec
ter over Vietnamese "national"
education. Hundreds of South
Vietnam's best students are go
ing to the U.S. every year on
American government scholar
ships. Many of those who return
will want to incorporate Ameri
can ideas into the curriculum.
Already a number of professors

in the country's five universities
want to change the language of
instruction—not from French to
Vietnamese, but from French to
English.
But for the moment, Ameri
can influence in secondary edu
cation is only beginning to be
felt. The dominant strain is still
French, and it probably will be
for years to come. As Nguyen
Due Mai, an outspoken science
teacher at Quoc Hoc, says: "Not
only do we have a French edu
cational system, but it's 20 years
old. It was copied from the
French in 1947, and hasn't been
changed since it was instituted.
I still must explain to my stu
dents that Lavoisier is not the
last word in chemistry."
SAIGON, South Vietnam
(CPS) —"We have no national
education," a young high school
teacher said here recently. He
was bothered by a problem that
will plague South Vietnamese
governments for years to come,
in war and in peace.
* Simply stated, the national
curriculum for public high
schools, drawn up by the Min
istry of Education in Saigon
and used in each of the coun
try's public schools, is French.
The program is French, the
administrative techniques are
French, most of the textbooks
are French, many of the teach
ers are French-trained, and by
the time they graduate the
brightest students have learned
to think in French.
- By its own admission, one of
the government's most pressing
needs is the development of a
sense of nationhood among
$outh Vietnam's dozens of
<?thnic, religious, cultural and
Regional groups. Yet its most
Obvious potential tool—public
fducatioh — systematically
tjaches young Vietnamese that
Western values and institutions
Ire superior to their own na
■onal heritage.
ft Nationalism
"■For 40 years nationalism has
been the burning issue in Viet
namese politics. Now the Viet
cong are trying to drive out the
Americans and their lackeys in
the name of nationalism, and in
the name of nationalism non-
Communist Vietnamese vow
they will never submit to a Com
munist takeover of South Viet
nam. Ironically, to continue the
struggle both sides have become
increasingly dependent on for
eign arms, foreign supplies, for
eign training and foreign per
sonnel.
Thus, unfortunately for those
Vietnamese who want neither
Communism nor Americanism,
a nationalist solution to the war
is no longer possible here. But
even if it were, South Vietnam
would still be in hock to foreign
influence for some time to come.
Peace will only bring more for
eigners to build back what other
foreigners have destroyed. A
look at one of the country's
best public high schools shows
why.
The Quoc Hos, or National
High School, fronts on the south
bank of the River of Perfumes
hi Hue, across Le Loi Boulevard
from a long green garden mall.
. . . Beyond the main gate of
.nodified Chinese design is a
quadrangle of two-story build
ings in French colonial pink.
Clumps of bamboo and other
exotic shrubs dot the grounds.
The school was founded as a
French lycee in 1896. For many
years there was no better pedi
gree in Vietnam; among the
Quoc Hoe's most illustrious
graduates were Ngo Dinh Diem
and Vo Nguyen Giap. In 1947
the French turned it over to the
Vietnamese, and it has since
been run as the best of Hue's
seven public high schools. The
French shadow lingers, but the
greatness of the past is gone.
Even the interscholastic athletic
program has been abandoned.
There are 1800 boys at the
Quoc Hoc. The earnest young
vice principal Hong Giu Luu,
expalins that 1900 were enrolled
at the beginning of the year.
"But many have been drafted.
Some have to work to support
their families. Some cannot
come into Hue from their vil
liages — they are controlled by
the Viet Cong." This last ex
planation of course may be in
terpreted in several different
ways.
Upper Forms, Lower Forms
Students are classified into
three lower and three upper
forms, which correspond rough
ly to American junior and sen
ior high school. Upper form stu
dents are asked to choose be
fween three major programs:
mathematics, the experimental
sciences, or letters. Fully 65 per
cent choose math, 23 per cent
opt for the sciences, and letters
gets the remaining 12 per cent.
There appear to be several
reasons for this imbalance. In
past years math was the most
challenging program, since en

gineering and related fields
were the most prestigious pro
fessional careers open to a Viet
namese under the French. Sec
ondly, by common consent the
letters program, especially the
all-important final examination
or baccalaureate, is much more
taxing; the sciences require too
much memorization; math by
comparison is the gut course,
though Mr. Luu estimated that
only 20 per cent of the students
can follow it easily.
(One young teacher com
plains that all three programs
suffer from a heavy emphasis
on rote learning arther than in
dependent thinking. He cites
this as a major reason for the
atrophied character of many
Vietnamese institutions, from
government bureaucracies and
Constituent Assemblies to daily
newspapers.) Finally, in these
uncertain times, math is simply
a lot safer than programs
which might take the bright
student into the whirlwind of
politics and public affairs.
11 Subjects
But no matter which major
a student chooses, he must
study 11 subjects at once; this
is true of every public high
school in South Vietnam. The
scattershot national curriculum
requires that each year an up
per form student must be ex
posed to: Vietnamese, English,
French, history, geography,
mathematics, physics, chemis
try, natural sciences (meaning
biology), civics, and physical
education.
Even the Quoc Hoc has a criti
cal shortage of decent texts.
There are no standard school
books. Each teacher suggests
his own preferences and the stu
dents must then buy them them
selves. The expenses run an av
erage of eight to ten dollars
yearly, more than many can
afford.
Vietnamese textbooks began
to appear in numbers in the pub
lic schools only in 1957-58, and
the upper forms still rely heav
ily on French and English books.
A large percentage of the few
Vietnamese textbooks are mere
ly translations from the French.
English students use an abomin
able series of paperbacks called
"English for Today," which sell
for 45 piastres or about 30 cents
apiece.
But the curriculum shows
even more clearly that Viet
namese high school students are
getting a foreign education. One
might expect that the math and
science programs would have
little bias, either foreign or pa
triotic. Yet most of the texts
are either French or transla
tions from the French: the math
is French math; the chemistry
comes out of French laborator
ies; and the physics texts often
refer to technical problems that
would challenge a French boy,
but leave a Vietnamese boy cold.
Foreign Letters
In letters, where the times de
mand a nationalist bias, foreign
influence is even more pro
nounced. (Indeed, though no one
interviewed would admit it, this
may be an important reason
why only a fraction major in
letters.)
Trung and Thanh are two sec
ond form (11th grade) letters

ly translations from the French.
English students use an abomin
able series of paperbacks called
"English for Today," which sell
for 45 piastres or about 30 cents
apiece.
But the curriculum shows
even more clearly that Viet
namese high school students are
getting a foreign education. One
might expect that the math and
science programs would have
little bias, either foreign or pa
triotic. Yet most of the texts
are either French or transla
tions from the French: the math
is French math; the chemistry
comes out of French laborator
ies; and the physics texts often
refer to technical problems that
would challenge a French boy,
but leave a Vietnamese boy cold.
Foreign Letters
In letters, where the times de
mand a nationalist bias, foreign
influence is even more pro
nounced. (Indeed, though no one
interviewed would admit it, this
may be an important reason
why only a fraction major in
letters.)
Trung and Thanh are two sec
ond form (11th grade) letters
students. They spend four hours
a day, six days a week, in class.
Eight of these hours are in En
glish language and literature,
six in French, five in Vietna
mese. Right away then, more
than half of their education is
devoted to the cultures of two
Western powers.
The seven remaining subjects
—math, physics, chemistry, biol
ogy, history, geography and
civics — are squeezed into five
hours per week. Surely they
learn something of their own
country in history and geogra
phy. But no. In government high
schools these are world studies,
not national ones. This liberal
ism would be admirable except
that, from what many teachers
say, Vietnamese high school stu
dents often know virtually noth
ing of their own country's back
ground and resources.

It's no wonder. With an hour
or two a week, and little em
phasis on Vietnamese history
and geography in the French
oriented baccalaureate exam,
why should they take them ser
iously? Yet the South Vietna
mese government is supposedly
trying to build some conscious
ness of national culture, as a
prerequisite for putting a na
tion together.
Civics
Civics too requires only an
hour or two of listening per
week. In five years, a Quoc Hoc
student is exposed to: (1) fam
ily relationships; ancestor wor
ship and filial piety; and traffic
regulations. (2) school relation
ships; duty to teachers, discip
line, dress etiquette; and more
traffic regulations. (3) social re
lationships; language, customs
and religious institutions. (4)
the Rights of Man (from the
United Nations Charter, 1948);
political theories of democracy,
socialism, and communism; and
national institutions—the con
stitution, the draft, elections,
taxes, etc. (5) economics (free
trade, currency, etc.) and politi
cal science.
Political science covers "the
Eastern democratic spirit" (Con
fucius, Mencius, Sun Yat-sen
and Vietnamese village coun
cils), "the Western democratic
spirit" (Britain's constitutional
monarchy, the American revolu
tion and the republican-federal
system, and the Third and
Fourth French Republics — but
not the Fifth), and Dictatorship
(Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy,
and Communism in Russia and
Eastern Europe — but not in
China or North Vietnam).
Letters majors get the cream
of the philosophical crop. "Gen
eral philosophy" introduces
them to epistemology and meta
physics, European style. A sec
tion on Eastern philosophy is
devoted to Confucius, Lao Tzu,
and primitive Buddhism. (This
sub-section of a minor course,
which only 12 per cent of the
students take, is probably that
part of Quoc Hoc education
which is most relevant to the
daily lives of the Vietnamese.
Until the French came, of
course, it would have been vir
tually the whole curriculum.)
The desire to go to America
for college raises the next spec
ter over Vietnamese "national"
education. Hundreds of South
Vietnam's best students are go
ing to the U.S. every year on
American government scholar
ships. Many of those who return
will want to incorporate Ameri
can ideas into the curriculum.
Already a number of professors

in the country's five universities
want to change the language of
instruction—not from French to
Vietnamese, but from French to
English.
But for the moment, Ameri
can influence in secondary edu
cation is only beginning to be
felt. The dominant strain is still
French, and it probably will be
for years to come. As Nguyen
Due Mai, an outspoken science
teacher at Quoc Hoc, says: "Not
only do we have a French edu
cational system, but it's 20 years
old. It was copied from the
French in 1947, and hasn't been
changed since it was instituted.
I still must explain to my stu
dents that Lavoisier is not the
last word in chemistry."
