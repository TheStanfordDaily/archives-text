# IFC To Examine Proposal Altering Scope Of Council
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) will consider a proposal
tomorrow night that would
change its scope and operations,
and includes more power for
the officers of the group and
more individual activities for
fraternities.
"The concept of the IFC
will change somewhat," ex
plained Dick Williams, presi
dent of Beta Chi. "At one time,
the IFC and all the representa
tives had to take up every is
sue, many of which can be eas
ily handled by the officers."
"The concern of the group
would then turn to more cen
tral issues to concern of all the
groups," Williams went on. He
mentioned such areas as rush,
the commisary where most resi
dences get their food, and
others.
Sponsored jointly by Lambda
Nu, Theta Chi, Phi Kappa Sig
ma, Beta Chi, and Delta Chi,
the proposal also includes a
substantial reduction in the IFC
budget.
The proposal allots less mon

ey to the IFC with the intention
that each house would spend the
money normally alloted on proj
ects for the house or small
groups of fraternities.
Williams said the plan was
designed to make the programs,
parties, and projects of frater
nities "more flexible" to the in
dividual needs and desires of
the specific houses rather than
the entire 1200 man community.
"It is much more impressive
for individual fraternities to
work on individual community
projects than for all 1200 to
plant several trees in front of
the library", Williams noted.
Guest - in - residence pro
grams then would be individual
or small group of house activi
ties, and less money would be
spent on Greek Week, and other
IFC functions.
