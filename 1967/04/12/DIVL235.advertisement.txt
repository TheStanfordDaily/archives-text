"Mark Mirsky has simply skipped the tedious
first novel many talented writers are compelled to \
work through. His narrator's voice is forceful
enough to make his characters leap startled
from the page." ALBERT J. GUERARD
"Mark Mirsky is a miracle worker. He has the tears
of comedy, the laughter of tragedy, and the
speaking voice of life—all in a stylization that
lets us know instantly we are in the presence of
a great teller of tales." JOHN CIARDI
