# Venereal Disease: A Problem At Stanford
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
"Although the incidence of venereal disease
at Stanford is lower than it would be for other
parallel populations, for instance the Army,
there is quite definitely a problem."
This is the opinion of Dr. David E. Torin,
Assistant Director for Clinical Services at the
Cowell Student Health Center. According to
Dr. Torin, the Health Center sees an average
of one case of venereal disease per week. Dr.
Torin pointed out, however, that these aver
age 52 cases a year constituted only the cases
that the Health Center knew about, and that
there was reason to believe that there were a
good many more cases that weren't being

treated because students were afraid to come
in for treatment.
Social Disease
Dr. Torin suggested two possible reasons
for reluctance in coming in to be treated for
venereal disease. "Many students are afraid
that treatment for venereal disease will go on
their records. Some are embarrassed because
they have contracted a 'social disease.' "
"It is important," Dr. Torin continued, "that
students know that venereal disease is treated
here just as any other contagious disease
would be, for example flu. There is no contact
with the administration."
Although there are actually five types of

venereal disease, syphilis and gonorrhea are
the most common. At Stanford there are an
average of two cases of syphilis a year and
an average 50 of gonorrhea. Dr. Torin pointed
out that there has not been a significant in
crease in incidence of either of the diseases
since birth control pills became more com
monly used and readily available. He did in
dicate, however, that for every 11 cases of
venereal disease treated at the Health Center,
men had ten.
Education Efforts
Efforts are made to try and slow down the
spread of venereal disease at Stanford, al
though none of these efforts are formal. Dr,

Torin said that there were three health faci
lities at Stanford, the Health Center, the Medi
cal School and the Department of Health Edu
cation. Efforts at controlling the spread of
VD consist of lectures at the Med School,
courses from the department and informal
talks with sponsors and RA's each fall. Dr.
Torin added that the Health Education course
used to be mandatory for all students.
Source
When a case of venereal disease turns up
at the Health Center, every attempt is made
to locate the source of the infection, so that
it too may be brought in for treatment.
Dr. Torin said that in cases where the
source is a friend the patient usually gives

us the name of the contact. In cases where the
source is a "casual acquaintance" the Health
Center Rives the contact's name to Public
Health Officials who contact the source. In
the latter case the name of the patient need
not be revealed.
Dr. Torin emphasized two points in con
cluding his interview with The Daily. "Vener
eal disease is curable, both syphilis and gonor
rhea. It is only in the tertiary stage, about
15 years after infection, that it is no longer
possible to cure syphilis."
"I want to re-emphasize," Dr. Tobin said,
"that there is complete confidence used in
regard to releasing information about cases
of venereal disease that we treat here."
