# Powell Wins

NEW YORK (AP) â€” Adam
Clayton Powell easily won re
election in absentia Tuesday
night as Harlem's congress
man, and the House of Repre
sentatives was faced anew with
the problem of what to do about
its debonair outcast.
With more than half the 214
election districts reporting,
Powell was piling up an 80 per
cent margin over his two oppo
nents, Lucille Pickett Williams,
Republican, and the Rev. Ervin
F. Yearling, Conservative.
But a lackadaisical turnout
threatened to keep the total vote
well short of last fall's turnout.
This was a blow to Powell
backers who had sought a large
vote in support of the free
wheeling Negro minister.
