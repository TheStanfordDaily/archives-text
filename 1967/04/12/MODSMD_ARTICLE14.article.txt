A day in Sacramento with
Ronald Reagan ... an illumi
nating, frank evening with two
members of the political public
relations firm of Spencer-Ro
'• erts, which ran his campaign
.. an afternoon with the co
inventor of the laser... a discus
sion with a Stanford historian
what constitutes presidential
greatness... a bull session on
editorial writing... a private
question-and-answer session with
Senator Mark Hatfield ... an
other with the president of the
Stanford student body ... and
still another with Stanford Pres
ident J. E. Wallace Sterling.
These were some of the ex
periences of Stanford Univer
sity's professional journalism
fellows during the first six
months of the program. These
are 27 newspaper men and news
broadcasters from throughout
the United States and Canada,
who came to Stanford for one
or two quarters (three or six
months).
The follows, whose expenses

are paid from a Ford Founda
tion seed-money grant, may
study in any area offered by the
university except journalism.
The objective is to provide them
with updated information and
analysis, and a mid-career aca
demic exposure, to help them
do better in their jobs as report
ers, desk men, writers, or
editors.
New Fellows
Another ten fellows will come
to the campus for the spring
quarter beginning April 3, while
six of those at the university in
the winter quarter will stay
over.
Although almost all fellows
try to do more classroom work
than the ordinary Stanford stu
dent they have indicated that
some of their more valuable ex
periences have come from spe
cial seminars set up by the pro
gram itself.
During the winter quarter
such seminars included, in addi
tion to those mentioned above,
sessions with law-school profes
sors on new Supreme Court rul
ings as they affect police prac
tices, and the libel laws; with

political scientists and historians
who are experts on Southeast
Asia; with the dean of the medi
cal school; with a top-ranking
U.S. diplomat-in-residence at
Stanford; and with such well
known writers and editors as
Wallace Stegner of the Stan
ford faculty, Erwin Canham of
the Christian Science Monitor,
and Norman Cousins of the Sat
urday Review.
Concentrations
In their Stanford courses the
fellows tended to concentrate
on political science and history.
Other areas of particular in
terest included economics, socio
logy, and anthropology.
Among the more popular
courses in addition to these
basic specializations were those
that dealt with modern China,
the South, American diplomatic
history, U.S. economic problems
since World War 11, and mod
ern European history.
One fellow, an art editor,
spent most of his classroom
hours in art history and criti
cism. Another, a wire-service re
porter, took a fiction-writing
course to sharpen his own writ
ing ability. Still others followed
courses on the great changes
taking place in religion.
Contributions
Members of the Stanford fa
culty welcomed the fellows to
their courses, even overcrowded
ones, because of the contribu
tions they could make to class
room discussion on the basis of
their maturity and experience.
Some professors helped fel
lows to organize special reading
courses to meet individual needs.
Others invited fellows to their
homes for dinner and informal
discussions.
Fourteen of the first 27 fel
lows were at Stanford for one
academic quarter and 13 for two
quarters. Most of them felt that
two quarters were more than
twice as valuable as a single
quarter, in large part because
of the problems involved in shift
ing from a newsroom constantly
concerned with deadlines to the
sharply different and different
ly-paced academic atmosphere.
Assistance
Each fellow receives a stipend
of $1700 per quarter, plus free
tuition. But experience has
shown that this is not enough
to finance a man's leave from
his employer, especially if he
comes from a distance, or has a
family, or both.
Accordingly 14 of the 27 fel
lows at Stanford to date re
ceived some financial assistance
from their employers. This
ranged from a continued full
salary to the difference between

the stipend and the employe's
regular salary. Some received
lump-sum payments for travel
or other expenses.
At the end of each quarter
each fellow writes a confidential
report on the program. Their ex
periences are best summed up
through comments they made.
For example:
• "I don't think the benefits
of the program would be as
great if there were not this com
plete break from the profession
al working world. This is a time
to learn, to think, to re-appraise
one's work and even one's life
itself."
• "The seminars, classes, and
reading in the program have
constituted for me a series of
in-depth background briefings
for stories of the future."
• "In a whole array of ways,
the Stanford experience has
been beneficial — so much so
that it is painful to imagine
what life would have been with
out the experience.... For the
first time in a decade, I read
newspapers as a reader — and
not as a newspaperman. ... I
got a chance to read what would

have gone unread and to think
what would have gone un
thought."
© "I had fire in my belly be
fore, but Stanford helped to
harden my determination to
help make newspapers survive
in the only way they can, by
getting better."
• "Perhaps as instructive as
the seminars and the class work
was the chance to meet fellow
newsmen from around the coun
try. The chance to exchange
ideas and observe attitudes is
something we in the business
need more of."
• "The great opportunity to
stop working, back off, and read
and read and read is something
I'm grateful to have had."
• "Many of the experiences
and impressions that I've gain
ed, and much of the knowledge,
came to me unexpectedly, dart
ing into the fringes of my per
ception from a hand-lettered
poster on a campus kiosk, from
a chance comment dropped by
a professor or a seminar speak
er, from the sudden surge of
conviction in a student's con
versation."
