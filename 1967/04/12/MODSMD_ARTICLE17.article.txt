## Athletes Not Special For Admissions Men Daily Sports

The stereotype of the stupid
football player which exists in
the mind of some critics of ath
letics and athletic recruiting
simply does not have validity any
more, says football coach John
Ralston.
This statement is especially
true at Stanford, according to the
Admissions Office, which states
•flatly that it has no different
standard for the admission of
athletes than for any other group
and as a matter of policy does
not determine whether Stanford
has good athletic teams or not.
"Our primary responsibility is
to select a class which represents
many different talents, aptitudes,
interests, values, and back
grounds, one which will best
benefit from the educational op
portunities here," says Douglas
R. Walker, Director of Freshman
Admissions. "Athletes are not
treated as a special group by this
office."
Admissions Justification
Walker offered one justifica
tion for athletic recruiting:
"More and more, the student
athlete is becoming the best can
didate over the straight student,
a better overall individual for the
University. We are after a per
fect mix of different types, and
the student-athletes help to com
plete that mix. We need the kind
of recruiting we do, which has
less emphasis on the great ath
lete and the major emphasis on
the top student who is also a
good athlete."
An Admissions Office Study
which is often cited by the Ath
letics Department as evidence of

the student-athlete's ability to do
the work academically, shows
that during the four year under
graduate period the student-ath
letes averaged 2.57 compared to
the all-men's figure of 2.64 for
the six years studied. Other facts
of the study show that the stu
dent-athletes graduate with their
class more frequently by almost
10 percent. Also, 75 percent of
the student-athletes go on to
graduate school, as compared
with an all-University figure of
75-80 percent. The Admis
sions Office said that student
athletes now qualify for aca
demic scholarships far more fre
quently.
Athletic Director Taylor sees
no need for a different admis
sions policy for the student-ath
lete. He desires one only if the
Admissions Office sets up differ
ent standards for other groups
of applicants.
