# Athletic Recruiting
## Athletes Not Special For Admissions Men Daily Sports

The stereotype of the stupid
football player which exists in
the mind of some critics of ath
letics and athletic recruiting
simply does not have validity any
more, says football coach John
Ralston.
This statement is especially
true at Stanford, according to the
Admissions Office, which states
â€¢flatly that it has no different
standard for the admission of
athletes than for any other group
and as a matter of policy does
not determine whether Stanford
has good athletic teams or not.
"Our primary responsibility is
to select a class which represents
many different talents, aptitudes,
interests, values, and back
grounds, one which will best
benefit from the educational op
portunities here," says Douglas
R. Walker, Director of Freshman
Admissions. "Athletes are not
treated as a special group by this
office."
Admissions Justification
Walker offered one justifica
tion for athletic recruiting:
"More and more, the student
athlete is becoming the best can
didate over the straight student,
a better overall individual for the
University. We are after a per
fect mix of different types, and
the student-athletes help to com
plete that mix. We need the kind
of recruiting we do, which has
less emphasis on the great ath
lete and the major emphasis on
the top student who is also a
good athlete."
An Admissions Office Study
which is often cited by the Ath
letics Department as evidence of

the student-athlete's ability to do
the work academically, shows
that during the four year under
graduate period the student-ath
letes averaged 2.57 compared to
the all-men's figure of 2.64 for
the six years studied. Other facts
of the study show that the stu
dent-athletes graduate with their
class more frequently by almost
10 percent. Also, 75 percent of
the student-athletes go on to
graduate school, as compared
with an all-University figure of
75-80 percent. The Admis
sions Office said that student
athletes now qualify for aca
demic scholarships far more fre
quently.
Athletic Director Taylor sees
no need for a different admis
sions policy for the student-ath
lete. He desires one only if the
Admissions Office sets up differ
ent standards for other groups
of applicants.
Challenge Of Body And Mind
Football coach Ralston men
tions the challenge of getting
good athletic teams from schools
that also have high admissions
standards. Stanford, he says, is
unique because it is the only top
academic school which also com
petes with nationally ranked
teams in every sport:
"We want to show that
strength in mind and body are
compatible in the same individ
ual. Bud Wilkinson, the former
chief of President Kennedy's
Council on Physical Fitness, told
me, 'The success of Stanford's
athletic program is vital to our
proving that this is possible.'
And if this isn't possible, I'll
quit."
A November Stanford Ob
server article reported that eight
athletes, all of whom were rep
resentative of Stanford athletes,
would not accept a lowering of
Stanford's academic program,
and indirectly, its admission
standards. Bud Walsh com
mented, "Most kids here are in
terested in (going into) some
profession. They couldn't do that
coming from a second-rate un
dergraduate school."
Faculty Athletic Representative
Stanford's Dean of Admissions
is also the Faculty Athletic Rep
resentative by virtue of the fact
he is also an Associate Professor
of History. Dr. Rixford Snyder's
main work in this position is to
make sure that the athletes are
academically qualified to com
pete in that they meet the NCAA
minimum grade point of 1.6,
which he states is comparable
to 1.1 at Stanford. "It is," he says,
"a small beginning" toward na
tional standardization of athletes
academic abilities. But he adds,
the Academic Achievement
Award Program of the AAWU is
a real "breakthrough" in pre
venting unjustified solely ath
letic free rides.
Dr. Snyder represents Stan
ford at all AAWU conference
meetings. These meetings decide
conference policies on recruiting
procedures, aid, and work pro
grams. "We have tried to obtain
more limiting standardization of
recruiting procedures, but have
always been outvoted."
Dr. Snyder adds that he feels
it will be impossible to arrive at
rules which will put other schools
on the same recruiting basis as
Stanford because of Stanford's
high admission standards and
tuition costs.
Athletic Director
The Athletic Director's job is
to oversee the entire program
and check that no policy rules are
broken. The Handbook of the
AAWU contains the following re
cruiting Code of Ethics in addi
tion to the rules on aid and visits:
1) the student-athlete and his
family are to be considered as
individuals with a free choice;
2) at the wish of the student-ath
lete and/or his family, all recruit
ing pressure is to end; and 3)
the recruiter may make no de
rogatory comments about other
schools' educational or athletic
opportunities, although he may
enlarge upon his own school's
advantages.
Direction And Distribution
As Athletic Director, Taylor
directs the Buck Club efforts to
raise money, often speaking at
promotional events. Of these ef
forts, he says, "Stanford is a
great place because we are not
lacking the financial support of
our alumni. We have to work at
getting the money, but we get
enough. And because there will
always be a certain number of
great student-athletes who are
interested in the education Stan
ford offers, we will never have to
enter a pure bidding race for top
athletes. We may not have
enough great athletes, by simple
numbers, to always have cham

pionship teams. Undoubtedly, it
will become harder to compete
in the future, but we feel we can
do it."
Taylor distributes the Buck
Club grant-in-aid to the various
teams by a formula which is de
termined by the sport, and the
ability of the 'crop' of student
athletes that year. For example,
the division of 28 awards of all
kinds for incoming freshmen of
1966-67 was 17 in football, six in
track, two in basketball and base
ball, and one in gymnastics. Golf
had no awards this year, but only
because the award could not be
filled. Wrestling had none this
year, but it will have one next
year for sure, and possibly two
or three.
Justification: Manpower
Taylor states that at the be
ginning of the year, he has a
good idea of how much money
will be available and arbitrarily
decides how many awards will
go to each sport. The numbers
are open to revision during
monthly and weekly meetings
with the coaches. Their ideas and
suggestions, especially when
about whether it is a good year
or not for recruiting in that
sport, affect the final number.
Several times in the past, foot
ball has been given 25 grants
one year and then taken eight
the next year or two.
Usually, the Athletics Depart
ment tries to work within the
framework of 28 awards per
year. "Every coach wants more
awards," says Taylor, "but we
simply can't afford that." Taylor
justifies the proportions, which
by numbers alone seem unfair
to someone without knowledge
of the needs of that sport, on the
basis of the manpower require
ments.
Football, as it exists in its most
competitive state, requires at
least 44 players, or almost two
teams on" offense and defense
plus specialists, to win. Track is
the second most needy man
power sport, and baseball is
third, according to Taylor. Foot
ball he concludes, usually gets
half the number of grants avail
able.
The variable policy, Taylor
states, is indicative of the Ath
letic Department's desires for
good student-athletes, because it
is willing to wait for years when

candidates do qualify. It is also,
he admits, indicative of the Ath
letic Department's desire for
good athletic teams.

recruiting, mainly "Is athletic re
cruiting necessary?"
