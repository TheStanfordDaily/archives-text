# Wilbur Experiment Endorsement Challenged By Stern Hall Protest
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
The revised Wilbur Experiment has
been informally approved by the steer
ing committee of the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES), but the pro
tests of Stern students may lead to
changes in part of the plan before it
is implemented.
The steering committee has been
polled by the SES staff and has en
dorsed an experiment in Wilbur which
would include three integrated coedu
cational houses with varying degrees
of academic theme. The plan, which
includes changes in at least three
other residences to accommodate dis
placed freshman men, will come up
for final approval at the steering com
mittee meeting April 17.

But the objections of Stem residents
to the specific change which would
convert two of their houses to all-fresh
man dorms will probably result in a
revision of this part of the proposal,
according to three administrators and
two members of the Committee on
Residential Polices of SES.
Speaking in Serra House lounge in
Stern last night, Dean of Students
Joel Smith said, "It would be a serious
mistake to remove two houses in
Stern and we must reach for other al
ternatives."
Smith and ASSU Housing Commis
sion co-chairman Jacobi, both mem
bers of the SES residence committee,
promised that Stern residents would
be brought in on future discussions
of the experiment, probably starting
at the committee's meeting this
afternoon.
Want Coeds Too
Other objections were raised be
cause the Stern residents felt they
should have coeducation, too. Saying
that they feared the Wilbur Experi
ment would cause a drain of leadership
in Stern into the more attractive co-

educational projects in Wilbur, they
urged Smith to investigate ways of
changing the legal restrictions which
presently limit Stern to a residence
for men.
The statement of the steering com
mittee approving the experiment re
ferred to the "appropriate implement
ing authorities" the job of effecting
changes for next year.
These authorities, according to SES
staff director Robert Hind, are the
Provost and his staff.
Provost Richard W. Lyman said
yesterday, "we're working hard on
this. We have to make some decisions
soon since they affect people's choices
for residences next year."
He commented that "the situation
with Stern illustrates the complexity
of making changes in the residence
system" but stated that "a program
of innovation in housing policy, car
ried out within the limits imposed by
practical considerations and by the
need not to make progress in one area
at the expense of creating insoluble
problems in another area," could be
expected for next year.

At issue also is the continuation of
the Grove House.
Provost Lyman indicated yesterday
that this is a "high priority" consid
eration for him, and said "it seems
most likely that it will have to be in
Wilbur."
Smith said the same thing at Stern
last night, terming "outrageous" a
suggestion that the Grove be allowed
to stay in its present house and that
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, on
suspension for the academic year, be
moved elsewhere if it returns to cam
pus next year.
History professor Mark Mancall, di
rector of the Grove, has expressed the
hope that the project would not have
to be moved to Wilbur, because he
considers as important factors the
smaller size of the present facilities
and their greater degree of separation
from other residences.
Other changes embodied in the plan
are a freshman women's house in
Wilbur, freshman coeducation in Ro
ble, and about 50 freshman women in
tegrated into Florence Moore Hall.

last night in the Serra Lounge. Many of the students voiced opposition to the
proposed change, In its present form.
