# Defense For Society?

### 
Aaron Mitchell, 37, is scheduled to die in San
Quentin's gas chamber this morning.
If he does, it will mark California's reaffir
mation of the anachronistic belief that the in
terests of society are served through the vin
dictive execution of a murderer. There have
been no executions in this state for four years,
but it appears that Governor Reagan's endorse
ment of capital punishment as a "self-defense
for society" may result in a vast bloodbath
in the coming months, as the backlog of death
row occupants await their fate.
A last minute stay of execution by the Gov
ernor would serve to ease the conscience of

public officials, but would not eliminate the
fundamental barbarousness of the institution.
In fact, it is these repeated delays which con
tribute most to the brutality of the system,
while revealing the insecurity with which so
ciety approaches capital punishment.
The state should not take upon itself to de
fine and control the most fundamental right of
men: the right to human life. The idea of capi
tal punishment as a deterrent is a myth and the
belief that society is safer when it kills its mis
fits is equally erroneous.
It has never been so evident that capital
punishment must be abolished if the inequities
of the present system are to be remedied.
