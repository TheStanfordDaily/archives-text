## Brown, Novak: No Easy Answers 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Whether or not one is a pro
fessed Christian, it should be
clear that Professor Otis has
done Professors Brown and No
vak a serious injustice. Profes
sor Otis, of course, is entitled to
disagreement with whomever he
chooses about the war in Viet
nam for whatever reasons he
chooses — theological, political,
or otherwise. Nevertheless, it is
not very thoughtful and even
misleading to associate Profes
sors Brown and Novak with a
position of "absolute pacifism,"
a position with which they both
differ substantially.
(One also wonders in this re
gard why Professor Otis has
focused solely on these two men,
neglecting to mention other pro
fessed Christians on the faculty,
such as Professor Ruotolo and
Dean Napier, who have also
publicly declared their opposi
tion to the Vietnam war and, it
should be added, who are also
not 'absolute pacifists.') Surely,
one need be neither a professed
Christian nor an 'absolute paci
fist' to oppose the war in Viet
nam.
More seriously, however, I
find grossly unfair Professor
Otis' insinuation that Professors
Brown and Novak are pushing
"easy answers" and that their
stand has exhibited "self-right
eousness" and "noisy intoler
ance". I can only wonder wheth
er Professor Otis has taken the
trouble to become familiar with
the positions of the two he criti
cizes. Is it self-righteousness to
confess that all Americans share
in the guilt for the suffering of
the Vietnamese people, especial
ly the innocent? Is it noisy intol
erance to insist that our govern
ment bring to an end the incon
sistencies between our stated
aims and the consequences they
produce and between what we
are told and what we discover
has actually been taking place?
Is it pushing an easy answer to
urge that the United States dem
onstrate that we are genuinely
ready to negotiate and that we
are not merely trying to win dip
lomatically what we have not
won militarily?
Professor Otis has misrepre
sented the positions both of the
Christian pacifists, who make
no pretense towards moral pur
ity, and of the responsible non
pacifists, some of whom happen
to be professed Christians, but
none of whom advocate uncon
ditional surrender or immediate
withdrawal of the United States,
even though they oppose the
war in Vietnam.
Finally, Professor Otis asserts
that war is justifiable in Christ
ian terms only when the alterna

tive is worse. The question must
be asked, however, worse for
whom? For us in America the
war is televised and painless as
we grow fat in the midst of un
paralled affluence. Perhaps it
will not be wasted on a Classics
professor to draw an analogy
from Herodotus between the ar
rogant wealth and power of
Lyndon Johnson and the Amer
icans in Vietnam, and that of
Xerxes and the Persians attack
ing Athens. And perhaps it will
not be wasted on a professed
Christian to point out that the
decisive mark of Christian suf
fering is that it is voluntary.

• Shame, Shame
Editor, The Daily:
I was pleased to read Dr.
Brooks Otis' letter of yesterday
calling for a series of public de
bates and a "Stanford Paper on
Vietnam." What he proposes
would be a credit to stoic de
bate at Stanford. Is this perhaps
the light at the end of the tun
nel? From the tone of his let
ter, "I write this because I feel
it is my duty to do 50..," I am
sure that Dr. Otis is a man
whose sense of duty will extend
to establishing the debates and
insuring the quality of the white
paper he proposes.
The fact is, the ideas in the
letter were so amazing it was
hard to believe a man in Dr.
Otis' position had written them.
Dr. Otis, you write about puting
aside self-righteousness and vio
lence and appealing instead to
honesty. Well, Dean Rusk said
that three years ago and, noth
ing in him changed, is still say
ing it today. You also write (or
quote) that "... it would be
sheer hypocrisy to pretend that
war, however conducted, is not
a process of killing, maiming
and otherwise destroying human
beings." Again, Dean Rusk in
December, as hard as winter
nails.
What disturbs is this: though
the idea of a debate is a good
one, I do not see the reason for
your debate except to commend
U.S. foreign policy and dispute
the wisdom of Professors Brown
and Novak. If you really have
been shamed by Dr. Brown, I
can only think of the Middle
Ages when a body had to do "cer
tain things" in shame. The Dr.
Brown of your sorrow is also
one of the sponsors of the Com
mittee of Responsibility which
is working to bring war-burned
and war-injured Vietnamese
children to American hospitals
for adequate medical treatment.
I am sorry for you, Dr. Otis, if
you have seen pictures of these
kids and not been shamed by

what you call destroying human
beings than by Dr. Brown's do
ings. By the way, do you really
consider Lyndon Johnson to be
an honest man? My God, the
CIA has been busy at this
school.

• Decadence
Editor, The Daily:
Is Mr. Otis an academic de
cadent? Those parts of his long
letter which pertain to action
against the war seem to indicate
he is. From his rather Aeschy
lean interpretation of original
sin Mr. Otis finds it quite easy
to damn everyone who does
anything to alter the way our
government is prosecuting the
war. The bellicose risk general
nuclear war; the pacifistic are
self-righteous and even play into
the hands of the bellicose. Mr.
Otis is telling us, in effect,
"you're damned whatever you
do; so, just sit back and talk
about the fearful symmetry of
your predicament." Such a posi
tion is decadent, and no amount
of academic concern, at this
point, can change it. In fine Mr.
Otis has put himself in the com
fortable position of the lover of
the truth, perhaps more dovish
than Mr. Johnson; though we
cannot know for sure.
I would like to ask Mr. Otis:
have we not questioned enough;
have we not been told enough;
have we not seen enough by
now to judge with certainty that
this war is criminal? Has not
the time come when further in
action even in the name of
truth-seeking is a decadent and
dishonest expedient for avoid
ing personal involvement?

• Smother Love?
Editor, The Daily:
Here at Stanford we live in a
world, alas, where the one great
sin is rudeness. Professor Otis
(Daily, April 10), five years late
and fence-sitting in the midst of
an immoral war, waxes indig
nant at the "self-righteousness
and violence of some pacifists"
(which ones, Prof. Otis?), at the
"small and petty way" of protest
by anti-war demonstrators dur
ing Vice President Humphrey's
visit to Stanford.
The fact is that Humphrey's
address was an insult to all who
profess to widen and preserve
our knowledge of the world. The
"specific reasonable, tolerant,
public and reiterated debate"
called for by Prof. Otis has been
going on now for years. But it
has been heavily one-sided, and
all we have had in return from

the Johnson administration,
each time they escalate the war,
is high-minded banalities about
preserving world peace. When
Humphrey spoke here, that
was no political leader at the
rostrum; that was a Pop Image,
and all who wanted intelligent
discussion of the issues were of
fended by his cant and Timese
cliches. No wonder he has been
forced, during past weeks, to
sneak out the back doors of Eu
rope.
I respect Prof. Otis's open pro
fession of conscience and agree,
though no Christian myself,
with his view of the relativity of
Christian ethic — the evil of war
in a world often containing evils
greater than war itself. But one
must be either naive or unin
formed to equate protest against
war in Vietnam with pacifism.
It is one thing to oppose war
in principle. It is quite another
to oppose the principles by
which a government wages war.
And it is misleading, at best, to
suggest — as Prof. Otis does —
that protest against the war in
Vietnam is anything like "paci
fist opposition to any sort of
rearmament against Nazi Ger
many." If analogies are what
you want, then the role of the
United States in Vietnam is very
much like the role played by
Nazi Germany in the Spanish
Civil War.
Our war in Vietnam is not
just any war. It is the military
extension of a foreign policy by
which the United States — be
nign, powerful, munifient — will
impose Pax Americana on the
rest of the world by loving it to
death. It takes very little to see
how even Stanford — where the
interlocking directorate of SRI,
the Board of Trustees, and Stan
ford Industrial Park thrive on
war industry and "pacification"
research — contributes to the
grand design.
The trouble is that those most
in power are incapable of seeing
the design for what it is. (Hu
bert Humphrey, no doubt, talks
the same nonsense at the break
fast table as he does publically.)
And thev are deaf to any words
suggesting that the design
might be perverse. So, Prof.
Otis, you can expect the protest
to grow noisier, the protesters
ruder, as long as Administra
tion response is the likes of
Humphrey's banal smile and the
platitudes that come with it.
It is an American, even a gen
erally Western (and Christian)
habit that we cannot love what
we have not first subdued. The
United States, in the person of
Lydon B. Johnson, is bent on
loving the whole world. Let the
world beware.
