## Food Revolt Brings Results 
### Charles Kite 
Spring is affectionately known
to all as the "silly season," and
as it implies, now is the optimum
time to take an off hand swipe at
the continuing myth of Tresid
der food.
"What myth?" you ask, "Ev
erybody knows it's rotten focd."
I have been patiently consum
ing Tresidder meals, sometimes
unavoidably, three times a day,
for the past two quarters. For
those six months I have accepted
the unspeakable burden (myth)
of the off-campus male with a
certain amount of equanimity,
getting little satisfaction from
the last Daily expose on the es
calation of food prices.
I laughed at the petition plas
tering "doves" and simply re
fused indulgence (perhaps "sac
rifice" is more accurate) in an
expensive bowl of "hawk" soup.
I gav.-' in to the pastry prices
though, chosing to conceal my
white arm band on those days
when I succumbed to my sweet
teeth. Perhaps my protest would
have been more vocal had I been
able to locate the table where one
signed the price-hike protest
petition. But, by that time, my
eyes had grown weak from the
lack of vitamin 'A' provided in
those over-cooked carrots.
For two quarters this minor
irritation mounted, until a series
of incidents made silence little
better than a war crime. As my
tongue contemplated a bit of
soggy tuna salad sandwich one
noon, my mind began to reel,

and I emitted a fishy "Auggg!"
The whole business became too
much to stomach. Visions of in
digenous dill pickle slices (ad
infinitum, ad nauseum) swirled
about the meat loaf that tasted
like last night's beef enchilada,
or Swedish meat balls, or Swiss
steak, or turkey a la king. I had
accepted this gourmet's Hell for
the simple expedient of price,
lack of an alternative, and acces
sibility. No more.
There are places, on campus
and off, that have cheaper food
of better quality. Unfortunately,
this does not include, to my
knowledge, the evening meal.
The only way to hurdle that plate
is to recruit those friendly La
gunita girls who undoubtedly re
ceive the best dorm food on
campus (I may have started
something here, but Julia Baby
will back me up).
But at the threat of physical
violence, I can not, languishing
reader, reveal the cold lunch
paradise I have discovered. It
was impressed on me at fist-point
that I "wouldn't want to ruin
a good thing" by having all the
discontented masses descending
on our palatine paradise. It was
generally agreed by my cour
teous lynch mob that "the noon
time crush could damn well suf
fer the lack of seating space at
the Union," as they left me to
continue their bridge game.
So it will have to suffice to doc
ument for the hierarchy of Tre
sidder that good sandwiches are
possible with better quality in
gredients (and more of them)
than currently available at TMU.
TMU'S $.45 roast beef sand
wich is duplicated for $40 by
Flading Catering Service of Red
wood City. For less money Flad
ing has as much beef as the TMU
French dip, fresh lettuce, and
better quality bread. The pickle
is left to the discretion of the
purchaser.
This secret place also has
brand-name ice cream. You can
actually buy a real ice cream
bar for the same dime you might
spend on the ridiculously mini
scule portion of what is known
in the TMU parlance as "one ten
cent scoop."
One hint though, I'm not re
ferring to Encina snack bar.
That place is an underground
operation of the TMU "cartel."
For some unfathomable reason,
the food survives the trip be
tween, and to my amazement
even the ready made $.25 atroci
ties (which come in the form of a
hot dog or hamburger) taste
better for the journey. It must
be the atmosphere of the place.
For an escapist breakfast
though, there was no restriction
placed on my revealing the true
nature-of-the-beast. In fact, the
Dally should be paid for the free
advertising. But then I don't ex
pect any headlong rush for the
Stickney's Golden Chicken on El
Camino, two blocks north of
Page Mill Road. One may be
skeptical, since the prices of a
Stickney dinner are way over
blown. But breakfast there is
quite reasonable, and the service
is prompt enough (and cour
teous, depending on your wait
ress) to attempt a meal, sans
TMU, without needing a whole
morning free. The coffee is $.15,
but with refills, and it is splendid
coffee! Actually ingestible with
out the necessary nose holding
that accompanies the noisy ir
ruption of the TMU brew.
One can consume a very filling
breakfast at Stickney's of
scrumptious oatmeal (hot, too),
fresh buttered toast (with three
kinds of condiments, apple but
ter, strawberry jam, and marma
lade), and coffee, for under a dol
lar. Likewise, with the "Californ
ian" special; coffee, toast, scram
bled eggs with diced ham, and
hash brown potatoes are just
$.99. There are other combina
tions to suit anybody's tastes, all
fairly priced.
But the one thing Stickney's
can't compete with becomes
TMU's partial saving grace. For
some reason, the pastry cooks at
the Union take an uncommon
pride in their work (uncommon
compared to what else walks out
of that place) and the quality
low price combination remains
unbeatable.
Do I expect a revolution?
Hardly. Only a small bomb in the
back kitchen would have an ap
preciable effect on TMU food. At
that suggestion one jokester at
our table hinted it must surely
improve the food, "What with
the saltpeter seasoning and the
smoke house flavor." One change
would inspire confidence, and

that is good ol' American com
petition (At Stanford? Where
are you Winds of Freedom?) Un
doubtedly TMU management
realizes they have a captive aud
ience, and chuckle softly to them
selves whenever the "gadfly"
Daily, spurred on by a reader's
letter, attempts an expose. That's
why my one-and-a-half alterna
tives to a Union might be
pounced on. At least by those
who have the means to escape,
goaded on by what remains of
their taste buds. Next stop: To
check on rumors of good food at
the Medical school cafeteria.

lar. Likewise, with the "Californ
ian" special; coffee, toast, scram
bled eggs with diced ham, and
hash brown potatoes are just
$.99. There are other combina
tions to suit anybody's tastes, all
fairly priced.
But the one thing Stickney's
can't compete with becomes
TMU's partial saving grace. For
some reason, the pastry cooks at
the Union take an uncommon
pride in their work (uncommon
compared to what else walks out
of that place) and the quality
low price combination remains
unbeatable.
Do I expect a revolution?
Hardly. Only a small bomb in the
back kitchen would have an ap
preciable effect on TMU food. At
that suggestion one jokester at
our table hinted it must surely
improve the food, "What with
the saltpeter seasoning and the
smoke house flavor." One change
would inspire confidence, and

that is good ol' American com
petition (At Stanford? Where
are you Winds of Freedom?) Un
doubtedly TMU management
realizes they have a captive aud
ience, and chuckle softly to them
selves whenever the "gadfly"
Daily, spurred on by a reader's
letter, attempts an expose. That's
why my one-and-a-half alterna
tives to a Union might be
pounced on. At least by those
who have the means to escape,
goaded on by what remains of
their taste buds. Next stop: To
check on rumors of good food at
the Medical school cafeteria.
Spring is affectionately known
to all as the "silly season," and
as it implies, now is the optimum
time to take an off hand swipe at
the continuing myth of Tresid
der food.
"What myth?" you ask, "Ev
erybody knows it's rotten focd."
I have been patiently consum
ing Tresidder meals, sometimes
unavoidably, three times a day,
for the past two quarters. For
those six months I have accepted
the unspeakable burden (myth)
of the off-campus male with a
certain amount of equanimity,
getting little satisfaction from
the last Daily expose on the es
calation of food prices.
I laughed at the petition plas
tering "doves" and simply re
fused indulgence (perhaps "sac
rifice" is more accurate) in an
expensive bowl of "hawk" soup.
I gav.-' in to the pastry prices
though, chosing to conceal my
white arm band on those days
when I succumbed to my sweet
teeth. Perhaps my protest would
have been more vocal had I been
able to locate the table where one
signed the price-hike protest
petition. But, by that time, my
eyes had grown weak from the
lack of vitamin 'A' provided in
those over-cooked carrots.
For two quarters this minor
irritation mounted, until a series
of incidents made silence little
better than a war crime. As my
tongue contemplated a bit of
soggy tuna salad sandwich one
noon, my mind began to reel,

and I emitted a fishy "Auggg!"
The whole business became too
much to stomach. Visions of in
digenous dill pickle slices (ad
infinitum, ad nauseum) swirled
about the meat loaf that tasted
like last night's beef enchilada,
or Swedish meat balls, or Swiss
steak, or turkey a la king. I had
accepted this gourmet's Hell for
the simple expedient of price,
lack of an alternative, and acces
sibility. No more.
There are places, on campus
and off, that have cheaper food
of better quality. Unfortunately,
this does not include, to my
knowledge, the evening meal.
The only way to hurdle that plate
is to recruit those friendly La
gunita girls who undoubtedly re
ceive the best dorm food on
campus (I may have started
something here, but Julia Baby
will back me up).
But at the threat of physical
violence, I can not, languishing
reader, reveal the cold lunch
paradise I have discovered. It
was impressed on me at fist-point
that I "wouldn't want to ruin
a good thing" by having all the
discontented masses descending
on our palatine paradise. It was
generally agreed by my cour
teous lynch mob that "the noon
time crush could damn well suf
fer the lack of seating space at
the Union," as they left me to
continue their bridge game.
So it will have to suffice to doc
ument for the hierarchy of Tre
sidder that good sandwiches are
possible with better quality in
gredients (and more of them)
than currently available at TMU.
TMU'S $.45 roast beef sand
wich is duplicated for $40 by
Flading Catering Service of Red
wood City. For less money Flad
ing has as much beef as the TMU
French dip, fresh lettuce, and
better quality bread. The pickle
is left to the discretion of the
purchaser.
This secret place also has
brand-name ice cream. You can
actually buy a real ice cream
bar for the same dime you might
spend on the ridiculously mini
scule portion of what is known
in the TMU parlance as "one ten
cent scoop."
One hint though, I'm not re
ferring to Encina snack bar.
That place is an underground
operation of the TMU "cartel."
For some unfathomable reason,
the food survives the trip be
tween, and to my amazement
even the ready made $.25 atroci
ties (which come in the form of a
hot dog or hamburger) taste
better for the journey. It must
be the atmosphere of the place.
For an escapist breakfast
though, there was no restriction
placed on my revealing the true
nature-of-the-beast. In fact, the
Dally should be paid for the free
advertising. But then I don't ex
pect any headlong rush for the
Stickney's Golden Chicken on El
Camino, two blocks north of
Page Mill Road. One may be
skeptical, since the prices of a
Stickney dinner are way over
blown. But breakfast there is
quite reasonable, and the service
is prompt enough (and cour
teous, depending on your wait
ress) to attempt a meal, sans
TMU, without needing a whole
morning free. The coffee is $.15,
but with refills, and it is splendid
coffee! Actually ingestible with
out the necessary nose holding
that accompanies the noisy ir
ruption of the TMU brew.
One can consume a very filling
breakfast at Stickney's of

scule portion of what is known
in the TMU parlance as "one ten
cent scoop."
One hint though, I'm not re
ferring to Encina snack bar.
That place is an underground
operation of the TMU "cartel."
For some unfathomable reason,
the food survives the trip be
tween, and to my amazement
even the ready made $.25 atroci
ties (which come in the form of a
hot dog or hamburger) taste
better for the journey. It must
be the atmosphere of the place.
For an escapist breakfast
though, there was no restriction
placed on my revealing the true
nature-of-the-beast. In fact, the
Dally should be paid for the free
advertising. But then I don't ex
pect any headlong rush for the
Stickney's Golden Chicken on El
Camino, two blocks north of
Page Mill Road. One may be
skeptical, since the prices of a
Stickney dinner are way over
blown. But breakfast there is
quite reasonable, and the service
is prompt enough (and cour
teous, depending on your wait
ress) to attempt a meal, sans
TMU, without needing a whole
morning free. The coffee is $.15,
but with refills, and it is splendid
coffee! Actually ingestible with
out the necessary nose holding
that accompanies the noisy ir
ruption of the TMU brew.
One can consume a very filling
breakfast at Stickney's of
scrumptious oatmeal (hot, too),
fresh buttered toast (with three
kinds of condiments, apple but
ter, strawberry jam, and marma
lade), and coffee, for under a dol
lar. Likewise, with the "Californ
ian" special; coffee, toast, scram
bled eggs with diced ham, and
hash brown potatoes are just
$.99. There are other combina
tions to suit anybody's tastes, all
fairly priced.
But the one thing Stickney's
can't compete with becomes
TMU's partial saving grace. For
some reason, the pastry cooks at
the Union take an uncommon
pride in their work (uncommon
compared to what else walks out
of that place) and the quality
low price combination remains
unbeatable.
Do I expect a revolution?
Hardly. Only a small bomb in the
back kitchen would have an ap
preciable effect on TMU food. At
that suggestion one jokester at
our table hinted it must surely
improve the food, "What with
the saltpeter seasoning and the
smoke house flavor." One change
would inspire confidence, and

that is good ol' American com
petition (At Stanford? Where
are you Winds of Freedom?) Un
doubtedly TMU management
realizes they have a captive aud
ience, and chuckle softly to them
selves whenever the "gadfly"
Daily, spurred on by a reader's
letter, attempts an expose. That's
why my one-and-a-half alterna
tives to a Union might be
pounced on. At least by those
who have the means to escape,
goaded on by what remains of
their taste buds. Next stop: To
check on rumors of good food at
the Medical school cafeteria.
Spring is affectionately known
to all as the "silly season," and
as it implies, now is the optimum
time to take an off hand swipe at
the continuing myth of Tresid
der food.
"What myth?" you ask, "Ev
erybody knows it's rotten focd."
I have been patiently consum
ing Tresidder meals, sometimes
unavoidably, three times a day,
for the past two quarters. For
those six months I have accepted
the unspeakable burden (myth)
of the off-campus male with a
certain amount of equanimity,
getting little satisfaction from
the last Daily expose on the es
calation of food prices.
I laughed at the petition plas
tering "doves" and simply re
fused indulgence (perhaps "sac
rifice" is more accurate) in an
expensive bowl of "hawk" soup.
I gav.-' in to the pastry prices
though, chosing to conceal my
white arm band on those days
when I succumbed to my sweet
teeth. Perhaps my protest would
have been more vocal had I been
able to locate the table where one
signed the price-hike protest
petition. But, by that time, my
eyes had grown weak from the
lack of vitamin 'A' provided in
those over-cooked carrots.
For two quarters this minor
irritation mounted, until a series
of incidents made silence little
better than a war crime. As my
tongue contemplated a bit of
soggy tuna salad sandwich one
noon, my mind began to reel,

and I emitted a fishy "Auggg!"
The whole business became too
much to stomach. Visions of in
digenous dill pickle slices (ad
infinitum, ad nauseum) swirled
about the meat loaf that tasted
like last night's beef enchilada,
or Swedish meat balls, or Swiss
steak, or turkey a la king. I had
accepted this gourmet's Hell for
the simple expedient of price,
lack of an alternative, and acces
sibility. No more.
There are places, on campus
and off, that have cheaper food
of better quality. Unfortunately,
this does not include, to my
knowledge, the evening meal.
The only way to hurdle that plate
is to recruit those friendly La
gunita girls who undoubtedly re
ceive the best dorm food on
campus (I may have started
something here, but Julia Baby
will back me up).
But at the threat of physical
violence, I can not, languishing
reader, reveal the cold lunch
paradise I have discovered. It
was impressed on me at fist-point
that I "wouldn't want to ruin
a good thing" by having all the
discontented masses descending
on our palatine paradise. It was
generally agreed by my cour
teous lynch mob that "the noon
time crush could damn well suf
fer the lack of seating space at
the Union," as they left me to
continue their bridge game.
So it will have to suffice to doc
ument for the hierarchy of Tre
sidder that good sandwiches are
possible with better quality in
gredients (and more of them)
than currently available at TMU.

and off, that have cheaper food
of better quality. Unfortunately,
this does not include, to my
knowledge, the evening meal.
The only way to hurdle that plate
is to recruit those friendly La
gunita girls who undoubtedly re
ceive the best dorm food on
campus (I may have started
something here, but Julia Baby
will back me up).
But at the threat of physical
violence, I can not, languishing
reader, reveal the cold lunch
paradise I have discovered. It
was impressed on me at fist-point
that I "wouldn't want to ruin
a good thing" by having all the
discontented masses descending
on our palatine paradise. It was
generally agreed by my cour
teous lynch mob that "the noon
time crush could damn well suf
fer the lack of seating space at
the Union," as they left me to
continue their bridge game.
So it will have to suffice to doc
ument for the hierarchy of Tre
sidder that good sandwiches are
possible with better quality in
gredients (and more of them)
than currently available at TMU.
TMU'S $.45 roast beef sand
wich is duplicated for $40 by
Flading Catering Service of Red
wood City. For less money Flad
ing has as much beef as the TMU
French dip, fresh lettuce, and
better quality bread. The pickle
is left to the discretion of the
purchaser.
This secret place also has
brand-name ice cream. You can
actually buy a real ice cream
bar for the same dime you might
spend on the ridiculously mini
scule portion of what is known
in the TMU parlance as "one ten
cent scoop."
One hint though, I'm not re
ferring to Encina snack bar.
That place is an underground
operation of the TMU "cartel."
For some unfathomable reason,
the food survives the trip be
tween, and to my amazement
even the ready made $.25 atroci
ties (which come in the form of a
hot dog or hamburger) taste
better for the journey. It must
be the atmosphere of the place.
For an escapist breakfast
though, there was no restriction
placed on my revealing the true
nature-of-the-beast. In fact, the
Dally should be paid for the free
advertising. But then I don't ex
pect any headlong rush for the
Stickney's Golden Chicken on El
Camino, two blocks north of
Page Mill Road. One may be
skeptical, since the prices of a
Stickney dinner are way over
blown. But breakfast there is
quite reasonable, and the service
is prompt enough (and cour
teous, depending on your wait
ress) to attempt a meal, sans
TMU, without needing a whole
morning free. The coffee is $.15,
but with refills, and it is splendid
coffee! Actually ingestible with
out the necessary nose holding
that accompanies the noisy ir
ruption of the TMU brew.
One can consume a very filling
breakfast at Stickney's of
scrumptious oatmeal (hot, too),
fresh buttered toast (with three
kinds of condiments, apple but
ter, strawberry jam, and marma
lade), and coffee, for under a dol
lar. Likewise, with the "Californ
ian" special; coffee, toast, scram
bled eggs with diced ham, and
hash brown potatoes are just
$.99. There are other combina
tions to suit anybody's tastes, all
fairly priced.
But the one thing Stickney's
can't compete with becomes
TMU's partial saving grace. For
some reason, the pastry cooks at
the Union take an uncommon
pride in their work (uncommon
compared to what else walks out
of that place) and the quality
low price combination remains
unbeatable.
Do I expect a revolution?
Hardly. Only a small bomb in the
back kitchen would have an ap
preciable effect on TMU food. At
that suggestion one jokester at
our table hinted it must surely
improve the food, "What with
the saltpeter seasoning and the
smoke house flavor." One change
would inspire confidence, and

that is good ol' American com
petition (At Stanford? Where
are you Winds of Freedom?) Un
doubtedly TMU management
realizes they have a captive aud
ience, and chuckle softly to them
selves whenever the "gadfly"
Daily, spurred on by a reader's
letter, attempts an expose. That's
why my one-and-a-half alterna
tives to a Union might be
pounced on. At least by those
who have the means to escape,
goaded on by what remains of
their taste buds. Next stop: To
check on rumors of good food at
the Medical school cafeteria.
