# YOSEMITE SEARCH
## Park Rangers Find Tent 
### SUE DONNELLY 
Rangers have found a tent contain
ing two sleeping bags in Yosemite Val
ley, reported Mike Humphreys, Presi
dent of the Alpine Club last night. The
bags apparently belong to missing
Stanford students Larry Greene and
Ed Hermanns.
A third sleeping bag was found out
side the tent. Although the two grad
uate students signed out from the
ranger station alone, it is possible that
they may have had a companion, said
Humphreys.
Earlier yesterday, Bob Graves, grad
uate student in industrial engineering,
reported that he had met a group of
three climbers in the Mirror Lake

parking lot at Yosemite. Graves and
three others, Mike Collins, Marlys
Engelman, and Carol Landa, were set
ting out on snowshoes to Badger Pass.
In a brief conversation, the climbers
told him of their plan to climb the
gully to Aweaha Point.
Graves later heard radio reports of
the missing Stanford hikers, but the
radio said they had set out on March
31st and that only two hikers were
missing. Graves said that yesterday
morning he suddenly saw a possible
connection between the two incidents.
Cheek Out
Hermanns and Greene were checked
out on March 30th to hike to Aweaha
Point, near Half Dome, said the Rang
ers. They indicated that they would
return on March 31st.
There is no record of a group of
three people signing out to climb to
Aweaha Point on the 30th, said the
Rangers. However, according to
Graves, sign out procedures are in
formal, and people sometimes do not
make use of them.
The car which the two graduate stu
dents were driving has been found in
the Happy Isles parking lot, said the
Rangers, and it appears to be in run
ning condition. This lot is about two
miles from the Mirror Lake parking
lot, said Graves, and it is possible that
the climbers passed the Mirror Lake
lot on their way to begin climbing.
Search Difficult
Rangers continue to look for the
climbers, they said yesterday after
noon. But avalanche conditions,

brought about by heavy snows of the
last two weeks, have made ground
search difficult, and air search has
been impossible, they said.
According to Graves, the area look
ed "like a beautiful avalanche trap,"
on the morning of the 30th. It had
snowed the night before and was a
warm day in the valley â€” about 40
degrees.
The three people whom they met in
Mirror Lake parking lot did not ap
pear to have equipment for an over
night stay, said Graves. But he did
not see their car, he added.
Moderate Experience
Larry Greene is a moderately ex
perienced climber, according to Mike
Humphreys, but he may not be very
experienced at snow climbing. Ed
Hermanns has less experience than
Greene, he said.
Graves said that the three people
he met seemed to be knowledgeable
climbers. They conversed about the
different routes to Aweaha Point, and
they had good equipment. They said
that instead of going up the face,
they planned to go around the far
side, up the gully.
Graves said that at the top of the
gully there is a regular trail which
comes out by Nevada Falls. It is an
easier route back down than the gully
itself. He said that he had talked
with the climbers about this trail. He
felt sure that they knew the trail was
there and that they would take it if
the gully seemed too dangerous a way
down.
