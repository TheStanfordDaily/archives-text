# Graduates Receive Ford Grant: Wilson Fellowships Phase Out
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The Woodrow Wilson Fellowships,
ordinarily awarded to incoming gradu
ate students, will be phased out after
this fall, according to Robert M. Rozen
zweig, Associate Dean of the Graduate
Division.
The phase-out is one of the condi
tions of a recent grant to the Univers
ity by the Ford Foundation. The grant,
worth $4 million, is expected to be a
substitute for the Wilson money, and
will reduce the uncertainty the Uni
versity now faces in planning for the
Wilson fellowships.
Wilson fellowships are awarded to
the individual student, not the Univers
ity. Students are allowed to choose the
University where they want to do their
graduate work and the number that
choose Stanford varies from year to
year.
The Ford grant will take effect with
September's entering graduate class.
It will support the next four classes
for four years each and will insure
that every student will receive either
fellowship money or will earn money

through a teaching assistantship or a
research assistantship, according to
Rosenzweig.
The $4 million will be used in addi
tion to the funds the University is now
using for graduate support. "A condi
tion of the grant is that there will be
no substitution for money now being
used," Rosenzweig said.
There will be no net increase in the
number of students this fall, he said,
but there may be small increases over
the four years the grant will be in
effect. "I wouldn't expect any large in
crease in class size," Rosenzweig com
mented.
The Ford Foundation suggested the
plan for graduate subsidies to Stan
ford last fall and asked the Univer
sity how they would revise their fi
nancing for graduate students if the
funds were made available. After a
study of the situation, Stanford asked
for more than $4 million, according
to Rosenzweig, and the final figure
was the result of negotiations. Nine
other universities have also been se
lected to receive grants of approxi
mately $4 million each.

The grants will be distributed to in
dividual academic departments accor
ding to their needs, Rosenzweig said,
"but some small departments may
get proportionately more than some
large departments."
Rosenzweig stressed that the new
program does not mean a four year
fellowship for every graduate stu
dent. "What form the money comes
in depends on what's available," he
said. The University will guarantee at
least two years of fellowship support.
The other two years may be support
ed by a fellowship or a teaching as
sistantship or a research assistant
ship.
"At the present time beginning stu
dents are brought in on fellowships,"
Rosezweig said. "Most students are
supported most of the time they're
here," he added. One of the difficul
ties now is the uncertainty students
face when applying for teaching or
research positions. The Ford Grant
will allow the University to "regular
ize the process," according to Rosen
zweig.

this fall, according to Robert M. Rozen
zweig, Associate Dean of the Graduate
Division.
The phase-out is one of the condi
tions of a recent grant to the Univers
ity by the Ford Foundation. The grant,
worth $4 million, is expected to be a
substitute for the Wilson money, and
will reduce the uncertainty the Uni
versity now faces in planning for the
Wilson fellowships.
Wilson fellowships are awarded to
the individual student, not the Univers
ity. Students are allowed to choose the
University where they want to do their
graduate work and the number that
choose Stanford varies from year to
year.
The Ford grant will take effect with
September's entering graduate class.
It will support the next four classes
for four years each and will insure
that every student will receive either
fellowship money or will earn money

through a teaching assistantship or a
research assistantship, according to
Rosenzweig.
The $4 million will be used in addi
tion to the funds the University is now
using for graduate support. "A condi
tion of the grant is that there will be
no substitution for money now being
used," Rosenzweig said.
There will be no net increase in the
number of students this fall, he said,
but there may be small increases over
the four years the grant will be in
effect. "I wouldn't expect any large in
crease in class size," Rosenzweig com
mented.
The Ford Foundation suggested the
plan for graduate subsidies to Stan
ford last fall and asked the Univer
sity how they would revise their fi
nancing for graduate students if the
funds were made available. After a
study of the situation, Stanford asked
for more than $4 million, according
to Rosenzweig, and the final figure
was the result of negotiations. Nine
other universities have also been se
lected to receive grants of approxi
mately $4 million each.

The grants will be distributed to in
dividual academic departments accor
ding to their needs, Rosenzweig said,
"but some small departments may
get proportionately more than some
large departments."
Rosenzweig stressed that the new
program does not mean a four year
fellowship for every graduate stu
dent. "What form the money comes
in depends on what's available," he
said. The University will guarantee at
least two years of fellowship support.
The other two years may be support
ed by a fellowship or a teaching as
sistantship or a research assistant
ship.
"At the present time beginning stu
dents are brought in on fellowships,"
Rosezweig said. "Most students are
supported most of the time they're
here," he added. One of the difficul
ties now is the uncertainty students
face when applying for teaching or
research positions. The Ford Grant
will allow the University to "regular
ize the process," according to Rosen
zweig.
The Woodrow Wilson Fellowships,
ordinarily awarded to incoming gradu
ate students, will be phased out after
this fall, according to Robert M. Rozen
zweig, Associate Dean of the Graduate
Division.
