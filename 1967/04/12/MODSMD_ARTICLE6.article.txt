# Three Eating Clubs Open Doors To Dollies
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Coeducational Eating Clubs are
now a reality. Three of the seven
clubs say they are accepting girls as
members and a fourth is seriously
considering the idea.
The Eating Clubs have traditionally
been for male students who either
live off campus or in Toyon Hall, the
Eating Clubs' dormitory. Now, how
ever, by instituting an open-rush pol
icy which says that no one desiring
membership will be "dinged," Break
ers and El Capitan have implicitly
decided to accept girls, and El Campo
voted last quarter to take in girls.
Joining an eating club is presently
practical only for undergraduate
coeds living in Hoskins House or
graduate women who live off campus.
Girls living in dormitories or row
houses are required to participate in
the University Food Service, and few
could afford to pay twice for their
meals.
Economic Problem
The basic problem preventing ex
tensive integration of women into Eat
ing Clubs appears to be economic. The
University Food Service would lose
money if it permitted girls to eat else
where and not pay them board.
Bill Wyman, director of Toyon,
says,"The University is being unnec
essarily pragmatic. They have to sell
food to all those in the dormitories
to come out even." Wyman feels that
since the only factor preventing the
change is economic, "The University
should be willing to take a small loss
in the interest of residential reform."
Thus far, no approaches to the Uni
versity to change its policy have met
with success. Manuel Nathanso, Resi
dent Assistant of Breakers, believes
that such change is impossible. "I
tried and got a flat no," he says. Glenn
Hara, president of the Inter-Club
Council, admits that the present pol
icy will be "pretty difficult to change."

Hara sees two possible ways to per
mit more girls to participate in the
Eating Clubs. One is for the OFF pro
posal to be approved allowing under
graduate women to live off campus.
Coeducational Toyon?
The other possibility is to make
Toyon coeducational. According to
Wyman, approximately sixty women
could be housed in Toyon with reno
vation expenses of less than $400. He
says,"I suggested Toyon be coed so
the University would realize that they
were stopping girls" from enjoying
the various opportunities open to
male students.

Breakers was the first of the Eating
Clubs to have the open-rush policy.
Beginning in 1965, all who wished to
join were accepted. Presently there
are nine women members, three of
whom live in Hoskins. Breakers' Busi
ness Manager is a female law student.
Other Breakers members include a
husband and wife team who hash to
gether.
Last quarter, El Capitan went on the
open-rush system. There was one girl
member last year, but the club feels
that a larger number of women is
necessary to make a significant and
successful change.

El Campo voted at the end of last
quarter to accept women members on
the same basis as others. They now
have one female in the club and are
the first to actively conduct a cam
paign to attract coeds. Each resident
of Hoskins has been mailed an invi
tation to join the club. Tom Chambers,
president of El Campo, explained, "We
would like to have as many graduate
and undergraduate women as we could
accomodate."
Los Arcos is presently considering
making the club coeducational but so
far has made no decision. It will hold
a hostel in two weeks to discuss future
plans, including the possibility of an
exchange lunch arrangement.
Three Remain All-Male
The three remaining clubs, El
Cuadro, El Tigre, and El Toro, want to
remain all-male. In general, they sup
port the other clubs in their decisions
and feel that this is a matter for each
club to determine individually.
El Cuadro reports that members like
the opportunity to eat informally with
friends and feels that women would
inhibit their activities. They prefer to
keep the present policy of welcoming
women as guests.
El Tigre also discussed becoming
coeducational and decided to remain
for men only, as did El Toro. In their
diversity, the clubs hope to offer the
men a choice of eating conditions.
The cost of joining an Eating Club
is nearly the same as paying Uni
versity board. Each costs approximat
ely $220 per quarter, so the women
would neither be saving nor spending
more money by joining a club. Ar
rangements can also be made for par
tial board.
One interesting concession made by
El Campo concerns social dues. "We
don't charge girl members social dues
($35)," said Chambers. "We prefer to
uphold tradition in this matter."

is nearly the same as paying Uni
versity board. Each costs approximat
ely $220 per quarter, so the women
would neither be saving nor spending
more money by joining a club. Ar
rangements can also be made for par
tial board.
One interesting concession made by
El Campo concerns social dues. "We
don't charge girl members social dues
($35)," said Chambers. "We prefer to
uphold tradition in this matter."
Coeducational Eating Clubs are
now a reality. Three of the seven
clubs say they are accepting girls as
members and a fourth is seriously
considering the idea.
The Eating Clubs have traditionally
been for male students who either
live off campus or in Toyon Hall, the
Eating Clubs' dormitory. Now, how
ever, by instituting an open-rush pol
icy which says that no one desiring
membership will be "dinged," Break
ers and El Capitan have implicitly
decided to accept girls, and El Campo
voted last quarter to take in girls.
Joining an eating club is presently
practical only for undergraduate
coeds living in Hoskins House or
graduate women who live off campus.
Girls living in dormitories or row
houses are required to participate in
the University Food Service, and few
could afford to pay twice for their
meals.
Economic Problem
The basic problem preventing ex
tensive integration of women into Eat
ing Clubs appears to be economic. The
University Food Service would lose
money if it permitted girls to eat else
where and not pay them board.
Bill Wyman, director of Toyon,
says,"The University is being unnec
essarily pragmatic. They have to sell
food to all those in the dormitories
to come out even." Wyman feels that
since the only factor preventing the
change is economic, "The University
should be willing to take a small loss
in the interest of residential reform."
Thus far, no approaches to the Uni
versity to change its policy have met
with success. Manuel Nathanso, Resi
dent Assistant of Breakers, believes
that such change is impossible. "I
tried and got a flat no," he says. Glenn
Hara, president of the Inter-Club
Council, admits that the present pol
icy will be "pretty difficult to change."

Hara sees two possible ways to per
mit more girls to participate in the
Eating Clubs. One is for the OFF pro
posal to be approved allowing under
graduate women to live off campus.
Coeducational Toyon?
The other possibility is to make
Toyon coeducational. According to
Wyman, approximately sixty women
could be housed in Toyon with reno
vation expenses of less than $400. He
says,"I suggested Toyon be coed so
the University would realize that they
were stopping girls" from enjoying
the various opportunities open to
male students.

Breakers was the first of the Eating
Clubs to have the open-rush policy.
Beginning in 1965, all who wished to
join were accepted. Presently there
are nine women members, three of
whom live in Hoskins. Breakers' Busi
ness Manager is a female law student.
Other Breakers members include a
husband and wife team who hash to
gether.
Last quarter, El Capitan went on the
open-rush system. There was one girl
member last year, but the club feels
that a larger number of women is
necessary to make a significant and
successful change.

El Campo voted at the end of last
quarter to accept women members on
the same basis as others. They now
have one female in the club and are
the first to actively conduct a cam
paign to attract coeds. Each resident
of Hoskins has been mailed an invi
tation to join the club. Tom Chambers,
president of El Campo, explained, "We
would like to have as many graduate
and undergraduate women as we could
accomodate."
Los Arcos is presently considering
making the club coeducational but so
far has made no decision. It will hold
a hostel in two weeks to discuss future
plans, including the possibility of an
exchange lunch arrangement.
Three Remain All-Male
The three remaining clubs, El
Cuadro, El Tigre, and El Toro, want to
remain all-male. In general, they sup
port the other clubs in their decisions
and feel that this is a matter for each
club to determine individually.
El Cuadro reports that members like
the opportunity to eat informally with
friends and feels that women would
inhibit their activities. They prefer to
keep the present policy of welcoming
women as guests.
El Tigre also discussed becoming
coeducational and decided to remain
for men only, as did El Toro. In their
diversity, the clubs hope to offer the
men a choice of eating conditions.

club to determine individually.
El Cuadro reports that members like
the opportunity to eat informally with
friends and feels that women would
inhibit their activities. They prefer to
keep the present policy of welcoming
women as guests.
El Tigre also discussed becoming
coeducational and decided to remain
for men only, as did El Toro. In their
diversity, the clubs hope to offer the
men a choice of eating conditions.
The cost of joining an Eating Club
is nearly the same as paying Uni
versity board. Each costs approximat
ely $220 per quarter, so the women
would neither be saving nor spending
more money by joining a club. Ar
rangements can also be made for par
tial board.
One interesting concession made by
El Campo concerns social dues. "We
don't charge girl members social dues
($35)," said Chambers. "We prefer to
uphold tradition in this matter."
Coeducational Eating Clubs are
now a reality. Three of the seven
clubs say they are accepting girls as
members and a fourth is seriously
considering the idea.
The Eating Clubs have traditionally
been for male students who either
live off campus or in Toyon Hall, the
Eating Clubs' dormitory. Now, how
ever, by instituting an open-rush pol
icy which says that no one desiring
membership will be "dinged," Break
ers and El Capitan have implicitly
decided to accept girls, and El Campo
voted last quarter to take in girls.
Joining an eating club is presently
practical only for undergraduate
coeds living in Hoskins House or
graduate women who live off campus.
Girls living in dormitories or row
houses are required to participate in
the University Food Service, and few
could afford to pay twice for their
meals.
Economic Problem
The basic problem preventing ex
tensive integration of women into Eat
ing Clubs appears to be economic. The
University Food Service would lose
money if it permitted girls to eat else
where and not pay them board.
Bill Wyman, director of Toyon,
says,"The University is being unnec
essarily pragmatic. They have to sell
food to all those in the dormitories
to come out even." Wyman feels that
since the only factor preventing the
change is economic, "The University
should be willing to take a small loss
in the interest of residential reform."
Thus far, no approaches to the Uni
versity to change its policy have met
with success. Manuel Nathanso, Resi
dent Assistant of Breakers, believes
that such change is impossible. "I
tried and got a flat no," he says. Glenn
Hara, president of the Inter-Club
Council, admits that the present pol
icy will be "pretty difficult to change."

Hara sees two possible ways to per
mit more girls to participate in the
Eating Clubs. One is for the OFF pro
posal to be approved allowing under
graduate women to live off campus.
Coeducational Toyon?
The other possibility is to make
Toyon coeducational. According to
Wyman, approximately sixty women
could be housed in Toyon with reno
vation expenses of less than $400. He
says,"I suggested Toyon be coed so
the University would realize that they
were stopping girls" from enjoying
the various opportunities open to
male students.

Breakers was the first of the Eating
Clubs to have the open-rush policy.
Beginning in 1965, all who wished to
join were accepted. Presently there
are nine women members, three of
whom live in Hoskins. Breakers' Busi
ness Manager is a female law student.
Other Breakers members include a
husband and wife team who hash to
gether.
Last quarter, El Capitan went on the
open-rush system. There was one girl
member last year, but the club feels
that a larger number of women is
necessary to make a significant and
successful change.

El Campo voted at the end of last
quarter to accept women members on
the same basis as others. They now
have one female in the club and are
the first to actively conduct a cam
paign to attract coeds. Each resident
of Hoskins has been mailed an invi
tation to join the club. Tom Chambers,
president of El Campo, explained, "We
would like to have as many graduate
and undergraduate women as we could
accomodate."
Los Arcos is presently considering
making the club coeducational but so
far has made no decision. It will hold
a hostel in two weeks to discuss future
plans, including the possibility of an
exchange lunch arrangement.
Three Remain All-Male
The three remaining clubs, El
Cuadro, El Tigre, and El Toro, want to
remain all-male. In general, they sup
port the other clubs in their decisions
and feel that this is a matter for each
club to determine individually.
El Cuadro reports that members like
the opportunity to eat informally with
friends and feels that women would
inhibit their activities. They prefer to
keep the present policy of welcoming
women as guests.
El Tigre also discussed becoming
coeducational and decided to remain
for men only, as did El Toro. In their
