# Vietnam Protest Posters Torn Down By Police
## 
### 
Posters opposing Stanford's involve
ment in the Vietnam war appeared on
campus this morning, but some were
torn down by campus police.
The posters were photographs of
Stanford trustees David Packard,
Roger Lewis, Charles Ducommon and
William Hewlett; President Wallace
Sterling; and Business School Dean
Ernest Arbuckle. They carried the
words "we accuse" beneath the photos,
as well as an announcement about a
rally to be held on Thursday.
At the same time, leaflets were dis
tributed which said, "those who de
velop and supply weapons for the war
are no less responsible for their actions
than the men who order it fought."
The leaflets also discussed the re
lationship between Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) and the war. It charged
that, "SRI ranked among the top 100
military contractors" and that it de
veloped "dissemination techniques for
gas being used in Vietnam." and heli

copters in use there.
The leaflets said about the men pic
tured, "These are by no means the
only members of the Stanford com
munity actively involved in the war,"
and suggested that if they did not
sever their connection with the war
either corporately or individually,
"they have no place in the University."
Stanford police were first instructed
to remove the posters from the kiosks,
but were later told to leave them.
Meanwhile, Prof. Mark Mancall, di
rector of the Grove Project told stu
dents who hung posters there that
they would have to indicate who was
sponsoring them.
Although he said he did not have a
right to impose his own standards on
the residents of Grove House, Mancall
called the posters "in extraordinary
bad taste" and suggested they become
a subject for public discussion if there
appeared to be a consensus on this
feeling.
