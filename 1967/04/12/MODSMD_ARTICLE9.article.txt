# IIR Group To Study Cultures
## 
### 
A new Institute was added to
the Institute of International Re
lations (IIR) last night, when
James Ching, lIR President,
Marvin Prosono and Ron Royce
signed the charter of the Insti
tute for the Study of Contem
porary Cultures (ISCC).
Although ISCC is chartered
by the lIR, it retains a certain
degree of autonomy in that it is
governed by its own officers and
Board. Projects, conferences
and day-to-day operations are
the function of Director Proso
no and his assistant, Kenji Higa
ki. The planning of programs,
the formulation of policy, and
the choosing of long term goals
are the functions of the Execu
tive Board and the President.
A tentative schedule of events
for 1967-68 has been drawn up
by the ISCC, and includes con
ferences and seminars discuss
ing the ways in which such di
verse entities as Maoism, the
credibility gap, the thawing of
the cold war, military prepared
ness, and television have altered
American social values and the
American image.
