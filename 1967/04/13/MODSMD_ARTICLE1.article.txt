# 'Marriage,' Overnights Let Girls Live Off
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
"The University requires that an undergrad
uate woman under 23 years of age, who Is
not living with her parents or her husband,
live In University residence." (Stanford Uni
versity Bulletin, 1967.)

If you are an undergraduate woman at Stan
ford, other than a freshman, and are cur
rently abiding by the above stated University
housing regulation and have not seen your
roommate for any length of time, do not be
alarmed. It is quite possible that she is living
off campus.
While living off campus is technically illegal
for girls who do not fall into the special cate
gories outlined above, there is every evidence
that more and more Stanford Dollies have
found loop-holes in the regulation which have
made it possible for them to move out of their
dorms. One such loophole is applicable only
to junior and senior women.
According to the publication Social Regula
tions and Procedures for Undergraduate
Women, "A woman must sign out if she

wishes to take a late leave (or overnight)."
An overnight is defined as remaining away
from the residence "beyond 2:30 a.m. or 6:00
a.m. (whichever would have been her maxi
mum sign-out time) of the following day."
The loophole in the residence regulation exists
because nowhere in the social regulations is it
specified when a g*rl must return from an
overnight.
A Quarter At A Time
Junior and senior women have had un
limited overnights since Spring Quarter, 1965.
Unlimited overnights coupled with the ab
sence of a ruling about the number of con
secutive overnights for which a girl may sign
out at the same time, makes it ridiculously
easy for these junior and senior women to
sign out on the first day of the quarter and
sign in on the last. The only penalty that a
girl taking such action must incur is an eco
nomic one since the University requires all
girls who are supposed to live on campus to
pay room and board bills.
The Administration is well aware of this
loophole in the University Residence Regula
tion and are currently making attempts to

clarify both the regulation and their position
concerning the regulation. According to Dean
of Students Joel Smith, "It is too early to
say what our final position on this question
will be. But," Dean Smith continued, "some
thing will be done."
Sub-Committee
Another group which is studying the ques
tion of late leave and overnight sign-outs is
a special sub-committee of the Presidential
Committee on Student Affairs and Services.
According to Dr. Eleanor Maccoby, chairman
of the sub-committee, it is too early to tell
what the recommendations of the subcommit
tee will be.
According to Student Body President Mike
Collins, however, who is a member of the
parent committee, there is an indication that
the sub-committee will report out a more lib
eralized version of the existing regulation.
The sub-committee is expected to make its
report in a few weeks.
There have been attempts by the various
living group directors to control this loop
hole in some manner. For example, on the
Row, while there is no special time limit estab

lished, Miss Knauer makes an attempt to see
every girl who has been signed out for long
periods and talk to her about her obligations
to her house and her roommate. Each case
is handled individually. In Hoskins, on the
other hand, the girls are asked to sign in and
out for every consecutive overnight, except
weekends.
Another Loophole
While only junior and senior women can
take advantage of the absence of a limit to
Consecutive overnight sign-outs regulation,
there is another loophole in the University
Residence Regulation which can be used by
sophomore and freshmen women as well.
The marriage loophole, for want of a better
name, exists because of a large degree of
complacency. Although the
marriage loophole is less frequently used than
the overnight loophole, there are a good many
girls who are using it and keeping it secret
only from the Administration.
Taking advantage of the marriage loop
hole requires a violation of the Fundamental
Standard, but that does not seem to bother
the girls as much as living on campus does.

The game was played in the following manner
by one girl.
Miss X, a junior, who asked not to be iden
tified, tired of living in Florence Moore, con
vinced hor boyfriend that they should get
"married." Getting "married" involved two
steps. "I had to fill out a card on reg day
stating who my husband was and where we
were living and other pertinent information,
and then I had to go to the Associate Dean of
Students Office and tell them the same thing
in order to be removed from the residence
roles."
No Proof Required
Neither the Registrar nor the Associate
Dean of students require any proof of mar
riage in certifying that an undergraduate is
married. According to the Associate Dean of
Students Office the Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard are expected to be followed
in situations of that type.
It is still too early to tell how the Admini
stration is going to react to these two loop
holes in the Residence Regulation. If, how
ever, you are an undergraduate woman miss
ing a roommate, do not be alarmed.
