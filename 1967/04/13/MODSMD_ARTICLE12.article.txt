# Penn U. Continues Defense Contracts
## 
### 
(CPS) — Spice Rack and
Summit, the University of Pen
nsylvania's chemical and bio
logical warfare research proj
ects, are on again — but now
they have a new site.
University president Gaylord
Harnwell had previously an
nounced that the contracts for
the Air Force and Army proj
ects would be allowed to lapse
in March, 1968.
Campus Protest
This week, Harnwell said the
projects, which have been the
subject of campus demonstra
tions since October, 1965, would
be moved to the University City
Science Center by July of this
year.
And Harnwell admitted that
the University had signed an
unpublicized agreement last
January extending the Spice
Rack contract until March, 1969.
Harnwell denied that the action
had been intentionally secretive.
The University of Pennsyl
vania owns a majority of the
stock in the Science Center,
which is operated jointly by 19
educational institutions, but
Penn has only four of the 46
seats on the Center's board of
directors.
Continued Contracts
Science Center executive vice
president Jean Paul Mather told
the Daily Pennsylvanlan that
"the Center is an independent
corporate citizen of the U.S.,
and we plan to be taking De
fense Department contracts
from now until doomsday."
The two projects originally

came under the supervision of
Penn's Institute for Cooperative
Research, an interdisciplinary
center established in 1954 and
disbanded last fall.
Members of Penn's Commit
tee on Implementing Research
Policy were reported ready to
resign because Harnwell had
not consulted them about the
extension of the contracts.
Extension Agreement
Stated Harnwell, "Our advice
from the Steering Committee of
the University Council had been
to discontinue both projects. We
assumed their instructions to
mean that we should discon
tinue them by whatever means
we deemed appropriate."
He said that "we didn't feel
that we had been instructed to
consult any committee in our
efforts to transfer the projects,
and we thought in January that
signing the extension agree
ment was the best way of facili
tating the transfer."
