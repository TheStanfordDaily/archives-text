Oregon State University will
lose university recognition un
less they are completely free of
outside interference in selecting
members.
University of Oregon presi
dpnt Arthur S. Flemming and
Oregon State president James
Jensen told Oregon's State
Board of Higher Education that
the only way to enforce the
board's policy against discrimi
nation in Greek houses is to
have no interference by na
tional organizations in local se
lection of members.
Documentary Change
Although fraternities and so
rorities have had to sign pled
ges of local non-discrimination,
they have not been made to
pledge that they were free from

outside approval by national or
local alumni.
Due to this situation, Flem
ming told the Oregon Daily
Emerald, Greek houses have
been able to discriminate even
though they had no constitu
tional clause prohibiting mem
bership by minority group mem
bers.
Flemming said that the Uni
versity of Oregon's policy will
be to give the national body of
each Greek organization until
"the beginning of the academic
year following the first oppor
tunity" they have "to bring
their basic documents into har
mony with this statement."
No Outside Interference
Both Fleming and Jensen
made it clear that local chap
ters could still consult with out
side persons, but that the final
decision must rest with the lo
cal organization.
