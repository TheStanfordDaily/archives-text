### BRUCE MERRY 
Once upon a time there was
a pretty girl who married a pub
licity-conscious man. She travel
led all over the world getting
photographed at premieres and
gala performances wherever
they might Dp.'.;
she became-a star, wrth star
status and all that it entails.
But Raquel (for that was her
name) was a sad star, because
nobody would give her a movie
to star in.
Then one day along came Mr.
Big T'-ne and asked Raquel to
star in his films. She was a real
star at last! And the combined
talents of Hammer and R.
Welch are now on display in
One Million Years B.C.
Alluring Scream
One Million Years B.C. is a
vehicle for Miss Raquel Welch.
In this remake of an old '30s
movie, two things are required
for her: she must scream and
SCREAM, and look nudely al
luring.
My main complaint is that
there is too much more to her
than meets the eye. And our
ideal cave-woman can't scream
too well, either. But enough of
such reveries: this highly edu
cational film taught me that one
million years B.C. there were
two types of species Homo Sa
piens (pronounce it "man"). The
brunettes were wild and woolly
and definitely not, as yet, comme
11 faut.
The blondes, on the other
hand, had already discovered
the meaning of personal fresh
ness and had invented Culture,
though not, as yet, the wheel.
Good Form
John Richardson is a shaggy
brunette. He falls foul of his
chief and is driven forth into

the wilderness. After adventures
with a giant lizard, a bronto
saurus and a monstrous mock
turtle, he is rescued by the
blondes (especially Miss R.
Welch).
But having no notion of good
form, he is driven out in turn
by the iblOndes. And Raquel
goes with him.
Hero and heroine return to
find the brunettes in a state of
political upheaval. The plot and
Raquel get rather involved —
.Raquel with a pterodactyl —
and finally blondes and brunet
tes come to blows.
Geological Mockery
But before battle has prop
erly commenced, six volcanoes
erupt and the ground splits
asunder. Man's futile conflicts,

thus mocked by the immensity
of Nature, wind up the movie
MEANINGFULLY in black and
white. The survivors pick them
selves up, dust themselves down
and then start all over again.
All this should act as a som
ber reminder that the folly of
war may lead today to a holo
caust far more terrible than
the battle of the blondes and
the brunettes. Vive cinema, ver
ite and plastic rocks!
With monsters so magnifi
cently monstrous and a cast so
touchingly enthusiastic, I defy
anyone not to enjoy this cine
matic corn classic. But one thing
still puzzles me. Why do the
titles feel obliged to state that
any similarity with living per
sons is purely coincidental?

than meets the eye. And our
ideal cave-woman can't scream
too well, either. But enough of
such reveries: this highly edu
cational film taught me that one
million years B.C. there were
two types of species Homo Sa
piens (pronounce it "man"). The
brunettes were wild and woolly
and definitely not, as yet, comme
11 faut.
The blondes, on the other
hand, had already discovered
the meaning of personal fresh
ness and had invented Culture,
though not, as yet, the wheel.
Good Form
John Richardson is a shaggy
brunette. He falls foul of his
chief and is driven forth into

the wilderness. After adventures
with a giant lizard, a bronto
saurus and a monstrous mock
turtle, he is rescued by the
blondes (especially Miss R.
Welch).
But having no notion of good
form, he is driven out in turn
by the iblOndes. And Raquel
goes with him.
Hero and heroine return to
find the brunettes in a state of
political upheaval. The plot and
Raquel get rather involved —
.Raquel with a pterodactyl —
and finally blondes and brunet
tes come to blows.
Geological Mockery
But before battle has prop
erly commenced, six volcanoes
erupt and the ground splits
asunder. Man's futile conflicts,

thus mocked by the immensity
of Nature, wind up the movie
MEANINGFULLY in black and
white. The survivors pick them
selves up, dust themselves down
and then start all over again.
All this should act as a som
ber reminder that the folly of
war may lead today to a holo
caust far more terrible than
the battle of the blondes and
the brunettes. Vive cinema, ver
ite and plastic rocks!
With monsters so magnifi
cently monstrous and a cast so
touchingly enthusiastic, I defy
anyone not to enjoy this cine
matic corn classic. But one thing
still puzzles me. Why do the
titles feel obliged to state that
any similarity with living per
sons is purely coincidental?
Once upon a time there was
a pretty girl who married a pub
licity-conscious man. She travel
led all over the world getting
photographed at premieres and
gala performances wherever
they might Dp.'.;
she became-a star, wrth star
status and all that it entails.
But Raquel (for that was her
name) was a sad star, because
nobody would give her a movie
to star in.
Then one day along came Mr.
Big T'-ne and asked Raquel to
star in his films. She was a real
star at last! And the combined
talents of Hammer and R.
Welch are now on display in
One Million Years B.C.
Alluring Scream
One Million Years B.C. is a
vehicle for Miss Raquel Welch.
In this remake of an old '30s
movie, two things are required
for her: she must scream and
SCREAM, and look nudely al
luring.
My main complaint is that
there is too much more to her
than meets the eye. And our
ideal cave-woman can't scream
too well, either. But enough of
