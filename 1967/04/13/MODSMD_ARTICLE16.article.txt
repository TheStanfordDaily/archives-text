# Austrian Diplomat Here
## 
### 
The State Secretary for Social
Affairs of Austria visited the
campus yesterday on one leg
of a journey which has so far
taken him half way around the
world. Before he returns to
Vienna, Dr. Carl Gruber will
have visited Tokyo, Honolulu
and six cities in the continental
United States and Canada, in
cluding Washington.
In an interview with The
Daily, Dr. Gruber said the rea
son for his visit is to encourage
more ties between Austria and
the American communities of
business and government. Yes
terday he met with faculty and
administration officials here, and
toured the campus and the Lin
ear Accelerator. He also spoke
to the World Affairs Council of
Northern California and the San
Francisco Committee on For
eign Relations. Today he will
meet with San Francisco busi
nessmen.
Common Market
Speaking of Austria's position
in the affairs of Europe, Dr.
Gruber stated that his country
was very desirous of entering
the Common Market. He said
difficulties in this regard arose
because Austria wants to main
tain its close trading ties with
the countries of Eastern Europe,
which now account for more
than half its foreign trade.
Austria, governed by a neu
tralist coalition government un
til recently, is now governed by
a single party which is anxious
to maintain its neutral position.
For this reason, Dr. Gruber
said, Austria has refused to take
sides in the Vietnam war crisis,
although it has received pres
sure from both sides to do so.
He added that Austria officially
takes a conservative, reserved
attitude towards all East-West
controversies, and that "trade
should never be governed by po
litical alliances."
Attitude Changes
As to East-West relations, Dr.
Gruber said that the process of

moving together can be attri
buted to changes in attitude on
both sides. In America, he noted,
the people are less "tense" about
East European Communist re
gimes than they have been in
the past. And in Eastern Eu
rope, the people are beginning
to have consumer goods avail
able, a fact which produces
changes in attitude toward Com
munist ideology .
Dr. Gruber made a careful dis
tinction between "Communism"
and "militant Communism." The
latter, he said, must be fought
where it threatens neighboring
states. Otherwise, he said, one
country should not interfere in
the internal affairs of another.
The recent demonstrations in
Europe against Vice President
Humphrey were, according to
Dr. Gruber, highly overrated in
the American press. He said the
demonstrators represented "a
very small minority."
