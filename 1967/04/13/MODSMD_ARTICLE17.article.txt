# HUAC Blasts Mobilization
## 
### 
(CPS)—The House Commit
tee on Un-American Activities
(HUAC) has charged that Com
munists have dominated the
planning of anti-war demonstra
tions to be held April 8-15.
In a report titled "Communist
Origin and Manipulation of Viet
Nam Week," HUAC claimed
that the Spring Mobilization for
Peace was "a crash program to
resistance to Communist mili
tary aggression in Viet Nam."
Rev. James Bevel, a former
aid to Dr. Martin Luther King
and the dirctor of the ihobiliza
tion, said that committee mem
bers were "liars" and "spread
ers of trash."
Not All Communists
Committee chairman Edwin
E. Willis, Jr. (D-La.), writing in

the foreword to the report, stat
ed that HUAC was not trying
"to stifle honest and legitimate
dissent."
Willis said that the mention
of an individual's name in the
report does not mean that, in the
eyes of HUAC, "they are Com
munists or knowingly aiding
and abetting the purposes of the
world Communist movement or
any of the organizations named
in this report."
In a related event, Federal Bu
reau of Investigation Director
J. Edgar Hoover charged that
"morality, integrity, law and or
der" are "under constant attack
from degrading and corrupting
influences which, if not halted,
will sweep away every vestage
of decency and orderliness re
maining in our society."
"Poisonous" Literature
The FBI director stated, "We

should be alarmed when some
groups, under the guise of aca
demic freedom and constitution
al privilege, flood our college
campuses with obscene four-let
ter-word campaigns and porno
graphic publications which vio
late all codes of ethics."
Hoover attacked the contro
versial play "Macßird," stating
that "we should be alarmed
when widespread recognition
and monetary awards go to a
person who writes a "satirical"
piece of trash which maliciously
defames the President of our
country and insinuates he mur
dered his predecessor."
Said the FBI director, "Let us
stop deifying offbeat dolts whose
ability is measured only by how
deep they can dip their poison
ous pens into the pots of blas
phemy, filth, and falsehood."

person who writes a "satirical"
piece of trash which maliciously
defames the President of our
country and insinuates he mur
dered his predecessor."
Said the FBI director, "Let us
stop deifying offbeat dolts whose
ability is measured only by how
deep they can dip their poison
ous pens into the pots of blas
phemy, filth, and falsehood."
(CPS)—The House Commit
tee on Un-American Activities
(HUAC) has charged that Com
munists have dominated the
planning of anti-war demonstra
tions to be held April 8-15.
In a report titled "Communist
Origin and Manipulation of Viet
Nam Week," HUAC claimed
that the Spring Mobilization for
Peace was "a crash program to
resistance to Communist mili
tary aggression in Viet Nam."
Rev. James Bevel, a former
aid to Dr. Martin Luther King
and the dirctor of the ihobiliza
tion, said that committee mem
bers were "liars" and "spread
ers of trash."
Not All Communists
Committee chairman Edwin
E. Willis, Jr. (D-La.), writing in

the foreword to the report, stat
ed that HUAC was not trying
"to stifle honest and legitimate
dissent."
Willis said that the mention
of an individual's name in the
report does not mean that, in the
eyes of HUAC, "they are Com
munists or knowingly aiding
and abetting the purposes of the
world Communist movement or
any of the organizations named
in this report."
In a related event, Federal Bu
reau of Investigation Director
J. Edgar Hoover charged that
"morality, integrity, law and or
der" are "under constant attack
from degrading and corrupting
influences which, if not halted,
will sweep away every vestage
of decency and orderliness re
maining in our society."
"Poisonous" Literature
The FBI director stated, "We

should be alarmed when some
groups, under the guise of aca
demic freedom and constitution
al privilege, flood our college
campuses with obscene four-let
ter-word campaigns and porno
graphic publications which vio
late all codes of ethics."
Hoover attacked the contro
versial play "Macßird," stating
that "we should be alarmed
when widespread recognition
and monetary awards go to a
person who writes a "satirical"
piece of trash which maliciously
defames the President of our
country and insinuates he mur
dered his predecessor."
Said the FBI director, "Let us
stop deifying offbeat dolts whose
ability is measured only by how
deep they can dip their poison
ous pens into the pots of blas
phemy, filth, and falsehood."
