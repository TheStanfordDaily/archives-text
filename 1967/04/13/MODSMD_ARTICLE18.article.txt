# Kerr Cites Anti-Intellectualism

### 
(CPS) — American students
may become as militant as their
fellows overseas in the quest for
"student power," according to
former University of California
president Clark Kerr.
In an interview to be published
in the April 18 issue of LOOK
magazine, Kerr stated, "It could
happen, and has happened in a
number of countries ... a nation
al student union would stand out
side and bargain with the uni
versity administration."
Kerr said he "would prefer to
see students participate from the
inside . . . than see them func
tion as opponents of the cam
pus." But the former California
administrator admitted "that if
we fail to solve our internal
problems, we may see the growth
of national student unions as
militant" as those in such coun
tries as France, India, and Ja
pan.
Fear of Intellectuals
He added that certain segments
of the population have "a fear
of the younger generation and a

fear of the intellectuals."
Citing "the Red Guards in
China, and student revolution
aries in Indonesia, India, and
Latin America," Kerr queried,
'*Can you expect many adults not
to be nervous at what youth, with
its volatility and its large con
centrations on campuses, might
do to this nation?"
He said the gap between intel
lectuals and the government
over Vietnam and other matters
of interest to the educational
community has brought the pub
lic to question, "Where is youth
going, and where might the in
tellectuals want to lead it?"
Fired by the University of
California Regents with the ap
proval of Gov. Ronald Reagan,
Kerr claimed that Reagan and
others in California politics have

raised the fear of intellectuals
"to almost epidemic propor
tions."
U.C. Faculty Unrest
A recent regents meeting
brought warnings from the nine
University of California campus
es that the faculty of the schools
was biding time and that another
year of uncertainty from either
the regents of Reagan would
most likely cause a large num
ber of professor to leave the Cali
fornia system.
Berkeley chancellor Roger
Heyns said he was "relying on
the historical basis of state sup
port" in convincing faculty mem
bers to remain. But he warned
that "it is taking a prodigious
amount of effort—and faith."
Pay Declines
A poll conducted by the Amer

ican Association of University
Professors (AAUP) recently
showed the University of Califor
nia 42nd in the nation in pay
rates for full professors.
In previous years, the Califor
nia system had rated in the top
ten in terms of pay. UCLA vice
chancellor Foster Sherwood said
the current ranking could "make
it difficult" to attract new pro
fessors.
Sherwood said budget cuts pro
posed by Reagan could deter
professors from coming to Cali
fornia because of the "bad pub
licity" involved.
However, Sherwood has no
knowledge at present of the num
ber of professors planning to
leave the California university
system.

was biding time and that another
year of uncertainty from either
the regents of Reagan would
most likely cause a large num
ber of professor to leave the Cali
fornia system.
Berkeley chancellor Roger
Heyns said he was "relying on
the historical basis of state sup
port" in convincing faculty mem
bers to remain. But he warned
that "it is taking a prodigious
amount of effort—and faith."
Pay Declines
A poll conducted by the Amer

ican Association of University
Professors (AAUP) recently
showed the University of Califor
nia 42nd in the nation in pay
rates for full professors.
In previous years, the Califor
nia system had rated in the top
ten in terms of pay. UCLA vice
chancellor Foster Sherwood said
the current ranking could "make
it difficult" to attract new pro
fessors.
Sherwood said budget cuts pro
posed by Reagan could deter
professors from coming to Cali
fornia because of the "bad pub
licity" involved.
However, Sherwood has no
knowledge at present of the num
ber of professors planning to
leave the California university
system.
(CPS) — American students
may become as militant as their
fellows overseas in the quest for
"student power," according to
former University of California
president Clark Kerr.
In an interview to be published
in the April 18 issue of LOOK
magazine, Kerr stated, "It could
happen, and has happened in a
number of countries ... a nation
al student union would stand out
side and bargain with the uni
versity administration."
Kerr said he "would prefer to
see students participate from the
inside . . . than see them func
tion as opponents of the cam
pus." But the former California
administrator admitted "that if
we fail to solve our internal
problems, we may see the growth
of national student unions as
militant" as those in such coun
tries as France, India, and Ja
pan.
Fear of Intellectuals
He added that certain segments
of the population have "a fear
of the younger generation and a

fear of the intellectuals."
Citing "the Red Guards in
China, and student revolution
aries in Indonesia, India, and
Latin America," Kerr queried,
'*Can you expect many adults not
to be nervous at what youth, with
its volatility and its large con
centrations on campuses, might
do to this nation?"
He said the gap between intel
lectuals and the government
over Vietnam and other matters
of interest to the educational
community has brought the pub
lic to question, "Where is youth
going, and where might the in
tellectuals want to lead it?"
Fired by the University of
California Regents with the ap
proval of Gov. Ronald Reagan,
Kerr claimed that Reagan and
others in California politics have

raised the fear of intellectuals
"to almost epidemic propor
tions."
U.C. Faculty Unrest
A recent regents meeting
brought warnings from the nine

fornia system.
