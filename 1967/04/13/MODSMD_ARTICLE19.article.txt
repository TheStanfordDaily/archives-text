# Faculty Criticizes Required Courses
## 
### 
Students entering Stanford
should be offered a greater varie
ty of ways to meet University re
quirements for general educa
tion, several professors suggest
ed at a faculty meeting of the
School of Humanities and Scien
ces last Monday.
Prof. Konrad B. Krauskopf, a
member of the National Acad
emy of Sciences, said he felt the
University is no longer justified
in requiring all students to take
courses both in biology and the
physical sciences, either in high
school or at Stanford.
Freer Choice of Science Coursen
"Improvements in high school
education since Sputnik have
greatly increased the exposure of
students to these subjects, he
said. Students should have a
freer choice of science courses at
the university level.
Appearing by invitation, he
also expressed the hope that
Stanford could institute a wider
selection of science courses for
the non-science major. Possible
topics of this order would include
the history of science, political
implication of science, or the re
lationship between science and
engineering.
"Forty years of talking and
writing on this subject have pro
duced remarkably little factual
information," he c o m m en ted.
"The only conclusion I've
reached is that our freshman stu
dents cover a wide spectrum and
it would be a great mistake to
try to prescribe a single means
for meeting their needs."
Questions Requirement
Other faculty members raised
similar questions about nearly
all the general studies require
ments. Philosophy Prof. John D.
Goheen suggested that a few en
tering students might be permit
ted to take Eastern Civilization
instead of Western Civ., for ex

ample, provided appropriate
ways could be found to meet
state requirements for education
in the U.S. Constitution and Cali
fornia history and government.
Physics Prof. Leonard Schiff
said that "straight department
courses probably are not the best
approach" for non-science ma
jors, but emphasized the need to
develop constructive alternatives,
possibly drawing from several
disciplines.
"Great Feeling of Discontent"
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Robert Sears said years of dis
cussion about science courses for
non-science majors reflected a
"great feeling of discontent"
with in the general studies com
mittee. But lack of agreement on
alternatives has delayed change.
"Instead of looking for one so
lution, we probably have to look
for several," he commented.
English Prof. Thomas Moser
said, "The unity of the freshman
year we used to think was so im
portant has tended now to be
come a straightjacket."
French Prof. Lee Weinsten em
phasized the need for the faculty
to think through its basic con
cept of what constitutes a well
educated person, determine who
shall set standards for education,
and then devise different ways to
satisfy academic requirements.
Need Simpler Requirements
Informal comments by several
others expressed hope that a
more simplified system would re
place what one called the "jerry
built structure" of course re
quirements.
The faculty voted without dis
sent to establish a small commit
tee to study general education.
Their action was welcomed by
Prof. Herbert Packer, steering
committee chairman of the Study
of Education at Stanford.,'

quirements for general educa
tion, several professors suggest
ed at a faculty meeting of the
School of Humanities and Scien
ces last Monday.
Prof. Konrad B. Krauskopf, a
member of the National Acad
emy of Sciences, said he felt the
University is no longer justified
in requiring all students to take
courses both in biology and the
physical sciences, either in high
school or at Stanford.
Freer Choice of Science Coursen
"Improvements in high school
education since Sputnik have
greatly increased the exposure of
students to these subjects, he
said. Students should have a
freer choice of science courses at
the university level.
Appearing by invitation, he
also expressed the hope that
Stanford could institute a wider
selection of science courses for
the non-science major. Possible
topics of this order would include
the history of science, political
implication of science, or the re
lationship between science and
engineering.
"Forty years of talking and
writing on this subject have pro
duced remarkably little factual
information," he c o m m en ted.
"The only conclusion I've
reached is that our freshman stu
dents cover a wide spectrum and
it would be a great mistake to
try to prescribe a single means
for meeting their needs."
Questions Requirement
Other faculty members raised
similar questions about nearly
all the general studies require
ments. Philosophy Prof. John D.
Goheen suggested that a few en
tering students might be permit
ted to take Eastern Civilization
instead of Western Civ., for ex

ample, provided appropriate
ways could be found to meet
state requirements for education
in the U.S. Constitution and Cali
fornia history and government.
Physics Prof. Leonard Schiff
said that "straight department
courses probably are not the best
approach" for non-science ma
jors, but emphasized the need to
develop constructive alternatives,
possibly drawing from several
disciplines.
"Great Feeling of Discontent"
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Robert Sears said years of dis
cussion about science courses for
non-science majors reflected a
"great feeling of discontent"
with in the general studies com
mittee. But lack of agreement on
alternatives has delayed change.
"Instead of looking for one so
lution, we probably have to look
for several," he commented.
English Prof. Thomas Moser
said, "The unity of the freshman
year we used to think was so im
portant has tended now to be
come a straightjacket."
French Prof. Lee Weinsten em
phasized the need for the faculty
to think through its basic con
cept of what constitutes a well
educated person, determine who
shall set standards for education,
and then devise different ways to
satisfy academic requirements.
Need Simpler Requirements
Informal comments by several
others expressed hope that a
more simplified system would re
place what one called the "jerry
built structure" of course re
quirements.
The faculty voted without dis
sent to establish a small commit
tee to study general education.
Their action was welcomed by
Prof. Herbert Packer, steering
committee chairman of the Study
of Education at Stanford.,'
