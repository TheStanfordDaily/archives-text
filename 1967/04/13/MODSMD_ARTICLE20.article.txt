# Oregon Student Body Leader Drafted After Renouncing 2S
## 
### 
David Harris has a kindred
spirit. Henry Drummonds, the
student body president of the
University of Oregon, who gave
up his student draft deferment
last October, has been drafted.
Harris, who also returned his
deferment to his board, has been
reclassified 1-Y, temporarily un
fit for service.
Drummonds, who opposes the
War in Vietnam and the present
draft system, reported for in
duction last Tuesday. He would
have graduated in June.
Drummonds said last week
that he had no comment "at this
time" on his induction. He said
last October that he would not
ask for a student deferment be
cause it is "morally wrong for
young working men to be con
scripted to fight and perhaps die
in a major war while college
students continue to enjoy their
civilian lives."
He calls the war in Vietnam
"misguided," but, he said last
October, "as iong as my govern
ment and society must call upon
young Americans to kill and be
killed, I cannot in good faith

continue to accept an exemption
from that burden."
While serving as student body
president, Drummond's policies
displayed a similarity to the pro
grams of Stanford's ex-student
body president. Both fought for
educational reform in their re
spective universities, including
pass - fail options for students
and faculty evaluation pro
grams; both were outspoken
critics of the selective living
process inherent in fraternities.
