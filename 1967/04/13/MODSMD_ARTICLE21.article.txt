(London School of Economics

ed of an ideal University. Six
days later, as we go to press,

seminars and evening celebra

This is an excerpt from Inter
national Times, an "under
ground" newspaper in London.
Perhaps it is the fairest press
coverage of the events which
took place at the London School
of Economics during the week
of March 13-20, 1967. During
this time, students of the LSE
occupied two of the buildings
of the School continuously, in
protest of the suspension of two
elected student leaders. The
measures taken against the two
by the School authorities were
labelled "victimization of elected
representatives" in punishment
of an act of disobedience which
had been committed by the stu
dent body as a whole, and which
had been committed as an asser
tion of "free speech" and "stu
dents' rights."
Open University
These terms began to have
real meaning for nearly all the
students at LSE in the context
of the events which had led up
to the week of March 13. The
meanings of these and other
ideas were under discussion 24
hours a day at LSE during that
week, and in an earnest effort
to apply some of these ideals,
the students of LSE as a Union
physically confronted the
"School" — the unchanging au
thority and administrative struc
ture. Out of this grew a quieter
and more constructive confron
tation — an Open University,
a harbor for the discovery and
development of the ideas which
question the validity of this in
stitution. The future of the
Open University is by no defini
tion certain, but another thing
is certain; the students of LSE
have provided themselves with a
precedent, and have a commit
ment to realize their ideals; the
new concept of education may
soon be reflected by changes in

the stiff, 19th century organiza
tions of the institutions of high
er learning in England.
Objction to Dirctor
In the summer of 1966 it was
announced that Dr. Walter Ad
ams, president of the University
College of Rhodesia, had been
appointed to replace the present
direetor, Sir Sydney Caine, in
the fall of 1967. Those LSE stu
dents who had not already done
so familiarized themslves with
recent developments at UCR,
which had been the subject of
reports by Amnesty Internation
al, the Intrnational Students'
Conference, and a group of 55
UCR lecturers. It became clear
that Dr. Adams was unaccept
able to the students as their new
Director. The controversy
warmed up with discussions and
meetings. In the fall quarter,
Director Caine ruled that nei
ther the name of the Students'
Union, the official students' or
ganization, nor its officers could
be used in communication with
the press. The ruling was
promptly violated by the Union.
The president of the Union, Da
vid Adelstein, was called before
a Board of Discipline and found
guilty of disobeying the Direc
tor's order, which is contrary to
Rule 1. No sentence was given.
This action was protested by
the Union by a one-day sit-in
and boycott of classes on No
vember 21. The sit-in and boy
cott was supported by most of
the students and some of the
academic staff. The same day,
the Union passed a resolution
calling for immediate changes
in the rules under which Adel
stein was prosecuted. Discus
sion at the meeting showed the
disagreement between those
who desired a moderate, quiet
course of action and those who
wanted the Union to take a
more direct, stronger stand.
A few days later Sir Sydney
Caine delivered a statement, in
dicating that he was in favor of

a complete review of the School
Regulations, but asking stu
dents to recognize that due to
the size and complexity of the
organization, changes could not
be dramatic or sudden. After
the Christmas break, the Adams
controversy was resumed, with
much of the initiative provided
by Marshall Bloom, an Ameri
can student and recently elected
president of the Graduate Stu
dents' Association. A meeting
was scheduled for Tuesday, Jan
uary 31, in the Old Theater of
the School, for the purpose of
discussing "ways of opposing
Dr. Adams." The Director ob
served a sample of notices that
were circulating about the meet
ing. The wording of the notice
mentioned "direct action," and
the Director decided that such a
meeting would be improper. He
informed Bloom that the meet
ing scheduled for the Old Thea
ter was banned. Bloom in turn
informed members of the Union
Council, who then called an
emergncy meeting. Evidently
the meeting was very confused
but came to the decision that the
meeting should lake place in de
fiance of the ban. Arrangments
were made for a microphone in

the students' Bar. However,
leaflets were shortly circulating
headed by "Caine Bans Free
Speech" in large letters, and
calling for a cointinuation of
plans to meet in the Old Thea
ter.
Death Ends Demonstration
A large crowd had gathered in
the entrance hall of the building
containing the Old Theater by
the scheduled time. A number
of porters were standing at the
doors of the Old Theater to pre
vent access. Bloom tried to
bring the crowd to order, and ex
plained that the student Bar had
been fitted with a microphone
so the meeting could be held
there. But no one left. The Di
rector appeared and reasserted
the ban on the use of the Old
Theater. Bloom then tried to
take a vote on whether to stay
in the foyer or move to the Bar,
but several students were shout
ing, "The Old Theater or the
Bar!" Then Adelstein arrived,
and at first suggsted that every
body go to the Bar. No one left.
After some confusion, Adelstein
put the three alternatives to a
vote, and the group voted to
force entrance to the Old Thea
ter. Studenis started pushing
their way past the porters. The

incident was ended when one of
the porters, who had not been
detailed to watch the doors but
had come to help on his own,
had a heart attack and shortly
died.
It was quickly made clear that
no one could be held responsible
for the porter's death. But six
students were called before the
Board of Discipline, including
Adelstein and Bloom. Again,
some members of the Union
called for strong student reac
tion in protest of this, and were
disappointed by the Union's de
cision to await the outcome of
the hearing. The proceedings
dragged on for weeks, with long
recesses.

the LSE Incident will be con

direetor, Sir Sydney Caine, in
the fall of 1967. Those LSE stu
dents who had not already done
so familiarized themslves with
recent developments at UCR,
which had been the subject of
reports by Amnesty Internation
al, the Intrnational Students'
Conference, and a group of 55
UCR lecturers. It became clear
that Dr. Adams was unaccept
able to the students as their new
Director. The controversy
warmed up with discussions and
meetings. In the fall quarter,
Director Caine ruled that nei
ther the name of the Students'
Union, the official students' or
ganization, nor its officers could
be used in communication with
the press. The ruling was
promptly violated by the Union.
The president of the Union, Da
vid Adelstein, was called before
a Board of Discipline and found
guilty of disobeying the Direc
tor's order, which is contrary to
Rule 1. No sentence was given.
This action was protested by
the Union by a one-day sit-in
and boycott of classes on No
vember 21. The sit-in and boy
cott was supported by most of
the students and some of the
academic staff. The same day,
the Union passed a resolution
calling for immediate changes
in the rules under which Adel
stein was prosecuted. Discus
sion at the meeting showed the
disagreement between those
who desired a moderate, quiet
course of action and those who
wanted the Union to take a
more direct, stronger stand.
A few days later Sir Sydney
Caine delivered a statement, in
dicating that he was in favor of

a complete review of the School
Regulations, but asking stu
dents to recognize that due to
the size and complexity of the
organization, changes could not
be dramatic or sudden. After
the Christmas break, the Adams
controversy was resumed, with
much of the initiative provided
by Marshall Bloom, an Ameri
can student and recently elected
president of the Graduate Stu
dents' Association. A meeting
was scheduled for Tuesday, Jan
uary 31, in the Old Theater of
the School, for the purpose of
discussing "ways of opposing
Dr. Adams." The Director ob
served a sample of notices that
were circulating about the meet
ing. The wording of the notice
mentioned "direct action," and
the Director decided that such a
meeting would be improper. He
informed Bloom that the meet
ing scheduled for the Old Thea
ter was banned. Bloom in turn
informed members of the Union
Council, who then called an
emergncy meeting. Evidently
the meeting was very confused
but came to the decision that the
meeting should lake place in de
fiance of the ban. Arrangments
were made for a microphone in

the students' Bar. However,
leaflets were shortly circulating
headed by "Caine Bans Free
Speech" in large letters, and
calling for a cointinuation of
plans to meet in the Old Thea
ter.
Death Ends Demonstration
A large crowd had gathered in
the entrance hall of the building
containing the Old Theater by
the scheduled time. A number
of porters were standing at the
doors of the Old Theater to pre
vent access. Bloom tried to
bring the crowd to order, and ex
plained that the student Bar had
been fitted with a microphone
so the meeting could be held
there. But no one left. The Di
rector appeared and reasserted
the ban on the use of the Old
Theater. Bloom then tried to
take a vote on whether to stay
in the foyer or move to the Bar,
but several students were shout
ing, "The Old Theater or the
Bar!" Then Adelstein arrived,
and at first suggsted that every
body go to the Bar. No one left.
After some confusion, Adelstein
put the three alternatives to a
vote, and the group voted to
force entrance to the Old Thea
ter. Studenis started pushing
their way past the porters. The

incident was ended when one of
the porters, who had not been
detailed to watch the doors but
had come to help on his own,
had a heart attack and shortly
died.
It was quickly made clear that
no one could be held responsible
for the porter's death. But six
students were called before the
Board of Discipline, including
Adelstein and Bloom. Again,
some members of the Union
called for strong student reac
tion in protest of this, and were
disappointed by the Union's de
cision to await the outcome of
the hearing. The proceedings
dragged on for weeks, with long
recesses.

were made for a microphone in

the students' Bar. However,
leaflets were shortly circulating
headed by "Caine Bans Free
Speech" in large letters, and
calling for a cointinuation of
plans to meet in the Old Thea
ter.
Death Ends Demonstration
A large crowd had gathered in
the entrance hall of the building
containing the Old Theater by
the scheduled time. A number
of porters were standing at the
doors of the Old Theater to pre
vent access. Bloom tried to
bring the crowd to order, and ex
plained that the student Bar had
been fitted with a microphone
so the meeting could be held
there. But no one left. The Di
rector appeared and reasserted
the ban on the use of the Old
Theater. Bloom then tried to
take a vote on whether to stay
in the foyer or move to the Bar,
but several students were shout
ing, "The Old Theater or the
Bar!" Then Adelstein arrived,
and at first suggsted that every
body go to the Bar. No one left.
After some confusion, Adelstein
put the three alternatives to a
vote, and the group voted to
force entrance to the Old Thea
ter. Studenis started pushing
their way past the porters. The

incident was ended when one of
the porters, who had not been
detailed to watch the doors but
had come to help on his own,
had a heart attack and shortly
died.
It was quickly made clear that
no one could be held responsible
for the porter's death. But six
students were called before the
Board of Discipline, including
Adelstein and Bloom. Again,
some members of the Union
called for strong student reac
tion in protest of this, and were
disappointed by the Union's de
cision to await the outcome of
the hearing. The proceedings
dragged on for weeks, with long
recesses.

Open University
These terms began to have
real meaning for nearly all the
students at LSE in the context
of the events which had led up
to the week of March 13. The
meanings of these and other
ideas were under discussion 24
hours a day at LSE during that
week, and in an earnest effort
to apply some of these ideals,
the students of LSE as a Union
physically confronted the
"School" — the unchanging au
thority and administrative struc
ture. Out of this grew a quieter
and more constructive confron
tation — an Open University,
a harbor for the discovery and
development of the ideas which
question the validity of this in
stitution. The future of the
Open University is by no defini
tion certain, but another thing
is certain; the students of LSE
have provided themselves with a
precedent, and have a commit
ment to realize their ideals; the
new concept of education may
soon be reflected by changes in

the stiff, 19th century organiza
tions of the institutions of high

Objction to Dirctor
In the summer of 1966 it was
announced that Dr. Walter Ad
ams, president of the University
College of Rhodesia, had been
appointed to replace the present
direetor, Sir Sydney Caine, in
the fall of 1967. Those LSE stu
dents who had not already done
so familiarized themslves with
recent developments at UCR,
which had been the subject of
reports by Amnesty Internation
al, the Intrnational Students'
Conference, and a group of 55
UCR lecturers. It became clear
that Dr. Adams was unaccept
able to the students as their new
Director. The controversy
warmed up with discussions and
meetings. In the fall quarter,
Director Caine ruled that nei
ther the name of the Students'
Union, the official students' or
ganization, nor its officers could
be used in communication with
the press. The ruling was
promptly violated by the Union.
The president of the Union, Da
vid Adelstein, was called before
a Board of Discipline and found
guilty of disobeying the Direc
tor's order, which is contrary to
Rule 1. No sentence was given.
This action was protested by
the Union by a one-day sit-in
and boycott of classes on No
vember 21. The sit-in and boy
cott was supported by most of
the students and some of the
academic staff. The same day,
the Union passed a resolution
calling for immediate changes
in the rules under which Adel
stein was prosecuted. Discus
sion at the meeting showed the
disagreement between those
who desired a moderate, quiet
course of action and those who
wanted the Union to take a
more direct, stronger stand.
A few days later Sir Sydney
Caine delivered a statement, in
dicating that he was in favor of

a complete review of the School
Regulations, but asking stu
dents to recognize that due to
the size and complexity of the
organization, changes could not
be dramatic or sudden. After
the Christmas break, the Adams
controversy was resumed, with
much of the initiative provided
by Marshall Bloom, an Ameri
can student and recently elected
president of the Graduate Stu
dents' Association. A meeting
was scheduled for Tuesday, Jan
uary 31, in the Old Theater of
the School, for the purpose of
discussing "ways of opposing
Dr. Adams." The Director ob
served a sample of notices that
were circulating about the meet
ing. The wording of the notice
mentioned "direct action," and
the Director decided that such a
meeting would be improper. He
informed Bloom that the meet
ing scheduled for the Old Thea
ter was banned. Bloom in turn
informed members of the Union
Council, who then called an
emergncy meeting. Evidently
the meeting was very confused
but came to the decision that the
meeting should lake place in de
fiance of the ban. Arrangments
were made for a microphone in

the students' Bar. However,

national Times, an "under
ground" newspaper in London.
Perhaps it is the fairest press
coverage of the events which
took place at the London School
of Economics during the week
of March 13-20, 1967. During
this time, students of the LSE
occupied two of the buildings
of the School continuously, in
protest of the suspension of two
elected student leaders. The
measures taken against the two
by the School authorities were
labelled "victimization of elected
representatives" in punishment
of an act of disobedience which
had been committed by the stu
dent body as a whole, and which
had been committed as an asser
tion of "free speech" and "stu
dents' rights."
Open University
These terms began to have
real meaning for nearly all the
students at LSE in the context
of the events which had led up
to the week of March 13. The
meanings of these and other
ideas were under discussion 24
hours a day at LSE during that
week, and in an earnest effort
to apply some of these ideals,
the students of LSE as a Union
physically confronted the
"School" — the unchanging au
thority and administrative struc
ture. Out of this grew a quieter
and more constructive confron
tation — an Open University,
a harbor for the discovery and
development of the ideas which
question the validity of this in
stitution. The future of the
Open University is by no defini
tion certain, but another thing
is certain; the students of LSE
have provided themselves with a
precedent, and have a commit
ment to realize their ideals; the
new concept of education may
soon be reflected by changes in

the stiff, 19th century organiza
tions of the institutions of high
er learning in England.
Objction to Dirctor
In the summer of 1966 it was
announced that Dr. Walter Ad
ams, president of the University
College of Rhodesia, had been
appointed to replace the present
direetor, Sir Sydney Caine, in
the fall of 1967. Those LSE stu
dents who had not already done
so familiarized themslves with
recent developments at UCR,
which had been the subject of
reports by Amnesty Internation
al, the Intrnational Students'
Conference, and a group of 55
UCR lecturers. It became clear
that Dr. Adams was unaccept
able to the students as their new
Director. The controversy
warmed up with discussions and
meetings. In the fall quarter,
Director Caine ruled that nei
ther the name of the Students'
Union, the official students' or
ganization, nor its officers could
be used in communication with
the press. The ruling was
promptly violated by the Union.
The president of the Union, Da
vid Adelstein, was called before
a Board of Discipline and found
guilty of disobeying the Direc
tor's order, which is contrary to
Rule 1. No sentence was given.
This action was protested by
the Union by a one-day sit-in
and boycott of classes on No
vember 21. The sit-in and boy
cott was supported by most of
the students and some of the
academic staff. The same day,
the Union passed a resolution
calling for immediate changes
in the rules under which Adel
stein was prosecuted. Discus
sion at the meeting showed the
disagreement between those
who desired a moderate, quiet
course of action and those who
wanted the Union to take a
more direct, stronger stand.
A few days later Sir Sydney
Caine delivered a statement, in
dicating that he was in favor of

a complete review of the School
Regulations, but asking stu
dents to recognize that due to
the size and complexity of the
organization, changes could not
be dramatic or sudden. After
the Christmas break, the Adams
controversy was resumed, with
much of the initiative provided
by Marshall Bloom, an Ameri
can student and recently elected
president of the Graduate Stu
dents' Association. A meeting
was scheduled for Tuesday, Jan
uary 31, in the Old Theater of
the School, for the purpose of
discussing "ways of opposing
Dr. Adams." The Director ob
served a sample of notices that
were circulating about the meet
ing. The wording of the notice
mentioned "direct action," and
the Director decided that such a
meeting would be improper. He
informed Bloom that the meet
ing scheduled for the Old Thea
ter was banned. Bloom in turn
informed members of the Union
Council, who then called an
emergncy meeting. Evidently
the meeting was very confused
but came to the decision that the
meeting should lake place in de
fiance of the ban. Arrangments
were made for a microphone in

the students' Bar. However,
leaflets were shortly circulating
headed by "Caine Bans Free
Speech" in large letters, and
calling for a cointinuation of
plans to meet in the Old Thea
ter.
Death Ends Demonstration
A large crowd had gathered in
the entrance hall of the building
containing the Old Theater by
the scheduled time. A number
of porters were standing at the
doors of the Old Theater to pre
vent access. Bloom tried to
bring the crowd to order, and ex
plained that the student Bar had
been fitted with a microphone
so the meeting could be held
there. But no one left. The Di
rector appeared and reasserted
the ban on the use of the Old
Theater. Bloom then tried to
take a vote on whether to stay
in the foyer or move to the Bar,
but several students were shout
ing, "The Old Theater or the
Bar!" Then Adelstein arrived,
and at first suggsted that every
body go to the Bar. No one left.
After some confusion, Adelstein
put the three alternatives to a
vote, and the group voted to
force entrance to the Old Thea
ter. Studenis started pushing
their way past the porters. The

incident was ended when one of
the porters, who had not been
detailed to watch the doors but
had come to help on his own,
had a heart attack and shortly
died.
It was quickly made clear that
no one could be held responsible
for the porter's death. But six
students were called before the
Board of Discipline, including
Adelstein and Bloom. Again,
some members of the Union
called for strong student reac
tion in protest of this, and were
disappointed by the Union's de
cision to await the outcome of
the hearing. The proceedings
dragged on for weeks, with long
recesses.

the LSE Incident will be con
