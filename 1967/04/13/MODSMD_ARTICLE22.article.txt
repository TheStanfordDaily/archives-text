# Athletic Recruiting
## Some Answers To: Why Recruiting?

"Is athletic recruiting necessary?"
Without exception, the coaches of football, basketball, and swim
ming state that they would be unable to get top student-athletes, in
a majority of cases, to come to Stanford without recruiting. As
Howie Dallmar puts it, a boy will feel "unwanted" if the school
doesn't show interest in him becaus the top student-athletes are
sought by everyone. "You have to let a boy know you want him to
attend your school, hkh;
The result of the school 1 seeking after the boy may be a boy who
has a swelled opinion of his own importance, says Athletic Director
Taylor. But football coach Ralston adds, "They come down to earth
pretty fast. I don't feel there is any lasting bad effect at all."
The coaches interviewed also agreed completely that an end to
recruiting would mean an end to competition on the present levels.
The Admissions Office, the student-athletes, and the Athletics Di
rector all concurred in this sentiment: "De-emphasis is the only al
ternative to stopping athletic recruiting." De-emphasis in this con
text means that Stanford would begin to compete against teams of
less athletic ability.
Wrestling coach Jerry Budzik states, "Some coaches think recruit
ing Is 99 per cent of success." Swimming coach Jim Gaughran picked
the same figure at first, but modified it to include the importance of
the training program. He added that perhaps only five of his 20
best swimmers would be at Stanford if 1) he hadn't bothered to find
the top swimming student-athletes, and 2) he hadn't let them know
about Stanford and its training program.
Loss of Top Candidates
Director of Freshman Admissions Douglas Walker offered a more
comprehensive statement about the need to continue recruiting: "An
end to recruiting would be interpreted by high school coaches and
student-athletes as a sign that Stanford was no longer interested in
fielding representative teams.
"We would lose, therefore, a good many of the student-athletes
who are becoming such good candidates for schools of higher edu
cation." Walker mentioned such Ivy League schools as Penn, Harvard,
Dartmouth, Yale, and Princeton, as willing alternative recipients of
these student-athletes. "In fact," he states, "many of our student
athletes were recruited by those schools."
Some student-athletes state that the recruiting process did not In
fluence their decision because they had always wanted to come to
Stanford. But those who were undecided and those who were more
heavily recruited said they would never have considered Stanford
if they hadn't been recruited.
Stress Educational Opportunities
All of the student-athletes interviewed agreed that what the re
cruiters stressed most were Stanford's educational opportunities.
They mentioned that other schools generally were unable to do this:
Also, most of those interviewed said recruiting gave them a good
idea of what Stanford was like. The stays at Wilbur and fraternities
allowed them to speak with different individuals. They said that If
the recruit was interested in academics, athletics, or a special field,
the Athletics Department made sure the recruit stayed with a boy
with similar interests and talked to someone (coach or professor)
in the faculty about the Interest. Finally, some said that the recruit
ing experience allowed them to be better oriented during Pre-Reg
week.
The student-athletes gave the idea that grants-in-aid were a fac
tor only because of financial problems. None expressed a feeling
of having been "bid" for. (Editor's note: I did not make a full sur
vey of everyone on campus who has been recruited. It is possible
that some student-athletes may feel the amount of money offered, if
for example it was above actual need, was an important factor.
THOSE INTERVIEWED did not feel this way.)
Bad Effects of Recruting'
Supposing Stanford did decide to de-emphasifce athletics, to end all
athletic recruiting, what would be the effect on Stanford in general?
Athletics Director Taylor cites the following figures, which ap
peared in the Stanford Observer:
# Stanford sells 6,960 student books to its football games.
. This figure represents 91 per cent of undergraduates, 36 per cent
of graduates.
i Stanford sells 1,376 faculty books for the games.
# This figure represents 19 per cent of the faculty.
# National surveys show Stanford has the highest percentage of Its
students attending its athletic contests of all schools in the coun
try.
"Therefore," Taylor concludes, interest in the program as it stands
now, in the level of competition which exists now, does exist from
the spectator's point of view.
Taylor also mentioned the fact that about 800 Stanford students
or 20 per cent of the male undergraduate student body do compete
intercollegiately. This number, Taylor says, acquires added signifi
cance when it is considered along with the "tremendous" enthusiasm
for club sports like crew and lacrosse.
Taylor's final point is that de-emphasis of the football program,
which pays four-fifths of the $1.5 million cost of the overall physical
education program, would in no way reduce the costs of the pro
gram.
But Taylor carries the question to a higher level when he says: "If
we are going to play other schools, we must be as competitive. I do
not consider athletics an educative experience if boys are. not allowed,
by virtue of a policy, the opportunity to compete successfully. I do
believe athletics does have a value in education, but if it doesn't have
this value in the mind of student-athletes, it has no place in the cur
riculum."
Football coach Ralston has one other statement about the effect of
de-emphasis of athletics. He says much of the news the average
Stanford graduate will read about Stanford is how it has fared ath
letically. Therefore, athletics will be for the graduate a major con
tact with the University. "I think athletics acts as a welding force

both between the alumni and
the students here."
Could Stanford unilterally
end recruiting?
Again all the coaches ques
tioned concluded there was no
way that recruiting could be
ended unilaterally by Stanford
without Stanford changing its
level of competition. All of them
regard recruiting as a necessary
bother. They hope for a con
ference standardization which
would end most of the efforts
made now.

Stanford. But those who were undecided and those who were more
heavily recruited said they would never have considered Stanford
if they hadn't been recruited.
Stress Educational Opportunities
All of the student-athletes interviewed agreed that what the re
cruiters stressed most were Stanford's educational opportunities.
They mentioned that other schools generally were unable to do this:
Also, most of those interviewed said recruiting gave them a good
idea of what Stanford was like. The stays at Wilbur and fraternities
allowed them to speak with different individuals. They said that If
the recruit was interested in academics, athletics, or a special field,
the Athletics Department made sure the recruit stayed with a boy
with similar interests and talked to someone (coach or professor)
in the faculty about the Interest. Finally, some said that the recruit
ing experience allowed them to be better oriented during Pre-Reg
week.
The student-athletes gave the idea that grants-in-aid were a fac
tor only because of financial problems. None expressed a feeling
of having been "bid" for. (Editor's note: I did not make a full sur
vey of everyone on campus who has been recruited. It is possible
that some student-athletes may feel the amount of money offered, if
for example it was above actual need, was an important factor.
THOSE INTERVIEWED did not feel this way.)
Bad Effects of Recruting'
Supposing Stanford did decide to de-emphasifce athletics, to end all
athletic recruiting, what would be the effect on Stanford in general?
Athletics Director Taylor cites the following figures, which ap
peared in the Stanford Observer:
# Stanford sells 6,960 student books to its football games.
. This figure represents 91 per cent of undergraduates, 36 per cent
of graduates.
i Stanford sells 1,376 faculty books for the games.
# This figure represents 19 per cent of the faculty.
# National surveys show Stanford has the highest percentage of Its
students attending its athletic contests of all schools in the coun
try.
"Therefore," Taylor concludes, interest in the program as it stands
now, in the level of competition which exists now, does exist from
the spectator's point of view.
Taylor also mentioned the fact that about 800 Stanford students
or 20 per cent of the male undergraduate student body do compete
intercollegiately. This number, Taylor says, acquires added signifi
cance when it is considered along with the "tremendous" enthusiasm
for club sports like crew and lacrosse.
Taylor's final point is that de-emphasis of the football program,
which pays four-fifths of the $1.5 million cost of the overall physical
education program, would in no way reduce the costs of the pro
gram.
But Taylor carries the question to a higher level when he says: "If
we are going to play other schools, we must be as competitive. I do
not consider athletics an educative experience if boys are. not allowed,
by virtue of a policy, the opportunity to compete successfully. I do
believe athletics does have a value in education, but if it doesn't have
this value in the mind of student-athletes, it has no place in the cur
riculum."
Football coach Ralston has one other statement about the effect of
de-emphasis of athletics. He says much of the news the average
Stanford graduate will read about Stanford is how it has fared ath
letically. Therefore, athletics will be for the graduate a major con
tact with the University. "I think athletics acts as a welding force

both between the alumni and
the students here."
Could Stanford unilterally
end recruiting?
Again all the coaches ques
tioned concluded there was no
way that recruiting could be
ended unilaterally by Stanford
without Stanford changing its
level of competition. All of them
regard recruiting as a necessary
bother. They hope for a con
ference standardization which
would end most of the efforts
made now.
(Fourth In a Series)
"Is athletic recruiting necessary?"
Without exception, the coaches of football, basketball, and swim
ming state that they would be unable to get top student-athletes, in
a majority of cases, to come to Stanford without recruiting. As
Howie Dallmar puts it, a boy will feel "unwanted" if the school
doesn't show interest in him becaus the top student-athletes are
sought by everyone. "You have to let a boy know you want him to
attend your school, hkh;
The result of the school 1 seeking after the boy may be a boy who
has a swelled opinion of his own importance, says Athletic Director
Taylor. But football coach Ralston adds, "They come down to earth
pretty fast. I don't feel there is any lasting bad effect at all."
The coaches interviewed also agreed completely that an end to
recruiting would mean an end to competition on the present levels.
The Admissions Office, the student-athletes, and the Athletics Di
rector all concurred in this sentiment: "De-emphasis is the only al
ternative to stopping athletic recruiting." De-emphasis in this con
text means that Stanford would begin to compete against teams of
less athletic ability.
Wrestling coach Jerry Budzik states, "Some coaches think recruit
ing Is 99 per cent of success." Swimming coach Jim Gaughran picked
the same figure at first, but modified it to include the importance of
the training program. He added that perhaps only five of his 20
best swimmers would be at Stanford if 1) he hadn't bothered to find
the top swimming student-athletes, and 2) he hadn't let them know
about Stanford and its training program.
Loss of Top Candidates
Director of Freshman Admissions Douglas Walker offered a more
comprehensive statement about the need to continue recruiting: "An
end to recruiting would be interpreted by high school coaches and
student-athletes as a sign that Stanford was no longer interested in
fielding representative teams.
"We would lose, therefore, a good many of the student-athletes
who are becoming such good candidates for schools of higher edu
cation." Walker mentioned such Ivy League schools as Penn, Harvard,
Dartmouth, Yale, and Princeton, as willing alternative recipients of
these student-athletes. "In fact," he states, "many of our student
athletes were recruited by those schools."
Some student-athletes state that the recruiting process did not In

cance when it is considered along with the "tremendous" enthusiasm
for club sports like crew and lacrosse.
Taylor's final point is that de-emphasis of the football program,
which pays four-fifths of the $1.5 million cost of the overall physical
education program, would in no way reduce the costs of the pro
gram.
But Taylor carries the question to a higher level when he says: "If
we are going to play other schools, we must be as competitive. I do
not consider athletics an educative experience if boys are. not allowed,
by virtue of a policy, the opportunity to compete successfully. I do
believe athletics does have a value in education, but if it doesn't have
this value in the mind of student-athletes, it has no place in the cur
riculum."
Football coach Ralston has one other statement about the effect of
de-emphasis of athletics. He says much of the news the average
Stanford graduate will read about Stanford is how it has fared ath
letically. Therefore, athletics will be for the graduate a major con
tact with the University. "I think athletics acts as a welding force

both between the alumni and
the students here."
Could Stanford unilterally
end recruiting?
Again all the coaches ques
tioned concluded there was no
way that recruiting could be
ended unilaterally by Stanford
without Stanford changing its
level of competition. All of them
regard recruiting as a necessary
bother. They hope for a con
ference standardization which
would end most of the efforts
made now.
(Fourth In a Series)
"Is athletic recruiting necessary?"
Without exception, the coaches of football, basketball, and swim
ming state that they would be unable to get top student-athletes, in
a majority of cases, to come to Stanford without recruiting. As
Howie Dallmar puts it, a boy will feel "unwanted" if the school
doesn't show interest in him becaus the top student-athletes are
sought by everyone. "You have to let a boy know you want him to
attend your school, hkh;
The result of the school 1 seeking after the boy may be a boy who
has a swelled opinion of his own importance, says Athletic Director
Taylor. But football coach Ralston adds, "They come down to earth
pretty fast. I don't feel there is any lasting bad effect at all."
The coaches interviewed also agreed completely that an end to
recruiting would mean an end to competition on the present levels.
The Admissions Office, the student-athletes, and the Athletics Di
rector all concurred in this sentiment: "De-emphasis is the only al
ternative to stopping athletic recruiting." De-emphasis in this con
text means that Stanford would begin to compete against teams of
less athletic ability.
Wrestling coach Jerry Budzik states, "Some coaches think recruit
ing Is 99 per cent of success." Swimming coach Jim Gaughran picked
the same figure at first, but modified it to include the importance of
the training program. He added that perhaps only five of his 20
best swimmers would be at Stanford if 1) he hadn't bothered to find
the top swimming student-athletes, and 2) he hadn't let them know
about Stanford and its training program.
Loss of Top Candidates
Director of Freshman Admissions Douglas Walker offered a more
comprehensive statement about the need to continue recruiting: "An
end to recruiting would be interpreted by high school coaches and
student-athletes as a sign that Stanford was no longer interested in
fielding representative teams.
"We would lose, therefore, a good many of the student-athletes
who are becoming such good candidates for schools of higher edu
cation." Walker mentioned such Ivy League schools as Penn, Harvard,
Dartmouth, Yale, and Princeton, as willing alternative recipients of
these student-athletes. "In fact," he states, "many of our student
athletes were recruited by those schools."
Some student-athletes state that the recruiting process did not In
fluence their decision because they had always wanted to come to
Stanford. But those who were undecided and those who were more
heavily recruited said they would never have considered Stanford
if they hadn't been recruited.
Stress Educational Opportunities
All of the student-athletes interviewed agreed that what the re
cruiters stressed most were Stanford's educational opportunities.
They mentioned that other schools generally were unable to do this:
Also, most of those interviewed said recruiting gave them a good
idea of what Stanford was like. The stays at Wilbur and fraternities
allowed them to speak with different individuals. They said that If
the recruit was interested in academics, athletics, or a special field,
the Athletics Department made sure the recruit stayed with a boy
with similar interests and talked to someone (coach or professor)
in the faculty about the Interest. Finally, some said that the recruit
ing experience allowed them to be better oriented during Pre-Reg
week.
The student-athletes gave the idea that grants-in-aid were a fac
tor only because of financial problems. None expressed a feeling
of having been "bid" for. (Editor's note: I did not make a full sur
vey of everyone on campus who has been recruited. It is possible
that some student-athletes may feel the amount of money offered, if
for example it was above actual need, was an important factor.
THOSE INTERVIEWED did not feel this way.)
Bad Effects of Recruting'
Supposing Stanford did decide to de-emphasifce athletics, to end all
athletic recruiting, what would be the effect on Stanford in general?
Athletics Director Taylor cites the following figures, which ap
peared in the Stanford Observer:
# Stanford sells 6,960 student books to its football games.
. This figure represents 91 per cent of undergraduates, 36 per cent
of graduates.
i Stanford sells 1,376 faculty books for the games.
# This figure represents 19 per cent of the faculty.
# National surveys show Stanford has the highest percentage of Its
students attending its athletic contests of all schools in the coun
try.
"Therefore," Taylor concludes, interest in the program as it stands
now, in the level of competition which exists now, does exist from
the spectator's point of view.
Taylor also mentioned the fact that about 800 Stanford students
or 20 per cent of the male undergraduate student body do compete
intercollegiately. This number, Taylor says, acquires added signifi
cance when it is considered along with the "tremendous" enthusiasm
for club sports like crew and lacrosse.
Taylor's final point is that de-emphasis of the football program,
