# Shock Treatment

### 
A letter on this page several months ago
pointed out that the worst horror of the Vietnam
war was that it was causing people in this coun
try to become full of hate, intolerance, and irra
tionality. In this last week, Stanford has seen a
very disquieting manifestation of this truth. The
posters that have appeared in various spots on
the campus indicting President Sterling and oth
ers for their "complicity" in the war epitomize
the desperation which has led people with the
most sincere motives to do irreparable harm to
their cause, a cause which we agree should be
of utmost concern to all.
1 Unfortunately, the hasty action of the Stan
ford police has caused the controversy over these
posters to be clouded with polemics over free
dom of speech. There is no doubt that people
should have the right to display these posters
and any effort to deny them this right would be
a rejection of the tradition of free expression on
this campus.
The connection between the University and
the war-supporting complex of Stanford Re
search Institute and the Industrial Park is scan
dalous. Although the issues are not black and
white, as Resistance has suggested, a University
composed of a large number of students, faculty,
and staff in disagreement with the present U.S.
foreign policy should not have any connection
at all with production of war materials. That
this question should plague the conscience of
every member of this community there is no
doubt.
But the connection between Messrs. Sterling,
Arbuckle, et aland the horrors of the war in
Vietnam is more tenuous. It is obviously true

that they are involved with a military complex
vigorously supporting the war effort, but it is a
ridiculous oversimplification to accuse them of
being merchants of death without establishing
more direct connections and conscious motives
on their part. We are not trying to exonerate
these men for their involvement with military
construction, but only want to suggest that their
position does not warrant singling them out in
this sensational manner.
The argument, of course, is that people need
to be "shocked" into reassessing their beliefs on
this war and that the posters are intended to pro
duce this effect. The results of the poster cam
paign, however, should be obvious to all by now.
Instead of shocking the "wishy-washy liberals"
into a more militant position against the war in
Vietnam, it has alienated many of them and re
duced the credibility of a point of view which
needs so badly to continue being expressed.
Those who printed the signs wanted to create
controversy; this they have done, but the con
troversy is about posters and not about Vietnam.
What is most significant about the posters is
that they are a manifestation of the hopeless
frustration which so many in this community
and this country feel today. It is the frustration
of being impotent in the face of a war which
ordinary people can do nothing about. In the
final analysis, it is not only the people who put
up the posters who should be blamed; equally
guilty are all who have remained silent and have
continued to be cogs in the machine, despite
their own beliefs.
It is unfortunate that in a university people
should be driven to such extremes, just to stimu
late discussion.

at all with production of war materials. That
this question should plague the conscience of
every member of this community there is no
doubt.
But the connection between Messrs. Sterling,
Arbuckle, et aland the horrors of the war in
Vietnam is more tenuous. It is obviously true

that they are involved with a military complex
vigorously supporting the war effort, but it is a
ridiculous oversimplification to accuse them of
being merchants of death without establishing
more direct connections and conscious motives
on their part. We are not trying to exonerate
these men for their involvement with military
construction, but only want to suggest that their
position does not warrant singling them out in
this sensational manner.
The argument, of course, is that people need
to be "shocked" into reassessing their beliefs on
this war and that the posters are intended to pro
duce this effect. The results of the poster cam
paign, however, should be obvious to all by now.
Instead of shocking the "wishy-washy liberals"
into a more militant position against the war in
Vietnam, it has alienated many of them and re
duced the credibility of a point of view which
needs so badly to continue being expressed.
Those who printed the signs wanted to create
controversy; this they have done, but the con
troversy is about posters and not about Vietnam.
What is most significant about the posters is
that they are a manifestation of the hopeless
frustration which so many in this community
and this country feel today. It is the frustration
of being impotent in the face of a war which
ordinary people can do nothing about. In the
final analysis, it is not only the people who put
up the posters who should be blamed; equally
guilty are all who have remained silent and have
continued to be cogs in the machine, despite
their own beliefs.
It is unfortunate that in a university people
should be driven to such extremes, just to stimu
late discussion.
A letter on this page several months ago
pointed out that the worst horror of the Vietnam
war was that it was causing people in this coun
try to become full of hate, intolerance, and irra
tionality. In this last week, Stanford has seen a
very disquieting manifestation of this truth. The
posters that have appeared in various spots on
the campus indicting President Sterling and oth
ers for their "complicity" in the war epitomize
the desperation which has led people with the
most sincere motives to do irreparable harm to
their cause, a cause which we agree should be
of utmost concern to all.
1 Unfortunately, the hasty action of the Stan
ford police has caused the controversy over these
posters to be clouded with polemics over free
dom of speech. There is no doubt that people
should have the right to display these posters
and any effort to deny them this right would be
a rejection of the tradition of free expression on
this campus.
The connection between the University and
the war-supporting complex of Stanford Re
search Institute and the Industrial Park is scan
dalous. Although the issues are not black and
white, as Resistance has suggested, a University
composed of a large number of students, faculty,
and staff in disagreement with the present U.S.
foreign policy should not have any connection
at all with production of war materials. That
this question should plague the conscience of
every member of this community there is no
