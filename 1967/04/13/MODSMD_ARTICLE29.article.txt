## Mass Executions Are Cheaper 
### Robert E. Stone 
Governor Reagan is missing a
sure way of cutting the State's
budget. I am referring of
course to the area of executions
at San Quentin State Prison.
These executions are a source
of incredible cost to the state
and these costs could be eli
minated.
With the death of Aaron
Mitchell yesterday, there are a
total of 63 men awaiting exe
cution on San Quentin's Death
Row. The cost to the State of
executing these men amounts to
$7,500 each. While this is a
small amount when compared
to the overall State budget, it is
important to remember, as Gov
ernor Reagan has pointed out,
that pennies make dollars.
The incredibly high cost of
dying pays for many things; a
doctor, a clergyman, witnesses,
guards, and of course, appeals.
Then, too, there is the man who
pulls the lever, which drops the
pellets, which release the gas,
which kills the man. Don't for
get that the executioner hasn't
had an awful lot to do in the
past four years, and his salary
must be enough to carry him
over the rough spots when no
one is scheduled to die.
Austerity
Considering the fact that Cali
fornia's projected austerity pro

gram is second only to Great
Britain's, one wonders why ex
ecutions are allowed to continue
when they cost so much for
everybody involved. There are a
number of possibilities.
For purposes of discussion we
must accept the fact that Cali
fornia's death penalty is, in fact,
a deterrent to crime. Having
done so, the next step is to see
whether or not the cost of an
execution is less than the cost
of arresting and trying one exe
cution's worth of felons. If such
a relationship is valid, then it
can be assumed that Governor
Reagan has no intention of al
tering the situation as it pres
ently stands since it is more
economical to kill people than
to pay for the increased num
ber of policemen and judges
that not killing them would re
quire.
Will Ronnie Act?
Harking back to Governor
Reagan's campaign, however,
and examining his first hundred
days in office, one must con
clude that the Governor has no
intention of letting any situa
tion exist which existed prior to
his inauguration. What then is
Reagan going to do?
The costs of an execution are
rather fixed. No one execution
costs any more than any other.
It is also true, however, that

multiple executions would cost
no more than single ones. Sure
ly enough cyanide gas is gener
ated by the pellets to kill say 10
to 15 men. All other factors
are fixed. And even if there is
not enough gas generated to
kill that many men, cyanide is
cheap. The increase in cyanide
costs would more than be offset
by the savings in the other
areas.
There is, of course, a prob
lem inherent in the above bud
get cut. Very rarely are two
men scheduled to die on the
same day. The possibility of 10-
15 men being scheduled to die
on the same day is so slim as to
be non-existent. This of course
is a problem that could be over
come. Certain days of the
month could be set aside as exe
cution days and all executions
would have to occur on that
day. If there were not enough
executions to justify a monthly
date, it would be possible to
establish one day per quarter or
per year.
While the cost of executions
at San Quentin is not going to
break the State, there is no
doubt that the money could be
put to better use in other areas.
It is incomprehensible to believe
that Governor Reagan has not
recognized this fact and is not
prepared to act on it.
