# Anti-Draft Petitioners Explain Opposition
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
The Stanford Anti-Draft Union has
collected 55 signatures on "We Won't
Go" petitions. Gary Coutin, secretary
treasurer of the Union, explained
that 36 students claimed they will not
be conscripted into military service
or fight in Vietnam. Another 16 stat
ed they will not fight in Vietnam, and
three said only they would not allow
themselves to be conscripted into
military service.

Basic reasons for signing the peti
tion are not always the same. Gary
Coutin argued, "The draft is a viola
tion of all the United States stands
for —a violation of freedom and de
mocracy."
But Rick Bogart, who also signed
the petition, does not feel the com
pulsory nature of the present draft
so repulsive as military service. He
predicted, "Fairly large numbers

would be willing to be conscripted
into non-military activities."
C.O.'s
Jeff Kane opposes the "system." He
commented that the present require
ments for becoming a conscientious
objector (C.0.) put the burden of
proof on the applicant. He observed
that the individual is forced to meas
ure himself by the system's stan
dards.
The common focal point was the
compulsory nature of the system.
Leonard Siegel called the draft "in
voluntary servitude," speculating that
it is a clear-cut violation of the thir
teenth amendment to the constitution.
Bogart expressed the hope that sev
eral more people will sign the peti
tion, in a "snowballing effect." If
enough people sign similar petitions,
draft boards will find it difficult to
meet their quotas. Then, he contin
ued, alternatives to compulsory mili
tary service might be established.
Conservatives
Kane offered a comment on one
major problem facing the anti-draft
group. "The group of people opposed
to the war—and the draft—are large
ly people who have rejected accepted
social values, including standards of
dress. This hurts the cause," he said,
"because many conservatives lose all
objectivity when appearance is not
acceptable to them."
"The draft is an assumption that
war is good," said Coutin. He con

structed a hypothesis that volunteer
armies cannot be "used" to fight un
popular wars. When asked if he
thought there could be an unpopular
but "necessrary" war, he replied that
in a democracy, the people should
make decisions.
"I'm radically democratic," he con
tinued, "but the draft isn't democrat
ic." He attacked drafting 18-year-olds
who can't vote.
Volunteer Army
All of the participants noted that
several studies have shown a volun
teer army would be practical. Sen.
Hatfield, on his recent trip to Stan
ford, noted that a Pentagon study had
come to that conclusion.
Coutin said the draft violates the
principles of the Nuremberg conven
tion on morality. He explained, "I'm
not a C.0., and I'm not a pacifist, but
killing is a very special act. If I kill
it must be for my own reasons."
"This summer I'll become a C.O. I
would accept two years' alternative
service as opposed to five years in
jail," said Kane, "but I'll try to change
the system." Kane noted that many
C.O.'s resented alternate civilian serv
ice, because they felt they could con
tribute more to society in their own
private lives.
Emphasizing the problem of all
compulsory services, Coutin objected
to non - military alternatives that
would "require me to be an ambassa
dor of what other people tell me."

tribute more to society in their own
private lives.
Emphasizing the problem of all
compulsory services, Coutin objected
to non - military alternatives that
would "require me to be an ambassa
dor of what other people tell me."
The Stanford Anti-Draft Union has
collected 55 signatures on "We Won't
Go" petitions. Gary Coutin, secretary
treasurer of the Union, explained
that 36 students claimed they will not
be conscripted into military service
or fight in Vietnam. Another 16 stat
ed they will not fight in Vietnam, and
three said only they would not allow
themselves to be conscripted into
military service.

Basic reasons for signing the peti
tion are not always the same. Gary
Coutin argued, "The draft is a viola
tion of all the United States stands
for —a violation of freedom and de
mocracy."
But Rick Bogart, who also signed
the petition, does not feel the com
pulsory nature of the present draft
so repulsive as military service. He
predicted, "Fairly large numbers

would be willing to be conscripted
into non-military activities."
C.O.'s
Jeff Kane opposes the "system." He
commented that the present require
ments for becoming a conscientious
objector (C.0.) put the burden of
proof on the applicant. He observed
that the individual is forced to meas
ure himself by the system's stan
dards.
The common focal point was the
compulsory nature of the system.
Leonard Siegel called the draft "in
voluntary servitude," speculating that
it is a clear-cut violation of the thir
teenth amendment to the constitution.
Bogart expressed the hope that sev
eral more people will sign the peti
tion, in a "snowballing effect." If
enough people sign similar petitions,
draft boards will find it difficult to
meet their quotas. Then, he contin
ued, alternatives to compulsory mili
tary service might be established.
Conservatives
Kane offered a comment on one
major problem facing the anti-draft
group. "The group of people opposed
to the war—and the draft—are large
ly people who have rejected accepted
social values, including standards of
dress. This hurts the cause," he said,
"because many conservatives lose all
objectivity when appearance is not
acceptable to them."
"The draft is an assumption that
war is good," said Coutin. He con

structed a hypothesis that volunteer
armies cannot be "used" to fight un
popular wars. When asked if he
thought there could be an unpopular
but "necessrary" war, he replied that
in a democracy, the people should
make decisions.
"I'm radically democratic," he con
tinued, "but the draft isn't democrat
ic." He attacked drafting 18-year-olds
who can't vote.
Volunteer Army
All of the participants noted that
several studies have shown a volun
teer army would be practical. Sen.
Hatfield, on his recent trip to Stan
ford, noted that a Pentagon study had
come to that conclusion.
Coutin said the draft violates the
principles of the Nuremberg conven
tion on morality. He explained, "I'm
not a C.0., and I'm not a pacifist, but
killing is a very special act. If I kill
it must be for my own reasons."
"This summer I'll become a C.O. I
would accept two years' alternative
service as opposed to five years in
jail," said Kane, "but I'll try to change
the system." Kane noted that many
C.O.'s resented alternate civilian serv
ice, because they felt they could con
tribute more to society in their own
private lives.
