## Poster Protest Termed Idiocy 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
If one is to trust the Gallup
r>olls. there is increasing disaf
fection among Americans with
the Vietnam war. It should be
the aim of any war protest to
enlist the support of these peo
ple because only when such
pressure of numbers is brought
to bear on Washington will the
war be terminated. One should
consider, then, how any particu
lar action will affect these "out
siders," rejcting any action that
would clearly alienate more peo
ple than it would enlist. As ex
amnle. the public expression of
self-righteous indignation, while
being perhaps morally justified,
is most often a tactical error.
Such was the case in the recent
protest here at Stanford. One
almost suspects that the people
who designed this protest would
rather be right than effective.
The anti war cause is in great
need of support from peoole in
positions of power, including
businessmen. For a protest
group to assume, as seems the
case here, that anyone who has
not already spoken out against
the war is a moral monster, is
another tactical error. If the
aim of this protest was truly to
convert the officials of SRI to
the anti - war cause, no other
means of "persuasion" could
have been less appronriate. For
any executive of SRI to pres
ently begin opposing the war
would be tantamount to confess
ing a past sin, a sin which most
of the officials of SRI and a good
many other people would be
loath to acknowledge as r~al 'n
the first place; for it is Wash
ington that is finally responsible
for this dirty war, not American
business. At any rate, this pro
test has placed a psychological
barrier in front of the people in
SRI that in effect hinders their
enlistment in the anti-war cause
rather than helps it.
I object to this manner of
"speaking out" not because I
support the Vietnam war, but
because I violently oppose it;
and it makes me sick to see a
group of unthinking students
cast a shadow of idiocy upon all
efforts to end the war.

• Dialogue Wanted
Editor, The Dally:
Having suffered throughout
the season The Daily's savage
and careless reviews, we might
be expected to reply in kind to
this latest review of the Stan
ford Repertory Theatre's pro
duction of Inadmissible Evi
dence. Instead, we would like to
express serious concern as to
the usefulness of this kind of
commentary.
Even we neophytes (persons
who have spent some six or
seven—or more—years studying
and training for work in our
profession) feel that we have

the right to try and fail, and the
right to try and succeed, in the
theatre. But what are the quali
fications which give your Mr.
Merry and Mr. Sanchez this
right as drama critics? What
in their opinion, and yours, is
their function as critics? What
special insights do they have
that permit them to dispense
with the critic's normal obliga
tions to audience and theatre?
Members of the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre have generally
not bothered to defend them
selves against The Daily's scur
rilous attacks, but perhaps that
is no longer wise. Therefore we
three graduating M.F.A. stu
dents (who are not performers
in Inadmissible Evidence) pro
pose a meeting between the Edi
tor of The Daily, Mr. Merry, Mr.
Sanchez and ourselves to dis
cuss our failings — and theirs.
We do so in the hope that our
public and private dialogue
would continue, but newly in
formed by some knowledge of
the facts, and perhaps a respect
for each other's personal and ar
tistic integrity.

the experiences of our profes

first two quarters of this first

Editor, The Dally:
Your stand on capital punish
ment in Wednesday's Dally was
both unexpected and admirable.
It seems California has be
come a state where, as one of
God's agents-on-earth noted re
cently, "trees are more impor
tant than people." Thousands of
voices are raised in anger when
a piddling redwood tree is cut
down, but few seem to care that
a man was gassed in San Quen
tin today.
The murdered murderer was
convicted of shooting a police
man. In Alabama today, a jailer
was acquitted of all guilt after
beating a prisoner to death.
Five months ago, when Pat
Brown was in office, Aaron
Mitchell would not have taken
those thirteen steps to death.
Adolph Hitler gassed those who

were considered enemies of the
state, too, which only shows, I
suspect, that time and place
have a lot to do with so-called
questions of right and wrong.
I used to believe that capital
punishment was the only an
swer to society's problems —
when I was 12 years old. Why
can't California leave the "12-
year-old" stage? Certainly, it's
very costly to house, guard, and
feed a man who would other
wise be gassed and forgotten.
But, let me suggest that's one of
the costs of self-respect in a civ
ilized society. Cutting the guest
list on Death Row by 10 per
cent is no solution.

Editor, The Daily:
Because there is some confu
sion as to what happened at the
Interim Judicial Body proceed
ings Monday night and as to my
position which was presented in
a written statement, I intend to

read and explain statpment
at the Vietnam Week rally to
be held at noon Thursday in
White Plaza. I wish to invite
Martin Gerry or other members
of the student Judicial Council
who witnessed the hearing to
present their opinion on the
case (they need not affiliate
themselves with the rally. I sup
port the position of the Judicial
Council although it is quite dis
tinct from my own position.
I would point out to those
who were confused or misled
by Tuesday's Daily article that
Dean Smith's statement that "it
is irrelevant whether or not the
Fundamental Standard has been
violated" is, in point of fact, a
capitulation to the sit-in and to
the arguments I made in my
statement. It was the Adminis
tration that brought the case to
the Judicial Council in the first
place, and it was brought on
the allegation that the Funda
mental Standard had been vio

• Self' Respect
Editor, The Dally:
Your stand on capital punish
ment in Wednesday's Dally was
both unexpected and admirable.
It seems California has be
come a state where, as one of
God's agents-on-earth noted re
cently, "trees are more impor
tant than people." Thousands of
voices are raised in anger when
a piddling redwood tree is cut
down, but few seem to care that
a man was gassed in San Quen
tin today.
The murdered murderer was
convicted of shooting a police
man. In Alabama today, a jailer
was acquitted of all guilt after
beating a prisoner to death.
Five months ago, when Pat
Brown was in office, Aaron
Mitchell would not have taken
those thirteen steps to death.
Adolph Hitler gassed those who

were considered enemies of the
state, too, which only shows, I
suspect, that time and place
have a lot to do with so-called
questions of right and wrong.
I used to believe that capital
punishment was the only an
swer to society's problems —
when I was 12 years old. Why
can't California leave the "12-
year-old" stage? Certainly, it's
very costly to house, guard, and
feed a man who would other
wise be gassed and forgotten.
But, let me suggest that's one of
the costs of self-respect in a civ
ilized society. Cutting the guest
list on Death Row by 10 per
cent is no solution.

• More Confusion
Editor, The Daily:
Because there is some confu
sion as to what happened at the
Interim Judicial Body proceed
ings Monday night and as to my
position which was presented in
a written statement, I intend to

read and explain statpment
at the Vietnam Week rally to
be held at noon Thursday in
White Plaza. I wish to invite
Martin Gerry or other members
of the student Judicial Council
who witnessed the hearing to
present their opinion on the
case (they need not affiliate
themselves with the rally. I sup
port the position of the Judicial
Council although it is quite dis
tinct from my own position.
I would point out to those
who were confused or misled
by Tuesday's Daily article that
Dean Smith's statement that "it
is irrelevant whether or not the
Fundamental Standard has been
violated" is, in point of fact, a
capitulation to the sit-in and to
the arguments I made in my
statement. It was the Adminis
tration that brought the case to
the Judicial Council in the first
place, and it was brought on
the allegation that the Funda
mental Standard had been vio
lated.
MARC SAPIR
Editor, The Dally:
If one is to trust the Gallup
r>olls. there is increasing disaf
fection among Americans with
the Vietnam war. It should be
the aim of any war protest to
enlist the support of these peo
ple because only when such
pressure of numbers is brought
to bear on Washington will the
war be terminated. One should
consider, then, how any particu
lar action will affect these "out
siders," rejcting any action that
would clearly alienate more peo
ple than it would enlist. As ex
amnle. the public expression of
self-righteous indignation, while
being perhaps morally justified,
is most often a tactical error.
Such was the case in the recent
protest here at Stanford. One
almost suspects that the people
who designed this protest would
rather be right than effective.
The anti war cause is in great
need of support from peoole in
positions of power, including
businessmen. For a protest
group to assume, as seems the
case here, that anyone who has
not already spoken out against
the war is a moral monster, is
another tactical error. If the
aim of this protest was truly to
convert the officials of SRI to
the anti - war cause, no other
means of "persuasion" could
have been less appronriate. For
any executive of SRI to pres
ently begin opposing the war
would be tantamount to confess
ing a past sin, a sin which most
of the officials of SRI and a good
many other people would be
loath to acknowledge as r~al 'n
the first place; for it is Wash
ington that is finally responsible
for this dirty war, not American
business. At any rate, this pro
test has placed a psychological
barrier in front of the people in
SRI that in effect hinders their
enlistment in the anti-war cause
rather than helps it.
I object to this manner of
"speaking out" not because I
support the Vietnam war, but
because I violently oppose it;
and it makes me sick to see a
group of unthinking students
cast a shadow of idiocy upon all
efforts to end the war.

• Dialogue Wanted
Editor, The Dally:
Having suffered throughout
the season The Daily's savage
and careless reviews, we might
be expected to reply in kind to
this latest review of the Stan
ford Repertory Theatre's pro
duction of Inadmissible Evi
dence. Instead, we would like to
express serious concern as to
the usefulness of this kind of
commentary.
Even we neophytes (persons
who have spent some six or
seven—or more—years studying
and training for work in our
profession) feel that we have

the right to try and fail, and the
right to try and succeed, in the
theatre. But what are the quali

Merry and Mr. Sanchez this
right as drama critics? What
in their opinion, and yours, is
their function as critics? What
special insights do they have
that permit them to dispense
with the critic's normal obliga
tions to audience and theatre?
Members of the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre have generally
not bothered to defend them
selves against The Daily's scur
rilous attacks, but perhaps that
is no longer wise. Therefore we

MARC SAPIR
Editor, The Dally:
If one is to trust the Gallup
r>olls. there is increasing disaf
fection among Americans with
the Vietnam war. It should be
the aim of any war protest to
enlist the support of these peo
ple because only when such
pressure of numbers is brought
to bear on Washington will the
war be terminated. One should
consider, then, how any particu
lar action will affect these "out
siders," rejcting any action that
would clearly alienate more peo
ple than it would enlist. As ex
amnle. the public expression of
self-righteous indignation, while
being perhaps morally justified,
is most often a tactical error.
Such was the case in the recent
protest here at Stanford. One
almost suspects that the people
who designed this protest would
rather be right than effective.
The anti war cause is in great
need of support from peoole in
positions of power, including
businessmen. For a protest
group to assume, as seems the
case here, that anyone who has
not already spoken out against
the war is a moral monster, is
another tactical error. If the
aim of this protest was truly to
convert the officials of SRI to
the anti - war cause, no other
means of "persuasion" could
have been less appronriate. For
any executive of SRI to pres
ently begin opposing the war
would be tantamount to confess
ing a past sin, a sin which most
of the officials of SRI and a good
many other people would be
loath to acknowledge as r~al 'n
the first place; for it is Wash
ington that is finally responsible
for this dirty war, not American
business. At any rate, this pro
test has placed a psychological
barrier in front of the people in
SRI that in effect hinders their
enlistment in the anti-war cause
rather than helps it.
I object to this manner of
"speaking out" not because I
support the Vietnam war, but
because I violently oppose it;
and it makes me sick to see a
group of unthinking students
cast a shadow of idiocy upon all
efforts to end the war.

Having suffered throughout
the season The Daily's savage

be expected to reply in kind to
this latest review of the Stan

express serious concern as to
the usefulness of this kind of

Even we neophytes (persons
who have spent some six or
seven—or more—years studying

the right to try and fail, and the
right to try and succeed, in the
theatre. But what are the quali

Merry and Mr. Sanchez this
right as drama critics? What
in their opinion, and yours, is
their function as critics? What
special insights do they have
that permit them to dispense
with the critic's normal obliga
tions to audience and theatre?
Members of the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre have generally
not bothered to defend them
selves against The Daily's scur
rilous attacks, but perhaps that
is no longer wise. Therefore we
three graduating M.F.A. stu

in Inadmissible Evidence) pro
pose a meeting between the Edi

cuss our failings — and theirs.
We do so in the hope that our

Editor, The Dally:
Your stand on capital punish
ment in Wednesday's Dally was
both unexpected and admirable.
It seems California has be
come a state where, as one of
God's agents-on-earth noted re
cently, "trees are more impor
tant than people." Thousands of
voices are raised in anger when
a piddling redwood tree is cut
down, but few seem to care that
a man was gassed in San Quen
tin today.
The murdered murderer was
convicted of shooting a police
man. In Alabama today, a jailer
was acquitted of all guilt after
beating a prisoner to death.
Five months ago, when Pat
Brown was in office, Aaron
Mitchell would not have taken
those thirteen steps to death.
Adolph Hitler gassed those who

were considered enemies of the
state, too, which only shows, I
suspect, that time and place
have a lot to do with so-called
questions of right and wrong.
I used to believe that capital
punishment was the only an
swer to society's problems —
when I was 12 years old. Why
can't California leave the "12-
year-old" stage? Certainly, it's
very costly to house, guard, and
feed a man who would other
wise be gassed and forgotten.
But, let me suggest that's one of
the costs of self-respect in a civ
ilized society. Cutting the guest
list on Death Row by 10 per

with the critic's normal obliga
tions to audience and theatre?
Members of the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre have generally
not bothered to defend them
selves against The Daily's scur
rilous attacks, but perhaps that
is no longer wise. Therefore we
three graduating M.F.A. stu
dents (who are not performers
in Inadmissible Evidence) pro
pose a meeting between the Edi
tor of The Daily, Mr. Merry, Mr.
Sanchez and ourselves to dis
cuss our failings — and theirs.
We do so in the hope that our
public and private dialogue
would continue, but newly in
formed by some knowledge of
the facts, and perhaps a respect
for each other's personal and ar
tistic integrity.

We are grateful for your pub
lication April 12 of the report on
the experiences of our profes
sional journalism fellows in the
first two quarters of this first
year of the program. It is how
ever inaccurate to put my by

Julius Duscha, and he should
get any credit that attaches to
it

• Self' Respect
Editor, The Dally:
Your stand on capital punish
ment in Wednesday's Dally was
both unexpected and admirable.
It seems California has be
come a state where, as one of
God's agents-on-earth noted re
cently, "trees are more impor
tant than people." Thousands of
voices are raised in anger when
a piddling redwood tree is cut
down, but few seem to care that
a man was gassed in San Quen
tin today.
The murdered murderer was
convicted of shooting a police
man. In Alabama today, a jailer
was acquitted of all guilt after
beating a prisoner to death.
Five months ago, when Pat
Brown was in office, Aaron
Mitchell would not have taken
those thirteen steps to death.
Adolph Hitler gassed those who

were considered enemies of the
state, too, which only shows, I
suspect, that time and place
have a lot to do with so-called
questions of right and wrong.
I used to believe that capital
punishment was the only an
swer to society's problems —
when I was 12 years old. Why
can't California leave the "12-
year-old" stage? Certainly, it's
very costly to house, guard, and
feed a man who would other
wise be gassed and forgotten.
But, let me suggest that's one of
the costs of self-respect in a civ
ilized society. Cutting the guest
list on Death Row by 10 per
cent is no solution.

• More Confusion
Editor, The Daily:
Because there is some confu
sion as to what happened at the
Interim Judicial Body proceed
ings Monday night and as to my
position which was presented in
a written statement, I intend to

read and explain statpment
at the Vietnam Week rally to
be held at noon Thursday in
White Plaza. I wish to invite
Martin Gerry or other members
of the student Judicial Council
who witnessed the hearing to
present their opinion on the
case (they need not affiliate
themselves with the rally. I sup
port the position of the Judicial
Council although it is quite dis
tinct from my own position.
I would point out to those
who were confused or misled
by Tuesday's Daily article that
Dean Smith's statement that "it
is irrelevant whether or not the
Fundamental Standard has been
violated" is, in point of fact, a
capitulation to the sit-in and to
the arguments I made in my
statement. It was the Adminis
tration that brought the case to
the Judicial Council in the first
place, and it was brought on
the allegation that the Funda
mental Standard had been vio
lated.
MARC SAPIR
Editor, The Dally:
If one is to trust the Gallup
r>olls. there is increasing disaf
fection among Americans with
the Vietnam war. It should be
the aim of any war protest to
enlist the support of these peo
ple because only when such
pressure of numbers is brought
to bear on Washington will the
war be terminated. One should
consider, then, how any particu
lar action will affect these "out
siders," rejcting any action that
would clearly alienate more peo
ple than it would enlist. As ex
amnle. the public expression of
self-righteous indignation, while
being perhaps morally justified,
is most often a tactical error.
Such was the case in the recent
protest here at Stanford. One
almost suspects that the people
who designed this protest would
rather be right than effective.
The anti war cause is in great
need of support from peoole in
positions of power, including
businessmen. For a protest
group to assume, as seems the
case here, that anyone who has
not already spoken out against
the war is a moral monster, is
another tactical error. If the
aim of this protest was truly to
convert the officials of SRI to
the anti - war cause, no other
means of "persuasion" could
have been less appronriate. For
any executive of SRI to pres
ently begin opposing the war
would be tantamount to confess
ing a past sin, a sin which most
of the officials of SRI and a good
many other people would be
loath to acknowledge as r~al 'n
the first place; for it is Wash
ington that is finally responsible
for this dirty war, not American
business. At any rate, this pro
test has placed a psychological
barrier in front of the people in
SRI that in effect hinders their
enlistment in the anti-war cause
rather than helps it.
I object to this manner of
"speaking out" not because I
support the Vietnam war, but
because I violently oppose it;
and it makes me sick to see a
group of unthinking students
cast a shadow of idiocy upon all
efforts to end the war.

• Dialogue Wanted
Editor, The Dally:
Having suffered throughout
the season The Daily's savage
and careless reviews, we might
be expected to reply in kind to
this latest review of the Stan
ford Repertory Theatre's pro
duction of Inadmissible Evi
dence. Instead, we would like to
express serious concern as to
the usefulness of this kind of
commentary.
Even we neophytes (persons
who have spent some six or
seven—or more—years studying
and training for work in our
profession) feel that we have

the right to try and fail, and the
right to try and succeed, in the
theatre. But what are the quali
fications which give your Mr.
Merry and Mr. Sanchez this
right as drama critics? What
in their opinion, and yours, is
their function as critics? What
special insights do they have
that permit them to dispense
with the critic's normal obliga
tions to audience and theatre?
Members of the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre have generally
not bothered to defend them
selves against The Daily's scur
rilous attacks, but perhaps that
is no longer wise. Therefore we

dents (who are not performers
