# Stern Presses For New Residential Programs
## 
### 
The committee on residence policies
of the Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) yesterday deliberated how
Stern Hall could be creatively in
cluded in the innovations to be ef
rected next year.
It then requested a subcommittee,
to which Stern director Bill Leland
and a Stem resident had just been ap
pointed to consider specific proposals
along these lines and report back at
the full committee's meeting a week
from today.
Stern residents have recently ar
gued that the proposed experimenta
tion would reduce the attractiveness
of Stern and draw leadership to the

experimental houses, and have also
protested any plan to make two
houses in Stern freshman residences.
Some members of the residence
committee, however, expressed the
opinion that it is precisely because
the new houses would be attractive
that they must be built, emphasizing
meanwhile that everything possible
must be done to improve Stern at the
same time.
Improvement of Stern could con
sist of instituting academic programs
similar to those in the experimental
houses or, if the legal restrictions
making Stern a men's residence can
be dropped, in coeducation.
