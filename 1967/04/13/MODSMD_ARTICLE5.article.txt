# IFC Presidency To Quinn
## 
### ROGER LaBRUCHERIE 
Mike Quinn defeated A 1 Tammany
in the election of the President of the
Inter-Fraternity Council last night.
Quinn, a junior and a psychology ma
jor from Middletown, New Jersey, won
by a wide margin on a platform call
ing for a new look at the proper role
of the IFC. Quinn is a member of Del
ta Upsilon.
Quinn stated that the IFC might
best reorient itself toward serving as a
sounding board for ideas and problems
of the individual houses, and away
from sponsoring activities of all fra
ternities as a body. Quinn feels this
would allow greater initiative on the
part of the individual houses and per-

Mit groups of houses to jointly spon
sor activities in which they have par
ticular interest. He sees IFC's main
role as that of serving as a communica
tions link between fraternities and the
rest of the university community, be
tween the fraternities themselves, and
between the fraternities and the Daily.

Quinn said that the IFC might turn
its attention specifically to assisting
the Phi Delts' return to campus next
year, aiding "weaker" houses in secur
ing cluster housing, and helping in
dividual houses locate faculty asso
ciates.
Quinn stated that it is contingent on
the IFC to work to improve fraterni
ties so that they can serve as worth
while alternatives to other living sys
tems.
In uncontested elections Bob Bitt
ner of Delta Tau Delta was voted
Vice President and Mike Green of
Alpha Sigma Phi was elected Secre
tary.

In further business the Council

voted to amend the Constitution to re
quire a two-thirds approval by the
Council for the annual budget, a move
which Quinn later stated might make
possible the reduction of the IFC as
sessment of fraternity members. This,
he commented, would be a matter for
the entire Council to decide.
A group of representatives from
five houses called for a reevaluation
of IFC and for the consideration of a
proposal that the IFC change from a
spending unit to a discussion-oriented
body which might help groups of
fraternities work in concert. This
would enable the IFC to reduce its
budget substastially, freeing funds for
the individual houses to persue their
own objectives.
Drennen Jones, outgoing IFC Pres
ident, commented that both ASSU
Vice-Presidential candidates had been
unable to accept the invitation to ad
dress the Council. A statement of
position from Bill Stone was, how
ever, read in lieu of his appearance.

Mike Quinn defeated A 1 Tammany
in the election of the President of the
Inter-Fraternity Council last night.
Quinn, a junior and a psychology ma
jor from Middletown, New Jersey, won
by a wide margin on a platform call
ing for a new look at the proper role
of the IFC. Quinn is a member of Del
ta Upsilon.
Quinn stated that the IFC might
best reorient itself toward serving as a
sounding board for ideas and problems
of the individual houses, and away
from sponsoring activities of all fra
ternities as a body. Quinn feels this
would allow greater initiative on the
part of the individual houses and per-

Mit groups of houses to jointly spon
sor activities in which they have par
ticular interest. He sees IFC's main
role as that of serving as a communica
tions link between fraternities and the
rest of the university community, be
tween the fraternities themselves, and
between the fraternities and the Daily.
Improve Fraternities
Quinn said that the IFC might turn
its attention specifically to assisting
the Phi Delts' return to campus next
year, aiding "weaker" houses in secur
ing cluster housing, and helping in
dividual houses locate faculty asso
ciates.
Quinn stated that it is contingent on
the IFC to work to improve fraterni
ties so that they can serve as worth
while alternatives to other living sys
tems.
In uncontested elections Bob Bitt
ner of Delta Tau Delta was voted
Vice President and Mike Green of
Alpha Sigma Phi was elected Secre
tary.
IFC Re-Evaluation
In further business the Council

voted to amend the Constitution to re
quire a two-thirds approval by the
Council for the annual budget, a move
which Quinn later stated might make
possible the reduction of the IFC as
sessment of fraternity members. This,
he commented, would be a matter for
the entire Council to decide.
A group of representatives from
five houses called for a reevaluation
of IFC and for the consideration of a
proposal that the IFC change from a
spending unit to a discussion-oriented
body which might help groups of
fraternities work in concert. This
would enable the IFC to reduce its
budget substastially, freeing funds for
the individual houses to persue their
own objectives.
