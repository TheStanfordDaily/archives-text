## 
### 
A renowned teacher of "body
awareness," ''physical resensiti
zation," and "non-verbal communica
tion"—Bernard Gunther —will be in
the Experiment building tonight at
8:15. Gunther's development of new
approaches to sensory awakening and
massage has earned him national
fame. He is in the residential educa
tion program of the Esalen Institute
in Big Sur and in his workshops uses
things like yoga, visual imagery, and
meditation in an attempt to create an
integral approach.
Creative Experiences
Gunther is the first in a series of
persons coming to Stanford from Esa
len in an effort to bring creative and
innovative educational experiences to
the Stanford community. ASSU Pres
ident Mike Collins, who was very
much involved in the arrangements
for the series, sees them as a facet of
the kind of educational pioneering
that he and Dave Harris made so
much of a part of the spirit of their
election campaign last spring.
Frederick S. Perls, the founder of

gestalt therapy, will be in Tresldder
Large Lounge on April 19. In his
demonstrational techniques he has
been known to have subjects from his
audience act out dreams or problems.

fessor of Medical Psychology at UC
LA and author of articles in the Jour
nal of Consulting - Psychology and the
Psychedelic Review on Zen medita
tion, will be in Tresidder Small

with meditation's "symbol experi

group dynamics on meditation.
Virginia Satir will be in Tresidder
Large Lounge on May 4. She is a
family therapist who has lectured
around the world on her findings. Her
"conjoint family therapy" includes
things like identifying marriage prob
lems by employing a pattern of ques

who is hesitant, and what each per
son talks about. She has worked out
a large scheme of fascinating "family
games" which she makes uses of in
her therapy.
