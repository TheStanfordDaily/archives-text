# KZSU To Sponsor Phila. Philharmonic
## 
### MALCOLM MacKENZIE 
The Philadelphia Orchestra,
with Eugene Ormandy conduct
ing, is coming to Stanford May
28th. Their Sunday afternoon
performance will feature the
works of Mozart, Ravel, Brahms
and the contemporary American
composer William Schuman.
Advance tickets for the univer
sity community—students, facul
ty, and staff—go on sale at spe
cial prices Monday in front of the
post office.
Program
The concert program ranges
from the classic period to 20th
Century American. KZSU and
the Committee on Public Exer
cises,. sponsors of the perform
ance, say that the program was
selected with this diversity in
mind. Mozart's Symphony No. 35
in D Major opens the program.
Called the "Haffner Symphony"
in honor of a friend of the Mo
zart family, the piece is consid
ered a masterpiece of the sym
phony-in-brief.
Schuman's New England Trip
tyoh reflects the religious and
patriotic values of early New
England. Although a 20th Cen
tury American work, the Trip
tych thematically derives from
three 18th Century pieces, one of
which the Continental Army
marched to during the Revolu
tion. Ravel's theme when he com
posed the Second Suite from
Daphnis and Chloe was the clas
sic Greek tale of Chloe's abduc

tion and restoration to her lover
Daphnis. The program's major
work, like Daphnis and Chloe,
is from the late 19th Century—
Brahm's Symphony No. 2 In D
Major. Hailed as a lyric master
piece of the Romantic period, the
symphony was acclaimed at its
premiere in 1877 and has re
tained popular and critical favor.
Ormandy
Eugene Ormandy and the Phil
adelphia Orchestra occupy a
unique position in the American
musical world. The Saturday Re
view has callcd Philadelphia "the
greatest orchestra in the world,"
and Newsweek recently de
scribed Ormandy as "the top
man of the top orchestra." In his
31 years at Philadelphia, Orman
dy's stylistic impact has been
such that critics often refer to
the "Philadelphia Sound" of Or
mandy's leadership.
Every orchestra is to some ex
tent a reflection of its conductor.
The Ormandy-Philadelphia rela
tionship shows this clearly, with
Ormandy himself claiming that
"an orchestra takes its sound
from its conductor." As proof,
observers have noted that Or
mandy can take any trained or
chestra and give it the "Philadel
phia Sound" in one rehearsal.
If Ormandy had been more
cautious In 1931, the "Philadel
phia Sound" might never have
come about. As a young musician
recently arrived in the United

States, Ormandy was asked at
the last minute to stand in for
guest conductor Arturo Tosca
nini. Ormandy's manager warned
that it would be folly for a young
unknown to take on such an as
signment, but Ormandy saw his
chance and capitalized on it.
Such a success was his Philadel
phia debut that the Minneapolis
Symphony immediately signed
him as Conductor. In 1936 he re
turned to Philadelphia as Con
ductor and Music Director, be
ginning a career which has
brought many honors and
"firsts" both to Ormandy and to
his orchestra.
The Orchestra
The orchestra itself is one of
the youngest in the country; its
first performance took place in
1900, and guided by its first
three conductors, the slow climb
toward artistic recognition be
gan. Flamboyant Leopold Stow
kowsky, Philadelphia's third
conductor, championed the
cause of modern music and gave
the orchestra an innovative im
age. Some hated Stowkowsky;
some loved him, but no one ig
nord him. On his arrival in
Philadelphia, Ormandy shifted
away from flamboyance and qui
etly began to build the orches
tra's present reputation. The
stress on new works continued,
without abandoning the famil
iar. Ormandy admits that his
personal taste runs to Beetho
ven and Mozart.

This blend of conservatism
and innovation has yielded both
artistic acclaim and popular
success. Harold Shonberg of the
New York Times speaks for the
critics in calling the Philadel
phia Orchestra "probably the
greatest virtuoso orchestra of
all time." And popular success
can be measured by the orches
tra's recorded repertoire, the
largest of any orchestra in the
world, and by three million-sell
er albums, a rare feat for se
rious music. The Philadelphia
orchestra was the first to be re
corded, the first to appear in
motion pictures and the first to
appear on television.
The Stanford concert repre
sents another first—the first ap
pearance in Frost Amphitheatre
by a major symphonic group
during the regular academic
year. This fact, plus the rarity
of major student-planned pro
ductions in the past, almost dis
couraged the KZSU staff mem
bers who originally conceived
the idea. That was almost three
years ago. "Luckily," remem
bers one staff member, "support
developed within the university,
and the way now seems clear
for more such student • origi
nated presentations in the fu
ture."
When tickets go on sale Mon
day here on campus, copies of a
specially - designed commemora
tive poster will also be available
in the Bookstore.

Eugene Ormandy
The Philadelphia Orchestra,
with Eugene Ormandy conduct
ing, is coming to Stanford May
28th. Their Sunday afternoon
performance will feature the
works of Mozart, Ravel, Brahms
and the contemporary American
composer William Schuman.
Advance tickets for the univer
sity community—students, facul
ty, and staff—go on sale at spe
cial prices Monday in front of the
post office.
Program
The concert program ranges
from the classic period to 20th
Century American. KZSU and
the Committee on Public Exer
cises,. sponsors of the perform
ance, say that the program was
selected with this diversity in
mind. Mozart's Symphony No. 35
in D Major opens the program.
Called the "Haffner Symphony"
in honor of a friend of the Mo
zart family, the piece is consid
ered a masterpiece of the sym
phony-in-brief.
Schuman's New England Trip
tyoh reflects the religious and
patriotic values of early New
England. Although a 20th Cen
tury American work, the Trip
tych thematically derives from
three 18th Century pieces, one of
which the Continental Army
marched to during the Revolu
tion. Ravel's theme when he com
posed the Second Suite from
Daphnis and Chloe was the clas
sic Greek tale of Chloe's abduc

tion and restoration to her lover
Daphnis. The program's major
work, like Daphnis and Chloe,
is from the late 19th Century—
Brahm's Symphony No. 2 In D
Major. Hailed as a lyric master
piece of the Romantic period, the
symphony was acclaimed at its
premiere in 1877 and has re
tained popular and critical favor.
Ormandy
Eugene Ormandy and the Phil
adelphia Orchestra occupy a
unique position in the American
musical world. The Saturday Re
view has callcd Philadelphia "the
greatest orchestra in the world,"
and Newsweek recently de
scribed Ormandy as "the top
man of the top orchestra." In his
31 years at Philadelphia, Orman
dy's stylistic impact has been
such that critics often refer to
the "Philadelphia Sound" of Or
mandy's leadership.
Every orchestra is to some ex
tent a reflection of its conductor.
The Ormandy-Philadelphia rela
tionship shows this clearly, with
Ormandy himself claiming that
"an orchestra takes its sound
from its conductor." As proof,
observers have noted that Or
mandy can take any trained or
chestra and give it the "Philadel
phia Sound" in one rehearsal.
If Ormandy had been more
cautious In 1931, the "Philadel
phia Sound" might never have
come about. As a young musician
recently arrived in the United

States, Ormandy was asked at
the last minute to stand in for
guest conductor Arturo Tosca
nini. Ormandy's manager warned
that it would be folly for a young
unknown to take on such an as
signment, but Ormandy saw his
chance and capitalized on it.
Such a success was his Philadel
phia debut that the Minneapolis
Symphony immediately signed
him as Conductor. In 1936 he re
turned to Philadelphia as Con
ductor and Music Director, be
ginning a career which has
brought many honors and
"firsts" both to Ormandy and to
his orchestra.
The Orchestra
The orchestra itself is one of
the youngest in the country; its
first performance took place in
1900, and guided by its first
three conductors, the slow climb
toward artistic recognition be
gan. Flamboyant Leopold Stow
kowsky, Philadelphia's third
conductor, championed the
cause of modern music and gave
the orchestra an innovative im
age. Some hated Stowkowsky;
some loved him, but no one ig
nord him. On his arrival in
Philadelphia, Ormandy shifted
away from flamboyance and qui
etly began to build the orches
tra's present reputation. The
stress on new works continued,
without abandoning the famil
iar. Ormandy admits that his
personal taste runs to Beetho
ven and Mozart.

This blend of conservatism
and innovation has yielded both
artistic acclaim and popular
success. Harold Shonberg of the
New York Times speaks for the
critics in calling the Philadel
phia Orchestra "probably the
greatest virtuoso orchestra of
all time." And popular success
can be measured by the orches
tra's recorded repertoire, the
largest of any orchestra in the
world, and by three million-sell

rious music. The Philadelphia

first performance took place in
1900, and guided by its first
three conductors, the slow climb
toward artistic recognition be
gan. Flamboyant Leopold Stow
kowsky, Philadelphia's third
conductor, championed the
cause of modern music and gave
the orchestra an innovative im
age. Some hated Stowkowsky;
some loved him, but no one ig
nord him. On his arrival in
Philadelphia, Ormandy shifted
away from flamboyance and qui
etly began to build the orches
tra's present reputation. The
stress on new works continued,
without abandoning the famil
iar. Ormandy admits that his
personal taste runs to Beetho
ven and Mozart.

This blend of conservatism
and innovation has yielded both
artistic acclaim and popular
success. Harold Shonberg of the
New York Times speaks for the
critics in calling the Philadel
phia Orchestra "probably the
greatest virtuoso orchestra of
all time." And popular success
can be measured by the orches
tra's recorded repertoire, the
largest of any orchestra in the
world, and by three million-sell
er albums, a rare feat for se
rious music. The Philadelphia
orchestra was the first to be re
corded, the first to appear in
motion pictures and the first to
appear on television.
The Stanford concert repre
sents another first—the first ap
pearance in Frost Amphitheatre
by a major symphonic group
during the regular academic
year. This fact, plus the rarity
of major student-planned pro

couraged the KZSU staff mem

the idea. That was almost three

Eugene Ormandy
The Philadelphia Orchestra,
with Eugene Ormandy conduct
ing, is coming to Stanford May
28th. Their Sunday afternoon
performance will feature the
works of Mozart, Ravel, Brahms
and the contemporary American
composer William Schuman.
Advance tickets for the univer
sity community—students, facul
ty, and staff—go on sale at spe
cial prices Monday in front of the
post office.
Program
The concert program ranges
from the classic period to 20th
Century American. KZSU and
the Committee on Public Exer
cises,. sponsors of the perform
ance, say that the program was
selected with this diversity in
mind. Mozart's Symphony No. 35
in D Major opens the program.
Called the "Haffner Symphony"
in honor of a friend of the Mo
zart family, the piece is consid
ered a masterpiece of the sym
phony-in-brief.
Schuman's New England Trip
tyoh reflects the religious and
patriotic values of early New
England. Although a 20th Cen
tury American work, the Trip
tych thematically derives from
three 18th Century pieces, one of
which the Continental Army
marched to during the Revolu
tion. Ravel's theme when he com
posed the Second Suite from
Daphnis and Chloe was the clas
sic Greek tale of Chloe's abduc

tion and restoration to her lover
Daphnis. The program's major
work, like Daphnis and Chloe,
is from the late 19th Century—
Brahm's Symphony No. 2 In D
Major. Hailed as a lyric master
piece of the Romantic period, the
symphony was acclaimed at its
premiere in 1877 and has re
tained popular and critical favor.
Ormandy
Eugene Ormandy and the Phil
adelphia Orchestra occupy a
unique position in the American
musical world. The Saturday Re
view has callcd Philadelphia "the
greatest orchestra in the world,"
and Newsweek recently de
scribed Ormandy as "the top
man of the top orchestra." In his
31 years at Philadelphia, Orman
dy's stylistic impact has been
such that critics often refer to
the "Philadelphia Sound" of Or
mandy's leadership.
Every orchestra is to some ex
tent a reflection of its conductor.
The Ormandy-Philadelphia rela
tionship shows this clearly, with
Ormandy himself claiming that
"an orchestra takes its sound
from its conductor." As proof,
observers have noted that Or
mandy can take any trained or
chestra and give it the "Philadel
phia Sound" in one rehearsal.
If Ormandy had been more
cautious In 1931, the "Philadel
phia Sound" might never have
come about. As a young musician
recently arrived in the United

States, Ormandy was asked at
the last minute to stand in for
guest conductor Arturo Tosca
nini. Ormandy's manager warned
that it would be folly for a young
unknown to take on such an as
signment, but Ormandy saw his
chance and capitalized on it.
Such a success was his Philadel
phia debut that the Minneapolis
Symphony immediately signed
him as Conductor. In 1936 he re
turned to Philadelphia as Con
ductor and Music Director, be
ginning a career which has
brought many honors and
"firsts" both to Ormandy and to
his orchestra.
