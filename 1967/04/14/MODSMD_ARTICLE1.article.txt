# SRI Protesters Get Protests And Denials
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON MICHAEL KUHL 
Students protested Stanford's in
direct involvement in the Vietnam
War yesterday in a rally at White
Plaza and a march on Stanford Re
search Institute. These activities were
protested by other students later in
the day.
At the rally, Experiment coordina
tor Barry Greenberg expressed dis
may at the "legitimation of schizo
phrenia" by men whose actions run
contrary to what they say. "Goodness
does not lie in good thoughts," he said,
"but in good actions, and in a fidelity
between what we say and what we
do."
"We have no hope of changing these
men's minds," he said, but hope lies
rather in "our own possibilities for an
authentic choice. To most of us the is
sue is not one of knowing but of fac
ing what we know and doing some
thing about It."
Speaking after him, Robert Haas, a
graduate in English, gave some in
formation about the Trustees' involve
ment in the war. He pointed to such
specific examples as FMC, manufac
turer of allegedly lethal gases and
other strategic defense materials, a
company which has had as many as
3 trustees and 3 directors of SRI on
its board.

Following the same line, Mitchell
Godman, a visiting lecturer in En
glish, talked about the "military-indus
trial-university" complex, referred to
the involvement of Harvard overseers
in defense and industry, and noted
that Harvard was the model for the
American university system.
Jay Neugeboren, a writer and pro
fessor of English, stated that "many
people think we should debate and dis
cuss the war in Vietnam. Many others,
and I number myself among them, no
longer want to protest the war. We
want to stop the war."
A number of groups and individuals
present offered differing views on
the rally.
The Ad Hoc Group for Equal Uni
versity Treatment circulated a peti
tion stating that the Experiment's re
quest for permanent housing should
be denied. The petition said that the
function of a university "is to bring
scholars together in a neutral forum
in which they may express views."
According to John Lucas, who
wrote the statement, the group "ob
jects to any voluntary group which
espouses one single idealogical and
political viewpoint obtaining perma
nent university housing. This is a
type of subsidy and represents the
sanction of the university."
Lucas added that the petition has

the support of the Executive Board
of the Stanford Area Young Repub
licans.
Another group, The Concerned Stu
dents for Responsible Debate, circu
lated another petition and attempted
to have dissenting speakers state
their opinions.
One of the members of the group,
Stanford YR president Bob Walker,
stated that he asked sponsors of the
rally if there was chance for him to
speak. Although they insisted they
would debate with him at another
time, "they said they would have only
speakers from their side at the rally,"
he claimed.
"The thrust of our group, which
hopes to obtain wide-based support,"
said Robert D. Clark, "is a protest
of the refusal to let other students
talk. We also protest the broad, sweep
ing attacks on people, the guilt by
association, and the statements made
against the war itself."
The most seething attack on the
rally came from Hubert Lindsay, a
lay preacher who works mainly on
the Berkeley campus. In his indict
ment of the rally sponsors, he stated:
"They are a miserable lot. They
talk about problems, but they can't
even solve their own. They talk about
peace, but I have never seen any of
these people get down on their knees
and pray for peace."
New Left Debate
Despite his challenge to meet any
"New Left member on campus in a
public debate," the crowd dwindled
after about five minutes.
Approximately 65 Stanford students
met at the Stanford Shopping Center
for the march to Stanford Research
Institute. They were joined at 3:30 by
a group of 75 high school students in
the United Student Movement.
The crowd was met with an occa
sional jeer from passing cars. The
majority of the employees drove by
the protestors quickly without look
ing at them.
A memorandum to SRI employees
from O. F. Senn, Vice President for
Technical Service, urged them to "stay
on the job and carry out our work as
signments. Avoid debate or alterca
tion with demonstrators if it becomes
necessary to pass through a picket
line—this is most important."
Untrue Accusations
Homer Meaders, manager of public
relations at SRI, called the Resistance
accusations "untrue." He insisted, "No
chemical or biological warfare wea
pons are being developed here at
SRI."
In reference to David Ransom's ar
ticle, he said, "Ransom has never ask
ed anyone in any position of authority
at SRI what is being done here."
Since the Army has its own center
for the development of chemical and
biological warfare weapons, "there
is no need for them to come to us."

function of a university "is to bring
scholars together in a neutral forum
in which they may express views."
According to John Lucas, who
wrote the statement, the group "ob
jects to any voluntary group which
espouses one single idealogical and
political viewpoint obtaining perma
nent university housing. This is a
type of subsidy and represents the
sanction of the university."
Lucas added that the petition has

the support of the Executive Board
of the Stanford Area Young Repub
licans.
Another group, The Concerned Stu
dents for Responsible Debate, circu
lated another petition and attempted
to have dissenting speakers state
their opinions.
One of the members of the group,
Stanford YR president Bob Walker,
stated that he asked sponsors of the
rally if there was chance for him to
speak. Although they insisted they
would debate with him at another
time, "they said they would have only
speakers from their side at the rally,"
he claimed.
"The thrust of our group, which
hopes to obtain wide-based support,"
said Robert D. Clark, "is a protest
of the refusal to let other students
talk. We also protest the broad, sweep
ing attacks on people, the guilt by
association, and the statements made
against the war itself."
The most seething attack on the
rally came from Hubert Lindsay, a
lay preacher who works mainly on
the Berkeley campus. In his indict
ment of the rally sponsors, he stated:
"They are a miserable lot. They
talk about problems, but they can't
even solve their own. They talk about
peace, but I have never seen any of
these people get down on their knees
and pray for peace."
New Left Debate
Despite his challenge to meet any
"New Left member on campus in a
public debate," the crowd dwindled
after about five minutes.
Approximately 65 Stanford students
met at the Stanford Shopping Center
for the march to Stanford Research
Institute. They were joined at 3:30 by
a group of 75 high school students in
the United Student Movement.
The crowd was met with an occa
sional jeer from passing cars. The
majority of the employees drove by
the protestors quickly without look
ing at them.
A memorandum to SRI employees
from O. F. Senn, Vice President for
Technical Service, urged them to "stay
on the job and carry out our work as
signments. Avoid debate or alterca
tion with demonstrators if it becomes
necessary to pass through a picket
line—this is most important."
Untrue Accusations
Homer Meaders, manager of public
relations at SRI, called the Resistance
accusations "untrue." He insisted, "No
chemical or biological warfare wea
pons are being developed here at
SRI."
In reference to David Ransom's ar
ticle, he said, "Ransom has never ask
ed anyone in any position of authority
at SRI what is being done here."
Since the Army has its own center
for the development of chemical and
biological warfare weapons, "there
is no need for them to come to us."
Students protested Stanford's in
direct involvement in the Vietnam
War yesterday in a rally at White
Plaza and a march on Stanford Re
search Institute. These activities were
protested by other students later in
the day.
At the rally, Experiment coordina
tor Barry Greenberg expressed dis
may at the "legitimation of schizo
phrenia" by men whose actions run
contrary to what they say. "Goodness
does not lie in good thoughts," he said,
"but in good actions, and in a fidelity
between what we say and what we
do."
"We have no hope of changing these
men's minds," he said, but hope lies
rather in "our own possibilities for an
authentic choice. To most of us the is
sue is not one of knowing but of fac
ing what we know and doing some
thing about It."
Speaking after him, Robert Haas, a
graduate in English, gave some in
formation about the Trustees' involve
ment in the war. He pointed to such
specific examples as FMC, manufac
turer of allegedly lethal gases and
other strategic defense materials, a
company which has had as many as
3 trustees and 3 directors of SRI on
its board.

Following the same line, Mitchell
Godman, a visiting lecturer in En
glish, talked about the "military-indus
trial-university" complex, referred to
the involvement of Harvard overseers
in defense and industry, and noted
that Harvard was the model for the
American university system.
Jay Neugeboren, a writer and pro
fessor of English, stated that "many
people think we should debate and dis
cuss the war in Vietnam. Many others,
and I number myself among them, no
longer want to protest the war. We
want to stop the war."
A number of groups and individuals
present offered differing views on
the rally.
The Ad Hoc Group for Equal Uni
versity Treatment circulated a peti
tion stating that the Experiment's re
quest for permanent housing should
be denied. The petition said that the
function of a university "is to bring
scholars together in a neutral forum
in which they may express views."

The crowd was met with an occa
sional jeer from passing cars. The
majority of the employees drove by
the protestors quickly without look
ing at them.
A memorandum to SRI employees
from O. F. Senn, Vice President for
Technical Service, urged them to "stay
on the job and carry out our work as
signments. Avoid debate or alterca
tion with demonstrators if it becomes
necessary to pass through a picket
line—this is most important."
Untrue Accusations
Homer Meaders, manager of public
relations at SRI, called the Resistance
accusations "untrue." He insisted, "No
chemical or biological warfare wea
pons are being developed here at
SRI."
In reference to David Ransom's ar
ticle, he said, "Ransom has never ask
ed anyone in any position of authority
at SRI what is being done here."
Since the Army has its own center
for the development of chemical and
biological warfare weapons, "there
is no need for them to come to us."
Students protested Stanford's in
direct involvement in the Vietnam
War yesterday in a rally at White
Plaza and a march on Stanford Re
search Institute. These activities were
protested by other students later in
the day.
At the rally, Experiment coordina
tor Barry Greenberg expressed dis
may at the "legitimation of schizo
phrenia" by men whose actions run
contrary to what they say. "Goodness
does not lie in good thoughts," he said,
"but in good actions, and in a fidelity
between what we say and what we
do."
"We have no hope of changing these
men's minds," he said, but hope lies
rather in "our own possibilities for an
authentic choice. To most of us the is
sue is not one of knowing but of fac
ing what we know and doing some
thing about It."
Speaking after him, Robert Haas, a
graduate in English, gave some in
formation about the Trustees' involve
ment in the war. He pointed to such
specific examples as FMC, manufac
turer of allegedly lethal gases and
other strategic defense materials, a
company which has had as many as
3 trustees and 3 directors of SRI on
its board.

Following the same line, Mitchell
Godman, a visiting lecturer in En
glish, talked about the "military-indus
trial-university" complex, referred to
the involvement of Harvard overseers
in defense and industry, and noted
that Harvard was the model for the
American university system.
Jay Neugeboren, a writer and pro
fessor of English, stated that "many
people think we should debate and dis
cuss the war in Vietnam. Many others,
and I number myself among them, no
longer want to protest the war. We
want to stop the war."
A number of groups and individuals
present offered differing views on
the rally.
The Ad Hoc Group for Equal Uni
versity Treatment circulated a peti
tion stating that the Experiment's re
quest for permanent housing should
be denied. The petition said that the
function of a university "is to bring
scholars together in a neutral forum
in which they may express views."
According to John Lucas, who
wrote the statement, the group "ob
jects to any voluntary group which
espouses one single idealogical and
political viewpoint obtaining perma
nent university housing. This is a
type of subsidy and represents the
sanction of the university."
Lucas added that the petition has

the support of the Executive Board
of the Stanford Area Young Repub
licans.
Another group, The Concerned Stu
dents for Responsible Debate, circu
lated another petition and attempted
to have dissenting speakers state
their opinions.
One of the members of the group,
Stanford YR president Bob Walker,
stated that he asked sponsors of the
rally if there was chance for him to
speak. Although they insisted they
would debate with him at another
time, "they said they would have only
speakers from their side at the rally,"
he claimed.
"The thrust of our group, which
hopes to obtain wide-based support,"
said Robert D. Clark, "is a protest
of the refusal to let other students
talk. We also protest the broad, sweep
ing attacks on people, the guilt by
association, and the statements made
against the war itself."
The most seething attack on the
rally came from Hubert Lindsay, a
lay preacher who works mainly on
the Berkeley campus. In his indict
ment of the rally sponsors, he stated:
"They are a miserable lot. They
talk about problems, but they can't
even solve their own. They talk about
peace, but I have never seen any of
these people get down on their knees
and pray for peace."
New Left Debate
Despite his challenge to meet any
"New Left member on campus in a
public debate," the crowd dwindled
after about five minutes.
Approximately 65 Stanford students
met at the Stanford Shopping Center
for the march to Stanford Research
Institute. They were joined at 3:30 by
a group of 75 high school students in
the United Student Movement.
