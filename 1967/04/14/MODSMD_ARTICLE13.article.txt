# After Protest Meeting
## London Students Disciplined 
### DOUGLAS RAYNOR 
(Note: The writer is present

London. The following is the
second half of a two-part re
port from the London School of
Economics.)
London School of Economics,
located in the center of a rich
business district in London, en
rolls about 2000 daytime under
graduate students and 1000 post
graduates. Of these, perhaps
one-third are overseas students,
primarily South African and
American. The school is man
aged by a Court of 72 Govern
ors, most of whom are wealthy
businessmen, and a Director.
Following the suspension of
two elected student leaders at
LSE, students occupied two of
the School's buildings. The stu
dents had been suspended in the
wake of a controversy over the
appointment to Director of LSE
of Dr. Walter Adams, previously
president of the University Col
lege of Rhodesia.
Led by Students' Union Presi
dent David Adelstein and an
American student, Marshall
Bloom, the students forced a
confrontation with the Board of
Discipline in February. After an
allegedly illegal protest meeting,
six students were called before
the Board of Discipline.
All six students were charged
with "joining with other stu
dents in deciding that that meet
ing be held on those premises
..." This meant participating in
the emergency Council meeting
on the afternoon of January 31.
This charge was dismissed.
There remained additional
charges against Bloom and Adel
stein. They were found guilty
of "causing or permitting a
gathering of students in the en
trance hall of the Old Building
to vote upon a proposal that
they transfer their meeting to
the Old Theater." Also, Adel
stein was found guilty of a
charge of "encouraging a gath
ering of students in the entrance
hall of the Old Building to de
mand admission to the Old
Theater."
Public Proposal
The basis of the charge is
clearly stated: "if any student
publicly puts a proposal to other
students which, if accepted, in
volves a clear breach of an order
of the Director, he is in our view
guilty of disobedience of that
order." It is mentioned that "At
no stage did they (Adelstein
and Bloom) suggest to the
crowd that as the Director had
banned the meeting the crowd
should disperse." TTiis criticism
appears three times. Speaking of
Adelstein, the report reads: "He
appears to have regarded him
self as a representative of the
students rather than their lead
er and that it was his duty to de
termine "the sense of the meet
ing" and to do what the meeting
wanted even though it involved
disobedience of the Director's
order." Of Bloom, the report
says: He "is a graduate and
should therefore exercise great
er responsibility than an under
graduate. ..."
The tone of this statement
from the Board of Discipline
and the philosophy behind it
served to reinspire the students
in their rejection of the validity
of the existing authority. The
students view their president as
a representative, not as a lead
er. The group in the foyer was
a Union meeting. A proposal
was offered and seconded, and
the Chairman was then obliged
to put It to a vote. It was not
his responsibility to impose any
thing on the meeting. In particu
lar, it was not his responsibility,

as the report suggests, to as
sure the Union that since, after
all, the meeting had been ban
ned the group should disband.
When not in the chair, he has
the right as a member of the
Union to advocate any course of
action; this is the exercising of
free speech. The Union felt the
degree to which the attitude of
the report would deny their abi
lity to conduct themselves re
sponsibly — an ability which the
Union reasserted beautifully in
its conduct during the next
week.
Guilty Verdict
Marshall Bloom, in a speech
after the guilty verdict, carried
the nature of the protest a step
further: "the only issue before
this Board is seen to be whether
students disobeyed an order. But
there are several issues which
are more relevant." He goes on
to speak of the ideal LSE as a
"community of free enquiry and
discussion" and to question
whether the Board itself serves
a legitimate role in the univer
sity community.
The sentences placed on Adel
stein and Bloom by the Board
were suspensions until the end
reached the Union meeting
ivhich had been awaiting it,
plans were quickly made for
an active protest. At this point
the entire Union was unified,
not only over principles, but al
so over tactics. Within 45 min
utes the meeting adjourned to
the foyer to begin a sit-in and
boycott of classes.
That night over 200 students
slept in the building, and on
following nights numbers rose
to 300, and one night to around
600. On Wednesday morning a
group of 100 students sat block
ing the doors to the administra
tion building, and were carried
off by police after being sus
pended by a professor who had
been given suspensory powers.
The suspensions were later
changed to 5 pound fines, which
have not been paid. On Friday
morning a march was held to
demonstrate student solidarity.
Between two and three thou
sand participated.
Meanwhile the Bloom and
Adelstein case was being ap
pealed, and was being consider
ed by the Standing Committee
of the Court of Governors,
which holds some of the same
members who sat on the Board
of Discipline. The Union met
Friday afternoon to await the
expected decision. General dis
cussion at this time showed the
Union had become widely divid
ed about future tactics. The
next Tuesday was the last day
of classes before the five-week
Easter vacation. Would the sit
in be continued over the holi
days?
Upheld Findings
The decision of the Commit
tee was finally announced. The
Committee upheld the findings
and the sentences of the Board,
with the exception that the two
suspended students would be al
lowed use of the School build
ings in order to use the library

and to visit tutors after a cer
tain date. Also Bloom would be
allowed to take his finals.
The Union was quite unhappy
with this outcome, but the de
bate over the proposed ending
of the sit-in continued. At 3 a.m.
the meeting was recessed until
the next afternoon, when six
more hours were spent in de
bate. Finally the vote was taken
and the motion was defeated,
with some feeling that it was
simply too early to make a de
cision.
The issue dangled somewhat
uncertainly until Monday, when
it was brought up again. Mean
while, work had been done on
the starting of seminars and
evening programs, as an at
tempt to shape the movement
into something constructive. At
the meeting Monday night the
Union did vote to end the sit-in.
When the meeting adjourned at
11:30 a group of students who
had never been seen at the
School during the movement
were seen hurrying towards the
door. The last Underground
trains run about a quarter to
twelve.
Many of those remaining
were deeply disappointed. Some,
who had worked hard through
the days of uncertainty and late
night meetings, and who felt
strongly committed to continue
the protest of the injustice done
to Adelstein and Bloom, felt
shattered. Discussion continued
and it was agreed that the dis
unity of the Union had been
the worst tragedy. That night
the motion was rewritten and
presented at Tuesday's meeting.
Reaffirm Protest
The new motion clearly reaf
firmed the protest against the
suspensions, ended the sit-in at
5 p.m., and instituted the Open
University as a "more effective
continuation" of the movement.
The motion was passed with
three dissenting votes. At 4:45,
the Union adjourned to the
foyer, where everybody sat and
sang for fifteen minutes. Then
it was over, and some of the
protesters gathered their things
and went home for the first
time in a week.
Some remained to work on
the Open University until the
buildings were locked on Thurs
day. Seminars were continued.
Over the holidays news of a
pound grant from a London or
ganization came, and invitations
to participate were sent out.
John-Paul Sartre was among
group of activists.
The week of March 13 carried
the confrontation of students
with the institution they are
trying to change far outside the
existing system in which discus
sion and questioning takes
place — a system which means
the locking of the buildings at
10:30 every night, the depen
dence of the students on the
whim of the "School" for the
use of its facilities; a system
which at the basis distinguishes
between the students and the
"School."

The Open University was
formed with the hope of pre
serving this independent con
frontation. The accomplishment
of the students of LSE in form
ing it within a week after the
authority system had sufficient
ly demonstrated its own intran
sigence was made possible only
by the participation of the stu
dents as a Union, rather than
the participation of a small
group of activists. The leader
ship of Marshall Blocrn, David
Adelstein, and others in looking
forward to a new era in educa
tion must be appreciated. The
future of the Open University of
London may be important to the
future of higher education.
