Drama at home: this Saturday, at 11:30 in the Nitery, the Speech
and Drama Department will present Strindberg's Miss Julie again.
Again, because the M.F.A. pupils staged the show in the Miedel
Room of the University Museum toward the end of last quarter. It
was a conspicuously good production of a difficult, 'psychological'
play and should deserve the 50c they are asking.

Drama abroad: ACT march from triumph to triumph in San
Francisco with a performance of Arthur Miller's Death Of A Sales
man which it would be heinous to miss.

The main event on Campus is indubitably the arrival of the Amer
ican Ballet Theater (see well-stretched photo above). Fresh from a
tour in Russia during the course of which they received standing
ovations and ecstatic applause from cities traditionally regarded as
the stronghold of the Bolshoi, they will offer two shows in the Me
morial Auditorium this Sunday.

The matinee program, scheduled to start at 2:30, will consist of

noted. Also in the matinee program: Balanchine's Theme And Vari
ations, set to the music of Tchaikovsky's third orchestral suite and
Eliot Feld's Harbinger, to the music of Prokofieff's G Major Piano
Concerto, The evening program kicks off at 8:30 and includes Ro
deo, the "Pas de deux" from Petipa's Black Swan, with music out
of Act III of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. MacMillan's Concerto

set to the magnificent thunder of Shostakovich's second Piano Con
certo.

San Francisco is becoming a veritable castle of Beethoven. Mae
stro Krips ('Josef' to friends) has recorded the complete sym
phonies. Now Rudolf Serkin will give all five piano concertos under
Krips baton, a tour de force which must be close to musical hubris.
From April 26 through May 5 Serkin will do each concerto once and
the Emperor twice. The opening night is "Beethoven Night" with
the third concerto, third symphony and "Egmont" overture.
