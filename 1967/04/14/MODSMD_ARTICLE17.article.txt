## 'Ulysses': Struggle For Existence 
### DAVID PROCHASKA 
A film has finally been made
of Ulysses.
And the film distributors
couldn't have done a worse job.
They scheduled it for a three
day run just before Easter.
They charged an exorbitant $4-
4.50 per seat. Their "once-in-a
lifetime" advertising warned
that the movie would be shelved
forever following its initial run.
But Ulysses was a critical and
popular success. Reviewers were
nearly unanimous in their
praise; it even made Life, with
nine stills, (March 31). Thus the
chances are quite good that it
will be screened again, if not in
the near future.
It is a film well worth seeing
— both as competent direction
and an excellent introduction to
the novel. Even those familiar
with Joyce seem to have been
led back to the novel by it. Jo
seph (The Balcony) Strick pro
duced, directed and co-authored
the script. Most of the actors
are from Dublin's Abbey Thea
ter.

Ulysses dwells primarily on
Stephen Dedalus (Maurice
Roeves), Leopold Bloom (Milo
O'Shea), his over-sexed wife
Molly (Barbara Jefford) and
their relationships with one an
other. Most of the main sequen
ces are included: Stephen's so
liloquy on the beach, Bloom's
argument in the pub, Leopold
and Stephen at Bella Cohen's
whorehouse and Molly's famous
book-end soliloquy.
By condensing the 750 page
novel into 140 minutes, Strick
has not produced a film which
replaces the book, but rather
one which aids understanding
through simplification. Strick
lacks the forceful, personal style
of a Bergman or an Antonloni
and relies Instead on tried-and
true techniques of contemporary
cinema.
Buck Mulligan's successive
swan dives are right out of
Marienbad. The use of fleeting
images — Stephen recalling his
mother, Blazes Boylan seducing
Molly—have been used succes
sively in The Pawnbroker, The
Knack and Hiroshima, Mon
Amour, among others.
And Strick has succeeded in
bringing Ulysses to the screen
where others, including Russian
director Sergei Eisenstein and
the venerable John Huston,
failed.

Yet his success is due to an
equal amount of will and luck.
In 1960 20th Century Fox ac
quired the film rights by making
it clear they would triple any
offer Strick made. Four years
later, their option ran out and
the rights went to Strick for
$75,000.
Acquiring the rights, however,
was simple compared to secur
ing financial backing. Investors,
remembering the history of the
plain brown-wrapper bestseller,
either shied away or attached
numerous strings to their of
fers. Life reports that one in

vestor wanted Tony Curtis to
play Bloom. "I cried," Strick re
calls, "He was serious."
It was decided at this time to
do one picture rather than a
hoped-for trilogy. Even so,
Strick had to assure backers the
film would not be banned by the
censors, with $60,000 surety.
Thus it is gratifying that the
film is even as uncompromising
as it is. tl is no more "daring"
than such current flicks as I, A
Woman, Dear John, or Alley
Cats. Yet we are still treated to
Buck Mulligan swandiving in
the nude, not once but several
times, the foulmouthed prosti

tutes of the Nighttown episode,
and above all to Molly's solilo
quy.
Bosley Crowther Is reportedly
afraid the film will encounter
censorship troubles if it returns,
Judge Woolsey notwithstanding.
Mr. Crowther has been wrong
before; let us hope he is wrong
again.
