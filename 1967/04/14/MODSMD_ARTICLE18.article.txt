## 
### 
(AP)â€”A "Gentle Thursday"
program is all right on the Uni
versity of Texas campus. But a
kiss-in? No.
So say University officials.
"Gentle Thursday" is part of
"Flipped-out Week" currently
being observed on the campus in
conjunction with the National
Spring Mobilization Against the
War in Vietnam (NSMAWV).
In announcing plans for "Gen
tle Thursday" the Students for a
Democratic Society, sponsors of
the week, said the day's activi
ties would include en masse kiss
ing.
But Edwin B. Price, coordina
tor of student activities, said
"no" to a kiss-in.
