# King To Speak On Civil Rights
## 
### STEVE JONES 
Civil rights leader Martin Luth
er King, Jr. will make his first ap
pearance at Stanford since 1964
when he speaks in Memorial Au
ditorium today at 3:30 p.m. He is
scheduled to discuss the civil rights
movement and its direction, lead
ership, and goals for the future.
Recently an active critic of Amer
ican policy in Vietnam, Dr. King
has condemned the administration
for the bombing of North Vietnam
and for their hypocrisy in support
ing "unconditional negotiations of
fers." He is presently involved In
the Spring anti-Vietnam war mo
bilization and will lead a march in
New York tomorrow.
Dr. King is President and one of
the founders of the Southern Chris
tian Leadership Conference. SCLC
is a loosely structured federation
of some three hundred nationwide
affiliates that adhere to the moral
Imperatives of a philosophy of non
violence deeply rooted in the think

lug of Jesus, Henry Thoreau, and
Mahatma Gandhi. It was formed
in January, 1957 and has since
been committed to the belief that
nonviolence can be an effective
tool in breaking: down conflicts be
tween racial and ethnic groups.
After being given much of the
credit for the effectiveness of civil
rights demonstrations in 1963, Dr.
King gained worldwide recognition
the following year when he was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was nominated by eight mem
bers of the Swedish Parliament
because "he had succeeded in keep
ing his followers to the principles
of nonviolence." He was the third
Negro and the youngest person
to receive the award.
The Stanford Political Union Is
sponsoring Dr. King's visit; their
president Charles Bell, will con
duct a question and answer session
after the talk. The lecture, which
is open to the general public, will
be broadcast over KZSU Friday
evening at *7:00.
