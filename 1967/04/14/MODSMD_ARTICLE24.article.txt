# Athletic Recruiting
## Tutoring; Editor's Opinion 
### Nick Selby 
(Last In a Series)
Among the criticisms of the
athletic recruiting Is that it
helps to get students of ques
tionable levels of intelligence
into the University because
these people are needed to par
ticipate in athletics. Despite
what the Admissions Office
states, the critics point to the
fact that the Athletic Depart
ment pays for tutoring as evi
dence of a presupposed lower
intelligence.
The Athletic Department
states that there is no special
tutor paid a salary by the Ath
letic Department. Pete Kmeto
vic, who helps athletes with
scheduling problems, says there
are 75 student-athletes out of
the 800 student-athletes at Stan
ford who ask for and receive tu
toring each year. The total num
ber of hours averages to about
six per person. Taylor states the
department pays about $1,000-
$1,500 per year to pay for the
tutoring. There is no investi
gation by the repartment as to
actual need before the tutoring
bills are paid by the department.
Taylor justifies the aid on the
basis that the University en
courages the boy to compete
whjn he comes here under a
Buck Club grant-in-aid. He feels
that the tutoring may assist a
student who might be having
difficulty in a particular subject.
He adds that it is certainly no
substitute for good study ef
forts, and that the source of
tutoring for student-athletes Is
the same for any other student.
The claim that the Athletic
Department does recommend
courses which seem to be easier
is also cited by critics. Pete
Kmetovic says he talks with
student-athletes and gets recom
mendations on courses which
seem to be easier. Taylor adds
that he feels every student, ath
lete or not, is generally familiar
with what may be considered
"easy" subjects and doesn't need
to ask.anyone except his fellow
students. Kmetovic also says
that these courses are a "one
quarter shot," only to help the
boy get back on his feet.
Taylor adds that the Athletics
Department has no control over
what courses exist in the cur
riculum. He also states that the
Athletics Department has no
control over boys getting into
certain courses.
Taylor concludes, "Too often,
critics tend to generalize about
every athlete or every type of
athlete after hearing about iso
lated cases. The critics are also
unwilling to see these cases in
light of the entire University.
Along with a student-athlete in
the so-called easy course will be
40-50 non-athletes.
THE EDITOR'S OPINION
Because certain conclusions
have not been stated, I now
want to give my opinion, as
Sports Editor, of the athletic re
cruiting situation at Stanford.
I do not think Stanford lures
athletes through promises of
easy admission, financial gifts,
or an easy academic load. I
think all the University officers
involved are completely aware
ot their responsibilities in main
taining an ethical athletic re
cruiting policy.
Ultimately, all discussions of
the athletic recruiting policy are
resolved into one question: what
place are athletics to have with
in the University? Stanford's
ethical system makes this THE
important question.
For, if Stanford no longer de
sires a degree of preeminence in
intercollegiate atfdetics, recruit
ing will not be needed. But to
continue its present level of
competition necessarily means
that Stanford must recruit.
Hopefully, Stanford will be able
to maintain its present high
standards in its recruiting pol
icy AND its athletic successes.
The question, I think, is one
of the most important the Pack

er Committee faces in its study
of education at Stanford.
Significant Checks
I believe there are significant
checks to prevent serious im
balances resulting from athletic
recruiting.
First in importance of these
checks is the policy of the Ad
missions Office. The statement:
"Athletes are not treated as a
special group by this office," if
it is really sincere, indicates
that this University will not
seek athletic successes at any
academic cost.
The Financial Aids Office
statements and the figures
about the student-athletes re
ceiving aid indicate to me that
this University is not interested
in buying athletes for intercol
legiate success.
The Athletic Department, I
feel, realizes its responsibility
to recruit using only normal
investigation procedures and
sales talk. It does not see every
student-athlete it desires enroll
ed, by any means.
It also sees the need for main
taining a serious level in the
work program. That certain
areas exist where the work isn't
really demanding or difficult, I
have no doubt. But specifics
which are not the rule can not
be used as the final basis for
opinion.
Genuine Source of Pride
In this situation, where, be
yond standard investigation and
information, there are no Uni
versity policies designed to as
sure athletic success, victories
become more meaningful for
Stanford than for other schools.
The NCAA swimming cham
pionship and the wrestling suc
cesses came without admission
and uncalled-for financial sup
port for special, separate
groups. They are therefore a
genuine source of pride for
everyone in the University,
from administrators to stu
dents.
As for the actual recruiting
process, the very decent suc
cess level indicates, considering
the handicaps of high admission
standards and high costs, a
phenomenal job.
I hope in the future the
coaches stress the educational
opportunities more — more re
cruits going to class would help
to strengthen the essential idea
that student-athletes at Stanford
are STUDENTS first and ath
letes second.
In this context, tutoring and
"easy" courses to help bolster

the GPA of a student-athlete
who considers himself primarily
an ATHLETE is totally unjusti
fied. Otherwise, if there is no
special setup for the athlete, as
the Athletic Department claims,
use of tutoring and taking
"easy" courses is as justified, if
it is at all, for student-athletes
as it is for other students.
Not Too Much Control
I don't think that athletics
control the student-athlete to
too great a degree. The situation
for the threat, "You'll lose your
grant-in-aid if you don't com
pete" may occur (and has). But
it is important to remember that
the great majority of student
athletes on grants-in-aid never
consider quitting, simply out of
love for a sport. Also, the Ath
letic Department will help the
student-athlete move to other
University aid or support him
until he has. Every student
athlete agonizes over the sac
rifices — academic and person
al — he must make. But sac
rifice Is part of success, and I
doubt that Stanford's student
would derive any satisfaction if
competing were made easier.
However, I feel athletics
should not become so important
or demanding that they prevent
or surplant true academic in
terest.
The criticism that student-ath
letes do not contribute to the
University is invalid. The fig
ures show that a substantial
part of the undergraduates do
enjoy Stanford's athletic con
tests. The student-athletes per
haps weld other students to
gether. Many contribute as stu
dents and personalities. These
are major contributions and jus
tify financial awards for those
who need them.
A Major Weakness
I am distressed that athletic
recruiting prevents the major
part of the student body from
competing. And I mean really
competing — there is too wide
a gap between the varsity foot
ball, basketball, and baseball
levels of competition, to name
a few, and the corresponding
levels of intramural competi
tion. The Athletic Department,
however, realizes that the gap
exists and is trying to solve the
financial and facility problems.
The facts of the policy and
my opinions, as much as space
allows, have been presented. It
remains for the reader to form
a sensible judgment on athletic
recruiting at Stanford and to
make his judgements known.
