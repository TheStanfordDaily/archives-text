# Ducks, Beavers To Sink In Diamond?
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
After winning 16 of 17 pre
league games the Stanford base
ball team jumps with both feet
Into its 17 game Pacific Eight
baseball schedule, hopefully
with the same success.
The Indians take on Oregon
State and Oregon in double
headers today and tomorrow.
Today's games with OSU will
start at 1:00, and Saturday's
games will begin at noon. All
four games will be in Sunken
Diamond.
Win Over Cal State
Strongman Ron Sho 11 s
knocked a home run in the bot
tom of the tenth Wednesday to
put down upset-minded Cal
State at Hayward, 2-1.
Stanford scored in the fourth,
but Cal St. tied it in the eighth.
Mark Marquess drove in the
Tribe's Frank Klinger.
Harvey Shank took over after
Hamm, Klinger, and Poteete and
received credit for the win.
Biff?
The Indians hope to scare the
new league this weekend. The
big question is: do the Cards
have the necessary poise and

desire for a conference title?
Friday, against OSU Sandy
Vance will pitch the first game
and Daro Quiring the second.
Don Rose and Rod Poteete will
pitch in Saturday's doublehead
er.
League Preview
USC and Stanford are co-fa
vored to win the first AAWU
baseball championship ever. Col
legiate Baseball News ranked
USC number one and Stanford
number two in their recent na
tional rankings. This gives an
indication of how close the race
will be.
The Trojans have dominated
college baseball for many years
and are so used to being win
ners that they could be favored
on that alone. But, they also
have the top CIBA hitter from
last year in catcher Steve Sogge,
some great pitching, and their
usual flock of outstanding J.C.
transfers.
UCLA lost some good players
by graduation, but it still has
enough power and hitting to
scare any pitcher. The Bruins'
win in the recent UC at River
side tourney was highlighted by
some fine pitching from their
previously shakey staff. They
beat last year's NCAA champ
Ohio State and a tough Brigham
Young team in the tourney.
Other Contenders
Washington State has a 13-2
record, has beaten Cal and
should be tough. OSU is a dark
horse and if USC, Stanford,
UCLA, and WSU concentrate on
each other too much, the Beav
ers could streak by them.
The rest, Cal, Washington, and
Oregon, could spoil the records
of the top contenders.
