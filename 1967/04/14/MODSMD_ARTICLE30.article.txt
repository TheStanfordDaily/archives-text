# Crew's One Home Meet
## Red Shells To Race 
### KERRY AHEARN 
Stanford's highly-rated oars
men will race USC, Oregon
State, and Santa Clara tomor
row morning in their only home
race of the season. Beginning at
9:00 on the Redwood City yacht
harbor course, the races will
lead off with the freshmen, fol
lowed by junior varsity, varsity
lightweight, and varsity races.
Highly successful in early
races, the oarsmen look toward
the season's important races
with Washington, California
U.C.L.A., and the other larger
west coast schools. The nucleus

of last year's varsity squad,
which defeated every other
western crew, has returned,
complemented by the "Fearsome
Foursome" of sophomore oars
men, and hardened by a sum
mer program which sent several
undergraduates to the World
Rowing Championships in Yu
goslavia last August.
Crew is an activity which,
more than in any other sport,
demands total body condition
ing; it is a little-known fact that
the legs, not the arms, make
the boat move. During winter
quarter, coach Will Condon pre

scribes three weight workouts,
three running workouts in the
stadium, and six rowing work
outs per week. Spring quarter
workouts begin at 5:45 p.m.
The Stanford Crew Associa
tion is one of the most effective
effective independent collegiate
rowing programs in the country;
although representing Stanford
in intercollegiate competition,
only a small fraction of the an
nual budget is paid for by ath
letic department funds, the re
mainder coming from private
contributions.
