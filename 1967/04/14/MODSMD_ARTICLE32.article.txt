# Jordan To Leave 'Team' Home
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
Stanford's tracksters journey
to Westwood this weekend to
face the Bruins of UCLA, last
year's NCAA champions.
Prospects are dim for Coach
Jordan's troops, as he is leaving
behind a squad of injured ath
letes more formidable than that
going.
Instead of the 22-23 men that
normally make up a traveling
squad, only 18 Indians will
make the trip south. Left be
hind are five of Stanford's best
competitors.
Jim Ward, who has one of the
top times in the conference in
the 440, is still recuperating
from a hamstring pull suffered
in the final 100 yards of the
mile-relay against Oregon State
and won't make the trip.
Also suffering from ham

string pulls are 16' 11" pole
vaulter Jim Eshelman and
sprinter Roger Cox.
Eshelman pulled up lame af
ter his winning vault last week
and has been unable to vault
since. Cox suffered his injury
over a month ago in practice
and is still unable to run hard.
Arnold Out
Also conspicuously absent
will be triple-jumper lan Ar
nold. Lan has a severe heal
bruise caused by a bone spur in
his heel. Arnold with a best of
49' 5", would have had excellent
competition, as UCLA's Gerald
Lee and Doug Ford have done
50' 0" and 48' 11" respectively.
Dave Harrington, a junior
shot putter also will not make
the trip. He fell on the all
weather track at Foothill last
weekend and injured his should

er. The Bruins have three shot
putters over 55' and should take
all three places.
Only Way is Up
While fully admitting that
this year's team stands to have
one of its worst seasons ever,
Coach Jordan maintains a note
of optimism. Though they lack
depth and have been slowed by
injuries, he says that he is
"very pleased with the perfor
mance of those who are com
peting," and thinks they will
pull some surprises before the
season is over.
Jordan said that the number
of men who have bettered their
previous best performances is
an indication of how well they
are performing this year. Stan
ford has mostly suffered having
no one to back up the few good
individuals.
