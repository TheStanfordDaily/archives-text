## Society Is Trying To Kill You 
### Tim Haight 
In that epic work Catch 22, a
World War II airman goes
through roughly this dialogue
with a friend:
"The Germans are trying to
kill me!"
"It's not you; they're trying to
kill everybody."
"What difference does that
make? . . .The U.S. Air Force
is trying to kill me."
"What?"
"They keep making me fly
over all these Germans who are
trying to kill me!"
One might accuse the airman
of being a bit paranoid, but to
day the situation is even clearer.
Our society is trying to kill us
by cigarette advertising, unsafe
cars, air pollution, stupid wars,
ulcers, and a million other ways.
And the question to ask today
is "Why work for a society that
is trying to kill you?"
Mad Enough To Kill
We are exploiting the under
developed world and making
those people mad enough to kill
us. Sixty percent of the world's
wealth is owned by the six per
cent of the world's population
that the United States compris
es, and, in fact, only a d a m n
small percentage of our people
control that wealth.
In a land that is so fat Its
average person is overweight,
where leisure class of teenagers
and students is as necessary to
the economy as our gargantuan
defense budget, where we must
have advertising and planned
obsolescence to make people buy
things they don't need, we are
keeping underprivileged and mi
nority groups bottled up. And

they are getting mad enough to
kill us.
And with reason. Forty mil
lion Negroes perished on the
boats during the years of the
slave trade, and forty million
more had the "good fortune" to
become slaves. If the white man
thinks he is going to be able to
ride that one out with clean
hands, he had better think
again.
"Rational" Killing
We are not only killing our
selves with work that we don't
have to do—from featherbed
ding to the frenetic pace of those
New York industries dedicated
to making the country think
something new and different is
"in"—we are killing others,
from the Indian starving in Cal
cutta, to the Vietnamese peas
ant, to God himself.
If God Is dead it is because
belief in him was not consonant
with the thinking that leads to
material goods. We are all so
rational. That way we can con
trol our environment and hurry
on the process of changing this
once-balanced world into man's
progeny and his products. Oe
cumenopolis, here we come.
And that thinking—that con
stant dividing and analyzing—
so effective in running a world
that is a machine (or more re
cently a cybernetic network)
has killed God. When the hippies
take LSD and suddenly see that
the crossword puzzle of the
world is not to be solved but to
be loved, the psychologist infers
brain damage.
We have so many sophisti
cated reasons why we must

store our surpluses, even at
great cost, and pay the farmer
not to produce, while the rest
of the world starves. We have
so many detached political scien
tists whose view of the war in
Vietnam that has killed 1,500,000
Vietnamese since 1945 is a well
informed shrug.
We are killing ourselves. We
drink alcohol, which is a recog
nized protoplasmic poison, and
outlaw marijuana, which is not.
We advertise cigarettes, cars
that have too much horsepower
for safe driving and which are
"unsafe at any speed," we sell
guns by mail-order.
Our organizations keep a man
from his family, pour three mar
tinis down his throat at lunch
and three more on the train
home, and put him to sleep with
pills. We are human-engineering
his life so that he will be able
to move quickly from one sev
enty-degree-glass-a n d - steel en
vironment to another without
knowing what season it is.
As Good As Bats?
We have created myths that
allow us to justify our aggres
sions while we have not devel
oped inhibitions as good as the
instinctive ones of any other
mammal, with the possible ex
ception of the rat. We have
somehow gotten so hooked on
all of these things that, like the
alcoholic who is perhaps the
archtypal figure of our society)
we go into war with the attitude
of "another drink"—"l know
this is killing me, but I've got
to do It."
And the irony of the whole
situation is that we don't have

to do it. Our society is fat
enough so that we could redirect
our resources and feed the starv
ing, reduce the hatreds of the
have-nots, give modern man the
time to find God, and the parent
time to know his child. But we
don't. Perhaps it is too late. But
there is nothing in this society
that says we have to work for it.

"Rational" Killing
We are not only killing our
selves with work that we don't
have to do—from featherbed
ding to the frenetic pace of those
New York industries dedicated
to making the country think
something new and different is
"in"—we are killing others,
from the Indian starving in Cal
cutta, to the Vietnamese peas
ant, to God himself.
If God Is dead it is because
belief in him was not consonant
with the thinking that leads to
material goods. We are all so
rational. That way we can con
trol our environment and hurry
on the process of changing this
once-balanced world into man's
progeny and his products. Oe
cumenopolis, here we come.
And that thinking—that con
stant dividing and analyzing—
so effective in running a world
that is a machine (or more re
cently a cybernetic network)
has killed God. When the hippies
take LSD and suddenly see that
the crossword puzzle of the
world is not to be solved but to
be loved, the psychologist infers
brain damage.
We have so many sophisti
cated reasons why we must

store our surpluses, even at
great cost, and pay the farmer
not to produce, while the rest
of the world starves. We have
so many detached political scien
tists whose view of the war in
Vietnam that has killed 1,500,000
Vietnamese since 1945 is a well
informed shrug.
We are killing ourselves. We
drink alcohol, which is a recog
nized protoplasmic poison, and
outlaw marijuana, which is not.
We advertise cigarettes, cars
that have too much horsepower
for safe driving and which are
"unsafe at any speed," we sell
guns by mail-order.
Our organizations keep a man
from his family, pour three mar
tinis down his throat at lunch
and three more on the train
home, and put him to sleep with
pills. We are human-engineering
his life so that he will be able
to move quickly from one sev
enty-degree-glass-a n d - steel en
vironment to another without
knowing what season it is.
As Good As Bats?
We have created myths that
allow us to justify our aggres
sions while we have not devel
oped inhibitions as good as the
instinctive ones of any other
mammal, with the possible ex
ception of the rat. We have
somehow gotten so hooked on
all of these things that, like the
alcoholic who is perhaps the
archtypal figure of our society)
we go into war with the attitude
of "another drink"—"l know
this is killing me, but I've got
to do It."
And the irony of the whole
situation is that we don't have

to do it. Our society is fat
enough so that we could redirect
our resources and feed the starv
ing, reduce the hatreds of the
have-nots, give modern man the
time to find God, and the parent
time to know his child. But we
don't. Perhaps it is too late. But
there is nothing in this society
that says we have to work for it.
In that epic work Catch 22, a
World War II airman goes
through roughly this dialogue
with a friend:
"The Germans are trying to
kill me!"
"It's not you; they're trying to
kill everybody."
"What difference does that
make? . . .The U.S. Air Force
is trying to kill me."
"What?"
"They keep making me fly
over all these Germans who are
trying to kill me!"
One might accuse the airman
of being a bit paranoid, but to
day the situation is even clearer.
Our society is trying to kill us
by cigarette advertising, unsafe
cars, air pollution, stupid wars,
ulcers, and a million other ways.
And the question to ask today
is "Why work for a society that
is trying to kill you?"
Mad Enough To Kill
We are exploiting the under
developed world and making
those people mad enough to kill
us. Sixty percent of the world's
wealth is owned by the six per
cent of the world's population
that the United States compris
es, and, in fact, only a d a m n
small percentage of our people
control that wealth.
In a land that is so fat Its
average person is overweight,
where leisure class of teenagers
and students is as necessary to
the economy as our gargantuan
defense budget, where we must
have advertising and planned
obsolescence to make people buy
things they don't need, we are
keeping underprivileged and mi
nority groups bottled up. And

they are getting mad enough to
kill us.
And with reason. Forty mil

Vietnamese since 1945 is a well
informed shrug.
We are killing ourselves. We
drink alcohol, which is a recog
nized protoplasmic poison, and
outlaw marijuana, which is not.
We advertise cigarettes, cars
that have too much horsepower
for safe driving and which are
"unsafe at any speed," we sell
guns by mail-order.
Our organizations keep a man
from his family, pour three mar
tinis down his throat at lunch
and three more on the train
home, and put him to sleep with
pills. We are human-engineering
his life so that he will be able
to move quickly from one sev
enty-degree-glass-a n d - steel en
vironment to another without
knowing what season it is.
As Good As Bats?
We have created myths that
allow us to justify our aggres
sions while we have not devel
oped inhibitions as good as the
instinctive ones of any other
mammal, with the possible ex
ception of the rat. We have
somehow gotten so hooked on
all of these things that, like the
alcoholic who is perhaps the
archtypal figure of our society)
we go into war with the attitude
of "another drink"—"l know
this is killing me, but I've got
to do It."
And the irony of the whole
situation is that we don't have

to do it. Our society is fat
enough so that we could redirect
our resources and feed the starv
ing, reduce the hatreds of the
have-nots, give modern man the
time to find God, and the parent
time to know his child. But we
don't. Perhaps it is too late. But
there is nothing in this society
that says we have to work for it.
In that epic work Catch 22, a
World War II airman goes
through roughly this dialogue
with a friend:
"The Germans are trying to
kill me!"
"It's not you; they're trying to
kill everybody."
"What difference does that
make? . . .The U.S. Air Force
is trying to kill me."
"What?"
"They keep making me fly
over all these Germans who are
trying to kill me!"
One might accuse the airman
of being a bit paranoid, but to
day the situation is even clearer.
Our society is trying to kill us
by cigarette advertising, unsafe
cars, air pollution, stupid wars,
ulcers, and a million other ways.
And the question to ask today
is "Why work for a society that
is trying to kill you?"
Mad Enough To Kill
We are exploiting the under
developed world and making
those people mad enough to kill
us. Sixty percent of the world's
wealth is owned by the six per
cent of the world's population
that the United States compris
es, and, in fact, only a d a m n
small percentage of our people
control that wealth.
In a land that is so fat Its
average person is overweight,
where leisure class of teenagers
and students is as necessary to
the economy as our gargantuan
defense budget, where we must
have advertising and planned
obsolescence to make people buy
things they don't need, we are
keeping underprivileged and mi
nority groups bottled up. And

they are getting mad enough to
kill us.
And with reason. Forty mil
lion Negroes perished on the
boats during the years of the
slave trade, and forty million
more had the "good fortune" to
become slaves. If the white man
thinks he is going to be able to
ride that one out with clean
hands, he had better think
again.
"Rational" Killing
We are not only killing our
selves with work that we don't
have to do—from featherbed
ding to the frenetic pace of those
New York industries dedicated
to making the country think
something new and different is
"in"—we are killing others,
from the Indian starving in Cal
cutta, to the Vietnamese peas
ant, to God himself.
If God Is dead it is because
belief in him was not consonant
with the thinking that leads to
material goods. We are all so
rational. That way we can con
trol our environment and hurry
on the process of changing this
once-balanced world into man's
progeny and his products. Oe
cumenopolis, here we come.
And that thinking—that con
stant dividing and analyzing—
so effective in running a world
that is a machine (or more re
cently a cybernetic network)
has killed God. When the hippies
take LSD and suddenly see that
the crossword puzzle of the
world is not to be solved but to
be loved, the psychologist infers
brain damage.
We have so many sophisti
cated reasons why we must

store our surpluses, even at
great cost, and pay the farmer
not to produce, while the rest
of the world starves. We have
so many detached political scien
tists whose view of the war in
Vietnam that has killed 1,500,000
Vietnamese since 1945 is a well
informed shrug.
