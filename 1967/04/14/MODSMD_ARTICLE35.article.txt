## War Spectators: Death Of The Intellect 
### Joel Kugelmass 
One recalls a poignant mo
ment in King Lear. Gloucester,
blinded by Edward's bare hands,
is wandering alone on the
heath. His son, Edmund, en
counters Gloucester as he, too,
wanders, disguised as an idiot.
Gloucester asks Edmund, whom
he does not recognize, for gui
dance to a cliff so that he might
jump and be dashed to bits
against the rocks. With a son's
love, Edward leads his father
to a little rise, Gloucester jumps
and falls a foot, failing.
Imagine, instead of Glou
cester, a man who very much
wants to live. He is blindfolded
by a Sergeant Edward and
taken into a helicopter. The heli
copter rumbles and rises three
feet above the earth. It might
be, for all the blind suspect
might know, miles into the sky.
The mute suspect is then thrown
from the machine. He falls the

three feet screaming and then
lies upon the ground quivering,
crazed, rolling about like a poi
soned dog.
Eye-Witness Report
Imagine, then, that this man
is then taken to a hill, which he
must run down blindfolded or be
shot. He runs. Soon he trips on
a little fcnce of barbed wire. He
falls into a tanglewood of more
wire, unprotected and pricked
the length of his body.
This man, sounding agony,
is taken to another hill on which
he falls sobbing and mad . . .
He often admits then that he is,
indeed, Viet Cong, a "Gook."
(This anecdote is from a eye
witness account.)
It is not coincidental that a
play concerning the unlimited
brutality of men should be out
done by the war in Vietnam.
More important, it is not acci
dent that the students and schol

ars of the University are specta
tors to both.
When we, as members of the
University, speak of the war, we
inevitably must also speak of
ourselves. When, conversely, we
speak of the University, we
must also direct ourselves to the
War. An easy point, perhaps. A
point, however, undone in the
cry for purity.
We must examine whether in
fact the spectator's role, a role
necessarily invested in the ful
fillment of the intellect, admits
of the purity avowed by college
Presidents. The assertion "that
the University shall not be a po
litical proving ground" has no
legitimacy.
The distance we achieve from
a Shakespearean drama has no
parallel in the awful drama of
Vietnam. The assumption that
there is a parallel presupposes a
detachment ungrounded in fact.

I am not only speaking of the
deep complicity of the Univer
sity's directorship; I am speak
ing of the cultural and social en
tanglement of the university in
a country unified in the cause of
Imperialism and the method of
murder.
Mocking Cry
When the student is being
trained to fulfill himself through
the production of war material,
when the teacher is advising the
military, when the "neutral" is
drafted, the cry for a pure uni
versity mocks the cryer. The
achievement of purity will not
be an ethical triumph, but a so
ciological one. Purity we cannot
maintain until it obtains; if we
value it, we must seize it. It is
not bestowed, but won.
The "fight for freedom" in
Vietnam reflects itself in the
growing disintegration of the
University's independence. Those

"apathetics" must be recognized
as a source of passive consen
sus. Neutrality is not possible in
a world aligning the neutral
with the majority. Boethius is
dead; in prison all are prisoners.
The immaculate perceptions of
those "disinterested" exude an
ugly innocence, frought with il
-lus or y Romanticism, unwel
comed by the critical mind.
Suspicious Silence
There might be a time, per
haps there once was a time,
when political rebellion and pro
test might bo the soilure of the
University. Now, however, it is
the imperative prelude to any
cloansing. We must wonder why
the hostility to the University,
so constant in United States his
tory, has abated. We must sus
pect this silence.
We can well theorize that the
quiet follows the victory of that
hostility; it is the quiet of a bat
tlefield that has been taken. We
have become the Bible readers
of a brave new world. Can we
dare to eat bread like the little
boy in Bergman's "Virgin
Spring?" Recall that he had his
humanity to sicken.
The University has always and
rightfully been reluctant to put
aside its books, even for a mo
ment. The Stanford Observer
says students do so to eat pan
cakes. How nice. How pathetic.
How horrible. With Camus, we
see that this reluctance is not an
obstacle, but a strength. When
the University finds itself obli
gated to act, action is the high
est obligation. When scholars
suprsede their reluctance, they
lead men with misgivings more
petty.
No Time For Tears
We used to weep for the Viet
namese. Now we weep for our
selves. The time for tears is
done. We can take, perhaps, our
image from Rieux, a doctor. The
University now is not the guar
dian of the intellect, but its mor
tician. The intellect requires no
embalming. We should rather
look at it, remember it, and
struggle for its rebirth.
The renaissance of the intel
lect is, as always, simultaneous
with the rebirth of civilization.
There is no other alternative;
all else is fraud.
