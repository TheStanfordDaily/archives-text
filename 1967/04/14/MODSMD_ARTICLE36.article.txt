# Scene and Herd
## Suspension Proposed For 'Poster Gang' 
### Fritz Schaefer 
No student is forced by Stan
ford University to attend classes
here. In fact, in order to obtain
the privilege of attending Stan
ford, one must not only pay
$1575 a year, but also agree to
uphold something called the
Fundamental Standard.
The Fundamental Standard
isn't a surprise that gets popped
on us when we first walk
through the Quad. The admis
sions office makes it very clear
that in order to obtain the
privilege of attending Stanford,
one must accept this basic so
cial contract. Among other
things, the Fundamental Stan
dard says that "the maintenance
of student rights and privileges
depends upon mature and re
sponsible conduct."
Posters Aocus«
Our campus is presently ex
periencing a flagrant violation
of the Fundamental Standard.
I refer to the posters which are
being distributed, apparently by
the Experiment. These posters

show a picture of President Ster
ling next to a scene from the
war in Vietnam.
The posters accuse President
Sterling, the Board of Trustees,
the Stanford Research Institute,
and presumably all students
who aren't members of the Ex
periment of "complicity in war
crimes" and various other forms
of "immorality" with respect to
the war in Vietnam.
The assumption that Stanford
University — as a part of Amer
ican Society — has silently sup
ported the war in Vietnam, is in
a sense true. However, the state
ment that President Sterling
and the Board of Trustees are
war criminals is not only incor
rect but about as far from "re
sponsible conduct" as one can
get. This is the violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
No Confining Wall
If the backers of these posters
feel, as they claim, that Stan
ford is incorrigibly immersed in
sin, their logical move should be

to drop out of Stanford. There
is no Berlin Wall which confines
them to the environs of Stan
ford University.
Realistically, the poster gang
probably won't opt to leave Stan
ford. Barry Greenberg and his
boys will say that their presence
is needed to enlighten the rest
of us lost souls in the hope
that someday, with the help of
a massive indoctrination pro
gram, headed by The Daily, we
can be rehabilitated.
There is no reason for Stan
ford students, faculty, or admin
istration to tolerate this gross
abuse of "academic freedom."
Disciplinary action must be
taken against the accusers of
President Sterling and the Trus
tees. Unfortunately, this kind of
action is supposed to go through
Chairman Martin Gerry's Judi
cial Council.
Same Old Problem
And this brings us through a
full circuit and back to the same
old problem — the conflict of in

terest between the Stanford stu
dents and the Student Establish
ment. Martin Gerry is a mem
ber of the in-crowd and as such
would probably take a dim view
of suspending any of his Ex
periment friends. This situation
exemplifies the mood of Stan
ford student government.
In the face of a clear violation
of the Fundamental Standard,
we the students are confronted
with a situation in which the
entrenched nature of the Stu
dent Establishment makes it im
possible for us to take any ac
tion whatsoever. Only President
Sterling and the Board of Trus
tees have the unconstrained
power to take the necessary ac
tion against the offenders.
Historical note: students at
the University of Michigan have
recently formed an organization
called SPASM — the Society for
the Prevention of Asinine Stu
dent Movements.
