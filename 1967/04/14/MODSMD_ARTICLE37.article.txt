## Rebels Not Always Creative 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Fishman's desire for a re
evaluation of admission policies
is shared by many members of
the Stanford community, but
one would question the direction
of his attack. Stanford should
definitely welcome "the guy who
spends his afternoon reading
Dostoevsky or devising a new
proof for the Pythagorean The
orem," but is not this student
likely to have the self-discipline
and the modicum of intelligence
necessary to perform the rela

tively simple tasks demanded of
the high school student?
While extroverted athlete
leaders may not be the most de
sirable Stanford students, are in
troverted "rebels" the best sub
stitutes? One wonders also how
Mr. Fishman proposes that
these "rebels" be selected. Is
uniform condemnation by his
high school to be the criterion of
a Stanford student?
Is the ability to make oneself
unpopular with one's teachers
and fellow students really any
more indicative of critical think
ing than the ability to make one
self popular? Is the student who
reacts to intellectual boredom
with ineffectual and undirected
rebellion any more likely to
demonstrate creativity than
those who pin their hopes for
stimulation on the university
they are striving to attend?
Stanford would do well to put
more emphasis on creative abil
ity and intellectual curiosity
than on athletic prowess and
personal popularity, but one
can't help thinking that a cam
pus of unthinking Homecoming
Queens would be preferable to
a campus of unthinking malcon
tents. There would at least be
more peace for those who de
sired it in order to seek an edu
cation.

• IS ever There
Editor, The Dally:
When Professor Brooks Otis
urges those of us in the Stan
ford community who oppose
United States policy in Vietnam
to engage in "specific, reason
able, tolerant, public and reit
erated debate," I can only won
der where my respected col
league has been for the last two
years. I have never seen him
stand up to question any of our
assumptions or facts during the
countless number of faculty and
student seminar and discussion
groups. Indeed, I have never
seen him present at any of these
functions.
No less perplexing is Profes
sor Otis's apparent belief that
Robert M. Brown and Michael
Novak are motivated in their
Vietnam criticism by pacifist
considerations. Nothing could be
further from the facts.
His letter is disturbingly un
clear as to whether Brown and
Novak are included among the
"self-righteous" he finds so com
mon among the protesters of
this war. I think I speak for
both of these gentlemen in say
ing they too oppose uncritical
dogmatism.
Finally, I suggest that his own
presupposition that Lyndon B.
Johnson and Hubert Humphrey
are honest men (a statement de
voutly to be wished) may not
be grounded in the theology he
espouses. I ask Professor Otis
sincerely to question whether he

has overcome the "credibility
gap" by reasonably weighing
the evidence or through the less
arduous leap to the proposition
that no American president is
capable of knowing the right
and doing the wrong. While sin
may be ignorance to home hu
manists, a different premise de
fines Christian anthropology.

• Apathists, Repent!
Editor, The Dally:
I was very disturbed by
Brooks Otis' letter to The Daily
Monday. I was frightened by
his statement that "Pacifists al
so are sinners." Dr. Otis said
that pacificists "must take re
sponsibility for what happened
to several million Jews," and I
agree to a point. Those pacifists
that committed the sin of
apathy are guilty, but they are
not guilty because they are
pacifists.
America is guilty because it
did nothing as Hitler rose to
power, not because it did noth
ing violent. America, with not
able exceptions, viewed Hitler
as an ephemeral aberration on
a distant horizon, and stuck its
head under its isolationist shell.
This is apathy, not pacifism,
and it is tearing our system to
red, white, and blue shreds.
