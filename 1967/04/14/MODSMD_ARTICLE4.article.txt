## Frats Lament High Cost Of Living 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
Rush at Stanford is an expensive
proposition.
Fraternities spend anywhere from
two hundred to twelve hundred dol
lars on the various expenses associat
ed with rush. In most houses the
funds are obtained from both the
actives and the now pledges but in
some either one or the other foots
the entire bill. Among the fraternities
interviewed, pledge fees range from
twenty-five to one-hundred dollars.
In every case this fee was designated
to cover the costs of rush, including
"pledge banquets."
They reported that the fees were al
located differently in different frater
nities.
Most said the major expense was
the bid parties at which rushees are
extended formal invitations to pledge.
Although the parties are essentially
rush parties, part of the costs can be
met with social fees since all actives
are usually required to attend. Fines
are sometimes imposed upon those
who fail to come.
At a typical party mixed drinks are
served, and a band provides entertain

ment. Actives are instructed to meet
all the rushees and to try to make
sure they enjoy themselves. The rush
chairman provides dates and trans
portation for those freshmen who
need them.
Food, Drink, Flowers
Other expenses incurred by frater
nities during the course of rush
usually include lunches and dinners
for rushees, flowers for rush host
esses, non-alcoholic refreshment for
open houses, bookkeeping supplies
and a telephone for the rush chair
man.
Most fraternities profess to believe
that the relative success of rush does
not depend upon the amount of mon
ey spent but on the other factors.
Chief among these are, in order of
the frequency mentioned, the person
alities of the actives, "image" of the
fraternities on campus, vigor of rush
chairmen, condition of the house
building, number of members, and
reputation of the national.
Attitudes on the success of this
year's rush ranged from"the best
we've had" to "barely enough to keep
us going". More than one frater

nity blames the "slackness" of this
year's freshman class for the poor
turnout at some of their rush func
tions. One rush chairman feels "fresh
men are no longer impressed by ex
pensive parties at some sumptuous
pad in San Francisco."
Others agree that larger rush bud
gets cannot guarantee an outstand
ing pledge class, but the cluster
houses and the growing popularity
of off-campus living are necessitating
more effort on the part of fraternities
during rush.
Financial Trouble
The new cluster houses accommo
date up to fifty-five men each and
must be occupied by at least forty
five to break even financially.
Several chapters of well-known na
tional fraternities are reportedly on
the brink of financial ruin but must
spend the money they feel is neces
sary to secure a pledge class big
enough to enable them to keep their
head above water.
Fraternity men offered several sug
gestions for reducing the cost of rush.
Several felt that if more contact be
tween freshmen and the fraternities
was permitted, fewer houses would
attempt to impress freshmen by
spending what they feel are exhor
bitant amounts for rush.
