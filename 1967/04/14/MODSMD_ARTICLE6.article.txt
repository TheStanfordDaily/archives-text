# FRANCE XIII, ITALY XIII
## Reduced Enthusiasm Marks Overseas Stay 
### KIRK HANSON 
Are Stanford's overseas campus stu
dents spending more now and en
joying it less? Yes, says The Stanford
Daily overseas campus poll given to
students returning three weeks ago
from Stanfordin-France and Stan
ford-in-Italy.
Increased spending and decreased
enthusiasm characterized the re
sponses of those who participated in
the poll, 30 of the 78 students at Tours
and 50 of the 88 at Florence. An iden
tical poll was given six months ago
to the preceding groups at each cam
pus.

While general enthusiasm for the ex
perience is evident, the enthusiasm is
significantly less than six months ago.
Only 70% of the students said they
would return to the French or Italian
campuses if they had the decision to
make over again. The previous groups
had responded 95% yes in Italy and
85% yes in France.
Water, Water Everywhere
The returning Italy group was in
Florence at the time of the November
floods and this greatly affected their
experience. France students com
plained of incessant rain during their
six months.

Both groups reported increased
spending. The fall-winter groups have
generally been assumed to spend less
than the spring-summer groups due
to lower prices in the non-tourist sea
son but this was not the case with
these two returning groups.
Last year's spring-summer group
in Italy averaged $1051 spent for ex
penses excluding room, board, tui
tion, and flight home. This group av
eraged $1113 per person. In France
the figure went up from $916 to $931.
The Overseas Campus Office esti
mates a reasonable modest sum to
be $600.. Only 2 of the 80 surveys

showed a figure this low.
Students rated the locations of
their campuses as good to excellent,
and had few of the criticisms which
have been heard from students at
Stanford-in-Austria and Stanford-in-
Britain. Accommodations and library
facilities were considered fair to good
at both campuses while the food at
Stanford-in-France was termed fair to
poor. Both campuses complained of
inadequate facilities.
Liberalized social regulations con
cerning open houses, liquor, and trav
el went into effect at the two campus
es in January. Both campuses classi
fied the new regulations "just right to
slightly restrictive," whereas the
groups returning six months ago over
whelmingly thought them "much too
restrictive."
Lack of Contact
Efforts were made with Italy XIII
to increase contact with the Italians
through a family program, but con
tact remained very slight. Last spring
summer 70 per cent in Florence said
they had contact with the local people
"seldom" or never.
This fall-winter the students ex
pressed a similar lack of contact, with
over 70 per cent stating they seldom
or never had contact with Florentine
families. While a few more had con
tact with students, the majority still
seldom did. While there were several
different suggestions for increasing
contact with the Florentines, many
students blamed themselves for not
taking advantage of the opportunities
there were.
In France almost all students re
ported contact with the local people
often to very often. However, some
had criticisms of the artificiality of
the conversation partners that each
Stanford student has at Tours. Sug
gests one student: "Why not let
French University students live in our
building or make living in Tours with
families an option?"
Study And Travel
Both Italy XIII and France XIII
thought their academic load "just
right." However 80 per cent in France

and 50 per cent in Italy criticized the
courses for not being related enough
to the local environment. Both cam
puses rated their language courses
good but students and the Italian cam
pus complained of too much transla
tion and not enough reading and con
versation. Many complained these
courses were too easy.
Weekend travel remained a signifi
cant part of the overseas experience
for both groups, although the Italian
students were limited fall quarter by
flood relief work, and both groups
were curtailed slightly by the winter
weather. France XIII averaged 5-6
weekend trips a quarter per student
while Italy XIII averaged four per
person.
Even though social regulations
were liberalized and open house
hours introduced at the overseas cam
puses, the Stanford men still seemed
dissatisfied with the social situation.
One male in Italy XIII complained of
the "monastic life the men of the Vil
la are forced to lead. Villa girls leave
something to be desired, that is the
few girls there are," he writes. The
ratio was changed for groups XIII
from equal men and women to about
50 men and 30 women.
The Florentine Female
The Stanford-in-Italy male says
"Florentine girls are impossible: talk
to them and you are either a) hauled
into police headquarters or b) mar
ried to them immediately." One male
member of Italy XIII found "b" to
be true.
A France XIII male simple notes:
"More girls needed â€” the quantity
here now is poor and the quality is
too." He did not say if he was a trans
fer from Princeton.
A poll of the returning group from
Austria was taken by the Overseas
Campus Board and it discovered that
Austria XIII favored a move to Vien
na almost unanimously, although
they had great praise for the oppor
tunities for contact with the Aus
trians in Semmering. Such a move
was approved over a month ago.
