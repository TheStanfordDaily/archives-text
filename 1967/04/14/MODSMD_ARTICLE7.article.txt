# Africans Celebrate Freedom Day In Cultural, Educational Program
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
Tomorrow, April 15, is Africa Free
dom Day. Ever since April, 1958,
when eight independent African na
tions met in Ghana to discuss ways
of co-ordinating their foreign policies,
Africa Freedom Day has symbolized
the attempts of all freedom-loving
people to rededicate themselves to
the task of eliminating social injus
tice.
In conjunction with Africa Free
dom Day the Organization of African
Students at Stanford is sponsoring
Campus Africa Weeks, beginning to
morrow and continuing until April
29.
The purpose of Africa Campus
Weeks is to organize regular pro
grams of educational, cultural, and
entertaining nature for the members
of the Stanford and San Francisco
Bay Area communities. With the help
of the Institute of International Re
lations and the Bechtel International
Center, the Organization of African
Students at Stanford has been able

to plan a diversified program which
will enable African students to share
the cultural wealth and knowledge
of their countries, peoples and art.
One of the main events of the two
week period will be an exhibit of
African art entitled "Africa — the
History, Ancient Kingdoms, the New
Africa, Senegal." The works of art
will be exhibited in the Hoover Insti
tution and Tresidder Union. The art
will go up tomorrow and will remain
up until the end of the two weeks.
On Africa Freedom Day, there will
be an Evening Abroad in the I-Cen
ter. Featured will be a film entitled
"Commonwealth of Nations," a talent
show and a show of African fashions.
Honorable Makamr
The high point of Africa Campus
Weeks will occur on Monday, April

at 4:15. At 7:30 that evening there

will be a reception for Makame in
the Faculty Club.
Other events scheduled for the two
weeks include a symposium on the
"Role of the Educated African in Ari
can Economic Developments," a sym

The last day of Africa Campus
Weeks will see a Yale • Stanford Joint
Conference on Senegal in the mor
ning and afternoon, an African din

The Organization ot African Stu
dents at Stanford stress that Africa
Campus Weeks provide an excellent
opportunity for students and staff
alike to learn more about the peoples
and countries of Africa. Detailed in
formation about the entire program
can be obtained at the I-Center and
