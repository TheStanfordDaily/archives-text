A staggering amount of money is wasted each year for preparations to
cure dandruff and baldness. Lured by fancy labels and fancier advertis
ing claims, many people try worthless lotions, salves, medicated sham
poos and hair restoratives. Dandruff, a name commonly used to designate
any land of scale that appears on the scalp, can occur from a variety of
causes. Its appearance always indicates that some change has occurred
in the mechanism of your hair. There are various types of dandruff, but
there are other active hair destroyers also, in the average balding
persons. Most of these scalp problems can be overcome with reliable,
scientific, TUROFF TREATMENT.
TUROFF HAS A RECORD OF OVER 1 MILLION TREATMENTS

A staggering amount of money is wasted each year for preparations to
cure dandruff and baldness. Lured by fancy labels and fancier advertis
ing claims, many people try worthless lotions, salves, medicated sham
poos and hair restoratives. Dandruff, a name commonly used to designate
any land of scale that appears on the scalp, can occur from a variety of
causes. Its appearance always indicates that some change has occurred
in the mechanism of your hair. There are various types of dandruff, but
there are other active hair destroyers also, in the average balding
persons. Most of these scalp problems can be overcome with reliable,
scientific, TUROFF TREATMENT.
