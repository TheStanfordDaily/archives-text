# Stone Tops Trimbur For Vice-Presidency
## 
### 
Bill Stone has been elected to fill
vacancy in the ASSU vice-presi
dency created last quarter due to the
resignation of David Harris and the
succession of former vice-president
Michael Collins.
Elected Friday by a margin of 544-
433, Stone commented "I'm really
surprised that I won. I thought that
the Daily's lack of publicity would
work to the advantage of my oppo
nent, and I'm not at all sure what to
make of the results."
Stone placed second in the primary
election held shortly before dead week
last quarter. Taking first place in that
election was John Trimbur, a Wilbur
Hall sponsor. Trimbur polled 627
votes (37.7% of the total) compared
with Stone's 323 votes (19.3%). "I
thought that the 600 or so who voted
for Trimbur in the primary would re
main committed to him and thought
it less likely that those who did not
vote for John or myself would come
to my side. I really think part of the
explanation lies in the fact that so
many people seemed to be ill-in
formed about the elections," said
Stone.
Frats and Freshmen
According to ASSU President Col
lins, 95 percent of the voters were ei
ther from fraternities or freshman
residences. Only one or two percent
were graduate students or students
living off campus. Stone attributes
this to the fact that "people who
weren't in a position to be communi
cated to in large numbers weren't
really up on what was going on. Peo
ple off campus have to be contacted
either on an individual basis or
through the paper and obviously that
wasn't done."
Collins, in a Daily interview, said
'I'd have been pleased at the outcome
of the election had it gone either way
because both candidates spoke strong
ly for educational reform. Bill and I
have already started to work, so I'm
sure we can work together toward
those programs we have been working
for all year. Our final objectives won't
change, we simply will have a few
more people to work on them."
Stone, who campaigned as a mod
erate, cautioned "anybody interpret

lng my election as a dynamic victory
of moderatism over radicalism. I'm
sure that a lot of people simply didn't
know what was going on."
Collins considers this election may
not be a reflection of possible voter
trends in the coming spring ASSU
elections. "Although the ratio of resi
dent to non-resident voting was un
usual, this percentage usually changes
significantly in the spring election so
it's hard to tell what this particular
election will indicate for spring."

those programs we have been working
for all year. Our final objectives won't
change, we simply will have a few
more people to work on them."
Stone, who campaigned as a mod
erate, cautioned "anybody interpret

lng my election as a dynamic victory
of moderatism over radicalism. I'm
sure that a lot of people simply didn't
know what was going on."
Collins considers this election may
not be a reflection of possible voter
trends in the coming spring ASSU
elections. "Although the ratio of resi
dent to non-resident voting was un
usual, this percentage usually changes
significantly in the spring election so
it's hard to tell what this particular
election will indicate for spring."


BILL STONE
Bill Stone has been elected to fill
vacancy in the ASSU vice-presi
dency created last quarter due to the
resignation of David Harris and the
succession of former vice-president
Michael Collins.
Elected Friday by a margin of 544-
433, Stone commented "I'm really
surprised that I won. I thought that
the Daily's lack of publicity would
work to the advantage of my oppo
nent, and I'm not at all sure what to
make of the results."
Stone placed second in the primary
election held shortly before dead week
last quarter. Taking first place in that
election was John Trimbur, a Wilbur
Hall sponsor. Trimbur polled 627
votes (37.7% of the total) compared
with Stone's 323 votes (19.3%). "I
thought that the 600 or so who voted
for Trimbur in the primary would re
main committed to him and thought
it less likely that those who did not
vote for John or myself would come
to my side. I really think part of the
explanation lies in the fact that so
many people seemed to be ill-in
formed about the elections," said
Stone.
Frats and Freshmen
According to ASSU President Col
lins, 95 percent of the voters were ei
ther from fraternities or freshman
residences. Only one or two percent
were graduate students or students
living off campus. Stone attributes
this to the fact that "people who
weren't in a position to be communi
cated to in large numbers weren't
really up on what was going on. Peo
ple off campus have to be contacted
either on an individual basis or
through the paper and obviously that
wasn't done."
Collins, in a Daily interview, said
'I'd have been pleased at the outcome
of the election had it gone either way
because both candidates spoke strong
ly for educational reform. Bill and I
have already started to work, so I'm
sure we can work together toward
those programs we have been working
for all year. Our final objectives won't
change, we simply will have a few
more people to work on them."
