# ADA Asks Draft Change; 2 Republicans Blast Study
## 
### 
(CPS)â€”Conscientious objec
tion to a specific war as grounds
for exemption from normal mil
itary service has been endorsed
by the nation's leading liberal
political organization.
After several hours of heated
debate, the national convention
of Americans for Democratic
Action (ADA) passed a resolu
tion which also supports elimi
nation of student deferments
and the use of a lottery system
for those classified 1-A.
The ADA meeting rejected a
substitute motion supported by
a number of younger delegates
which would have endorsed the
creation of a voluntary army.
Broader Service Programs
ADA's new position on Slec
tive Service favors a "draft of
the youngest first to end the
present uncertainties of those
between the ages of 19 and 26."
The liberal group, which
claims 55,000 national members,
endorsed conscientious objection
for those "who do not have an
organized religion and object on
moral grounds." It urged "the
broadening of national service
programs such as VISTA, Peace
Corps, Job Corps" but opposed
service in these groups "as al

ternatives to service in the
Armed Forces."
On Capitol Hill, two Republi
can Congressional advocates of
a volunteer army made public a
letter to President Johnson at
tacking the National Commis
sion on Selective Service headed
by former Assistant Attorney
General Burke Marshall.
Congressmen Thomas B. Cur
tis of Missouri and Donald
Rumsfeld of Illinois claimed the
Marshall Commission members
had "summarily dismissed the
possibility of a volunteer sys
tem of manpower procurement"
without any "background infor
mation supporting their state
ments on re-enlistment motiva
tion and cost."
The Congressmen said some
of the Commission arguments
amounted to "pure rhetoric de
void of any meaning." They
told the President that "without
supporting data and working
papers, the strength of your
proposals is seriously dimin
ished."
Both Republicans called for
full Congressional hearings on
the draft, and voiced support for
a resolution which would estab
lish a joint Congressional com
mittee to undertake the task.
