# Movie Review
## 'The Great Blondino' 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The world premiere of a
strange but rather engrossing
modernistic movie occurred at
the Cedar Alley Cinema, S.F.,
one afternoon last week.
The Great Blondino, a 45-min
ute series of phantasies in the
mind of the world renowned
tight-rope walker, was made by
Robert Nelson and William Wi
ley, plus wives, assorted girl
friends and the general populace
of San Francisco. It will gross
its negligible production costs in
the first week and covers every
thing from the Berkeley female
pubic to the Tenderloin wino.
Filmed entirely in the city and
Marin County, or as the credits
put it "in the heart of the beau
tiful, breathtaking, brainbruising
bananabelt delta", Blondino is
nevertheless a fair bit better
than the average underground
movie with its disorganized alle
gories and penny saving impro
vization.
Dedicated "to tight-rope walk
ers everywhere", The Great

Blondino uses the fame of the
19th Century tight-rope walker
to speak about the level of risk
at which we all live and the fool
ish beauty of life on the brink
when we confront that risk. It
all has a strange pre-Raphaelite
quality, Blondino pushing a
wheelbarrow into intricate back
grdunds that suggest pictures
by Dante Gabriele Rossetti.
Dreams
Blondino's dreams are the
heaviest part of the movie: se
quences about a horse being
gelded, women eternally undres
sing and maidens gambolling in
essentially public harems.
The random passages are fas
cinating: shots of two hippopo
tamuses drinking from a can of
cream, nuzzling away each oth
er's face. Then there is Tanta
lus, trying to lick the dot off a
hanging question mark, a sym
bol which returns constantly
throughout the film.
There is considerable L.S.D.
phantasmagoria: Blondino
(played by Chuck Wiley) un

locks a gun from a plush case
to play a weirdly hallucinating
game of Russian roulette. Then
he shoots some children's build
ing bricks into the wooden box.
But they all jump out again.
Blondino finally puts on a blind
fold to study the bricks.
Face of Suicide
The face of a suicide is seen
with a red, sensual, licking
tongue down the barrel of his re
volver. Eschewing self-destruc
tion with the gun, Blondino
pushes his wheelbarrow out
across a river.
He falls off the tight-rope but
survives to follow a trollop to
her room. Caressing her nipples
he finds he is feeling the wooden
arms of an artist's easel. He
caresses a suggestive piece of
bread through a brick wall. It
develops into the horn of a rhi
noceros, so he goes to visit a
real one in the zoo.
In splendidly rich blue and
gold surrealist photography, the
tight-rope walker's strange ad
ventures come to a finish.
Sounds of a lavatory flushing
and leopard skin curtains seem
not to jar. Music, DRONE mu
sic, is provided by Moving Van
Walters and his Truck. The
Grateful Dead, who have title
if not talent, also get in on the
act.
Six shorts by Nelson and Wi
ley add another half hour to th:>
show, all good value.

lus, trying to lick the dot off a
hanging question mark, a sym
bol which returns constantly
throughout the film.
There is considerable L.S.D.
phantasmagoria: Blondino
(played by Chuck Wiley) un

locks a gun from a plush case
to play a weirdly hallucinating
game of Russian roulette. Then
he shoots some children's build
ing bricks into the wooden box.
But they all jump out again.
Blondino finally puts on a blind
fold to study the bricks.
Face of Suicide
The face of a suicide is seen
with a red, sensual, licking
tongue down the barrel of his re
volver. Eschewing self-destruc
tion with the gun, Blondino
pushes his wheelbarrow out
across a river.
He falls off the tight-rope but
survives to follow a trollop to
her room. Caressing her nipples
he finds he is feeling the wooden
arms of an artist's easel. He
caresses a suggestive piece of
bread through a brick wall. It
develops into the horn of a rhi
noceros, so he goes to visit a
real one in the zoo.
In splendidly rich blue and
gold surrealist photography, the
tight-rope walker's strange ad
ventures come to a finish.
Sounds of a lavatory flushing
and leopard skin curtains seem
not to jar. Music, DRONE mu
sic, is provided by Moving Van
Walters and his Truck. The
Grateful Dead, who have title
if not talent, also get in on the
act.
Six shorts by Nelson and Wi
ley add another half hour to th:>
show, all good value.
The world premiere of a
strange but rather engrossing
modernistic movie occurred at
the Cedar Alley Cinema, S.F.,
one afternoon last week.
The Great Blondino, a 45-min
ute series of phantasies in the
mind of the world renowned
tight-rope walker, was made by
Robert Nelson and William Wi
ley, plus wives, assorted girl
friends and the general populace
of San Francisco. It will gross
its negligible production costs in
the first week and covers every
thing from the Berkeley female
pubic to the Tenderloin wino.
Filmed entirely in the city and
Marin County, or as the credits
put it "in the heart of the beau
tiful, breathtaking, brainbruising
bananabelt delta", Blondino is
nevertheless a fair bit better
than the average underground
movie with its disorganized alle
gories and penny saving impro
vization.
Dedicated "to tight-rope walk
ers everywhere", The Great

Blondino uses the fame of the
19th Century tight-rope walker
to speak about the level of risk
at which we all live and the fool
ish beauty of life on the brink
when we confront that risk. It
all has a strange pre-Raphaelite
quality, Blondino pushing a
wheelbarrow into intricate back
grdunds that suggest pictures
by Dante Gabriele Rossetti.
Dreams
Blondino's dreams are the
heaviest part of the movie: se
quences about a horse being
gelded, women eternally undres
sing and maidens gambolling in
essentially public harems.
The random passages are fas
cinating: shots of two hippopo
tamuses drinking from a can of
cream, nuzzling away each oth
er's face. Then there is Tanta
lus, trying to lick the dot off a
hanging question mark, a sym
bol which returns constantly
throughout the film.
