# Harvard Administration Takes Stand On Students' Use of Marijuana, LSD
## 
### 
The 1186 members of Har
vard's class of 1970 have been
advised by the administration
that if they are misusing their
time at Harvard "fooling around
with illegal and dangerous
drugs," they should get out.
The message from Dean John
U. Monro, distributed by proc
tors to the freshmen, read:
"The dean's office has been
repeatedly pressed by a number
of members of the freshman
class for a statement of the col
lege administrative position with
respect to the use of drugs, in
cluding marijuana and LSD. If

it will help anyone, I am pleased
to clarify our position.
"As anyone bright enough to
be at Harvard knows perfectly
well, possession or distribution
of marijuana and LSD are strict
ly against the law and taking
the drug involves users in psy
chological dangers and contacts
with the criminal underworld.
The college is prepared to take
serious disciplinary action, up to
and including dismissal, against
any student found to be involved
in the use or distribution of il
legal and dangerous drugs. . .
Dean Monro's message was ac
companied by a pamphlet from
Harvard's health service giving
the chemical properties and ef
fects of LSD and marijuana.
The Harvard Crimson report
ed two weeks ago that "more
freshmen than ever" were smok
ing pot and dropping acid.
