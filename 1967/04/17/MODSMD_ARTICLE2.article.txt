# Two Communities In Conflict: Stanford Vies With Palo Alto
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
(First in a series discussing the prob
lems between Stanford and the sur
rounding communities with particular
emphasis on the problem with Palo
Alto. )
"The aims and goals of Palo Alto
and Stanford are divergent," said
Mayor Frances Dias of Palo Alto,
"but with discussion we can work out
our mutual problems."
In an interview with The Dally con
cerning the recent rash of problems
between the city and the University,
Mrs. Dias noted that "Stanford has
always been willing to listen."
These recent difficulties between
the two are not traditional town-gown
problems experienced by some other
institutions, such as drunkness, mu
tual dislike, and vandalism; but rather
center around Stanford land and the
University's plans for it.
Other Towns Involved
Stanford's problems do not rest
with Palo Alto alone. Other munici
palities and special interest groups
are also concerned about these devel
opment plans, including Portola Val
ley, Menlo Park, the Central Palo
Alto Resident's Association, Woodside,
the Ladera Community Association,
and others.
Dixon Arnett, Director of Commu
nity Relations for Stanford, discussed
this problem. "Stanford is bordered
by seven municipalities," he said, "lo
cated in two counties, and part of
two Congressional districts, two As
sembly districts, and two Senate dis
tricts.
"We just aren't the sleepy little
college we used to be," Arnett went
on. "Stanford must develop its lands.
We can't let taxable lands stand idle."
The aim of land development, he
emphasized, is to "complement the
academic enterprise."
Arnett felt that the past relations
had something to do with the present
problems.

"Stanford was once very prominent
in Palo Alto affairs," he said, and had
a "pretty heavy hand" in local politics.
"The University was a source of tal
ent: professors designed the city
charter and helped get it started. Stan
ford and Palo Alto activities were the
same."
History
After World War 11, PACE began
and the land development program
was initiated. The Shopping Center
and the Industrial Park people began
to assume leadership and tended to
dominate affairs as part of the city.
Arnett went on to say that what
is now happening is a "reaction, per
haps an over-reaction to the heavy
handed tactics. Palo Alto is searching
for self-identity." He said the prevail
ing attitude is to sever any depen
dence on Stanford. "Today's problems
are the manifestation of this reac
tion," he concluded.
Mrs. Dias, Palo Alto mayor, describ
ed the attitude of Palo Alto citizens
toward the University. "The citizen:
• "admires Stanford as one of the
finest educational institutions in the
nation.
• "is grateful for the cultural en
richment the University brings to the
community.
• "doesn't understand what makes
it tick.
• "is suspicious of Stanford as the
largest land owner in the city.
• "is proud to point out contribu
tions each group has made to the
other."
Different Responsibilities
Mrs. Dias pointed out that, "the re
sponsibilities of the Board of Trustees
and the City Council are different and
both have to make decisions in the
best interests of what they repre
sent."
Probably one of the outstanding
problems between the University and
the city of Palo Alto is the issue of
the Ladera Dam. As proposed the

dam would flood over 500 acres of
land near and under the linear accel
erator.
The dam is to be an earth-fill struc
ture of San Francisquito Creek in
order to prevent serious flooding of
Palo Alto which has happened twice
in the last fifteen years. A flood in
April, 1958, did $300,000 damage to
the Palo Alto Golf Course and Air
port, particularly runways and planes.
The dam is opposed by the Uni
versity not only because it would
flood acreage, but also because there
exists the problem of land stability
of the linear accelerator and would
flood part of Jasper Ridge, a bio
logical preserve.
Flooding
A portion of the biological preserve
would be flooded rather permanently
and would substantially change the
nature of the area. Furthermore, a
recreation area is planned around the
reservoir which would mean the in
trusion of a large quantity of people
into the area.
The area has been a biological pre
serve since 1892.
Another problem with the proposed
plan, noted Arnett is that the value
of the land has risen substantially
and it appears that the cost of the
land alone, which is now set for the
site of a new industrial park, may
cost more than the dam itself.
He also added that what conserva
tion interest groups think will be
a beautiful park, will indeed be a
"mudhole for the majority of the
year." The proposed park he explain
ed would "cost more than the dam
and the land combined."
Stanford has to date "enjoyed the
approval of local government includ
ing Palo Alto," for its plans, said Ar
nett, "but, approval is getting harder
and harder to gain."
