# Mayor Of Florence Praises Flood Aid
## 
### ROGER LaBRUCHERIE 
The mayor of Florence, Italy,
yesterday took time out from a
tour of major U.S. cities to ex
tend a special, private thank
you to the Stanford community
for its personal contribution to
helping Florence recover from
the flood damage of last No
vember.
Mayor (and Professor) Piero
Bargellini took obvious delight
in speaking to the members of
Italy XIII and those Stanford
people who have worked to
raise funds for the rescue of
thousands of paintings and
manuscripts which were encrust
ed with the mud that came with
the rising Arno. Mayor Bargel
lini commented that the city
has been overwhelmed a second
time by a flood which has re
ceived less attention: the flood
of sympathy, concern and aid
from millions of people the
world over. Over four million
dollars has been sent from the
citizens of the United States
alone.
Mayor Bargellini is on a
three-week tour of the United
States with his wife and daugh
ter, extending the appreciation
of the Florentines to all those
who have expressed a concern
and reassuring Americans that
much of the city's art collection
is again on display.
The task of recovering enor

mous quantities of manuscripts
from mud damage is far from
over, however, and the Floren
tines have shown a remarkable
ingenuity in approaching the
task. Water-logged books, for
example, have been placed in re
frigeration to prevent their
mildewing, until there is room
and manpower to dry them
properly. The amount of room
available was considerably ex
panded when someone came up
with the idea of using sheds or
dinarily used for tobacco drying.
Mayor Bargellini's role in en
ergizing Florence into action im
mediately after the flood is all
the more remarkable for the
fact that until 1966 he had been
Professor Bar√üellini, author of
78 books on art history, archi
tecture, and Italian culture. He
had, in fact, not wanted the job
of mayor at all, knowing it
would mean the end of his fami
ly life and literary career, yet
his love for the city prevented
him from refusing the position.
Since, he has taken on the job
with the same zeal with which
he approached his academic en
deavors. He insisted, for ex
ample, that the Piazza della Sig
noria be restored to the red-and
white brick surface it long boast
ed, rather than resorting to the
expedient of asphalt.
