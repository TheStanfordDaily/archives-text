With three-fourths of the race left Stanford
(background) holds a half-boat lead over Ore
gon State. The Tribe went on to a two-length
victory over Santa Clara, with USC third and
OSU last. The victory was the third in a row
for the Card crew against no losses. Note the
tilting bouy in the background, indicating the
force of the tide they were rowing against.
