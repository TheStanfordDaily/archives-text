# Tribe Pitchers Skin OSU

### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford's baseball team roar
ed out in its chase for the first
AAWU title by sweeping a
double-header from Oregon
State on Friday. Fine pitching
and clutch defensive play were
mainly responsible for the 4-1
and 2-1 victories.
In the opener, Sandy Vance
limited the Beavers to just four
hits. Their lone run came in the
seventh on a walk, a misjudged
fly ball and a successful two-out
double steal.
Although Vance had early
trouble getting his breaking
stuff over the plate and conse
quently had to work very hard,
he held on the finished strong
by striking out two men in the
ninth on curve balls, for a total
of nine strikeouts.
DufTy, Marquess Score
The Indians struck for two
of their runs in the first inning.
Frank Duffy led off with a walk,
stole second, and scored when
Mark Marquess's wicked hopper
got through the OSU third base
man. Bob Boone then singled in
Marquess.

Ron Shotts added another
tally in the third with a tower
ing homer that cleared the 360
foot mark with ease, and the
Indians picked up an unearned
run in the fifth.
Nitecap Duel
The seven-inning nitecap was
a pitchers' duel between Stan
ford's Daro Quiring and OSU's
Denny Tower, a herky-jerky
southpaw. The Cards went
ahead in the first on a bases
loaded walk, but the Beavers
equalized in the second on an
error, a walk, and a single.
OSU threatened again in the
seventh, the first two batters
singling sharply. But Quiring
kept the ball low, and his infield
got him out of the jam un
scathed.
The Cards went into the bot
tom of the seventh determined
to win, and win they did. An
error and two walks loaded the
bases and set the stage for Mike
Schomaker. A long fly would
have won the game, but Mike
tried a little harded and dumped
into left center for the win.
