# 'Sense Of Direction Needed'
## King Views Vietnam, Education 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
If you're ever in need of an inter
esting companion for the ride from
San Francisco Airport to Stanford,
try Dr. Martin Luther King.
He covers a wide range of topics
and the trip flashes by. His comments
are stimulating and controversial, his
voice high and resonant.
The trip on Friday was hectic and
hurried, since King's flight from Los
Angeles was cancelled and he ar
rived an hour late. He and his assis
tant, Bernard Lee, were rushed into
a waiting car. Before he could catch
his breath, King was responding to
questions.
The first topic was the present state

of anti-war demonstrations. King said
there seemed to be general confusion
on how, when, and about what to
demonstrate. "There is too much
sporadic action," he noted. "A sense
of direction is needed. I think there
should be a summit conference of
peace leaders so that we can have a
united front."
King, who only recently turned his
attention to the Vietnam war and has
since been attacked for combining the
war and civil rights under one head
ing, gave his thoughts on the place of
universities in the peace movement.
Education Basically Conservative
"The content and quality of educa

tion is basically conservative, but a
hope lies in the faculties and student
bodies. Administrations and Boards
have been, and will continue to be
old-fashioned, but teachers and stu
dents are calling for radical reform
and are most important in the search
for peace."
Getting more specific, King talked
about the West Coast. "San Francisco
is one of the strongest areas in the
country on peace movements. But
Southern California, oh boy. There
isn't too much to encourage me down
there. They do have a nice climate."
The car was only half way to Stan
ford, and he was due in ten minutes.
But King wasn't flustered as he calm

ly continued to say what was on his
mind.
"The United States is on the wrong
side of the world revolution. Vietnam
is typical. Everything to us is com
munist, and we forget the power of
nationalism which is the dominant
cause of revolution in the world.
We were once the champions of revo
lution; now look at us: we're anti
revolution."
Civil rights was the next issue.
Asked whether he adopts policies in
reaction to movements such as
"Black Power", King stated, "I base
my beliefs on my moral impulses and
in line with my conscience. And at
any rate, 'Black Power' is only a tem
porary development."
As he talked, King nodded to
friendly looks and gestures from peo
ple who noticed him in passing cars.
He called for more radicalism in the
civil rights movement. "To get to
the root of more and more compli
cated problems we need to be more
radical in analyzing and organizing,
but always without violence.
"Americans don't like hearing the
truth. We are guided more and more
by a military-industrial complex that
oppresses us here and abroad."

The car was now coming down Uni
versity Ave. King paused in his talk
for a minute to ask how the program
was planned: was there to be a ques
tion and answer period? He praised
the beautiful palms as the car entered
the campus on Palm Drive.
It was now a little past 3:30, the
time he was due to appear. Just as
the audience was being told there
might be a delay, King and his
adopted party strode into Memorial
Auditorium. Without stopping for
more than a handshake, King walked
onto the stage.
He walked off an hour later amidst
a throng of news hungry members of
the press, but after a brief, non-vio
lent struggle, King got into the car
and was heading back to the airport.
Wonderful Audience
He was beaming as he repeated hap
pily, "Wonderful, wonderful, absolute
ly wonderful audience. I hate to leave
so many friends."
When the car finally pulled away
from the crowd of over 100 applaud
ing admirers, King admitted he hadn't
used a text for his talk. "Was that
all ad lib?" he was asked in astonish
ment.
"Oh," he said, "I don't like to write
speeches."
King's next major stop was to be
New York, where he spoke at the
Mobilization for Peace rally on Satur
day. He and Lee asked to be left at
the airport hotel so King could sleep
for the three hours before he left. He
said he was immune to travel fatigue,
but he was checked in and on his
way upstairs almost before "good
bye's" were exchanged.
He thanked us for an interesting
trip to and from Stanford.

When the car finally pulled away
from the crowd of over 100 applaud
ing admirers, King admitted he hadn't
used a text for his talk. "Was that
all ad lib?" he was asked in astonish
ment.
"Oh," he said, "I don't like to write
speeches."
King's next major stop was to be
New York, where he spoke at the
Mobilization for Peace rally on Satur
day. He and Lee asked to be left at
the airport hotel so King could sleep
for the three hours before he left. He
said he was immune to travel fatigue,
but he was checked in and on his
way upstairs almost before "good
bye's" were exchanged.
He thanked us for an interesting
trip to and from Stanford.
If you're ever in need of an inter
esting companion for the ride from
San Francisco Airport to Stanford,
try Dr. Martin Luther King.
He covers a wide range of topics
and the trip flashes by. His comments
are stimulating and controversial, his
voice high and resonant.
The trip on Friday was hectic and
hurried, since King's flight from Los
Angeles was cancelled and he ar
rived an hour late. He and his assis
tant, Bernard Lee, were rushed into
a waiting car. Before he could catch
his breath, King was responding to
questions.
The first topic was the present state

of anti-war demonstrations. King said
there seemed to be general confusion
on how, when, and about what to
demonstrate. "There is too much
sporadic action," he noted. "A sense
of direction is needed. I think there
should be a summit conference of
peace leaders so that we can have a
united front."
King, who only recently turned his
attention to the Vietnam war and has
since been attacked for combining the
war and civil rights under one head
ing, gave his thoughts on the place of
universities in the peace movement.
Education Basically Conservative
"The content and quality of educa

tion is basically conservative, but a
hope lies in the faculties and student
bodies. Administrations and Boards
have been, and will continue to be
old-fashioned, but teachers and stu
dents are calling for radical reform
and are most important in the search
for peace."
Getting more specific, King talked
about the West Coast. "San Francisco
is one of the strongest areas in the
country on peace movements. But
Southern California, oh boy. There
isn't too much to encourage me down
there. They do have a nice climate."
The car was only half way to Stan
ford, and he was due in ten minutes.
But King wasn't flustered as he calm

ly continued to say what was on his
mind.
"The United States is on the wrong
side of the world revolution. Vietnam
is typical. Everything to us is com
munist, and we forget the power of
nationalism which is the dominant
cause of revolution in the world.
We were once the champions of revo
lution; now look at us: we're anti
revolution."
Civil rights was the next issue.
Asked whether he adopts policies in
reaction to movements such as
"Black Power", King stated, "I base
my beliefs on my moral impulses and
in line with my conscience. And at
any rate, 'Black Power' is only a tem
porary development."
As he talked, King nodded to
friendly looks and gestures from peo
ple who noticed him in passing cars.
He called for more radicalism in the
civil rights movement. "To get to
the root of more and more compli
cated problems we need to be more
radical in analyzing and organizing,
but always without violence.
"Americans don't like hearing the
truth. We are guided more and more
by a military-industrial complex that
oppresses us here and abroad."
Praises Palms
The car was now coming down Uni
versity Ave. King paused in his talk
for a minute to ask how the program
was planned: was there to be a ques
tion and answer period? He praised
the beautiful palms as the car entered
the campus on Palm Drive.
It was now a little past 3:30, the
time he was due to appear. Just as
the audience was being told there
might be a delay, King and his
adopted party strode into Memorial
Auditorium. Without stopping for
more than a handshake, King walked
onto the stage.
He walked off an hour later amidst
a throng of news hungry members of
the press, but after a brief, non-vio
lent struggle, King got into the car
and was heading back to the airport.
Wonderful Audience
He was beaming as he repeated hap
pily, "Wonderful, wonderful, absolute
ly wonderful audience. I hate to leave
so many friends."
When the car finally pulled away

the beautiful palms as the car entered
the campus on Palm Drive.
It was now a little past 3:30, the
time he was due to appear. Just as
the audience was being told there
might be a delay, King and his
adopted party strode into Memorial
Auditorium. Without stopping for
more than a handshake, King walked
onto the stage.
He walked off an hour later amidst
a throng of news hungry members of
the press, but after a brief, non-vio
lent struggle, King got into the car
and was heading back to the airport.
Wonderful Audience
He was beaming as he repeated hap
pily, "Wonderful, wonderful, absolute
ly wonderful audience. I hate to leave
so many friends."
When the car finally pulled away
from the crowd of over 100 applaud
ing admirers, King admitted he hadn't
used a text for his talk. "Was that
all ad lib?" he was asked in astonish
ment.
"Oh," he said, "I don't like to write
speeches."
King's next major stop was to be
New York, where he spoke at the
Mobilization for Peace rally on Satur
day. He and Lee asked to be left at
the airport hotel so King could sleep
for the three hours before he left. He
said he was immune to travel fatigue,
but he was checked in and on his
way upstairs almost before "good
bye's" were exchanged.
He thanked us for an interesting
trip to and from Stanford.
If you're ever in need of an inter
esting companion for the ride from
San Francisco Airport to Stanford,
try Dr. Martin Luther King.
He covers a wide range of topics
and the trip flashes by. His comments
are stimulating and controversial, his
voice high and resonant.
The trip on Friday was hectic and
hurried, since King's flight from Los
Angeles was cancelled and he ar
rived an hour late. He and his assis
tant, Bernard Lee, were rushed into
a waiting car. Before he could catch
his breath, King was responding to
questions.
The first topic was the present state

of anti-war demonstrations. King said
there seemed to be general confusion
on how, when, and about what to
demonstrate. "There is too much
sporadic action," he noted. "A sense
of direction is needed. I think there
should be a summit conference of
peace leaders so that we can have a
united front."
King, who only recently turned his
attention to the Vietnam war and has
since been attacked for combining the
war and civil rights under one head
ing, gave his thoughts on the place of
universities in the peace movement.
Education Basically Conservative
"The content and quality of educa

tion is basically conservative, but a
hope lies in the faculties and student
bodies. Administrations and Boards
have been, and will continue to be
old-fashioned, but teachers and stu
dents are calling for radical reform
and are most important in the search
for peace."
Getting more specific, King talked
about the West Coast. "San Francisco
is one of the strongest areas in the
country on peace movements. But
Southern California, oh boy. There
isn't too much to encourage me down
there. They do have a nice climate."
The car was only half way to Stan
ford, and he was due in ten minutes.
But King wasn't flustered as he calm

ly continued to say what was on his
mind.
"The United States is on the wrong
side of the world revolution. Vietnam
is typical. Everything to us is com
munist, and we forget the power of
nationalism which is the dominant
cause of revolution in the world.
We were once the champions of revo
lution; now look at us: we're anti
revolution."
Civil rights was the next issue.
Asked whether he adopts policies in
reaction to movements such as
"Black Power", King stated, "I base
my beliefs on my moral impulses and
in line with my conscience. And at
any rate, 'Black Power' is only a tem
porary development."
As he talked, King nodded to
friendly looks and gestures from peo
ple who noticed him in passing cars.
He called for more radicalism in the
civil rights movement. "To get to
the root of more and more compli
cated problems we need to be more
radical in analyzing and organizing,
but always without violence.
"Americans don't like hearing the
truth. We are guided more and more
by a military-industrial complex that
oppresses us here and abroad."
Praises Palms
The car was now coming down Uni
versity Ave. King paused in his talk
for a minute to ask how the program
was planned: was there to be a ques
tion and answer period? He praised
the beautiful palms as the car entered
the campus on Palm Drive.
It was now a little past 3:30, the
