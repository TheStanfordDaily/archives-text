# Bruins Maul Indians
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
The UCLA Bruins won both
relays and swept five of the
other fifteen events in running
to a 115-28 victory over the
depleted Stanford track team
Saturday in Westwood.
Stanford's only show of
strength came in the long jump,
where they outscored the Bruins
8-1.
Bud Walsh won the event,
leaping 24'-l%" to capture five
points for the Card cause. Craig
Vaughan was 3" behind with a
second place distance of 23'-9%".
UCLA's Jeff Patterson was a
distant third at 22'-5V 2 ".
Walsh Top Point Man
Walsh picked up where he left
off last year as Stanford's high
point man. Besides the win in
the long jump, he was second
in the high hurdles with an ex
cellent time of 14.1, and second
in the 440 intermediate hurdles
with 54.4. With these three
places he scored 11 of Stanford's
points.
The Bruins' depth was most
responsible for the over-whelm
ing score. They swept the shot
put, mile, 440, triple jump, and
pole vault.
In four of those five events,
Stanford left its best competi
tors at home with injuries. Jim
Ward, quarter-miler; lan Ar
nold, triple-jumper; Dave Har
rington, shot putter; and Jim
Eshelman, pole vaulter, all
missed the trip. The absence of
these men accounts in part for
the disastrous score.
UCLA Again Strong
This is not to take away from
the performances by the Bruins.
Though not the powerhouse
that walked away with the NC
AA championship last year, the
men from Westwood again have
a very strong team.
Don Domansky won the 440
in a very good time of 46.7. Ger
ald Lee became one of the best
triple-jumpers in the nation with
a bound of 51'-9".
Ron Copeland won the high
hurdles in an excellent 14.0, only
0.1 second ahead of Stanford's
Walsh. The intermediate hurdle
time of 52.0 seconds by Roger

Johnson is also top in the con
ference.
Two Indians continued to im
prove in spite of the bad weath
er in L. A.
Grimm, Schembra Improve
Tom Grimm placed second
with his best lifetime loss in the
discus, heaving it 172'-4". His
teammade Chuck Schembra also
had the best performance of his
career taking third with 168'-1".
There were also some marks
below average for the Cards.
Jim Letterer, who last week
ran a 9:05 2-mile, dropped 30
seconds to 9:35.2 Saturday. That
time was still good for third
place.

In the high jump Peter Boyce
was second, clearing only 6'-6",
far below his best of 6'-ll".
UCLA's Larry Fischer also
cleared 6'-6" and was awarded
first place on the basis of fewer
misses.
The Worst Is Yet To Come
Prospects are no better for
the coming week. This Saturday
the Cards face USC in the sta
dium. The Trojans are favorites
in the conference and expected
to win the NCAA crown as well.
Coach Jordan hopes some of
the injuries will have healed and
Stanford will be closer to full
strength.
