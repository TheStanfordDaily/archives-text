REQUIEM FOR A SQUARE
You, like any other lovable, clean-living, freckle-faced
American kid, want to be a BMOC. How can you make it?
Well sir, there are several ways, none of which will
work.
You're too puny to be an athlete, too lazy to be a valedic
torian, and too hairy to run for Homecoming Queen.
As for becoming a best-dressed man, how are you going
to buy clothes with a miser for a father?
Are you licked then? Is there no way to make BMOC?
Yes, there is! And you can do it! Do what? This:
Become a hippie! Get cool! Get alienated! Have an
Identity Crisis! Be one of the Others!
How? Well sir, to become a hippie, simply follow these
five simple rules:
1. Read all of Tolkien in the original dwarf.
2. Have your Sophomore Slump in the freshman year.
3. Wear buttons that say things like this:
NATIONALIZE DAIRY QUEEN
ASTHMATICS, UNITE
LEGALIZE APPLE BUTTER
HANDS OFF AIR POLLUTION
4. Go steady with a girl who has long greasy hair, a gui
tar, enlarged pores, and thermal underwear.
5. Attend Happenings regularly.

This last item may require some explanation, for it is
possible that Happenings haven't reached your campus
yet. Be assured they will because Happening's are the big
gest college craze since mononucleosis.
A Happening, in case you don't know, is the first form
less art form. Things just happen. For example, eighty
naked men come out and squirt each other with fire hoses
containing tinted yogurt. Then eighty more naked men
come out and light birthday candles in the navels of the
first eighty men. Then one girl, clothed, comes out and
pulls three thousand feet of sausage casing through her
pierced ear. Then eighty more naked men come out and
eat a station wagon.
There is, of course, a musical accompaniment to all
these fun things. Usually it is "Begin the Beguinel'played
by 26 trench mortars, a drop forge, and a rooster.
There used to be, some years ago, still another require
ment for becoming a hippie: a man had to have a beard.
But no longer. Beards were worn in the past not so
much as a protest, but because shaving was such a painful
experience. Then along came Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades.
Today if you don't want to shave, well, that's yovr
hangup, isn't it, baby? I mean when you've got a blade
like Personna that tugs not neither does it scrape, what's
your copout, man? 1 mean like get with it; you're living
in the past. Shaving ~.sed to hurt, used to scratch, used to
gouge, used to give you all kinds of static. But not since
Personna. It's a gas, man. It's a doozy; it's mom's apple
pie. You dig?
I mean, man, you still want a beard? Crazy! But you
don't have to turn your face into a slum, do you? Shave
around the bush, baby, neatly and nicely with Personna.
I mean like Personna comes in double-edge style and
Injector style too. I mean like any way you try it, you
gotta like like it.

I mean, man, you still want a beard? Crazy! But you
don't have to turn your face into a slum, do you? Shave
around the bush, baby, neatly and nicely with Personna.
I mean like Personna comes in double-edge style and
Injector style too. I mean like any way you try it, you
gotta like like it.

Hey, man, like how about doubling your sharing cool?
Like how about wilting those crazy whiskers with some
Burma-Shave? Like regular or menthol? L.ike have
you got a better friend than your kisser? I,ike treat it
right, right? Ye-ye!


REQUIEM FOR A SQUARE
You, like any other lovable, clean-living, freckle-faced
American kid, want to be a BMOC. How can you make it?
Well sir, there are several ways, none of which will
work.
You're too puny to be an athlete, too lazy to be a valedic
torian, and too hairy to run for Homecoming Queen.
As for becoming a best-dressed man, how are you going
to buy clothes with a miser for a father?
Are you licked then? Is there no way to make BMOC?
Yes, there is! And you can do it! Do what? This:
Become a hippie! Get cool! Get alienated! Have an
Identity Crisis! Be one of the Others!
How? Well sir, to become a hippie, simply follow these
five simple rules:
1. Read all of Tolkien in the original dwarf.
2. Have your Sophomore Slump in the freshman year.
3. Wear buttons that say things like this:
NATIONALIZE DAIRY QUEEN
ASTHMATICS, UNITE
LEGALIZE APPLE BUTTER
HANDS OFF AIR POLLUTION
4. Go steady with a girl who has long greasy hair, a gui
tar, enlarged pores, and thermal underwear.
5. Attend Happenings regularly.

This last item may require some explanation, for it is
possible that Happenings haven't reached your campus
yet. Be assured they will because Happening's are the big
gest college craze since mononucleosis.
A Happening, in case you don't know, is the first form
less art form. Things just happen. For example, eighty
naked men come out and squirt each other with fire hoses
containing tinted yogurt. Then eighty more naked men
come out and light birthday candles in the navels of the
first eighty men. Then one girl, clothed, comes out and
pulls three thousand feet of sausage casing through her
pierced ear. Then eighty more naked men come out and
eat a station wagon.
There is, of course, a musical accompaniment to all
these fun things. Usually it is "Begin the Beguinel'played
by 26 trench mortars, a drop forge, and a rooster.
There used to be, some years ago, still another require
ment for becoming a hippie: a man had to have a beard.
But no longer. Beards were worn in the past not so
much as a protest, but because shaving was such a painful
experience. Then along came Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades.
Today if you don't want to shave, well, that's yovr
hangup, isn't it, baby? I mean when you've got a blade
like Personna that tugs not neither does it scrape, what's
your copout, man? 1 mean like get with it; you're living
in the past. Shaving ~.sed to hurt, used to scratch, used to
gouge, used to give you all kinds of static. But not since
Personna. It's a gas, man. It's a doozy; it's mom's apple
pie. You dig?
