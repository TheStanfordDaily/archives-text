# Narrow Tendencies
## 
### 
The "We Accuse" posters and the newspaper
Resistance have made it clear to the University
community that the Experiment is intensely
dedicated to a political role. Readers of Resis
tance know that for some time the leaders of the
Experiment have been carrying on an active
campaign against the American fight in Viet
nam and recently against Stanford's connections
with Defense Department contractors.
While the cause may be just, one is led to
ponder what it means to the Experiment to have
so many of its resources and so much of its
leadership's energy directed to such a single
minded, highly moralistic political purpose.
Barry Creenberg, the Experiment coordinator,
freely admits that the Experiment is deeply con
cerned with man's political existence. He has
said one cannot separate the political from the
social nor the social from the personal, an idea
which few would be inclined to refute. And he
has said that the abstract is meaningless if dis
connected from the concrete, likewise an ad
mirable conviction.
This argument is the reasoning strength be
hind any sort of political activism. It causes peo
ple to form political parties, action groups, peace
marches and sit-ins. And it has come to dominate
the Experiment.
It is not simply a question of public image or
the fact that the Experiment's political activities
have grabbed more headlines than its seminars,
poetry readings or sensory awakenings; for those

who follow the Experiment closely must be
aware that its members are not political activists
to the exclusion of everything else. But those out
side it, who know only what they read in the
papers, are not so aware of this fact. It is these
people whom the Experiment must reach if it
is to develop its radical community and forge
ahead with radical education.
One sees an unfortunate tendency to define
political education much too narrowly. One also
sees the underlying assumption that if a person
only thought a little about the Vietnam war, the
military-industrial complex, American universi
ties or what have you, he would naturally see
how terrible they all are and how they must be
remade from top to bottom and right now.
The Experiment appears to have developed a
certain close-mindedness, a certain self-satisfac
tion, and appearances are important. At the same
time as it cries out for moral and intellectual
freedom, it seems to work against these very
things.
In short, the future of the Experiment is in
question. Earlier this year, Barry Creenberg ex
pressed concern that the attention devoted to
the seminars might have the unfortunate effect
of distracting attention from the Experiment's
many other worthwhile activities. We must now
ask Barry Creenberg and his associates if the
attention drawn by the Experiment's political
activities has not irreparably hurt the cause of
radical education at Stanford.

with Defense Department contractors.
While the cause may be just, one is led to
ponder what it means to the Experiment to have
so many of its resources and so much of its
leadership's energy directed to such a single
minded, highly moralistic political purpose.
Barry Creenberg, the Experiment coordinator,
freely admits that the Experiment is deeply con
cerned with man's political existence. He has
said one cannot separate the political from the
social nor the social from the personal, an idea
which few would be inclined to refute. And he
has said that the abstract is meaningless if dis
connected from the concrete, likewise an ad
mirable conviction.
This argument is the reasoning strength be
hind any sort of political activism. It causes peo
ple to form political parties, action groups, peace
marches and sit-ins. And it has come to dominate
the Experiment.
It is not simply a question of public image or
the fact that the Experiment's political activities
have grabbed more headlines than its seminars,
poetry readings or sensory awakenings; for those

who follow the Experiment closely must be
aware that its members are not political activists
to the exclusion of everything else. But those out
side it, who know only what they read in the
papers, are not so aware of this fact. It is these
people whom the Experiment must reach if it
is to develop its radical community and forge
ahead with radical education.
One sees an unfortunate tendency to define
political education much too narrowly. One also
sees the underlying assumption that if a person
only thought a little about the Vietnam war, the
military-industrial complex, American universi
ties or what have you, he would naturally see
how terrible they all are and how they must be
remade from top to bottom and right now.
The Experiment appears to have developed a
certain close-mindedness, a certain self-satisfac
tion, and appearances are important. At the same
time as it cries out for moral and intellectual
freedom, it seems to work against these very
things.
In short, the future of the Experiment is in
question. Earlier this year, Barry Creenberg ex
pressed concern that the attention devoted to
the seminars might have the unfortunate effect
of distracting attention from the Experiment's
many other worthwhile activities. We must now
ask Barry Creenberg and his associates if the
attention drawn by the Experiment's political
activities has not irreparably hurt the cause of
radical education at Stanford.
The "We Accuse" posters and the newspaper
Resistance have made it clear to the University
community that the Experiment is intensely
dedicated to a political role. Readers of Resis
tance know that for some time the leaders of the
Experiment have been carrying on an active
campaign against the American fight in Viet
nam and recently against Stanford's connections
with Defense Department contractors.
