# Guest Column
## College Athletics: Matter Of Education 
### Robert Hutchins 
The eager readers of these
columns are, I am sure, breath
lessly awaiting my comments
on the most important educa
tional event of the year. I refer,
of course, to the firing of three
coaches at the University of Il
linois because of certain devia
tions from the rules about pay
ment to players.
We know this is the most im
portant educational event of the
year, if not of all time, because
the Chicago Tribune published
a front-page editorial about it.
I am reasonably confident that
the Tribune has never before
printed a front-page editorial
on any educational subject. This
kind of treatment the Tribune
customarily reserves for na
tional catastrophes like the
bombing of Pearl Harbor and
the election of Franklin Delano
.Roosevelt.
Anybody who knows the Tri
bune could have guessed what it
would say. It defended the three

splendid character builders
against the infamous charges
leveled at them by their self
righteous colleagues in the Big
Ten. Oblivious of the fact that
truth is a defense in an action
for libel, the Tribune advised
the three coaches to restore
their fortunes by suing all the
hypocrites who had attacked
them.
This is not the first time 1
have gained the impression that
the Tribune thinks the main
function of the Middle Western
universities is to supply ma
terial for the sports pages. The
Tribune is not alone in this.
The outcry that rang around
the world when the University
of Chicago abolished football
came not from the students,
alumni, faculty or trustees of
that institution, but from the
sports writers. They seemed to
think the university was start
ing a trend that would deprive
them of their livelihood.

They should have known bet
ter. The American university
has many purposes, most of
them conflicting. One is to enter
tain its constituency with glad
iatorial combats and exhibitions
of games of skill. This is a pur
pose everybody can understand
and appreciate. The example of
the University of Chicago could
not bo followed by other insti
tutions because if they had fol
lowed it many of their consti
tuents would have found them
completely incomprehensible.
The American university as it
exists at present is an outmoded
art form. An institution that has
no central purpose cannot func
tion. It has lost its excuse for
existence. It becomes an art
form and one that is quickly
outmoded.
A moment's reflection will
suggest that intercollegiate ath
letics cannot be THE purpose,
or even A purpose, of a univer
sity. Sport is a fine thing. So is
education. But they are not the
same, and only in America have
they been regarded as identical.
The requirements for success in
one are quite different from the
requirements in the other. For
example, nobody except a bas

ketball coach would think of
making height a test of admis
sion to a university.
But if you give favored treat
ment to tall boys, if you discrim
inate against short ones by of
fering "scholarships" for basket
ball players, you are in effect
saying, "You can't afford to at
tend this university unless you
are 6V2 feet high."
In a way I am on the Tri
bune's side. If a university is
going to be in the entertainment
business, it might as well go
first-class and pay the talent
what it takes to get it.
There is no justification for a
conspiracy to hold down the
wages of the performers. The
pretense that the performers
are students should be aban
doned. In fact, Illinois should be
encouraged to hire the Chicago
Bears.
It would be better still to
make a clean break and have a
university racing stable. The
jockeys could wear the college
colors, the students could cheer,
the alumni could bet â€” and the
horses would not have to pass
examinations.
