## Stern Men Deserve A Better Break 
### Bob Fishman 
â€¢ I would like to say a few kind
Words about the men of Stern
Hall. It's time somebody did.
I am praising the residents,
not the residence. Frank Lloyd
Wright's description of Stanford
architecture as "not just an eye
sore but soulsore" applies with
particular justice to Stern Hall.
The facade is reminiscent of
those emergency World War n
barracks you see along the Bay
shore; the interior is laid out
with all the imagination of a
San Quentin cell-block.
Moreover, the food is poorly
prepared and the large dining
rooms in which it is served are
cunningly constructed to ampli
fy sound and thus make con
versation impossible.
Stern Animals?
An environmentalist would
predict, I suppose, that Stern
men are the animals of Stan
ford while the residents of those
fraternity palaces are our model
students.
Instead, the opposite is the
case. I do not merely mean that
the leaking roofs of Stern shel
ter no counterparts to the Phi
Delts. But no group, male or
female, has contributed more to
the University community, I be
lieve, than Stern Hall.
I have neither the space nor
the patience to list the many
contributions which Stern men,
as a group, have made. I think,
however, that the Guest-in-Resi
dence program deserves special
notice. In the four years since
its founding, the program has

become one of the most distin
guished in the country. It has
brought to Stanford such men
as John Dos Passos, Paul Til
lich, Aaron Copland and Richard
Hofstadter. (This quarter's
guests are Fletcher Knebel, head
of Look magazine's Washington
bureau, and Hans Morgenthau
of the University of Chicago.)
Best of All Possible Universities
In the best of all possible uni
versities, the Administration
would do all it could to encour
age and improve such indepen
dent housing. But once again,
the exact opposite is the case.
I admit that the only signifi
cant improvement for Stern it
self would be to bomb the place
to rubble and then begin over
again. But the Housing Office
has made independent housing
seem worse than it is by allow
ing Stern to stand with only
minor improvements while build
ing magnificent clusters for the
fraternities and for the fraterni
ties only.
This fraternity monopoly of
first-rate housing on this cam
pus gives them a great advan
tage over independent living.
Harvard and Yale decided that
first-rate education meant ban
ning fraternities from the cam
pus. Other universities have re
mained neutral. Only Stanford,
to my knowledge, has so blatant
ly favored a sort of living group
whose contributions to the Uni
versity community have been
minimal.
But, as if one unfair advan

tage were not enough, the Wil
bur Experiment, in its present
form, promises to add more.
What freshman living in a dorm
that is coed and organized
around an interesting theme
would want to live in a Stern
House that is neither? And what

Stern man would want to stay
in Stern if he could secure an
honored place in an coed Wil
bur dorm?
I do not believe that the fra
ternity clusters should not have
been built or that the Wilbur
Experiment should not be imple
mented. But to do both without

at the same time giving similar
advantages to those who prefer
independent living is to handi
cap unfairly a living arrange
ment that has proved its ability
to contribute to the University.
If there is any justice in this
naughty world, the men of
Stern deserve a better break.
