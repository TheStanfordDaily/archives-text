## Confusion: Who Edits What? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I am offended when an edito
rial eschews rational argument
and takes the form of a ludi
crously sarcastic polemic. Mr.
Schaefer's proposal for suspen
sion of the "Poster Gang" man
aged to state in four columns
what might have been said in a
single paragraph. Rather than
inane bombast, could we ask for
lucid, considered proposals from
the Daily staff?
CAPPY McCLURE
(Editor's note: Mr. Schaefer's
column was not an editorial and
represents only his own opinion.
Mr. Schaefer, as is the case with
several of our columnists, is also
not a member of the DAILY
staff. Only editorials represent
the opinion of the editorial
board; they can be recognizd be
cause they are unsigned.
• Survey
Editor, The Daily:
At the Anti-Vietnam war ral

ly at White Plaza Thursday
noon, a speaker reported that a
CBS survey in the secure areas
of South Vietnam found that. 81
percent of the people wanted
peace, "even if it meant living
under Communist domination."
It is true that 81 percent did
express a desire for peace. But
the survey found exactly the re
verse of what the speaker said
when it came to attitudes to
ward the Vietcong. Seventy
three percent of those polled
said they would not like to have
the NLF take part in the gov
ernment after the war, 90 per
cent felt their lives would be
easier under the South Vietna
mese government, and none said
it would be easier under the
Vietcong.
The CBS script said: "Con
trary to a widely held belief out
side South Vietnam, its people
are not so exhausted and
numbed by the war that they

no longer care which side wins.
They do care—very much. They
want peace, but not at any price.
They do not want a Communist
government. They want unifica
tion, but not under Communist
terms."
One may debate the method of
the survey, the conditions under
which it was held, or the validi
ty of the results, but that does
not entitle one to report the re
sults as the opposite of what
they actually were.
