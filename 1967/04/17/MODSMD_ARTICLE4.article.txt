# Peace Corps Seeks Volunteers For New Western Samoa Project
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Stanford students will have their
first chance to apply for Peace Corps
service in Polynesia this week.
Today is the official beginning date
for a nationwide recruiting drive by
the Peace Corps to find 300 volunteers
for Western Samoa, first independent
republic of the South Pacific. As many
as 1000 additional volunteers may be
needed to meet anticipated requests
from other Polynesian nations.
The project needs June graduates in
liberal arts to conduct health pro
grams, teach English, and work with
agriculture and marketing coopera
tives. Training for the project volun
teers begins this summer; for the
teachers, this fall.
Foliow-Up
The move to Polynesia follows
closely a group of 450 volunteers who
last fall opened Peace Corps programs
in Micronesia, the United States' Pa
cific Trust Territory. All 97 inhabited
islands of this area have been staffed
with volunteers.
Peace Corps recruiters will be at

Stanford Monday through Friday
from 8:30 to 5 at White Plaza, with
information and applications for those
interested.
Stanford is back in its position as
number one in the nation for percent
age of the senior class volunteering
for the Peace Corps. 122 have volun
teered out of a class of about 1500.
Hopes For Turnout
"We don't expect as many this
time," said Steve Carter, a member of
the Peace Corps recruiting team based
in San Francisco, in an interview Fri
day, "but we hope there will be an
other good turnout."
He added that the Modern Language
Aptitude Test (MLAT) will be given
to applicants every day at 10 a.m.,
4:15 p.m., and 7 p.m. The test deter
mines a person's ability to learn a new
language. It is not used in selection of
volunteers, emphasized Carter, but
only in determining to which coun
tries the volunteers will be sent.
Two movies will also be shown by
the Corps, at 4:15 Tuesday and Wed
nesday in Tresidder 271. The first, en

titled "One Step At A Time," is about
volunteer work in Brazil. The second,
"Give Me A Riddle," has not been
publicly released. It has been author
ized for showing at only four univer
sities in the country. It concerns a
dialogue between a volunteer and a
group of Nigerians, and the Peace
Corps representatives say "It's so un
slanted we don't know whether it
helps us or not." Admission to both
movies is free.
Peru Project
Two other news programs are be
ing opened this year by the Corps.
One is a pilot training program for
persons holding an M.B.A. who will
work in Peru. Established by Stanford
and a university in Lima, the program
trains people to work in small busi
ness developments in urban and rural
areas.
"If the program is successful in
Peru," says Mike Riley of the San
Francisco Corps office, "it will be im
plemented in other countries." The
program is under the auspices of the
Stanford Business School and was
sponsored by Professor Frank Shal
lenberger.
The second program, called VISTA
Associates, is the first effort of the
Peace Corps and VISTA to get to
gether in their programs. The Corps
will have its college junior applicants
trained by VISTA. The volunteers will
work in poverty areas of the country,
such as California's Central Valley,
the South Side of Chicago, and vari
ous Indian reservations.
The purpose of the program is to
give the volunteers experience with
the feeling and problems of poverty
and of a poverty community in order
to understand it as a way of life. In
this way they will be better prepared
for the conditions they see overseas.
There are 500 openings for college
juniors this summer in the project.

other good turnout."
He added that the Modern Language
Aptitude Test (MLAT) will be given
to applicants every day at 10 a.m.,
4:15 p.m., and 7 p.m. The test deter
mines a person's ability to learn a new
language. It is not used in selection of
volunteers, emphasized Carter, but
only in determining to which coun
tries the volunteers will be sent.
Two movies will also be shown by
the Corps, at 4:15 Tuesday and Wed
nesday in Tresidder 271. The first, en

titled "One Step At A Time," is about
volunteer work in Brazil. The second,
"Give Me A Riddle," has not been
publicly released. It has been author
ized for showing at only four univer
sities in the country. It concerns a
dialogue between a volunteer and a
group of Nigerians, and the Peace
Corps representatives say "It's so un
slanted we don't know whether it
helps us or not." Admission to both
movies is free.
Peru Project
Two other news programs are be
ing opened this year by the Corps.
One is a pilot training program for
persons holding an M.B.A. who will
work in Peru. Established by Stanford
and a university in Lima, the program
trains people to work in small busi
ness developments in urban and rural
areas.
"If the program is successful in
Peru," says Mike Riley of the San
Francisco Corps office, "it will be im
plemented in other countries." The
program is under the auspices of the
Stanford Business School and was
sponsored by Professor Frank Shal
lenberger.
The second program, called VISTA
Associates, is the first effort of the
Peace Corps and VISTA to get to
gether in their programs. The Corps
will have its college junior applicants
trained by VISTA. The volunteers will
work in poverty areas of the country,
such as California's Central Valley,
the South Side of Chicago, and vari
ous Indian reservations.
The purpose of the program is to
give the volunteers experience with
the feeling and problems of poverty
and of a poverty community in order
to understand it as a way of life. In
this way they will be better prepared
for the conditions they see overseas.
There are 500 openings for college
juniors this summer in the project.
Stanford students will have their
first chance to apply for Peace Corps
service in Polynesia this week.
Today is the official beginning date
for a nationwide recruiting drive by
the Peace Corps to find 300 volunteers
for Western Samoa, first independent
republic of the South Pacific. As many
as 1000 additional volunteers may be
needed to meet anticipated requests
from other Polynesian nations.
The project needs June graduates in
liberal arts to conduct health pro
grams, teach English, and work with
agriculture and marketing coopera
tives. Training for the project volun
teers begins this summer; for the
teachers, this fall.
Foliow-Up
The move to Polynesia follows
closely a group of 450 volunteers who
last fall opened Peace Corps programs
in Micronesia, the United States' Pa
cific Trust Territory. All 97 inhabited
islands of this area have been staffed
with volunteers.
Peace Corps recruiters will be at

Stanford Monday through Friday
from 8:30 to 5 at White Plaza, with
information and applications for those
interested.
Stanford is back in its position as
number one in the nation for percent
age of the senior class volunteering
for the Peace Corps. 122 have volun
teered out of a class of about 1500.
Hopes For Turnout
"We don't expect as many this
time," said Steve Carter, a member of
the Peace Corps recruiting team based
in San Francisco, in an interview Fri
day, "but we hope there will be an
other good turnout."
