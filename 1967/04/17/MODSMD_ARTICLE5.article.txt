# Martin Luther King Sets 'True Equality' As Goal
## 
### STEVE JONES 
Although American Negroes have
made substantial gains during the
past ten years in their struggle for
political equality, they are now con
fronted with the much greater strug
gle for economic and social equality,
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said Fri
day in Memorial Auditorium.
"The Negro is facing a depression

in his everyday life that is more stag
gering than the depression of the
1930'5..."
"In the North, schools are more seg
regated than they were in 1954. The
Negro is economically worse off. His
unemployment rate was once about
the same as the white's. Today his
unemployment rate is twice the white
average."

Dr. King said there are several
forces blocking the Negro's path to
"genuine equality." White backlash,
"a new name for an old phenomenon,"
is one. According to King, everytime
the nation gives the Negro new civil
liberties, the forces of reaction push
other freedoms farther out of reach.
Racism, said King, is more wide
spread than we realize. Problems of
racism must be fought on legal as
well as moral grounds.
"Although it may be true that mor
ality can't be legislated, behavior can
be regulated. Law may not change
the hearts of men, but it can and does
change the attitudes of men."
Feelings that race problems will
disappear as time goes by and that
the Negro can and should help him
self are still prevalent in the white
community.
"We may have to repent in this gen
eration not for the violent actions of
bad people but for the inaction of
good people who have the ... notion
that time will cure all evil."
"It's a cruel thing to ask a bootless
man to pull himself up by his own
bootstraps."
Riots
Saying that black power and riots
may be the consequences of white
backlash rather than the causes of
it, King characterized riots as the
"language of the unheard." As long
as America postpones justice, he said,
we stand in danger of having riots.
It is unfortunate that the Civil
Rights movement, which faces a
greater struggle now than ever be
fore, has been weakened by those
who react to the prospect of Negroes
attaining social status and economic
prosperity. King said that many of
those who actively participated in the
Civil Rights movement during the
past ten years were outraged by ex
tremist policies towards Negroes but
did not want Negroes to achieve com
plete equality.
Dr. King used Michael Harrington's
book, The Oth r America, as a theme
for his speech, emphasizing the rele
vance of the poverty problem and the
Vietnam war to the race problem.
He received a half-minute ovation
from the capacity crowd when he
said,
"If we spend thirty-five billion dol
lars a year to fight an ill-conceived
war in Vietnam and twenty billion
dollars to put a man on the moon, we
can spend billions of dollars to put
God's children on their own two feet,
right now."
Minimum Income
Since the Negro is substantially
represented in "the other America,"
the poverty program can be an effec
tive aid to the Civil Rights move
ment. Labelling the present war on
poverty as "hardly a skirmish," Dr.
King proposed a guaranteed mini
mum income for all Americans. He
didn't specify how money would be
allocated under such a system.
Seemingly unperturbed by either
his plane's late arrival in San Fran
cisco or Dean B. Davie Napier's idol
atrous introduction, King spoke elo
quently, without notes, quoting poets
and philosophers from John Donne
to Zilphia Horton. Dr. King received
two standing ovations from a polite,
predominantly student audience.
