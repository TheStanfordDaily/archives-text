# Stanford Look': Story Of Changing Styles
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Hoover Tower and Wilbur Hall, the
arches of Inner Quad and the sprawl
ing decks of Tresidder Union, the ivy
covered brick of Roble and the glass
and-stone boxes of the Storke Build
ing—this is architecture at Stanford.
A conglomeration of styles and
periods, made uniform with roofs of
übiquitous red tile, it can make the
observer wonder if there is any plan
to it or if so, how well it has been
hidden. With the exception of the red
tile roofs and stone arches, there
seems to be little continuity to the
Stanford style.
Where did it all begin? To discover
this we return to the early days of
Stanford's history, when Leland Stan
ford Sr. began meeting with archi
tects to plan the building of his Uni
versity. General Francis A. Walker,
President of MIT at the time, was one
of these architects, and it is from him
that we discover the first description

of the plan for Stanford. Walker en
visioned "one-story buildings, in three
standard sizes." He recommends "that
the buildings be in a high degree uni
form in structure. Where more light
is required than can be obtained from
windows set into the walls of the
building due to their stone construc
tion, additional light can be easily
obtained through glass tiles or glass
windows in the roof."
That was Inner Quad.
Early Conceptions
Frederick Law Olmsted, another of
the architects, explained the plan for
the grounds around the classrooms in
terms of the climate: "Neither turf
nor any known substitute for cover
ing unpaved surfaces between the
buildings of a college can be used in
California as turf is used in the East.
Trees rooted in ground that is tram
pled as the ground is trampled about
the Eastern college buildings would
be sickly, deformed, and short-lived.

. . . If we are to look for types of
buildings and arrangements suitable
to the climate of California it will
rather be in those founded by the
wiser men of Syria, Greece, Italy and
Spain."
Olmsted also articulated a descrip
tion of the Quad providing a "con
tinuous arcade of stone" with "class
rooms, lecture rooms, draughting
rooms and rooms for scientific in
vestigation and instruction" each in
height of "one high and airy story."
The architects were also concerned
with the residential structure of the
university.
Original Housing- Plans
Said General Walker, "As regards
the housing of the students of the
university I would most earnestly and
emphatically recommend the intro
duction of the Cottage system for all
the girls and young women who have
to find their homes outside of families.

Even for the young men, I believe the
same system will be found advan
tageous. Should the increased expense
of board in cottages containing from
fifteen to twenty-five students be re
garded as an important objection to
this system I would still suggest
the erection of cottages for dormitory
purposes around small parks, with
a common kitchen and dining room."
Since those early days Stanford
architecture has undergone many
changes. It has passed through the
period when attempts were made to
continue a superficial uniformity of
structure to the present policy of con
structing contemporary buildings. Be
cause of these changes, Stanford pres
ently has seven basic "types" of archi
tecture, according to the Planning
Office.
Quad-esque?
Richardson Romanesque, adapted
from the European Romanesque or
pre-Gothic, features short columns

with decorated capital and hemispher
ic arches. (Inner Quad and the en
gineering labs.)
Victorian Romanesque differs struc
turally from the above in number of
stories, plan and the relation of mas
onry thickness to wall height. (Front
of Quad, Geology and Engineering
Corners, Memorial Church, the front
half of Encina.)
Transitional borrowed the most ob
vious of the Richardsonian motifs or
the most popular motifs of the day.
Arches and columns are used only
superficially. (Roblc, Lagunita, the
Main Library, Cubberley, Memorial
Auditorium, Branner, Toyon).
Colonial structures are light wood
derived from the American Colonial
period. (Firehouse).
California Spanish uses modem
structure with modified Spanish mo
tifs (the old Union).
Classical Revival used an experi

mental structural system of gravity
wall and reinforced concrete, with
motifs from Greek, Roman and Egyp
tian styles, (the Museum).
Contemporary With What?
Contemporary is defined as "a
frank departure from the use of mo
tifs of the past as superficial decora
tion." Examples given include Stern
Hall and the boathouse, but all the
new buildings on campus would
qualify.
Perhaps the most pressing question
is: How do these styles fit together?
There seems to be little explanation
for Wilbur, Hoover Tower, buildings
such as the Quad and Encina which
mix styles of architecture, and other
campus oddities. Criticisms not only
of individual structures but of overall
plan of Stanford architecture, as well
as different views on the subject,
will be articulated in a forthcoming
Daily forum.

wiser men of Syria, Greece, Italy and
Spain."
Olmsted also articulated a descrip
tion of the Quad providing a "con
tinuous arcade of stone" with "class
rooms, lecture rooms, draughting
rooms and rooms for scientific in
vestigation and instruction" each in
height of "one high and airy story."
The architects were also concerned
with the residential structure of the
university.
Original Housing- Plans
Said General Walker, "As regards
the housing of the students of the
university I would most earnestly and
emphatically recommend the intro
duction of the Cottage system for all
the girls and young women who have
to find their homes outside of families.

Even for the young men, I believe the
same system will be found advan
tageous. Should the increased expense
of board in cottages containing from
fifteen to twenty-five students be re
garded as an important objection to
this system I would still suggest
the erection of cottages for dormitory
purposes around small parks, with
a common kitchen and dining room."
Since those early days Stanford
architecture has undergone many
changes. It has passed through the
period when attempts were made to
continue a superficial uniformity of
structure to the present policy of con
structing contemporary buildings. Be
cause of these changes, Stanford pres
ently has seven basic "types" of archi
tecture, according to the Planning
Office.
Quad-esque?
Richardson Romanesque, adapted
from the European Romanesque or
pre-Gothic, features short columns

with decorated capital and hemispher
ic arches. (Inner Quad and the en
gineering labs.)
Victorian Romanesque differs struc
turally from the above in number of
stories, plan and the relation of mas
onry thickness to wall height. (Front
of Quad, Geology and Engineering
Corners, Memorial Church, the front
half of Encina.)
Transitional borrowed the most ob
vious of the Richardsonian motifs or
the most popular motifs of the day.
Arches and columns are used only
superficially. (Roblc, Lagunita, the
Main Library, Cubberley, Memorial
Auditorium, Branner, Toyon).
Colonial structures are light wood
derived from the American Colonial
period. (Firehouse).
California Spanish uses modem
structure with modified Spanish mo
tifs (the old Union).
Classical Revival used an experi

mental structural system of gravity
wall and reinforced concrete, with
motifs from Greek, Roman and Egyp
tian styles, (the Museum).
Contemporary With What?
Contemporary is defined as "a
frank departure from the use of mo
tifs of the past as superficial decora
tion." Examples given include Stern
Hall and the boathouse, but all the
new buildings on campus would
qualify.
Perhaps the most pressing question
is: How do these styles fit together?
There seems to be little explanation
for Wilbur, Hoover Tower, buildings
such as the Quad and Encina which
mix styles of architecture, and other
campus oddities. Criticisms not only
of individual structures but of overall
plan of Stanford architecture, as well
as different views on the subject,
will be articulated in a forthcoming
Daily forum.
Hoover Tower and Wilbur Hall, the
arches of Inner Quad and the sprawl
ing decks of Tresidder Union, the ivy
covered brick of Roble and the glass
and-stone boxes of the Storke Build
ing—this is architecture at Stanford.
A conglomeration of styles and
periods, made uniform with roofs of
übiquitous red tile, it can make the
observer wonder if there is any plan
to it or if so, how well it has been
hidden. With the exception of the red
tile roofs and stone arches, there
seems to be little continuity to the
Stanford style.
Where did it all begin? To discover
this we return to the early days of
Stanford's history, when Leland Stan
ford Sr. began meeting with archi
tects to plan the building of his Uni
versity. General Francis A. Walker,
President of MIT at the time, was one
of these architects, and it is from him
that we discover the first description

of the plan for Stanford. Walker en
visioned "one-story buildings, in three
standard sizes." He recommends "that
the buildings be in a high degree uni
form in structure. Where more light
is required than can be obtained from
windows set into the walls of the
building due to their stone construc
tion, additional light can be easily
obtained through glass tiles or glass
windows in the roof."
That was Inner Quad.
Early Conceptions
Frederick Law Olmsted, another of
the architects, explained the plan for
the grounds around the classrooms in
terms of the climate: "Neither turf
nor any known substitute for cover
ing unpaved surfaces between the
buildings of a college can be used in
California as turf is used in the East.
Trees rooted in ground that is tram
pled as the ground is trampled about
the Eastern college buildings would
be sickly, deformed, and short-lived.

. . . If we are to look for types of
buildings and arrangements suitable
to the climate of California it will
rather be in those founded by the
wiser men of Syria, Greece, Italy and
Spain."
Olmsted also articulated a descrip

Main Library, Cubberley, Memorial
Auditorium, Branner, Toyon).
Colonial structures are light wood
derived from the American Colonial
period. (Firehouse).
California Spanish uses modem
structure with modified Spanish mo
tifs (the old Union).
Classical Revival used an experi

mental structural system of gravity
wall and reinforced concrete, with
motifs from Greek, Roman and Egyp
tian styles, (the Museum).
Contemporary With What?
Contemporary is defined as "a
frank departure from the use of mo
tifs of the past as superficial decora
tion." Examples given include Stern
Hall and the boathouse, but all the
new buildings on campus would
qualify.
Perhaps the most pressing question
is: How do these styles fit together?
There seems to be little explanation
for Wilbur, Hoover Tower, buildings
such as the Quad and Encina which
mix styles of architecture, and other
campus oddities. Criticisms not only
of individual structures but of overall
plan of Stanford architecture, as well
as different views on the subject,
will be articulated in a forthcoming
Daily forum.
Hoover Tower and Wilbur Hall, the
arches of Inner Quad and the sprawl
ing decks of Tresidder Union, the ivy
covered brick of Roble and the glass
and-stone boxes of the Storke Build
ing—this is architecture at Stanford.
A conglomeration of styles and
periods, made uniform with roofs of
übiquitous red tile, it can make the
observer wonder if there is any plan
to it or if so, how well it has been
hidden. With the exception of the red
tile roofs and stone arches, there
seems to be little continuity to the
Stanford style.
Where did it all begin? To discover
this we return to the early days of
Stanford's history, when Leland Stan
ford Sr. began meeting with archi
tects to plan the building of his Uni
versity. General Francis A. Walker,
President of MIT at the time, was one
of these architects, and it is from him
that we discover the first description

of the plan for Stanford. Walker en
visioned "one-story buildings, in three
standard sizes." He recommends "that
the buildings be in a high degree uni
form in structure. Where more light
is required than can be obtained from
windows set into the walls of the
building due to their stone construc
tion, additional light can be easily
obtained through glass tiles or glass
windows in the roof."
That was Inner Quad.
Early Conceptions
Frederick Law Olmsted, another of
the architects, explained the plan for
the grounds around the classrooms in
terms of the climate: "Neither turf
nor any known substitute for cover
ing unpaved surfaces between the
buildings of a college can be used in
California as turf is used in the East.
Trees rooted in ground that is tram
pled as the ground is trampled about
the Eastern college buildings would
be sickly, deformed, and short-lived.

. . . If we are to look for types of
buildings and arrangements suitable
to the climate of California it will
rather be in those founded by the
wiser men of Syria, Greece, Italy and
Spain."
Olmsted also articulated a descrip
tion of the Quad providing a "con
tinuous arcade of stone" with "class
rooms, lecture rooms, draughting
rooms and rooms for scientific in
vestigation and instruction" each in
height of "one high and airy story."
The architects were also concerned
with the residential structure of the
university.
Original Housing- Plans
Said General Walker, "As regards
the housing of the students of the
university I would most earnestly and
emphatically recommend the intro
duction of the Cottage system for all
the girls and young women who have
to find their homes outside of families.

Even for the young men, I believe the
same system will be found advan
tageous. Should the increased expense
of board in cottages containing from
fifteen to twenty-five students be re
garded as an important objection to
this system I would still suggest
the erection of cottages for dormitory
purposes around small parks, with
a common kitchen and dining room."
Since those early days Stanford
architecture has undergone many
changes. It has passed through the
period when attempts were made to
continue a superficial uniformity of
structure to the present policy of con
structing contemporary buildings. Be
cause of these changes, Stanford pres
ently has seven basic "types" of archi
tecture, according to the Planning
Office.
Quad-esque?
Richardson Romanesque, adapted
from the European Romanesque or
pre-Gothic, features short columns

with decorated capital and hemispher
ic arches. (Inner Quad and the en
gineering labs.)
Victorian Romanesque differs struc
turally from the above in number of
stories, plan and the relation of mas
onry thickness to wall height. (Front
of Quad, Geology and Engineering
Corners, Memorial Church, the front
half of Encina.)
Transitional borrowed the most ob
vious of the Richardsonian motifs or
the most popular motifs of the day.
Arches and columns are used only
superficially. (Roblc, Lagunita, the
Main Library, Cubberley, Memorial
Auditorium, Branner, Toyon).
