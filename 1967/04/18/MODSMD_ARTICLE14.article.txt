# Judoists Win Surprise NCAA 4th
## 
### TOM WONG 
Stanford's first NCAA judo
team made an unexpectedly
strong showing to compile
enough points for a fourth place
tie in the national collegiate
judo championships last week
end.
The Stanford team, coached
by Tamo Kitaura, was com
posed of four men. They were;
Donald Ryujin in the 139-154 lb.
weight category, Don Thorn
burg in the 154-165 lb. class,
David Kutner in the 165-176 lb.
class, and Charlie To u ton in the
176-204 lb. weight class.
Stanford did not have any rep

resentatives in the 139 and un
der and 204 and over classes.
Kutner and Ryujin made it
into the final playoffs and then
earned fourth places. Thornburg
and Touton, though not making
it into the finals, contributed to
Stanford's point total with their
sixth and fifth place finishes.
San Jose State, which has
been the NCAA judo team
champions for the last five
years, easily managed to keep
the title for the sixth year in a
row. They placed first in four
out of the six weight classes
and second in the remaining
two. San Francisco State Col
lege came in second.
