# Sophs Challenge Vets After Crew Victories
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The five boats of the Stanford
Crew Association outran every
thing that the Santa Clara, Ore
gon State, or Southern Califor
nia crew squads could put on
the water Saturday to win
smashing victories in the first
and only home race of the sea
son.
Officially, the Indian oarsmen
won only four of the five races,
as the second freshman boat
was disqualified for an improper
lane change.
The varsity boat scored a big
win, leading Santa Clara, South
ern Cal and Oregon State, in
that order, with a 5:39.6 clock
ing.
Sophomores Replace Four
Four of Stanford's top oars
men, Jon Stilt, Bill Stump, Tim
Cowles, and Jim Madden did
not row Saturday, giving Coach
Will Condon a chance to test
four heralded sophomore pros
pects in the varsity boat.
The four, Gaynor Dawson,
Bob Thomas, Steve Crossland,
and Jim Haley have been dub
bed the "Fearsome Foursome."
It remains to be seen in work
outs this week, if any of the
four will nose out a varsity vet
eran.
The other four men in the
Kim boat Saturday were Mc
Kim Barnes, Larry Title, Russ
Barto, and John Hotson, with
Tom Eastman at cox.
Two J.V. Boats Win
The JV shell, stroked by Carl

Mundt, led all the way over
second place Santa Clara, win
ning in 6:42.3. The third varsity
boat won a tight race with a
strong finish.
The frosh shell, stroked by
Nick Farwell, moved ahead at
the onset of the race and finish
ed well ahead of Oregon State,
Santa Clara, and USC.
The second freshman boat
would have won the most deci
sive victory of the day, but for
the lane change that gave the
victory to Oregon State.
