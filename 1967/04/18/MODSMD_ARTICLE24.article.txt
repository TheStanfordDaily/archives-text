## Novak, Otis: Difference Factual, Not Ethical 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In his letter of April 10, Pro
fessor Brooks Otis manifested
the urbanity and warmth of
spirit which have won him much
admiration, respect, and affec
tion. His appeal for "specific,
reasonable, tolerant, public and
reiterated debate" about the war
in Vietnam readily wins my
support.
Regarding the war, moreover,
Professor Otis appears to stand
on the same general theological
ground that I do; viz., "that we
cannot practice an absolute ethic
because we must in fact choose
between quite relative ethics in
each of which there is a very
considerable amount of wrong."
Where Professor Otis and I
part company, it appears, con
cerns matters of political fact
and political interpretation. It
was not long ago that I shared
the hardheaded, reluctant, sad
dened support of the Vietnam
war which Professor Otis now
manifests, a support based upon
my estimation of the lesser of
two great evils.
Past Arguments
No matter how we got into
the war, I argued, we are now in
it; realistic discussion must be
gin from that point. I then ar
gued that our main concern in
Southeast Asia was Chinese na
tionalism, and I estimated that
a United States withdrawal
from South Vietnam would
mean that the Chinese verbal
sponsorship of "wars of nation
al liberation" would acquire fu
ture political weight in other
Asian nations, Latin America
and elsewhere. I further argued
that over the next fifteen years,
domestic dilficulties would con
stantly tempt the Chinese into
the promotion of violent revo
lutions elsewhere; after some
such period, a more prosperous
China would, like a more pros
perous Russia, become more in
volved in the international com
munity in a less offensive and
obstreperous way. In this view,
South Vietnam was, in effect,
the suffering pawn in a much
larger game.
What changed my mind were
three sets of facts: (1) the per
sonal acquisition of more and
better information about the
actual history of the United
States involvement in Vietnam,
and about the nature of the
struggle there; (2) the increased
domestic struggles within
China, and the failure of her
foreign policies in almost every
part of the world; (3) the con
stant raising of the threshold
of violence and destruction in
South Vietnam, through the in
troduction of U.S. technology:
B-52 raids, the bombings of

North Vietnam, offshore shell
ing, the employment of napalm,
the bombing of "V.C." villages
in South Vietnam, the use of
chemicals to defoliate jungle
areas and, sometimes, to deprive
the "V.C." of crops.
When Professor Otis sug
gests, for example, that "the
overwhelming evidence is that
North Vietnam will not negoi
ate," and that North Vietnam
"has thus put the United States
on the spot," I find myself ask
ing what there is for North
Vietnam to negotiate? It is
North Vietnam that has been
bombarded by sea and by air by
the United States. As I read the
evidence, the North Vietnamese
troops in South Vietnam are
a response to the prior United
States escalation there. When
the North Vietnamese sent 400
men into South Vietnam in De
cember, 1964, the United States
already had over 20,000 men
there. Nine months later the fig
ures released by the Defense De
partment listed 150,000 Ameri
cans against 13,000 North Viet
namese. When one recalls that
Vietnam is one nation, not two,
it becomes clear who is the for
eign power, the invader, the ag
gressor.
Power Politics
The intentions of the leaders
of the United States may well
be as pure as the driven snow,
individually and collectively. But
power tends to corrupt, and it
appears to me that the vast
military and economic power
generated by our nation has
been running on its own blun
dering course. Without any
body's wishing it, we have be
come men who solve political
difficulties — even those of
other people — with raw mili
tary power. Employing the rhe
toric of the "defense of liberty,"
we are killing many people.
Consequently, I do not find
withdrawal from Vietnam "un
thinkable." On the contrary, the
honorable way to peace is to ad
mit one's blunders, to extricate
oneself as gracefully and re
sponsibly as possible, and to go
home. It is precisely because the
issues in Vietnam "are much
less clearcut" than those of
World War II that the high
threshold of destruction there
seems to me so immoral. Being
so unsure of our moral respon
sibility, how dare we destroy
so much of another nation? Af
terwards, when the issues will
be clearer, one cannot bring the
dead back to life.
The task of the university
community, it seems to me, is
not to scream out any one posi
tion loud and clear. It is to re
mind this nation how sticky §nd

messy this war in Vietnam is;
above all, how morally contra
dictory it is to employ means of
high technical destructiveness in
a war without front lines, in a
civil war among civilians, in a
war in which our own nation
is in violation of every relevant
law and treaty, in a war of am
bivalent political purposes —
perhaps now even of no political
purpose except militaristic in
ertia and fear of losing face.
Vietnam One Nation
I do not think we are fighting
for the freedom of South Viet
nam, or to defend the South
Vietnamese. We have been flag
rantly violating the sovereignty
of North Vietnam. We have, de
spite the clear Geneva Accords
of 1954 to the contrary, insisted
on the separation of South Viet
nam from North Vietnam as an
"independent" state (defended,
managed, taught, and reorganiz
ed by the U.S.)
I do not see how there can be
peace in Vietnam until our own
people recognize what our gov
ernment has been doing in our
name—perhaps the most shame
ful sequence our flag has ever
been carried into. Regarding
North Vietnam, it is we who are
wrong. They are not bombing
the "military installations" in
our homeland, nor shelling our
shores. In South Vietnam, they
are not the foreigners.
A settlement in Vietnam may
be possible, once we take the ini
tiative in halting what we took
the initiative in beginning. Such
a settlement may involve the
participation of "Marxists"
from the N.L.F. in the future
government, and perhaps even
tually a Marxist-oriented, re
united North and South. But
that is a problem for the people
of Vietnam to work out; their
fate is not ours to decide or
r manipulate.

• Trade U nits
Editor, The Daily:
.Kudos to Krauskopf! and all
those others who feel that Stan
ford "is no longer justified in
requiring all students to take
courses both in biology and the
physical sciences." Surely it
should be apparent by now that
requiring harmless, inoffending
humanities students to spend
long hours in fetid laboratories,
squinting down broken micro
scopes at muck scraped from
the sides of Lake Lagunita is
at once useless and needlessly
cruel. Nor is it likely to do much
to narrow the two-culture gap.
Au contraire, the budding hu
manist comes away from the

laboratory with the well-nigh
unshakeable conviction that any
one who could make such beast
ly torment his life's work must
be both a Philistine and a mas
ochist.
It has often been pointed out
that the fact-oriented teaching
of General Studies science
courses is fruitless, since a) the
material will have become obso
lete within ten years, and b) the
student will have forgotten the
material within ten days. But
soft! I can see my Bio T.A.
wringing his hands in anguish.
"Surely," he says, "you remem
ber something." Well, some
things, it is true, have stuck
with me. Who could forget the
Voyage of the Beagle? or such
test questions as "How many
electrons are being transfered
by the ATP in the yeast cells
of your TA in the length of time
it takes you to read this ques
tion?" And certain phrases—
"adenosine triphosphate' 'and
"endoplasmic reticulum"—have
a nice ring to thorn. I also seem
to recall a determined, if genet
ically naive, attempt by the city
of Singapore to rid itself of
black cats. But beyond that—im
penetrable mnemonic gloom pre
vails.
Surely we could all be better
served. The things about science
I consider really important—
about the nature of scientific
creativity and of scientific pro
gress—l have learned in human
ities courses. Until such time as
the academic juggernaut can be
persuaded to reverse direction,
let me propose a measure de
signed to bring temporary re
lief. Let us intigate academic
barter. Science majors could
trade surplus units in science
courses for the leftover units
of humanities students, on
terms arranged by the contract
ing parties. Such dialogues as
"Hey, I'll give you a five unit
A in Soc. 1 for your three unit
B in Math 10. Look, I'm giving
you a deal. How can you pass it
up?" "A three-unit A in Physics!
For you, four units!"
Until such time as my wise
proposal is adopted, fellow ped
ants-of-tomorrow, hold on! For
san et haec. . .

• W ho's Accusing?
Editor, The Daily:
I accuse the Experiment of
using my money to print their
posters—posters which do not
represent my opinions or even
the opinions of a majority of the
student body.
I accuse LASSU of voting my
money to this cause—ssooof the

money collected from all Stan
ford students.
The deed was perpetrated at
the last LASSU meeting.

• For Self-Examination
Editor, The Daily:
I hope that Profs. Brown, No
vak, Ruotolo, and Dean Napier
will join me in calling for reflec
tion on the nature and tone of
the responses to Prof. Otis pub
lished in Wednesday's Daily;
and I hope that the authors of
those letters are willing to open
their own positions to examina
tion.
Mr. Otis, as I understand him,
is calling for definition and de
bate on a complex international
issue. He wants this debate to
replace unreflective and unin
formed expression of moral
sentiments, sometimes put forth
with no notion of the diplomatic
problems of implementation.
His respondents criticise the
arrogance of power with which
our government is conducting
our foreign affairs. I will ask
them: isn't your polemic and
spleen towards Mr. Otis a local
example of the attitude you de
cry?
Anyone can produce a moral
fiat. But when debate descends
to the exchange of slogans and
imputations of moral monstros
ity in the opponent, one dessi
cated assertion is as good as
another. If our government of
ficials are to question their con
victions of moral Tightness, so
are we.
A task of the university com
munity in society, as I see it, is
to reflect on moral posture, in
cluding our own, come to under
stand the positions of others,
and articulate the basic issues.
There is only one time when
social circumstances override
the need for reflection; that is
when the society is ruled by a
tyrant whose position will not
brook criticism. When the time
for thought and reflection in the
university is past, the time for
intolerance and tyranny is ripe.
No-Man's Land
There is for me a disturbing
similarity between the conserva
tive and liberal positions on this
campus: both tend to advocate
political disengagement. But be
tween the policies of 'fight' and
'run' lies a vast no-man's-land
in which international negotia
tion must in fact take place.
If war is to diplomacy what
surgery is to medicine, there
are conflicts in the social struc
ture which must be resolved by
other means—debate and dia
lectic—when war ceases. Mr.
Otis' respondents seem to me to
be offering moral enthusiasm
where political understanding is
needed. The possibility has
passed them by that he too
shares those passions, but sees
difficulties in implementation. I
think they have engaged in the
same thoughtless aggression
and uncritical moral certitude
which they impute to our gov
ernment.
'Know Thyself?
Two of our culture's greatest
moral teachers, Socrates and
Jesus, have insisted that those
who are going to criticise others
must know how to criticise
themselves. I would like to put
forth the following questions
for self-examination, because I
consider them crucial in achiev
ing the social dialectic which
will have to replace war:
How can I distinguish be
tween liberalism, conservatism,
and isolationism?
Are American individualism
and pluralism involved in an im
perialist posture?
What role has American high
er education played in the for

mulation of our present foreign
policy?
How can I be sure that my
moral outlook, if applied gen
erally, will not load to aggres
sion? Do I know the implica
tions of my own position?
Am I looking for the causes
of ethical conflict, or am I an
othical dogmatist?

• Law Against Peace
Editor, The Daily:
Re Mr. Doty's letter. The AP
reports: "A survey of public op
inion in South Vietnam from a
population sampling, the pol
sters admit had to be sharply
restricted, reported yesterday
that 81 percent of those ques
tioned wanted peace above all
else. Only four percent listed
victory over Communism. . . ."
In other questions, not con
cerned with what they wanted
"above all else" they did express
the attitudes that Mr. Doty
ascribes to them. My point is
quite simple: if we are in Viet
nam to defend the right to self
determination of the Vietnamese
people and 81 percent (accord
ing to this poll) want peace
"above all else," what does one
do with the following fact: it
has been a criminal offense in
South Vietnam (punishable in
some instances by death) to ad
vocate a negotiated end to the
war.
