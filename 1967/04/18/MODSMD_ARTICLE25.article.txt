## Phi Delt Rush: Ideal Chance To Reveal The Spirit Of The Loving Brotherhood 
### Kirk Hanson 
Every time rush rolls around
it seems one poor fraternity is
temporarily removed from cam
pus and prohibited from trying
to draw unaffiliated males (no
doubt a neurotic lot) into the
loving brotherhood.
Three years of non-rush evap
orated the loving brotherhood of
Zeta Psi as it existed in 1963
before it made its hasty depar
ture from campus due to unau
thorized activity. Zeta Psi is now
building from scratch and the
attentions of the new loving
brotherhood are yet to be af
firmed.
But Phi Delta Theta, our cur
rent off campus fraternity, faces
a much more delicate problem.
By the terms of their suspension
last November they are pro
hibited from rushing this spring
but may be permitted on cam
pus next fall, if their "rehabilita
tion" indicates they are prepared
to fit into the loving society that
is Stanford.
Rehabilitation
Last week when the Interfra
ternity Board (IFB) premitted
rush for the Phi Delts only to
have the permission revoked by
the Dean of Students, many
questions were raised concern
ing rehabilitation of a fraternity
and what part rush plays in this
process.
First it is obvious that even
if Phi Delta Theta has an in
formal rush, as they seem to be
conducting despite the recent
ruling, they will have a hard
time attracting pledges with pro
mises of "maybe next fall, may
be another year." A bid card in
the hand is certainly worth two
at an indefinite time in the fu

ture and the Phi Delts will be
hard pressed to get security
seeking freshmen to wait around
for the second coming.
How is rehabilitation to pro
ceed?
Steering: Committee
The steering committee under
Professor James T. Watkins is
now being organized to super
vise this rehabilitation of the Phi
Delts and will aid them in draw
ing up plans for financing,
pledge training, and creation of
a satisfactory environment in
the Phi Delt House (now the
most satisfactory environment
of them all with its Grove resi
dents).
It is going to be all too easy
for this committee working with
the leaders of the fraternity to
formulate a set of wonderful
proposals reeking of benevolence
and constructive intention (and
maybe a touch of the academic
environment the fraternity sub
committee of the Housing Com
mission seemed to be so fanatic
ally seeking).
But the real decision whether
to let the Phi Delts back on
campus must come on the basis
of action—how the remaining
members of the fraternity do act
together. Were all the trouble
makers eliminated by gradua
tion or expulsion? Or were these
group actions merely subli
mated until the brothers are
again under one roof? Will the
fraternity be allowed back on
campus on the basis of neat
plans, only to once more be run
off campus for misconduct?
Loving: Brotherhood
Maybe a chance to hold rush
would be a chance to show how

the loving brotherhood can oper
ate. Maybe the rush could have
a definite part in the rehabilita
tion by letting the remaining
group show that they can work
together.
This would also aid the house
when they come onto campus
in the fall. The house would be
full and so could survive fi
nancially without stopgap mea
sures. Also the makeup of the
house would already be altered
significantly and the remaining
brothers would not feel as a dec
imated group being sent back to

the slaughter.
Actions such as the "invasion"
of Grove by three members of
Phi Delta Theta who evidently
in their condition had forgotten
they had moved several months
ago are far more indicative of
attitude and spirit than are a
sheaf of well-formulated plans.
Although much of the formal
rush is already completed, it
would be a reasonable plan to al
low Phi Delta Theta to hold in
formal rush without formal bid
ding. But maybe this is a mute
question too.

Rehabilitation
Last week when the Interfra
ternity Board (IFB) premitted
rush for the Phi Delts only to
have the permission revoked by
the Dean of Students, many
questions were raised concern
ing rehabilitation of a fraternity
and what part rush plays in this
process.
First it is obvious that even
if Phi Delta Theta has an in
formal rush, as they seem to be
conducting despite the recent
ruling, they will have a hard
time attracting pledges with pro
mises of "maybe next fall, may
be another year." A bid card in
the hand is certainly worth two
at an indefinite time in the fu

ture and the Phi Delts will be
hard pressed to get security
seeking freshmen to wait around
for the second coming.
How is rehabilitation to pro
ceed?
Steering: Committee
The steering committee under
Professor James T. Watkins is
now being organized to super
vise this rehabilitation of the Phi
Delts and will aid them in draw
ing up plans for financing,
pledge training, and creation of
a satisfactory environment in
the Phi Delt House (now the
most satisfactory environment
of them all with its Grove resi
dents).
It is going to be all too easy
for this committee working with
the leaders of the fraternity to
formulate a set of wonderful
proposals reeking of benevolence
and constructive intention (and
maybe a touch of the academic
environment the fraternity sub
committee of the Housing Com
mission seemed to be so fanatic
ally seeking).
But the real decision whether
to let the Phi Delts back on
campus must come on the basis
of action—how the remaining
members of the fraternity do act
together. Were all the trouble
makers eliminated by gradua
tion or expulsion? Or were these
group actions merely subli
mated until the brothers are
again under one roof? Will the
fraternity be allowed back on
campus on the basis of neat
plans, only to once more be run
off campus for misconduct?
Loving: Brotherhood
Maybe a chance to hold rush
would be a chance to show how

the loving brotherhood can oper
ate. Maybe the rush could have
a definite part in the rehabilita
tion by letting the remaining
group show that they can work
together.
This would also aid the house
when they come onto campus
in the fall. The house would be
full and so could survive fi
nancially without stopgap mea
sures. Also the makeup of the
house would already be altered
significantly and the remaining
brothers would not feel as a dec
imated group being sent back to

the slaughter.
Actions such as the "invasion"
of Grove by three members of
Phi Delta Theta who evidently
in their condition had forgotten
they had moved several months
ago are far more indicative of
attitude and spirit than are a
sheaf of well-formulated plans.
Although much of the formal
rush is already completed, it
would be a reasonable plan to al
low Phi Delta Theta to hold in
formal rush without formal bid
ding. But maybe this is a mute
question too.
Every time rush rolls around
it seems one poor fraternity is
temporarily removed from cam
pus and prohibited from trying
to draw unaffiliated males (no
doubt a neurotic lot) into the
loving brotherhood.
Three years of non-rush evap
orated the loving brotherhood of
Zeta Psi as it existed in 1963
before it made its hasty depar
ture from campus due to unau
thorized activity. Zeta Psi is now
building from scratch and the
attentions of the new loving
brotherhood are yet to be af
firmed.
But Phi Delta Theta, our cur
rent off campus fraternity, faces
a much more delicate problem.
By the terms of their suspension
last November they are pro
hibited from rushing this spring
but may be permitted on cam
pus next fall, if their "rehabilita
tion" indicates they are prepared
to fit into the loving society that
