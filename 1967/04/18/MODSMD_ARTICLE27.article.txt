# PEACE CORPS IS GOING TO POLYNESIA
## Liberal Arts Graduates Will Be Nucleus of New Western Samoa Program 
### 
Ihe Peace Corps has been invited to
send Volunteers to Polynesia's first inde
pendent nation — Western Samoa.
Having demonstrated in Micronesia in
the space of only a few months what Vol
unteer catalysts can do in a Pacific Island
setting, the Peace Corps will place a new
contingent in training for the Samoan
assignment beginning this summer, with
the likelihood that by that time Volun
teers will also be requested for assignment
in other new South Pacific island areas.
Peace Corps planners believe it is pos
sible that these projected programs, cou
pled with the existing Micronesian efforts,
could add as many as 1,000 new Volun
teers in the Pacific.

For Western Samoa, and other pro
jected South Seas assignments, the Peace
Corps is seeking mainly liberal arts grad
uates for tasks in teaching, public health,
agriculture and community development.

THE GOAL is to raise thousands of
islanders from a life of ill health, poor
diet and lack of education in an area of
the world that historically has received
more romantic than realistic attention.
Volunteers in Western Samoa — a nine
island complex supporting a rapidly-grow
ing population of 134,000 — will form a
striking force against an array of health
problems and obstacles to educational and
economic development in a country where:

• almost all Samoans suffer from in
testinal parasites and many others are
afflicted with tuberculosis, yaws, leprosy
and other infectious diseases.
• adequate, safe village water supplies
are a luxury.
• infant mortality is still more common
than not and population growth is out
stripping what few advances have been
made in improving island life.
Against this dismal background are fur
ther hindrances to development: lack of
educational facilities and a meager agri
cultural output.
THE FIRST VOLUNTEERS to reach
Western Samoa this fall will set in motion a

government health program designed to sur
vey the islands' health needs and the preva
lence of diseases. Later, the Volunteers
— mostly liberal arts graduates who will
be supported by a team of Volunteer doc
tors, nurses, lab technicians, civil engi
neers and architects —will shift into disease
control, environmental health and sanita
tion, maternal and child care projects and
the building of village water supply sys
tems.
Meanwhile, about 20 agricultural ex
tension workers, including five Volunteers
with business administration backgrounds
to work with cooperatives, will aid farmers
growing the major island crops of ba-
