Despite the lure of top-paying jobs with
private industry, the Peace Corps con
tinues to be the country's number one
employer of newly-minted college gradu
ates.
As the Peace Corps loses its amateur
standing and joins the big leagues in over
seas development, the vast academic melt
ing pot will again provide the bulk of the
estimated 8,000 Volunteers required to
fill the critical skill reservoirs in at least
56 countries this year.

ALREADY rapidly-approaching sum
mer training programs are being developed
for the new Peace Corps countries of
Lesotho, Ihe Gambia and Upper Volta
in Africa (see page 4) and Western Samoa
in the Pacific.
After a 2'/i-year absence, the Peace
Corps is returning to Ceylon to assist in an
over-all national effort to make the tear
drop-sized nation self-sufficient in food
production.
In the Trust Territory of the Pacific
(Micronesia) and South Korea in East
Asia and the Pacific; Chad. Libya, Bots
wana and Mauritania in Africa, and Para
guay and Ciuyana in Latin America—all
countries which received their first Volun
teers only last year — additional programs
arc also being mounted for summer train
ing sessions.
Graduating seniors are being urged to
apply now, as summer and fall training
program quotas arc rapidly beginning to
fill.

KNI KRING A NEW ERA of consoli
dated growth, Director Jack Vaughn, an
ex-boxer. Marine combat officer and diplo
mat. has brought the agency through a
vital stage of development in which the
Peace Corps is being asked to measure its
impact overseas and not simply rely on
what one official calls "youthful goodwill
ambassadoring."
Although there is little quarrel with
basic goals — fostering ideas and tech
niques of self-help, cooperative work
and community organization — new trends
in training are beginning to take shape.
They include lengthier preparation for
most programs, more in-country as op
posed to stateside training, and greater
emphasis on technical and language skills.
