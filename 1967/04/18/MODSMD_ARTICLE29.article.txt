A SECOND PHASE of the
Western Samoa program will send
up to 150 English teachers into the
elementary and intermediate levels
of the Samoan school system, which
currently is staffed largely by in
adequately-trained islanders.
Reflecting the broad involvement
in community life expected of most
Volunteers, the teachers during "off
hours" will help fellow Samoan
teachers improve their English, in
struct students and villagers in basic
health and hygiene practices, and
aid Volunteer health workers in
their tasks.
Living conditions will be in the
South Pacific image for most Vol
unteers, who will reside in villages
in the traditional fale — a round
wood and thatch structure that of
fers natural wall-to-wall air con
ditioning in a comfortable tropical
climate.
THE EXPERIENCES thus far
of Volunteers in neighboring Mi
cronesia suggest that Volunteers
will take quickly to the similar
Samoan setting. The close confines
of an island environment, instead
of fostering rivalry and misunder
standing, promote a spirit of friend
liness, openness and mutual de
pendence. It is within this cultural
context that the Volunteers will
live and work for two years.

Western Samoa is (he first Poly
nesian island group to achieve in
dependence, having slipped off its
United Nations trusteeship status
under New Zealand on January 1,
1962. Full political emancipation
ended almost a century of colonial
administration, Jirst under Germany
from 1889 onward, then under
New Zealand following World War
I.
DURING the latter half of the
19th century, while Germany, the
United States and Great Britain
contended for Samoan favors, the
islands and their people were
plagued by bitter internal struggles
surrounding the kingship. Recent
times, however, have witnessed
peaceful transition from colonial
to independent governments and
the Samoan scene since 1962 has
been one of marked stability.
Lying 1,000 miles below the
equator and 2,600 miles southwest
of Hawaii, Western Samoa's two
major islands of Upolu and Savaii
cover an area approximate to
Rhode Island. The islands are sur
rounded by coral reefs enclosing
quiet lagoons. Tropically-vegetated
heights of several thousand feet
dominate both islands.
Author James A. Michener, with
long experience in the South Pa
cific, wrote of Polynesia in Return
to Paradise that its "influence on
world thought is far greater than
its size would warrant. Musical
names like Tahiti, Rarotonga, Bora
Bora carry an emotional freight to
all cold countries of the world . .
