# McClure's 'The Beard'
## Avant-Garde Play At Dinkelspiel 
### BOB DAVIS 
Michael McClure's avant-garde play
'"The Beard" will probably be the first
of its kind to be performed in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. The work, which
has recently figured in litigation,
climaxes with what one actress has
called an "act of love made on stage
in a very beautiful way."
Wednesday night at 8:30, under the
sponsorship of The Experiment, Rich
ard Bright and Billie Dixon, former
San Francisco Actor's Workshop
members, are to perform the roles of
Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow. They
meet in "a blue-velvet eternity" wear
ing tissue-paper beards.
Bright calls "The Beard" a play
of great "fire, color, and rhythm."
Battle of Sexes
It involves a direct confrontation
between Harlow and Billy the Kid, the
only characters. The confrontation is

rooted in the battle of the sexes. It is
in a sense a "love rite" according to
Miss Dixon. Jean Harlow is a "woman
caught up in her own illusions. The
Kid keeps tearing at them."
The actors compare the play to a
Beethoven sonata. The vocabulary of
the play consists of only about five
hundred words. "You play the human
voice in the human body."
A number of the words have four
letters.
British critic Kenneth Tynan called
the play "a landmark in the history of
heterosexual art."
Author: Beat Poet
The play was submitted to the Ac
tor's Workshop in 1965 by Michael
McClure, a one-time Beat Poet. The
Workshop was in financial difficulty
and was making an appeal to the
city fathers for financial assistance.
Bright and Miss Dixon were told that

the play might harm the Work
shop's cause at that time.
In the summer of 1966, Bright and
Miss Dixon obtained use of the Com
mittee's theatre one night a week.
After the second evening of "The
Beard", the police booked the per
formers.
"We were later charged with lewd
and dissolute behavior in a public
place," Bright explained. Conviction
would have obliged the performers to
register as sex offenders.
The American Civil Liberties Union
carried on the legal battle for Bright
and Miss Dixon. A judge later ruled
that the ordinance invoked was not
appropriate.
"The District Attorney may file an
appeal," Bright added.
Beyond Godot
The performers are interested in
written response from the Stanford
audience after they see the work,
Bright explained.
The play is a step beyond "Waiting
for Godot," according to the perform
ers. The characters in "Godot are
waiting for nothing. But Michael Mc-
Clure's play says that it is here now."
"It is a play without self-pity. It's
subject is human joy," Miss Dixon
explained. She added that Harlow
represents the spirit and Billy the
Kid represents flesh. Spirit and flesh
merge at the end.
