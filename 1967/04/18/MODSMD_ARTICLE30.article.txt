startling contrasts. The

people of Ebeye (its main street is pic
tured at right), profoundly influenced
by the proximity of the missile site at
Kwajalein, have forgotten many of their
out-island skills. They eat their tuna in
cans and wear sport shirts imported
from California. Only a small portion of
the people on Ebeye work at the missile
site. Ebeye has become known as the
slum of the Pacific with 4,000 people
crowded onto the small island.
On Ebeye, like other parts of Micro
nesia, the influence of the Peace Corps
is beginning to be felt. Eight Volunteers
working in cooperation with the Trust
Territory perform such diverse jobs as
teaching, community development,
health, and even business administra
tion.
Part of the satisfaction of being a
Volunteer in Micronesia is the sense of
acceptance which is given by the
Micronesians. These people feel that
the Peace Corps Volunteers belong to
them; there is a warmth, an empathy
which is a coin of great value.
The present program has over 450
Volunteers. The impact of their work,
of their concern will be felt for gen
erations.
