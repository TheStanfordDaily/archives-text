southern coast of India, assisting Ceylon
to attain self-sufficiency in food production.
Peace Corps training for the program
starts in August and will produce about SO
Volunteers scheduled to arrive abroad in
November. Trainees will be recruited
from among farmers, young persons with
farming experience, liberal arts graduates
and agricultural and home economics
majors.

The Volunteers will take part in a na
