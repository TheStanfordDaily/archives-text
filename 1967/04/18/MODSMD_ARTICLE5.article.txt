# Keynote Gimbel Lecture Calls For 'Mutual Trust'
## 
### 
The task of a university, said Dr.
Benson R. Snyder in his keynote
speech for the Jake Gimbel "Sex Psy
chology" series last night, "is to weld
together imagination and experience."
The resulting mixture, he feels,
should be of body as well as of mind,
not just of the latter as now appears
to be the case.
Stressing this neglect of the body
in what he termed the "Visible Cur
riculum,' Snyder gave several ex
amples to show the hypocricy that
results. At one small girls' liberal arts
college the administration expressed
much concern with protecting the
girl's morality, but turned around and
hired special police to guard the park
ing lots so that the neckers not be
molested.
Pregnant Coed
At another "elite" college, an upper
class coed became pregnant. The
dean's office threw her out of school
so that she would not "contaminate
the other girls."
This is the type of reaction, Snyder
said, that prevents the development
of the "openness, trust, frankness"
likely to lead to a healthy environ
ment.
And the problem results, Snyder
said, because of a forced separation
of the "visible' 'and "invisible curric
ulums,' with the former consisting of
the formal activities of going to class,
writing papers, etc., and the latter
being a social testing ground where
unstated norms and rules of etiquette
must be followed rigidly.
Private* Behavior
And never the twain shall meet.
Private behavior is completely di
vorced from public behavior, and the
individual must choose between ig
noring the dissonance or being dis
crete.
However, neither of these alterna
tives actually presents little problem

to the average person, Snyder pointed
out, because he has been trained since
childhood to either avoid exposing
his private life, as with the child who
gradually learns that what goes on
in the home is not for public con
sumption, or risk being ostracized.
Though never trying to answer the
questions, Snyder named the two to
be of prime concern for the imminent
discussion groups: How to cope with
the invisible curriculum, and what is
or what should be the relationship be
tween the invisible curriculum and
the visible curriculum?

He pointed out that just because a
child learns to seperate public and
private information does not mean
that they are two separate things.
But it is not until college that the
individual should really learn "the
ability to combine and integrate the
heart and the head." Failure at this
integration leads to several alterna
tives. Cynicism develops.
The individual may care about the
dissonance with little knowledge of
how to combat it. Or, he may have
all the necessary information and just
not care enough to use it.
