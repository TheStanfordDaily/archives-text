# Gordon's Century 21 Vision Features Prefab Environment
## 
### 
Visions of control over the aging
process, vast computer networks and
factories in outer space were evoked
last night in the kick-off speech of
Tresidder Union's "Century 21" pro
gram.
The speaker was Theodore Gordon
of the Douglas Space Systems Cen
ter, named by Life magazine as one
of the 100 most promising young men
and women in the U.S. in 1962. Men
have thought in the past, he said, that
"that which went before determines
that which will be. The end of this
kind of unhampered determinism
may be catastrophe."
He went on, "It is man who is the
manipulator of the present." Gordon
discussed five areas of "mainstream
developments," including the new bio
logy, behavioral control, information
technology, space enterprises and pop
ulation expansion.
Slow Down Aging
In the field of biology Gordon said
the world can look forward to a time
when the life expectancy will be many
decades longer than now, when
heredity can be controlled artificially,
when the aging process can be slowed
down and perhaps reversed, and when
the body will be able to produce its
own food.
The area of behavior control, Gor
don said, is already far advanced. "We
are developing psychological, chemi
cal and physical techniques by which
man can control the behavior of other
men without force; our freedom may
be lost in the process." In the cate
gory of psychological control, Gordon
cited the methods of hypnotism, im

printing, conditioning and brainwash
ing.
Chemical intervention includes such
things as tranquilizers, hallucinogens
and alcohol. Someday, he said, per
haps the loving wife will drop an
anti-grouch pill in her husband's
morning coffee. Physical manipula
tion today centers on stimulation of
the cortex. "The use of these control
means," he said, "is odious and fore
boding because, to a large degree,
they may rob the freedom of indivi
dual action and decision."
In the field of information techno
logies, Gordon discussed the future of
computerized information banks by
which "data will be almost instantly
available." The greatest advantage, he
said, would be "deeper and more in
sightful access to accumulated knowl
edge."
Doubled Population
The uses- of space are unlimited, he
said, in manufacturing, providing
an "antidote to leisure," opening up
new areas of resources, and so on.
The population explosion, however, is
the greatest challenge, he said. By the
year 2000, the population is expected
to double.
In a question-and-answer session
following his talk, Gordon said, "We
have a social tool. We need to learn
how to use it. If we don't, we're in
for trouble."
The Century 21 program is in the
planning stages now for next year.
Students interested in discussing Gor
don's ideas and planning next year's
program have been encouraged to

desk or contact Bruce Maximov at

In the field of biology Gordon said
the world can look forward to a time
when the life expectancy will be many
decades longer than now, when
heredity can be controlled artificially,
when the aging process can be slowed
down and perhaps reversed, and when
the body will be able to produce its
own food.
The area of behavior control, Gor
don said, is already far advanced. "We
are developing psychological, chemi
cal and physical techniques by which
man can control the behavior of other
men without force; our freedom may
be lost in the process." In the cate
gory of psychological control, Gordon
cited the methods of hypnotism, im

printing, conditioning and brainwash
ing.
Chemical intervention includes such
things as tranquilizers, hallucinogens
and alcohol. Someday, he said, per
haps the loving wife will drop an
anti-grouch pill in her husband's
morning coffee. Physical manipula
tion today centers on stimulation of
the cortex. "The use of these control
means," he said, "is odious and fore
boding because, to a large degree,
they may rob the freedom of indivi
dual action and decision."
In the field of information techno
logies, Gordon discussed the future of
computerized information banks by
which "data will be almost instantly
available." The greatest advantage, he
said, would be "deeper and more in
sightful access to accumulated knowl
edge."
Doubled Population
The uses- of space are unlimited, he
said, in manufacturing, providing
an "antidote to leisure," opening up
new areas of resources, and so on.
The population explosion, however, is
the greatest challenge, he said. By the
year 2000, the population is expected
to double.
In a question-and-answer session
following his talk, Gordon said, "We
have a social tool. We need to learn
how to use it. If we don't, we're in
for trouble."
The Century 21 program is in the
planning stages now for next year.
Students interested in discussing Gor
don's ideas and planning next year's
program have been encouraged to
sign up at the Tresidder information
desk or contact Bruce Maximov at

Visions of control over the aging
process, vast computer networks and
factories in outer space were evoked
last night in the kick-off speech of
Tresidder Union's "Century 21" pro
gram.
The speaker was Theodore Gordon
of the Douglas Space Systems Cen
ter, named by Life magazine as one
of the 100 most promising young men
and women in the U.S. in 1962. Men
have thought in the past, he said, that
"that which went before determines
that which will be. The end of this
kind of unhampered determinism
may be catastrophe."
He went on, "It is man who is the
manipulator of the present." Gordon
discussed five areas of "mainstream
developments," including the new bio
logy, behavioral control, information
technology, space enterprises and pop
ulation expansion.
Slow Down Aging
