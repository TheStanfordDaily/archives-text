# Hospital, Traffic Problems
## Stanford: Big Brother Or Bully? 
### PAT McMAHON 
(Second in a series discussing the
problems Stanford confronts in deal
ing with local communities, particu
larly Palo Alto.)
Stanford University has changed
in the eyes of some Palo Alto citizens
from Big Brother to Neighborhood
Bully.
Whether it's more traffic running
through the city, the University's
stubborn refusal to share the hospital
anymore, or simply public relations—
problems are cropping up.
What once was considered "the
best of all possible worlds" — the
partnership in the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital — has soured with the Uni
versity's decision to bow out.
The University and the city have
come into conflict in many areas in
recent years, and the hospital situa
tion is among them.
The University first considered dis
solving the partnership in 1965, and
offered the city of Palo Alto $5 mil
lion. In a letter to the city, President

Sterling wrote, "The University is
prepared to pay the city a sum of
money equivalent to the fair market
value of the city's share in the build
ing and equipment of the Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital in order to acquire
such share."
Teaching and Research
The University's purpose in sepa
rating from the city in this venture
is to allow greater latitude in research
and teaching that is difficult under
the present arrangements.
Palo Alto balked and decided to
stay in their part of the hospital re
gardless of the threatened separation
from Stanford. "What we had hoped
to work out isn't going to," said Vice
President for Finance Kenneth Cuth
oertson after Palo Alto's refusal.
"We're confident that we can plan
around it."
And planned around it it was. On
March 21, the Board of Trustees au
thorized the development of a master
plan for a new hospital. Ground break
ing is expected in about 18 months.

Traffic to and from the hospital
has also been a problem, but traffic
is a major problem confronting the
University and Palo Alto on several
fronts.
The city is very concerned about
the traffic from Stanford, the Shop
ping Center, and the Industrial Park,
not to mention the residential traffic
not connected with rush hours.
Palo Alto residents first oecame
aroused when traffic became so heavy
in 1962 that it was necessary to tear
out over 100 houses to make room for
the Oregon Expressway. At this time,
the United Palo Altans were formed
to evoke a residential voice in civic
affairs.
Facility Traffic
Traffic is also at issue concerning
the new faculty residential area on
Frenchman's Hill. The residents of
College Terrace, particularly on Am
herst Street, are up in arms about
plans which would reroute Stanford
Avenue and run within 30 feet of
some yards on Amherst.

The road is being protested not only
for reasons of safety (with the road
close to the yards) but because the
residents folt that the University was
"pulling a fast one" because they
didn't inform the residents soon
enough.
Public Relations
Mr. Dixon Arnett, Director of Com
munity Relations called the problem
"one of public relations." He also ex
plained the problem that Stanford
encounters in announcing its various
plans for projects.
It is a matter of "damned if we do,
and damned if we don't," he said. He
explained that when the University
announces something very early that
people don't like, they immediately
take issue with it. If, on the other
hand, the University holds back a
final decision, they are "charged with
secrecy" when the plans are revealed.
Arnett said that he felt that there
was some public relations error on
Stanford's part in not going to the
Amherst residents early enough.

Palo Alto residents first oecame
aroused when traffic became so heavy
in 1962 that it was necessary to tear
out over 100 houses to make room for
the Oregon Expressway. At this time,
the United Palo Altans were formed
to evoke a residential voice in civic
affairs.
Facility Traffic
Traffic is also at issue concerning
the new faculty residential area on
Frenchman's Hill. The residents of
College Terrace, particularly on Am
herst Street, are up in arms about
plans which would reroute Stanford
Avenue and run within 30 feet of
some yards on Amherst.

The road is being protested not only
for reasons of safety (with the road
close to the yards) but because the
residents folt that the University was
"pulling a fast one" because they
didn't inform the residents soon
enough.
Public Relations
Mr. Dixon Arnett, Director of Com
munity Relations called the problem
"one of public relations." He also ex
plained the problem that Stanford
encounters in announcing its various
plans for projects.
It is a matter of "damned if we do,
and damned if we don't," he said. He
explained that when the University
announces something very early that
people don't like, they immediately
take issue with it. If, on the other
hand, the University holds back a
final decision, they are "charged with
secrecy" when the plans are revealed.
Arnett said that he felt that there
was some public relations error on
Stanford's part in not going to the
Amherst residents early enough.
(Second in a series discussing the
problems Stanford confronts in deal
ing with local communities, particu
larly Palo Alto.)
Stanford University has changed
in the eyes of some Palo Alto citizens
from Big Brother to Neighborhood
Bully.
Whether it's more traffic running
through the city, the University's
stubborn refusal to share the hospital
anymore, or simply public relations—
problems are cropping up.
What once was considered "the
best of all possible worlds" — the
partnership in the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital — has soured with the Uni
versity's decision to bow out.
The University and the city have
come into conflict in many areas in
recent years, and the hospital situa
tion is among them.
The University first considered dis
solving the partnership in 1965, and
offered the city of Palo Alto $5 mil
lion. In a letter to the city, President

Sterling wrote, "The University is
prepared to pay the city a sum of
money equivalent to the fair market
value of the city's share in the build
ing and equipment of the Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital in order to acquire
such share."
Teaching and Research
The University's purpose in sepa
rating from the city in this venture
is to allow greater latitude in research
and teaching that is difficult under
the present arrangements.
Palo Alto balked and decided to
stay in their part of the hospital re
gardless of the threatened separation
from Stanford. "What we had hoped
to work out isn't going to," said Vice
President for Finance Kenneth Cuth
oertson after Palo Alto's refusal.
"We're confident that we can plan
around it."
And planned around it it was. On
March 21, the Board of Trustees au
thorized the development of a master
plan for a new hospital. Ground break
ing is expected in about 18 months.

Traffic to and from the hospital
has also been a problem, but traffic
is a major problem confronting the
University and Palo Alto on several
fronts.
The city is very concerned about
the traffic from Stanford, the Shop
ping Center, and the Industrial Park,
not to mention the residential traffic
not connected with rush hours.
