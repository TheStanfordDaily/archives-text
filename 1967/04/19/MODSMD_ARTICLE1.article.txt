# Kaplan Calls Assassination Critics Reckless
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
"Even the most baleful excesses of the Mc-
Carthy era were not as unfair, irresponsible
and reckless" as the present criticism of the
'Varren Commission, according to "The Assas
sins," a recent article by Law Professor John
Kaplan in the spring, 1967, issue of The Ameri
can Scholar, the Phi Beta Kappa magazine.
Kaplan, co-author of The Trial of Jack
Ruby, wrote, "Men who deplored McCarthyism
and all it stood for have been perfectly willing
on the basis of incredibly flimsy evidence or
<io evidence at all to posit theories that Patrol
man Tippit was a conspirator in the Presi
dent's assassination; that the Commissioners
lied and suppressed the truth; that a whole
host of government officials perjured them
selves; ..."
Vietnam may be one of the basic causes
or this irresponsibility, Kaplan continues.
"Hatred is not a pretty thing, and the hatred
"lat the extreme left has developed for Lyn
don Johnson ... is something unparalleled
in our time.
"In this context, the attacks on the Warren
Commission serve the function of blaming one
more thing on Lyndon Johnson."
Four-Stage Controversy
Kaplan sees the controversy over the assas
sination as having four stages. The first took

place in 1964, just a few months after the
assassination and was marked by the publi
cation of Who Killed Kennedy? by Thomas G.
Buchanan and Oswald: Assassination or Fall
Guy? by Joachim Joesten.
"Although both books enjoyed large sales
outside the United States—and to some extent
in it—within the perspective of only three
years they are so inept that it is embarrassing
to read them over," Kaplan said.
Publication of the Warren Commission Re
port and its 26 volumes of documentation
signified the beginning of the second stage.
". . . the lavish, indeed uncritical, praise of it
quieted most doubts," Kaplan writes.
"Then about nine months ago as we reached
the third stage, a second generation of unof
ficial inquiries into the assassination began
appearing." Kaplan claims that this stage con
sists mainly of five books—lnquest, by Ed
ward J. Epstein; Rush to Judgment, by Mark
Lane; Whitewash, by Harold Weisberg; The
Oswald Affair, by Leo Sauvage; and The
Second Oswald, by Richard H. Popkin.
One-bullet Theory
Epstein's arguments center around the War-
Commission concluded that the same bullet
first passed through the President's neck and
then struck Governor Connally.
"He (Epstein) argues, first, that the bullet
that struck the President did not go through

his body, and, secondly, that the wound on
the President's back was located much too
low for the bullet to have described the path
ascribed to it by the Commission."
Part of Epstein's support for his statement
comes from "diametrically opposed findings"
regarding the autopsy from the FBI and the
Warren Report. Kaplan claims, however, that
"To agree that an agency is not infallible—
which the FBI most certainly is not—is some
thing less than to 'cast doubt' upon its entire
investigation."
Kaplan passes over Weisberg's book, calling
it"the most strident, bitter and generally ir
rationally biased of all the attacks on the
Commission." He spends more time with the
books by Sauvage and Popkin, but seems to
be concerned mainly with Mark Lane's Rush
to Judgment, which he calls "a wide-ranging
attack on almost every conclusion of the War
ren Commission, and at least initially leaves
the reader thinking that if only a tenth of
Lane's assertions are true, he has more than
made his case ..."
But, Kaplan concludes, "In short, nowhere
near a tenth of Lane's relevant assertions and
implications stand up to careful scrutiny."
"Methods of Distortion"
After discussing two of Lane's arguments,
Kaplan writes, "But going through Lane's
book piece by piece is so time- and space-con

suming that, after this brief taste of his
technique, it is more appropriate merely to
classify his methods of distortion."
These "methods of distortion," according
to Kaplan are:
• "First, there is the rank distortion of
witness's testimony.
• "The second technique Lane uses is the
careful and factual presentation of one side
of a case without indicating, in any way, that
powerful reasons exist for rejecting the con
clusion to which this side might point.
• "Lane's third basic technique is to set him
self up as his own expert witness—although
not of course under oath.
• "The fourth of Lane's basic techniques
involves the gross logical fallacy.
• "Number five among Lane's techniques
. . . is to set up straw men, and attack the
Commission on points where he does not even
disagree with its conclusions."
Kaplan concludes his attack on the book
with "Furthermore, the idea that Rush to
Judgment might merely be a brief for Oswald
completely misconstrues the nature of a brief.
True, an advocate has a certain latitude to
emphasize some facts and de-emphasize others.
But Lane carries this far beyond mere advo
cacy to the point of extreme misrepresenta
tion and distortion.
"Moreover, a major factor that makes

Lane's book especially difficult to review is
that he presents no coherent theory as to the
Presidential assassination."
Lane's Statement
In a special statement to The Dally yester
day, Mark Lane wrote, "I leave speculation
to the Commission, which, in my view has pre
empted the field. My book is based upon the
existing evidence. It presents no theory."
Lane also challenged Kaplan to "a debate,
to be held at Stanford, addressed to the
validity of the Commission's conclusions.
"If I have used 'methods of distortion,'"
the statement continues, "Mr. Kaplan will be
free to demonstrate that fact at the debate.
If, on the other hand, Mr. Kaplan has demon
strated hysterical servility to the establish
ment, I shall be entitled to demonstrate that.
Mr. Kaplan may bring his own moderator and
his own rules."
Kaplan, when contacted by The Dally, re
plied, "I'd sooner enter a stinking match with
a skunk, than a debate with any of the 'third
stage critics.'" My specific allegations are in
The Scholar.
"If any of these critics wish to reply in writ
ing—where they cannot make up assertions
faster than responsible scholarship can an
swer them—then I would be most interested
in seeing what they have to say," Kaplan
added.

and reckless" as the present criticism of the
'Varren Commission, according to "The Assas
sins," a recent article by Law Professor John
Kaplan in the spring, 1967, issue of The Ameri
can Scholar, the Phi Beta Kappa magazine.
Kaplan, co-author of The Trial of Jack
Ruby, wrote, "Men who deplored McCarthyism
and all it stood for have been perfectly willing
on the basis of incredibly flimsy evidence or
<io evidence at all to posit theories that Patrol
man Tippit was a conspirator in the Presi
dent's assassination; that the Commissioners
lied and suppressed the truth; that a whole
host of government officials perjured them
selves; ..."
Vietnam may be one of the basic causes
or this irresponsibility, Kaplan continues.
"Hatred is not a pretty thing, and the hatred
"lat the extreme left has developed for Lyn
don Johnson ... is something unparalleled
in our time.
"In this context, the attacks on the Warren
Commission serve the function of blaming one
more thing on Lyndon Johnson."
Four-Stage Controversy
Kaplan sees the controversy over the assas
sination as having four stages. The first took

place in 1964, just a few months after the
assassination and was marked by the publi
cation of Who Killed Kennedy? by Thomas G.
Buchanan and Oswald: Assassination or Fall
Guy? by Joachim Joesten.
"Although both books enjoyed large sales
outside the United States—and to some extent
in it—within the perspective of only three
years they are so inept that it is embarrassing
to read them over," Kaplan said.
Publication of the Warren Commission Re
port and its 26 volumes of documentation
signified the beginning of the second stage.
". . . the lavish, indeed uncritical, praise of it
quieted most doubts," Kaplan writes.
"Then about nine months ago as we reached
the third stage, a second generation of unof
ficial inquiries into the assassination began
appearing." Kaplan claims that this stage con
sists mainly of five books—lnquest, by Ed
ward J. Epstein; Rush to Judgment, by Mark
Lane; Whitewash, by Harold Weisberg; The
Oswald Affair, by Leo Sauvage; and The
Second Oswald, by Richard H. Popkin.
One-bullet Theory
Epstein's arguments center around the War-
Commission concluded that the same bullet
first passed through the President's neck and
then struck Governor Connally.
"He (Epstein) argues, first, that the bullet
that struck the President did not go through

his body, and, secondly, that the wound on
the President's back was located much too
low for the bullet to have described the path
ascribed to it by the Commission."
Part of Epstein's support for his statement
comes from "diametrically opposed findings"
regarding the autopsy from the FBI and the
Warren Report. Kaplan claims, however, that
"To agree that an agency is not infallible—
which the FBI most certainly is not—is some
thing less than to 'cast doubt' upon its entire
investigation."
Kaplan passes over Weisberg's book, calling
it"the most strident, bitter and generally ir
rationally biased of all the attacks on the
Commission." He spends more time with the
books by Sauvage and Popkin, but seems to
be concerned mainly with Mark Lane's Rush
to Judgment, which he calls "a wide-ranging
attack on almost every conclusion of the War
ren Commission, and at least initially leaves
the reader thinking that if only a tenth of
Lane's assertions are true, he has more than
made his case ..."
But, Kaplan concludes, "In short, nowhere
near a tenth of Lane's relevant assertions and
implications stand up to careful scrutiny."
"Methods of Distortion"
After discussing two of Lane's arguments,
Kaplan writes, "But going through Lane's
book piece by piece is so time- and space-con

suming that, after this brief taste of his
technique, it is more appropriate merely to
classify his methods of distortion."
These "methods of distortion," according
to Kaplan are:
• "First, there is the rank distortion of
witness's testimony.
• "The second technique Lane uses is the
careful and factual presentation of one side
of a case without indicating, in any way, that
powerful reasons exist for rejecting the con
clusion to which this side might point.
• "Lane's third basic technique is to set him
self up as his own expert witness—although
not of course under oath.
• "The fourth of Lane's basic techniques
involves the gross logical fallacy.
• "Number five among Lane's techniques
. . . is to set up straw men, and attack the
Commission on points where he does not even
disagree with its conclusions."
Kaplan concludes his attack on the book
with "Furthermore, the idea that Rush to
Judgment might merely be a brief for Oswald
completely misconstrues the nature of a brief.
True, an advocate has a certain latitude to
emphasize some facts and de-emphasize others.
But Lane carries this far beyond mere advo
cacy to the point of extreme misrepresenta
tion and distortion.
"Moreover, a major factor that makes

Lane's book especially difficult to review is
that he presents no coherent theory as to the
Presidential assassination."
Lane's Statement
In a special statement to The Dally yester
day, Mark Lane wrote, "I leave speculation
to the Commission, which, in my view has pre
empted the field. My book is based upon the
existing evidence. It presents no theory."
Lane also challenged Kaplan to "a debate,
to be held at Stanford, addressed to the
validity of the Commission's conclusions.
"If I have used 'methods of distortion,'"
the statement continues, "Mr. Kaplan will be
free to demonstrate that fact at the debate.
If, on the other hand, Mr. Kaplan has demon
strated hysterical servility to the establish
ment, I shall be entitled to demonstrate that.
Mr. Kaplan may bring his own moderator and
his own rules."
Kaplan, when contacted by The Dally, re
plied, "I'd sooner enter a stinking match with
a skunk, than a debate with any of the 'third
stage critics.'" My specific allegations are in
The Scholar.
"If any of these critics wish to reply in writ
ing—where they cannot make up assertions
faster than responsible scholarship can an
swer them—then I would be most interested
in seeing what they have to say," Kaplan
added.

sins," a recent article by Law Professor John
Kaplan in the spring, 1967, issue of The Ameri
can Scholar, the Phi Beta Kappa magazine.
Kaplan, co-author of The Trial of Jack
Ruby, wrote, "Men who deplored McCarthyism
and all it stood for have been perfectly willing
on the basis of incredibly flimsy evidence or
<io evidence at all to posit theories that Patrol
man Tippit was a conspirator in the Presi
dent's assassination; that the Commissioners
lied and suppressed the truth; that a whole
host of government officials perjured them
selves; ..."
Vietnam may be one of the basic causes
or this irresponsibility, Kaplan continues.
"Hatred is not a pretty thing, and the hatred
"lat the extreme left has developed for Lyn
don Johnson ... is something unparalleled
in our time.
"In this context, the attacks on the Warren
Commission serve the function of blaming one
more thing on Lyndon Johnson."
Four-Stage Controversy
Kaplan sees the controversy over the assas
sination as having four stages. The first took

place in 1964, just a few months after the
assassination and was marked by the publi
cation of Who Killed Kennedy? by Thomas G.
Buchanan and Oswald: Assassination or Fall
Guy? by Joachim Joesten.
"Although both books enjoyed large sales
outside the United States—and to some extent
in it—within the perspective of only three
years they are so inept that it is embarrassing
to read them over," Kaplan said.
Publication of the Warren Commission Re
port and its 26 volumes of documentation
signified the beginning of the second stage.
". . . the lavish, indeed uncritical, praise of it
quieted most doubts," Kaplan writes.
"Then about nine months ago as we reached
the third stage, a second generation of unof
ficial inquiries into the assassination began
appearing." Kaplan claims that this stage con
sists mainly of five books—lnquest, by Ed
ward J. Epstein; Rush to Judgment, by Mark
Lane; Whitewash, by Harold Weisberg; The
Oswald Affair, by Leo Sauvage; and The
Second Oswald, by Richard H. Popkin.
One-bullet Theory
Epstein's arguments center around the War-
Commission concluded that the same bullet
first passed through the President's neck and
then struck Governor Connally.
"He (Epstein) argues, first, that the bullet
that struck the President did not go through

his body, and, secondly, that the wound on
the President's back was located much too
low for the bullet to have described the path
ascribed to it by the Commission."
Part of Epstein's support for his statement
comes from "diametrically opposed findings"
regarding the autopsy from the FBI and the
Warren Report. Kaplan claims, however, that
"To agree that an agency is not infallible—
which the FBI most certainly is not—is some
thing less than to 'cast doubt' upon its entire
investigation."
Kaplan passes over Weisberg's book, calling
it"the most strident, bitter and generally ir
rationally biased of all the attacks on the
Commission." He spends more time with the
books by Sauvage and Popkin, but seems to
be concerned mainly with Mark Lane's Rush
to Judgment, which he calls "a wide-ranging
attack on almost every conclusion of the War
ren Commission, and at least initially leaves
the reader thinking that if only a tenth of
Lane's assertions are true, he has more than
made his case ..."
But, Kaplan concludes, "In short, nowhere
near a tenth of Lane's relevant assertions and
implications stand up to careful scrutiny."
"Methods of Distortion"
After discussing two of Lane's arguments,
Kaplan writes, "But going through Lane's
book piece by piece is so time- and space-con

suming that, after this brief taste of his
technique, it is more appropriate merely to
classify his methods of distortion."
These "methods of distortion," according
to Kaplan are:
• "First, there is the rank distortion of
witness's testimony.
• "The second technique Lane uses is the
careful and factual presentation of one side
of a case without indicating, in any way, that
powerful reasons exist for rejecting the con
clusion to which this side might point.
• "Lane's third basic technique is to set him
self up as his own expert witness—although
not of course under oath.
• "The fourth of Lane's basic techniques
involves the gross logical fallacy.
• "Number five among Lane's techniques
. . . is to set up straw men, and attack the
Commission on points where he does not even
disagree with its conclusions."
Kaplan concludes his attack on the book
with "Furthermore, the idea that Rush to
Judgment might merely be a brief for Oswald
completely misconstrues the nature of a brief.
True, an advocate has a certain latitude to
emphasize some facts and de-emphasize others.
But Lane carries this far beyond mere advo
cacy to the point of extreme misrepresenta
tion and distortion.
"Moreover, a major factor that makes

Lane's book especially difficult to review is
that he presents no coherent theory as to the
Presidential assassination."
Lane's Statement
In a special statement to The Dally yester
day, Mark Lane wrote, "I leave speculation
to the Commission, which, in my view has pre
empted the field. My book is based upon the
existing evidence. It presents no theory."
Lane also challenged Kaplan to "a debate,
to be held at Stanford, addressed to the
validity of the Commission's conclusions.
"If I have used 'methods of distortion,'"
the statement continues, "Mr. Kaplan will be
free to demonstrate that fact at the debate.
If, on the other hand, Mr. Kaplan has demon
strated hysterical servility to the establish
ment, I shall be entitled to demonstrate that.
Mr. Kaplan may bring his own moderator and
his own rules."
Kaplan, when contacted by The Dally, re
plied, "I'd sooner enter a stinking match with
a skunk, than a debate with any of the 'third
stage critics.'" My specific allegations are in
The Scholar.
"If any of these critics wish to reply in writ
ing—where they cannot make up assertions
faster than responsible scholarship can an
swer them—then I would be most interested
in seeing what they have to say," Kaplan
added.
"Even the most baleful excesses of the Mc-
Carthy era were not as unfair, irresponsible
and reckless" as the present criticism of the
'Varren Commission, according to "The Assas
sins," a recent article by Law Professor John
Kaplan in the spring, 1967, issue of The Ameri
