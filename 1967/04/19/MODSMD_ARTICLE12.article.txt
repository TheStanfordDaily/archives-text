# '58 Phones Obsolete

### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Deep in the heart of the inner
city are eleven women who con
trol the lifeline of the Univer
sity — the Stanford telephone
system.
Located in a small building on
Panama Street behind the Old
Union, (in case you've always
wondered from whence cometh
the oft-heard salutation, "Stan
ford University"), these ladies
man the 2,000 inner-university
lines leading to 3,361 telephones
scattered throughout the cam
pus.
The 11 switchboards are oper
ated between 8 and 5 every
weekday, including vacations.
The crew is reduced for evening
shifts. Some 6,500 calls go
through these boards daily, and
8,000 outside calls are completed
by dialing "9" from any of the
DAI-2300 extensions. There is
no way of counting the hundreds
of intra-University calls com
pleted by dialing any of the
four-digit extension numbers
from University phones.

In addition, 1,100 "message
unit" calls — calls made outside
the Palo Alto area but within
the Bay — are dialed each day,
and some 250 regular long dis
tance calls are completed.
The intricate maze of wires,
phones, and other equipment are
valued at $23,725.60, according
to Joe Payne, a major accounts
manager. Stanford employs two
repairmen and approximately
ten installers at all times. This
does not include special work
crews that come in for new
building construction.
The present system was in
stalled in 1958, and it was de
signed to last for 20 years. The
50 incoming lines and additional
50 out-going connections are al
ready proving to be insufficient
to handle all the phone business
of the University and its offices,
however. Nearly all the possible
four-digit extension numbers are
now in service.
A study is currently being
conducted on the possibility of
installing a "Centrex" system in

Stanford. Centrcx would enable
an outside caller to dial directly
into any University extension
without going through a central
switchboard. It would also eli
minate dorm switchboards by
providing approximately 3,000
phones for students so that they
could be reached on their own
phones from within or without
the University. Students would
be able to dial Palo Alto num
bers from their rooms and pos
sibly credit card or collect long
distance calls.
Payne explained, "Our goal
is to provide students with the
same kind of telephone service
here that they have at home.
Right now when they come to
Stanford they go back 20 years
in telephone services."
