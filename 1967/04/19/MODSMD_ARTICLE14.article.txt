# Architecture At Stanford
## A 						Stanford Daily Forum Let's Edge Toward Greatness 
### JEFFERY SMITH 
Is Stanford trembling on the
edge of architectural greatness?
There is not the slightest sign
of it today. Yet almost overnight
a policy could be established de
manding not less than architec
tural greatness both for the cam
pus and the thousands of acres
it holds in trust. And the im
mense cost of such a policy
could be paid for from a fraction
of the proceeds of an imagina
tive, creative development of
these lands.
The need for such a policy is
urgent, for decisions taken now
will determine the quality of not
only of campus architecture but
of Stanford's architectural and
in large measure cultural envir
onment, and incidentally wheth
er its land development will gen
erate one hundred or five hun
dred million dollars.
The Heritage
Space is the essential ingre
dient of architecture, and of this
Stanford received 8,000 acres to

be held in perpetuity. In the be
ginning it was well used when
the great Inner Quad was laid
out. Here we have sun and sky
and buildings of quiet dignity
joined by the great colonnade.
The land was also ill used
through the erection of the pre
tentious buildings of Outer
Quad. The use of earthy and en
during materials —stone and tile
—is also an important part of
Stanford's architectural heritage.
I>ater Developments
A few of Stanford's later
structures are in keeping with
the spirit of Inner Quad. Above
all there is the Hanna house by
Frank Lloyd Wright. Commis
sioned by a young assistant pro
fessor and his wife, it has with
stood the ridicule of many if not
most of his colleagues, and is the
one Stanford building of world
significance. In keeping with the
Inner Quad tradition are also
such structures as the Big Dish,
opening to the sky, observing

and responding to objects invisi
ble to the human eye; and the
Bookstore, Post-Office, White
Memorial Plaza complex.
Stepchildren Of Encina
But most of the later build
ings are stepchildren of Encina:
Wilbur and Stern, with their
prison exteriors and incorrigible
inner confusion. I would add the
buildings flanking the physics
tanks, which I saw being built,
but except when I actually see
them, I can't believe that they
exist. The Shopping Center con
glomerate is also in the Encina
tradition, though lacking the
courage of its pretentions.
What Can Be Done?
The first thing to be done is to
get rid of the tile roof policy.
To identify Stanford's architec
tural tradition with the use of a
specific material invites imita
tion and stifles creativity. Is the
Hanna house not in the best
Stanford tradition because its
roof is copper and not tile? Does
the fact that Tresidder has a
tile roof make it any less a shod
dy assemb'age of modernistic
mannerisms? Warnecke did a
fine job of the Bookstore-Post
Office complex, but the stultify
ing compulsiveness of the tile
roof requirement becomes evi
dent in the top-heavy look of
UGLY's false room, which blocks
what could have been a mag
nificant viewing terrace. Can you
imagine Stone being asked to
add a fringe of tile to the Med
School building? He would have
refused the job.
Trembling Or Tottering?
Quite apart from taste and
function, there is a compelling
reason for prohibiting tile roofs
and high stone walls anywhere
on Stanford lands: the major
earthquakes which experts agree
are inevitable sooner or later
(would you believe the Spring
of '69?). Furthermore, the build
ing of facia to prevent loose tile
from falling wherever pedes
trains pass should be immedi
ately begun.

I have designed enough build
ings to know that architecture is
a community product, subject to
pressures, compromises and in
difference which together almost
insure characterless mediocrity.
This is especially true of institu
tional architecture, and is per
haps one reason donors are in
creasingly reluctant to put their
money into stone and mortar.
Yet the Parthenon and Char
tres Cathedral are proof that
great and Dulles Airport that ex
cellent institutional architecture
is possible. To achieve either,
however, requires an awareness
and an effort sufficient to over
come the inertia and stupidity
that generally prevail.
Land Development
The problems of architecture
are inseparable from those of
land development. Harvard and
Yale are hemmed in by urban
blight, but with most of 8,000
acres remaining, Stanford has
an incomparable opportunity.
Located midway between San
Francisco and the New Los
Angeles that will fester out
from San Jose, Stanford can
either allow its lands to become
part of the genera' architectural
and cultural blight, or it can
creat an environment commen
surate with its educational ac
tivities, and, hopefully, its educa
tional ideals.
It is easy to criticize the im
perfect efforts of men of good
will; what is needed is some
thing constructive. I shall con
clude, therefore, with two prac
tical suggestions. Each of them
assumes the obsolescence of the
familiar divisions between wil
derness, farmland, suburb, and
city, and involves the high
density development of Stanford
lands along with the preserva
tion of their natural qualities.
Business And Cultural Centers
I propose the development of
a Stanford Business Center—an
office, shopping, hotel, and apart
ment complex (I know how and
where), which would be as dis

tinctive in its way as Rockefeller
Center was in its. The Pan Am
building in New York, Century
City in Los Angeles ,and various
new "Rockefeller Centers" are
relevant straws in the wind. In
spite of the rapidly accelerating
growth of the Bay Area, there is
no present demand for such a
center. It would create its own.
SRI and the Stanford Indus
trial Park have given Stanford
an environment of high tech
nology of incalculable signifi
cance. I propose the development
of Stanford Cultural Center
which would be related to the
university somewhat as SRI is
now. This cultural center would
be an all year round attraction
for visitors, vacationers and
neighboring residents in search
of something that neither Dis
neyland nor Las Vegas offer.
The nucleus of this center would
consist of permanent institu
tions for the practice and per
formance of the arts, etc., etc. It
would be a center designed to
draw to it not only the public
but artists and thinkers in
search of an environment con
ducive to their work.
Adjacent to the center would
be an area for such institutions
as the present Think Tank, and
around the center would be a
highly integrated high density
transient and permanent resi
dential and recreational develop
ment. The proposed center could
not spring up overnight. Nor
should it if its quality is to be
assured. But it should be planned
for now, and the entire develop
ment organized in stages. I
should add that it takes more
than space, trees, sky and beau
tiful buildings, more even than
the winds of freedom, to develop
a creative community. The com
modity I propose would be, per
haps, no better and no worse
than Stanford itself.

Hanna house not in the best
Stanford tradition because its
roof is copper and not tile? Does
the fact that Tresidder has a
tile roof make it any less a shod
dy assemb'age of modernistic
mannerisms? Warnecke did a
fine job of the Bookstore-Post
Office complex, but the stultify
ing compulsiveness of the tile
roof requirement becomes evi
dent in the top-heavy look of
UGLY's false room, which blocks
what could have been a mag
nificant viewing terrace. Can you
imagine Stone being asked to
add a fringe of tile to the Med
School building? He would have
refused the job.
Trembling Or Tottering?
Quite apart from taste and
function, there is a compelling
reason for prohibiting tile roofs
and high stone walls anywhere
on Stanford lands: the major
earthquakes which experts agree
are inevitable sooner or later
(would you believe the Spring
of '69?). Furthermore, the build
ing of facia to prevent loose tile
from falling wherever pedes
trains pass should be immedi
ately begun.

I have designed enough build
ings to know that architecture is
a community product, subject to
pressures, compromises and in
difference which together almost
insure characterless mediocrity.
This is especially true of institu
tional architecture, and is per
haps one reason donors are in
creasingly reluctant to put their
money into stone and mortar.
Yet the Parthenon and Char
tres Cathedral are proof that
great and Dulles Airport that ex
cellent institutional architecture
is possible. To achieve either,
however, requires an awareness
and an effort sufficient to over
come the inertia and stupidity
that generally prevail.
Land Development
The problems of architecture
are inseparable from those of
land development. Harvard and
Yale are hemmed in by urban
blight, but with most of 8,000
acres remaining, Stanford has
an incomparable opportunity.
Located midway between San
Francisco and the New Los
Angeles that will fester out
from San Jose, Stanford can
either allow its lands to become
part of the genera' architectural
and cultural blight, or it can
creat an environment commen
surate with its educational ac
tivities, and, hopefully, its educa
tional ideals.
It is easy to criticize the im
perfect efforts of men of good
will; what is needed is some
thing constructive. I shall con
clude, therefore, with two prac
tical suggestions. Each of them
assumes the obsolescence of the
familiar divisions between wil
derness, farmland, suburb, and
city, and involves the high
density development of Stanford
lands along with the preserva
tion of their natural qualities.
Business And Cultural Centers
I propose the development of
a Stanford Business Center—an
office, shopping, hotel, and apart
ment complex (I know how and
where), which would be as dis

tinctive in its way as Rockefeller
Center was in its. The Pan Am
building in New York, Century
City in Los Angeles ,and various
new "Rockefeller Centers" are
relevant straws in the wind. In
spite of the rapidly accelerating
growth of the Bay Area, there is
no present demand for such a
center. It would create its own.
SRI and the Stanford Indus
trial Park have given Stanford
an environment of high tech
nology of incalculable signifi
cance. I propose the development
of Stanford Cultural Center
which would be related to the
university somewhat as SRI is
now. This cultural center would
be an all year round attraction
for visitors, vacationers and
neighboring residents in search
of something that neither Dis
neyland nor Las Vegas offer.
The nucleus of this center would
consist of permanent institu
tions for the practice and per
formance of the arts, etc., etc. It
would be a center designed to
draw to it not only the public
but artists and thinkers in
search of an environment con
ducive to their work.
Adjacent to the center would
be an area for such institutions
as the present Think Tank, and
around the center would be a
highly integrated high density
transient and permanent resi
dential and recreational develop
ment. The proposed center could
not spring up overnight. Nor
should it if its quality is to be
assured. But it should be planned
for now, and the entire develop
ment organized in stages. I
should add that it takes more
than space, trees, sky and beau
tiful buildings, more even than
the winds of freedom, to develop
a creative community. The com
modity I propose would be, per
haps, no better and no worse
than Stanford itself.

Is Stanford trembling on the
edge of architectural greatness?
There is not the slightest sign
of it today. Yet almost overnight
a policy could be established de
manding not less than architec
tural greatness both for the cam
pus and the thousands of acres
it holds in trust. And the im
mense cost of such a policy
could be paid for from a fraction
of the proceeds of an imagina
tive, creative development of
these lands.
The need for such a policy is
urgent, for decisions taken now
will determine the quality of not
only of campus architecture but
of Stanford's architectural and
in large measure cultural envir
onment, and incidentally wheth
er its land development will gen
erate one hundred or five hun
dred million dollars.
The Heritage
Space is the essential ingre
dient of architecture, and of this
Stanford received 8,000 acres to

be held in perpetuity. In the be
ginning it was well used when
the great Inner Quad was laid
out. Here we have sun and sky
and buildings of quiet dignity
joined by the great colonnade.
The land was also ill used
through the erection of the pre
tentious buildings of Outer
Quad. The use of earthy and en
during materials —stone and tile
—is also an important part of
Stanford's architectural heritage.
I>ater Developments
A few of Stanford's later
structures are in keeping with
the spirit of Inner Quad. Above
all there is the Hanna house by
Frank Lloyd Wright. Commis
sioned by a young assistant pro
fessor and his wife, it has with
stood the ridicule of many if not
most of his colleagues, and is the
one Stanford building of world
significance. In keeping with the
Inner Quad tradition are also
such structures as the Big Dish,
opening to the sky, observing

and responding to objects invisi
ble to the human eye; and the
Bookstore, Post-Office, White
Memorial Plaza complex.
Stepchildren Of Encina
But most of the later build
ings are stepchildren of Encina:
Wilbur and Stern, with their
prison exteriors and incorrigible
inner confusion. I would add the
buildings flanking the physics
tanks, which I saw being built,
but except when I actually see
them, I can't believe that they
exist. The Shopping Center con
glomerate is also in the Encina
tradition, though lacking the
courage of its pretentions.
What Can Be Done?
The first thing to be done is to
get rid of the tile roof policy.
To identify Stanford's architec
tural tradition with the use of a
specific material invites imita
tion and stifles creativity. Is the

a Stanford Business Center—an
office, shopping, hotel, and apart
ment complex (I know how and
where), which would be as dis

tinctive in its way as Rockefeller
Center was in its. The Pan Am
building in New York, Century
City in Los Angeles ,and various
new "Rockefeller Centers" are
relevant straws in the wind. In
spite of the rapidly accelerating
growth of the Bay Area, there is
no present demand for such a
center. It would create its own.
SRI and the Stanford Indus
trial Park have given Stanford
an environment of high tech
nology of incalculable signifi
cance. I propose the development
of Stanford Cultural Center
which would be related to the
university somewhat as SRI is
now. This cultural center would
be an all year round attraction
for visitors, vacationers and
neighboring residents in search
of something that neither Dis
neyland nor Las Vegas offer.
The nucleus of this center would
consist of permanent institu
tions for the practice and per
formance of the arts, etc., etc. It
would be a center designed to
draw to it not only the public
but artists and thinkers in
search of an environment con
ducive to their work.
Adjacent to the center would
be an area for such institutions
as the present Think Tank, and
around the center would be a
highly integrated high density
transient and permanent resi
dential and recreational develop
ment. The proposed center could
not spring up overnight. Nor
should it if its quality is to be
assured. But it should be planned
for now, and the entire develop
ment organized in stages. I
should add that it takes more
than space, trees, sky and beau
tiful buildings, more even than
the winds of freedom, to develop
a creative community. The com
modity I propose would be, per
haps, no better and no worse
than Stanford itself.

Is Stanford trembling on the
edge of architectural greatness?
There is not the slightest sign
of it today. Yet almost overnight
a policy could be established de
manding not less than architec
tural greatness both for the cam
pus and the thousands of acres
it holds in trust. And the im
mense cost of such a policy
could be paid for from a fraction
of the proceeds of an imagina
tive, creative development of
these lands.
The need for such a policy is
urgent, for decisions taken now
will determine the quality of not
only of campus architecture but
of Stanford's architectural and
in large measure cultural envir
onment, and incidentally wheth
er its land development will gen
erate one hundred or five hun
dred million dollars.
The Heritage
Space is the essential ingre
dient of architecture, and of this
Stanford received 8,000 acres to

be held in perpetuity. In the be
ginning it was well used when
the great Inner Quad was laid
out. Here we have sun and sky
and buildings of quiet dignity
joined by the great colonnade.
The land was also ill used
through the erection of the pre
tentious buildings of Outer
Quad. The use of earthy and en
during materials —stone and tile
—is also an important part of
Stanford's architectural heritage.
I>ater Developments
A few of Stanford's later
structures are in keeping with
the spirit of Inner Quad. Above
all there is the Hanna house by
Frank Lloyd Wright. Commis
sioned by a young assistant pro
fessor and his wife, it has with
stood the ridicule of many if not
most of his colleagues, and is the
one Stanford building of world
significance. In keeping with the
Inner Quad tradition are also
such structures as the Big Dish,
opening to the sky, observing

and responding to objects invisi
ble to the human eye; and the
Bookstore, Post-Office, White
Memorial Plaza complex.
Stepchildren Of Encina
But most of the later build
ings are stepchildren of Encina:
Wilbur and Stern, with their
prison exteriors and incorrigible
inner confusion. I would add the
buildings flanking the physics
tanks, which I saw being built,
but except when I actually see
them, I can't believe that they
exist. The Shopping Center con
glomerate is also in the Encina
tradition, though lacking the
courage of its pretentions.
What Can Be Done?
The first thing to be done is to
get rid of the tile roof policy.
To identify Stanford's architec
tural tradition with the use of a
specific material invites imita
tion and stifles creativity. Is the
Hanna house not in the best
Stanford tradition because its
roof is copper and not tile? Does
the fact that Tresidder has a
tile roof make it any less a shod
dy assemb'age of modernistic
mannerisms? Warnecke did a
fine job of the Bookstore-Post
Office complex, but the stultify
ing compulsiveness of the tile
roof requirement becomes evi
dent in the top-heavy look of
UGLY's false room, which blocks
what could have been a mag
nificant viewing terrace. Can you
imagine Stone being asked to
add a fringe of tile to the Med
School building? He would have
refused the job.
Trembling Or Tottering?
Quite apart from taste and
function, there is a compelling
reason for prohibiting tile roofs
and high stone walls anywhere
on Stanford lands: the major
earthquakes which experts agree
are inevitable sooner or later
(would you believe the Spring
of '69?). Furthermore, the build
ing of facia to prevent loose tile
from falling wherever pedes
trains pass should be immedi
ately begun.

I have designed enough build
ings to know that architecture is
a community product, subject to
pressures, compromises and in
difference which together almost
insure characterless mediocrity.
This is especially true of institu
tional architecture, and is per
haps one reason donors are in
creasingly reluctant to put their
money into stone and mortar.
Yet the Parthenon and Char
tres Cathedral are proof that
great and Dulles Airport that ex
cellent institutional architecture
is possible. To achieve either,
however, requires an awareness
and an effort sufficient to over
come the inertia and stupidity
that generally prevail.
Land Development
The problems of architecture
are inseparable from those of
land development. Harvard and
Yale are hemmed in by urban
blight, but with most of 8,000
acres remaining, Stanford has
an incomparable opportunity.
Located midway between San
Francisco and the New Los
Angeles that will fester out
from San Jose, Stanford can
either allow its lands to become
part of the genera' architectural
and cultural blight, or it can
creat an environment commen
surate with its educational ac
tivities, and, hopefully, its educa
tional ideals.
It is easy to criticize the im
perfect efforts of men of good
will; what is needed is some
thing constructive. I shall con
clude, therefore, with two prac
tical suggestions. Each of them
assumes the obsolescence of the
familiar divisions between wil
derness, farmland, suburb, and
city, and involves the high
density development of Stanford
lands along with the preserva
tion of their natural qualities.

dred million dollars.
The Heritage
Space is the essential ingre
dient of architecture, and of this
Stanford received 8,000 acres to

be held in perpetuity. In the be
ginning it was well used when
the great Inner Quad was laid
out. Here we have sun and sky
and buildings of quiet dignity
joined by the great colonnade.
The land was also ill used
through the erection of the pre
tentious buildings of Outer
Quad. The use of earthy and en
during materials —stone and tile
—is also an important part of
Stanford's architectural heritage.
I>ater Developments
A few of Stanford's later
structures are in keeping with
the spirit of Inner Quad. Above
all there is the Hanna house by
Frank Lloyd Wright. Commis
sioned by a young assistant pro
fessor and his wife, it has with
stood the ridicule of many if not
most of his colleagues, and is the
one Stanford building of world
significance. In keeping with the
Inner Quad tradition are also
such structures as the Big Dish,
opening to the sky, observing

and responding to objects invisi
ble to the human eye; and the
Bookstore, Post-Office, White
Memorial Plaza complex.
Stepchildren Of Encina
But most of the later build
ings are stepchildren of Encina:
Wilbur and Stern, with their
prison exteriors and incorrigible
inner confusion. I would add the
buildings flanking the physics
tanks, which I saw being built,
but except when I actually see
them, I can't believe that they
exist. The Shopping Center con
glomerate is also in the Encina
tradition, though lacking the
courage of its pretentions.
What Can Be Done?
The first thing to be done is to
get rid of the tile roof policy.
To identify Stanford's architec
tural tradition with the use of a
specific material invites imita
tion and stifles creativity. Is the
Hanna house not in the best
Stanford tradition because its
roof is copper and not tile? Does
the fact that Tresidder has a
tile roof make it any less a shod
dy assemb'age of modernistic
mannerisms? Warnecke did a
fine job of the Bookstore-Post
Office complex, but the stultify
ing compulsiveness of the tile
roof requirement becomes evi
dent in the top-heavy look of
UGLY's false room, which blocks
what could have been a mag
nificant viewing terrace. Can you
imagine Stone being asked to
add a fringe of tile to the Med
School building? He would have
refused the job.
Trembling Or Tottering?
Quite apart from taste and
function, there is a compelling
reason for prohibiting tile roofs
and high stone walls anywhere
on Stanford lands: the major
earthquakes which experts agree
are inevitable sooner or later
(would you believe the Spring
of '69?). Furthermore, the build
ing of facia to prevent loose tile
from falling wherever pedes
trains pass should be immedi
ately begun.

I have designed enough build
ings to know that architecture is
a community product, subject to
pressures, compromises and in
difference which together almost
insure characterless mediocrity.
This is especially true of institu
tional architecture, and is per
haps one reason donors are in
creasingly reluctant to put their
money into stone and mortar.
Yet the Parthenon and Char
tres Cathedral are proof that
great and Dulles Airport that ex
cellent institutional architecture
is possible. To achieve either,
however, requires an awareness
and an effort sufficient to over
come the inertia and stupidity
that generally prevail.
Land Development
The problems of architecture
are inseparable from those of
land development. Harvard and
Yale are hemmed in by urban
blight, but with most of 8,000
acres remaining, Stanford has
an incomparable opportunity.
Located midway between San
Francisco and the New Los
Angeles that will fester out
from San Jose, Stanford can
either allow its lands to become
part of the genera' architectural
and cultural blight, or it can
creat an environment commen
surate with its educational ac
tivities, and, hopefully, its educa
tional ideals.
It is easy to criticize the im
perfect efforts of men of good
will; what is needed is some
thing constructive. I shall con
clude, therefore, with two prac
tical suggestions. Each of them
assumes the obsolescence of the
familiar divisions between wil
derness, farmland, suburb, and
city, and involves the high
density development of Stanford
lands along with the preserva
tion of their natural qualities.
Business And Cultural Centers
I propose the development of
a Stanford Business Center—an
office, shopping, hotel, and apart
ment complex (I know how and
where), which would be as dis

tinctive in its way as Rockefeller
Center was in its. The Pan Am
building in New York, Century
City in Los Angeles ,and various
new "Rockefeller Centers" are
relevant straws in the wind. In
spite of the rapidly accelerating
growth of the Bay Area, there is
no present demand for such a
center. It would create its own.
SRI and the Stanford Indus
trial Park have given Stanford
an environment of high tech
nology of incalculable signifi
cance. I propose the development
of Stanford Cultural Center
which would be related to the
university somewhat as SRI is
now. This cultural center would
be an all year round attraction
for visitors, vacationers and
neighboring residents in search
of something that neither Dis
neyland nor Las Vegas offer.
The nucleus of this center would
consist of permanent institu
tions for the practice and per
formance of the arts, etc., etc. It
would be a center designed to
draw to it not only the public
but artists and thinkers in
search of an environment con
ducive to their work.
Adjacent to the center would
be an area for such institutions
as the present Think Tank, and
around the center would be a
highly integrated high density
transient and permanent resi
dential and recreational develop
ment. The proposed center could
not spring up overnight. Nor
should it if its quality is to be
assured. But it should be planned
for now, and the entire develop
ment organized in stages. I
should add that it takes more
than space, trees, sky and beau
tiful buildings, more even than
the winds of freedom, to develop
a creative community. The com
modity I propose would be, per
haps, no better and no worse
than Stanford itself.

Is Stanford trembling on the
edge of architectural greatness?
There is not the slightest sign
of it today. Yet almost overnight
a policy could be established de
manding not less than architec
tural greatness both for the cam
pus and the thousands of acres
it holds in trust. And the im
mense cost of such a policy
could be paid for from a fraction
of the proceeds of an imagina
tive, creative development of
these lands.
The need for such a policy is
urgent, for decisions taken now
will determine the quality of not
only of campus architecture but
of Stanford's architectural and
in large measure cultural envir
onment, and incidentally wheth
er its land development will gen
erate one hundred or five hun
dred million dollars.
