# Red Tile Ensemble?
## Need For Architectural 'Involvement' 
### MARILYN MELKONTAN 
At dusk and dawn, the archi
tectural motif of arches and red
tile roofs of the Stanford cam
pus creates a setting of placid
uniformity and serenity.
At those hours, there is noth
ing in view to disturb this peace
ful composition. The sun brings
out the warm, rose colors of the
roofs, casts shadows in the arch
ways; the eye wanders undis
turbed across the Stanford coun
tryside and nothing intrudes to
upset this visual peace.
But it does not last. It is
ruined and replaced by visual
chaos. All the efforts at archi
tectural control to prevent the
addition of one new building
which does not conform to the
Stanford motif, all the restraint
it has taken to forbear from
commissioning an architect
whose ideas might not fit in at
Stanford; all this discipline and
planning has gone into produc
ing an atmosphere and setting
which emerges for only a few
moments each day.
And why? Because Stanford
students will not do their part!
Each day the campus fills with
thousands of students who dress
and mill about in every which
way, oblivious to the need to
maintain the setting which Stan
ford architecture has endeav
ored to establish.
They do not attempt, in any
way, to carry on th motif of red
tile roofs and arches. Occasion
ally there will be a red skirt or
shirt here and there, but nothing
in the way of the massive effort
which is needed if we are to be
successful in achieving the uni
formity which is strived for in
the campus's physical setting.
On entering Stanford, each
student should be required to
purchase and wear a red tile
mantle and should not be per
mitted to appear on campus
without it.
This is not unprecedented. At

Oxford, students wear black
gowns to maintain the decor of
their campus, so I don't think it
would be asking too much to
have Stanford students give up
a little individuality and sub
merge their egos under a Stan
ford red tile mantle.
Only in this way, with every
student clad in red tile, can we
preserve that serene setting of
the early morning hours and
achieve that calm architectural
conformity which we see at
tempted all around us.
An absurd idea? Not really.
It is no more absurd than put
ting a tile roof on every campus
building no matter what the
function or size of the building.
Red tile students would serve
the same picturesque purpose.
Stanford has been obsessed
with the idea of continuity and
conformity as the campus has
expanded around the original
Quadrangle. Where recent
buildings lacked the charm and
brilliance of the Quad they had
the saving grace of "fitting in,"
of being harmonious.
Common Denominators
Red tile roofs and concrete
"arches" were the obvious com
mon denominators to achieve
a superficial conformity with
the architecture of the original
Quadrangle; there has been no
conformity to its architectural
quality.
There is no contemporary
building of architectural signifi
cance on the Stanford campus.
Some new buildings "fit in"
so well they make existing
buildings look like their succes
sors; witness the Lou Henry
Hoover Building now under con
struction.
Harmony has, to some extent,
become a euphemism for dull
mediocrity.
The architectural challenge at
Stanford, as in many other en
vironments built over genera
tions, is to design distinctive
contemporary buildings which

are compatible with the fine ar
chitecture of a former period.
But the emphasis, I think,
would be on encouraging design
which is both distinctive and
contemporary, which represents
what is happening in architec
ture in the second half of the
twentieth century. I think this
is a particularly important task
of a university.
The university's physical set
ting represents a long time
span: from what exists to what
will exist many years into the
future.
More to Offer
It is also, hopefully, a place
where, at each point in time,
that which is contemporary in
thought and creativity is being
viewed and examined with an
openmindedness and curiosity
not found in other institutions.
Its architecture should be an
embodiment of this quality; of
a willingness to explore what is
new and exciting in the culture
of the present day and to en
courage and provide an oppor
tunity for its expression.
Just as a university provides
encouragement and perhaps, at
times, the only refuge for a na
tion's writers, artists, and schol
ars, it should provide the same
forum for its architects.
The great architects of the
day should be commissioned to
work at the university and the
young and unknown should be
able to demonstrate their ability
through design competitions
sponsored by the university.
There is, of course, a signifi
cant difference between archi
tecture and the other arts. If
you don't like a book, you can
put it down; if you don't like a
symphony, you need nof listen.
A building forces itself on you
and you must live with it, at
least for a time.
But somewhere between sub
jecting the university to abuse
by the architect and forcing a
"design formula" or a "campus
style" on him, the line can be
drawn by Stanford in a more
creative fashion, and there is
some evidence that this may be
the trend.
A building at a university nec
essarily represents more than
aesthetic considerations and, if

it exists, the concern of the uni
versity for being involved in the
expression of contemporary cul
ture.
It represents money and the
people who contribute that mon
ey. These are pressures which
every university must deal with
and keep its soul in the process.
I think when you have left
here and become an alumnus or
even a trustee, perhaps you
change a little and want to pre
serve "The Farm" as you knew
It.
You're more reluctant to con
tribute your hard-earned dollars
to a building project which
doesn't have some sentimental
touch, be it only a red tile roof.
So we go on building buildings
with red tile roofs, not so much
for the sake of architectural
continuity, though that's what
we call it, but for alumni con
tinuity and the wherewithal to
build the additional facilities
which the University clearly re
quires.
Timidity A Problem
This affects the course of ar
chitectural development at a
university. But I think the de
sign timidity which this pres
sure causes may be more a re
sult of its exaggeration by those
who must give final approval of
a design than it is the actual
threat of withdrawal of alumni
support.
A university embodies many
aspects and competing values.
It is not a business, but it must
exhibit some of the efficiency
and astuteness of a business or
ganization.
It is not really an ivory tow
er, but it must maintain an at
mosphere where individuality,
and difference, and freedom to
experiment may thrive.
All these values and concerns
find expression in its architec
ture and if they are properly
reconciled then, I think, there
may be a visual embodiment of
what John Masefield meant
when he wrote, "There are few
earthly things more beautiful
than a university."
