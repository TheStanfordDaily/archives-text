# Product Of Soundness, Compromise

### LORENZ EITNER 
Architecture expresses cul
ture. The high quality, as archi
tecture, of the Parthenon or of
Reims cathedral is not unrelated
to the quality of the societies
which produced them.
We do not look on these build
ings as lucky accidents. Their
qualities do not simply reflect
the skill of individual architects,
they reflect a general level of
intellectual culture.
American university archi
tecture presents a picture of re
markably uniform mediocrity.
There are a few, widely scatter
ed exceptions, but the vast
majority of campus buildings
throughout the nation is
marked by a dispirited, half
hearted traditionalism, by dull
ness and timidity.
Is this merely an unlucky

accident? Or should we apply to
American university architec
ture the kind of analysis which
we apply, as a matter of course,
to such buildings as the Par
thenon and Reims cathedral,
and conclude that it reflects the
half-hearted traditionalism, the
dullness and the timidity of the
universities as institutions?
Universities are difficult cli
ents. Between the architect and
his actual client (i.e. the stu
dents and teachers who will use
his building) numerous commit
tees, boards, administrative of
fices intervene.
Each of these advises, argues,
demands, influences, and de
cides. The final outcome tends
to be an infinitely complicated
compromise, embodying no one,
dominant idea, least of all the
architect's own conception.
As patrons of architecture,

universities dislike experiment
and opt for "soundness". This
means, in practice, that they gen
erally prefer to work with estab
lished architects whose work in
spires confidence because it
strikes the lay members of the
building committees as familiar,
hence sensible.
Very few university adminis
trations have had the courage of
turning over major building pro
jects to the artistic authority of
first-rate contemporary archi
tects (who are notoriously un
willing to submit to committee
control), despite the fact that the
few experiments which have
been risked have generally been
successful and resulted in not
able buildings.
The best part of Stanford's
campus is still the Old Quad, a
product of autocratic planning

which brought face to face a
capable architect and a strong
patron.
The Old Quad is not "great"
architecture, but it was impres
sive sweep and magnanimity— it
expresses the energy and cour
age of the founders of the uni
versity.
The surrounding buildings, by
contrast, represent average Am
erican campus planning. Their
predominant aspect is one of
decorous indecision.
Despite the evident effort to
achieve unity, as symbolized by
the übiquitous tile roofs, the
total visual effect is scattered
and incoherent. The planners
have confused uniformity with
harmony.
Greater strength of character
in individual buildings could

have made for greater continu
ity, and more over-all harmony.
Roof tiles and shrubbery cannot
hold together buildings individ
ually so lacking in distinction:
it takes vigor to produce styl
istic unity.
Round the crusty core of the
Old Quad, the newer buildings
sprawl like a listless academic
committee, surrounding a
feared oligarch.
There are among the newer
buildings some exceptions; there
are, here and there, mild indi
cations of awakening courage,
slight gleams of aesthetic inde
pendence: but it will take much
more courage and independence
to make this campus architec
turally significant.

Head of the Department of
Art and Architure.)
Architecture expresses cul
ture. The high quality, as archi
tecture, of the Parthenon or of
Reims cathedral is not unrelated
to the quality of the societies
which produced them.
We do not look on these build
ings as lucky accidents. Their
qualities do not simply reflect
the skill of individual architects,
they reflect a general level of
intellectual culture.
American university archi
tecture presents a picture of re
markably uniform mediocrity.
There are a few, widely scatter
ed exceptions, but the vast
majority of campus buildings
throughout the nation is
marked by a dispirited, half
hearted traditionalism, by dull
ness and timidity.
Is this merely an unlucky

accident? Or should we apply to
American university architec
ture the kind of analysis which
we apply, as a matter of course,
to such buildings as the Par
thenon and Reims cathedral,
and conclude that it reflects the
half-hearted traditionalism, the
dullness and the timidity of the
universities as institutions?
Universities are difficult cli
ents. Between the architect and
his actual client (i.e. the stu
dents and teachers who will use
his building) numerous commit
tees, boards, administrative of
fices intervene.
Each of these advises, argues,
demands, influences, and de
cides. The final outcome tends
to be an infinitely complicated
compromise, embodying no one,
dominant idea, least of all the
architect's own conception.
As patrons of architecture,

universities dislike experiment
and opt for "soundness". This
means, in practice, that they gen
erally prefer to work with estab
lished architects whose work in
spires confidence because it
strikes the lay members of the
building committees as familiar,
hence sensible.
Very few university adminis
trations have had the courage of
turning over major building pro
jects to the artistic authority of
first-rate contemporary archi
tects (who are notoriously un
willing to submit to committee
control), despite the fact that the
few experiments which have
been risked have generally been
successful and resulted in not
able buildings.
The best part of Stanford's
campus is still the Old Quad, a
product of autocratic planning

which brought face to face a
capable architect and a strong
patron.
The Old Quad is not "great"
architecture, but it was impres
sive sweep and magnanimity— it
expresses the energy and cour
age of the founders of the uni
versity.
The surrounding buildings, by
contrast, represent average Am
erican campus planning. Their
predominant aspect is one of
decorous indecision.
Despite the evident effort to
achieve unity, as symbolized by
the übiquitous tile roofs, the
total visual effect is scattered
and incoherent. The planners
have confused uniformity with
harmony.
Greater strength of character
in individual buildings could

have made for greater continu
ity, and more over-all harmony.
Roof tiles and shrubbery cannot
hold together buildings individ
ually so lacking in distinction:
it takes vigor to produce styl
istic unity.
Round the crusty core of the
Old Quad, the newer buildings
sprawl like a listless academic
committee, surrounding a
feared oligarch.
There are among the newer
buildings some exceptions; there
are, here and there, mild indi
cations of awakening courage,
slight gleams of aesthetic inde
pendence: but it will take much
more courage and independence
to make this campus architec
turally significant.
