## Panel Discusses Academic Sex 
### LINDSAY BLACKMAN 
Dr. Benson Snyder observes that
the modern university is "charged
.vith doing what parents cannot do
â€” control their children's sexual be
havior."
Dr. Snyder, Psychiatrist-in-Chief at
Massachusetts Institute of Techno
" Dgy, yesterday afternoon moderated
a panel discussion as a part of the
Jake Gimbel Sex Psychology Series.
Helping him consider "Sex and the
Invisible Curriculum" were Mau
rice Osborne, James Paulsen, and
Margaret Deanesly from the Cowell
Student Health Center, and Stuart
McLean, UCCM minister.
Dr. Snyder noted that as a univer
" *ty student body becomes more cos
mopolitan and heterogeneous, it
grows increasingly difficult for col

lege administrators and health offi
cials to dictate standards for common
conduct. The panel felt that sexual
growth was not a chronological func
tion and that there was no connection
between social hours and sexual be
havior.
Varying Proclivities
Dr. Deanesly stated that a univer
sity cannot expect to set rules for
behavior in the same way that it
can set up courses. The difficulty en
countered by universities in creating
ethical codes for students of widely
varying social experience and sexual
proclivities is manifested in incon
sistent standards. At Stanford, two
sets of open house rules are in effect
and at odds. An undergraduate wom
an under 23 must live on campus
while a graduate woman over 21 may
live off campus. And undergraduate
coeds in Hoskins House might as
well be off campus.
Dr. Paulsen contends that univer
sities are no better equipped to con
trol adolescent sexual behavior than
are parents. "Parents do not know
their children," he states, "and uni
versities do not know their students."
In order to avoid the artificiality of
dictating time and location limita
tions, Paulsen feels a university would
have to sanction relaxed forms of so
cial - sexual experimentation which
would produce anxieties, anxieties
which would have to be confronted.
Inconsistent sexual ethics in Amer

ican society and on its university
campuses is often blamed for "double
standards" of sexual behavior. Proud
but ambivalent parents send the
"greatest children" (their own) off to
college, where they suddenly can't
be trusted and require the direction
of in loco parentis. An ethical dicho
tomy arises between what young
adults are told to do and what they
find they can get away with.
If universities sanction student
sexual behavior, Paulsen pointed out,
they would have to "go all the way"
from a "rumbleseat pregnancy in a
parking lot to a possible theapeutic
abortion." He observed that sex ac
tivity can too easily become the pre
dominant focus in a relationship, pre
empting emotional interchange and

discovery. I too often is the measure
rather than the manifestation of a
relationship.
Mr. McLean cited the competitive
struggle of American life, a life which
maximizes separateness. People are
expected to compete, and then they
expect themselvs to get in bed and
have a meaningful sexual-emotional
experience. Since a sexual relation
ship involves two people, Dr. Snyder
felt an essential requirement is that
both parties know what they are do
ing, so that neither is exploited or
deceived.
In closing, Dr. Paulsen offered a
summary conclusion: "There are dif
ferences between men and women,
boys and girls, here and there, now
and then."


Dr. Snyder, center above, delivered the first In the Jake Glmbel Sex Lectures
yesterday afternoon. Represented on the panel were the directors of the Stan
ford and UC Berkeley Student Health Centers.
