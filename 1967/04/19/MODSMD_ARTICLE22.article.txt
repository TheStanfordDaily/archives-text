# 'Vary Residences'--Levin
## 
### 
The following article was writ
ten by Dr. Max M. Levin, associ
ate director of the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems.
Dr. Levin was a member of the
Freshman Year Committee
which compiled a report for the
Housing Commission.
In this paper Dr. Levin, who
also lectures in psychology, de
fines and discusses the concept
of a "residential university" in
general. With respect to Stan
ford specifically, Dr. Levin feels
that the Grove Project is a good
model of the type of living
group which should be made
available as a residential alter
native for students.
He explained in an interview
with The Daily that the Univers
ity should provide a variety of
living situations which should
include special interest groups,
student co-operatives where resi
dents would work in the house
to help defray living expenses,
and on-campus apartments. He
stressed the fact that many
senior women feel the need for
apartment living in order to
practice the "homemaking" tech
niques they will use after grad
uation.
Levin pointed out many of the
problems which must be con
sidered in remodeling present
dorms or designing new ones.
He explained that many stu
dents prefer the "homelike" at
mosphere of small structures
like fraternity or row houses,
although many possibilities for
creative architecture exist. He
said that more singles should be
constructed for students desir
ing more privacy and that the
number of sitting rooms should
be increased.
Dr. Levin felt that financial
matters were one of the main
factors delaying improved Stan
ford housing. He noted, though,
that quality should not be sacri
ficed for economy and that well
planned residences will save
long-range improvement costs.
Other problems Levin sees as
pertinent to the residential uni
versity include the size of the
"ideal group," and whether or

not on-campus housing is to be
mandatory for all students.
Tfie^T :
of most universities are now
basically eating and sleeping fa
cilities, structurally like bar
racks or motels, or high-rise
Hiltons surrounded by parking
lots. As such, they serve a va
riety of functions. Apart from
food and shelter, they may pro
vide for some social needs at
a minimum level.
But they also serve as a ref
uge from the academic and in
tellectual ethos of the univer
sity, often perpetuating an ado
lescent — or even more regres
sive — peer culture. Through
the student personnel apparatus
they may serve as conduct con
trol centers. They constitute the
center of the extracurriculum
which, alas, for some may have
more pervasive and enduring ef
fects than the curriculum itself.
A new conception of the uni
versity, including its residential
components, is gradually emerg
ing. Basically it views the uni
versity as a community for
learning and development. At its
core is an intellectual and hu
manist ethos, which can be
achieved only if it is reinforced
by all elements of campus life.
The Hotel on Par
With Classroom
This view emphasizes that the
classroom, library, or laboratory
cannot — indeed, does not even
now — have a monopoly on pro
viding for the education and de
velopment of students. Else,
why a residential university?
Why not subcontract all residen
tial arrangements and avoid all
hotel problems?
To become a truly residential
university, residence halls must
in this view become centers of
learning and development equal
in importance to the lecture hall.
Ideally their staffing, planning,
and administration should be
the responsibility of faculty
members rather than housing di
rectors or business offices. The
entire faculty should be attach
ed as active fellows in various
residences.

Perhaps faculty members in
terested in and involved with
undergraduates should have
their offices there rather in the
departmental colonies. Together
with the students they should
organize house seminars, ar
range for tutorials, lecture se
ries, art exhibits, musical per
formances in the residence.
There should be house libraries,
record collections, arts and
crafts workshops. Curricular ex
perimentation and innovation
should be a house function
with or without credit.
Special Interest Houses
There appears to be consider
able difference of opinion about
special interest houses; experi
mentation is in order. Houses
with distinctive interests, for
eign language, fine arts, social
issues, foreign policy, may well
bring together students and fac
ulty from various disciplines
who could transform a house
whose residents and loosely af
filiated faculty can only share
pleasantries into a more mean
ingful learning community.
There would still be ample
diversity by virtue of differences
in personality, background, ca
reer plans and so on. But there
would also be a shared major
intellectual and social concern.
A residence learning center
can serve another special func
tion. For many students it may
be the sole experience in group
living, thereby providing a natu
ral laboratory in human rela
tions. Properly planned, but not
making of it a mental health
center, its members can acquire
more self-awareness, knowledge
about others, as well as an em
pathic understanding of the hu
man group.
Individual and
Group Awareness
Apart from what is most im
portant, the benefits individuals
might gain from such experi
ences for their own personal
and social development, they
may become better prepared to
participate in the densely or
ganized world which they will
inevitably encounter in their
work and social life. In fact,

they might even be prepared to
do so without the special T
groups, sensitivity training pro
grams and the like that many
industries and other organiza
tions now seem to find neces
sary.
While for a large university a
residential learning center might
best be achieved in a college
cluster arrangement, residential
clusters may serve equally well
in smaller colleges or universi
ties. But they must be planned
and organized at the outset as
significant learning and personal
development centers. This can
only be achieved if they are, in
fact, given such functions.
The various educational, so
cial, and personal services now
centralized in other parts of
the university ought to be dis
tributed among the various res
idential clusters wherever pos
sible. Only if they have genuine
and explicit functions can they
become more than what they
are now. While they may be
come more pleasant and to some
extent more educational if inte
grated by class and sex, such
integrations alone will not re
sult in genuine centers for
learning.

Holding an occasional class or
seminar in the residence hall
while noble in intent is only a
token solution. Much more is
required which will necessitate
considerable change in the con
ception and the nature of the
residence as well as in various
other components of the univer
sity. Faculty, academic admini
strators, counselors may have
to relocate their offices. Parts of
main libraries may have to be
relocated.
Someday in a "Brave New
World," equipment for informa
tion retrieval and closed circuit
TV systems will become stand
ard in each house. And the uni
versity may get along with few
er classes and classrooms. Stu
dents might then more actively
and responsibly pursue more of
their education in their living
centers.
The gap between the class
room-factory, where students
presumably work and are com
pensated by grades, and the res
idence, where they relax and
live, may be narrowed if not eli
minated. Short of this there is
no genuine residential univer
sity.
