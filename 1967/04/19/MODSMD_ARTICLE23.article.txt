# U.S. Bombs Laotian Village
## 
### HOWARD MOFFETT 
SAIGON, South Viet Nam
(CPS) — A U.S. spokesman in
Saigon yesterday confirmed that
B-52 Stratofortresses, the larg
est bombers America has in
Southeast Asia, have been
pounding the Ho Chi Minh Trail
in Laos for several weeks.
Though officially outside the
war zone, it is now known that
B-52's were bombing Laotian in
filtration routes as early as 1965.
But B-52's aren't the only
American planes bombing Laos,
and the Ho Chi Minh Trail isn't
the only thing they're bombing.
According to a young American
volunteer working in Muong
Phalane, Vietnam war bombs
have started falling on Laotian
villages.
In the morning of February
13, three American jet bombers,
said to be F-105's, dropped a
total of eighteen 750-pound
bombs on the village of Muong
Phalane, in the Laotian pan
handle 60 miles east of Savanna
khet and some 40 miles west of
the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The
bombs killed two villagers, in
jured 15, and destroyed 30
houses.
Letter Tells of Bombing
Lewis Sitzer, 23, an Interna
tional Voluntary Service mem
ber who had been teaching in
Muong Phalane for eight
months, told of the bombing in
a letter to friends in Saigon
dated February 18.
In his letter Sitzer also indi
cated he might be relieved, be
cause American officials felt he
had become "too involved with
the people to be useful." Inter
national Voluntary Service,
which served as the prototype
for the Peace Corps, is a private
organization under contract to

the U.S. Agency for Interna
tional Development, a branch
of the State Department. IVS
currently has 130 volunteers do
ing community development, ed
ucation, and agricultural work
in Vietnam, and another 100
serving in Laos.
A native of Los Angeles, Sit
zer graduated from the Univer
sity of California at Riverside
in 1965 with an AB in Philo
sophy. He worked as a counselor
to blind students in Los Angeles
and as a civil rights worker in
Mississippi in the summer of
1964.
"Dear Friends and Family"
His mimeographed letter,
headed "Dear Friends and Fami
ly," was a highly personal ac
count of the emotions that ran
through Muong Phalane after
the bombing.
He said the three planes came
at 6:45 Monday morning, catch
ing the villagers by surprise as
the children were preparing for
school and the morning market
was forming. At the time, Sitzer
was in a nearby village, visiting
friends during the Lunar New
Year festival. He returned to
Phalane on the first helicopter
at 10:30.
With him were a delegation
of Laotian generals and a U.S.
Air Force demolition crew. (Six
of the bombs had exploded on
impact, but the rest had time
fuses and had not yet gone off.)
He wrote that the villagers were
still in shock: half had fled to
the forest, a few were wander
ing around consoling each other,
some just sat and stared, and
some were beginning to get
angry.
Unfriendly Kowtowing
"It was strange to see the
emotional conflict the villagers
were going through — feeling
unfriendly, worn, abused, and

growing hostile, yet having to
kowtow and show humility with
these important men. With me,
whom they knew, they could
begin to be more open and less
tolerant. It was hard to believe
those whom I had considered
my friends now viewing me with
suspicion and hatred. Why did I
leave they asked? Why did the
jet planes bomb Muong Pha
lane? Had I been here the jet
planes would not have come,
they said."
Sitzer had to use a crow-bar
to break into his house. When
he finally got in and found
his camera, he said he noticed
the Peace Calendar on his desk
(published by the War Resistor's
League): "Bitter irony. I picked
up the camera and quickly ran
out of the house. The war had
come to Muong Phalane. I could
taste the tears and see the hurt
in reddened eyes. God damn it!"
He walked through the bomb
ed village. "Some took me and
showed me where their houses
had been, where their father
was buried, where their roof
was in shambles, where they
had lost all their possessions
and had nothing. Some just
glared at me. The children were
without smiles and greetings.
They had grown up quickly."
Craters Instead of Houses
Each bomb crater had its own
story: "Here is where my family
slept and my wife is still buried.
What will I do with my young
child who is still breast-feed
ing?"
The village teacher was luck
ier. His wife had been on the
front porch of their home when
a bomb hit alongside. The wom
an was injured by the rocks it
threw up, but the bomb itself
did not explode.
By this time the demolition
team had found that two-thirds

of the bombs had not yet ex
ploded; they might go off at any
moment. Sitzer wrote, "We all
realized how lucky we had been
that the bombs did not explode
as we were looking at them —
which was their purpose."
The area was promptly eva
cuated. Sitzer started walking
away with the teacher, the one
whose wife had been on the
porch when the bomb dropped
without going off. Suddenly, "we
heard a tremendous blast, look
ed in the direction of the house,
saw the great burst of dirt fly
ing and ran helplessly, defense
lessly, not knowing where to
hide, clods of dirt falling around
us. Luckily we were not hurt.
I looked at him and saw he was
speechless, on the verge of tears,
then, finally looking at me and
saying, "I have lost all, I have
nothing."
Shun Picture Taking
U.S. helicopters airlifted the
wounded to a hospital in Korat,
Thailand. The village was aban
doned. Most of the villagers set
up temporary shelters in a dry
river bed nearby. Sitzer tried to
take pictures, but the villagers
told him to put his camera
away: "They were angry and
did not want their poverty ex
posed."
He went back to the river bed
that afternoon, taking half a
sack of rice and all the food in
his house. "We slept together,
shared our blankets and food
— and we have continued to
share for three days and nights,"
he wrote. "They were surprised
and grateful for me sharing
their misfortune — and so they
shared their feelings and fears."
"These people are still afraid
to light fires at night to warm
themselves because they are
afraid the jets will see them.
When tne jets are heard voices

are hushed and people are tight
with fear. These people will not
return to Phalane until the
bombs are removed." Eight more
bombs had exploded; two re
mained in the center of the vil
lage. The demolition experts
said it might be two weeks be
fore they could be reached and
detonated.
Met by Suspicion
Earlier in the letter Sitzer had
written:
"This was one of the most
difficult periods of my life. I
was met with suspicion, dis
trust and hatred, because the
people felt that this was my
work. They didn't understand
the nature of the mistake. All
they understood was their loss
— and that this loss was caused
by American jet bombers.
"For three days and three
nights I talked with the people,
slept with them in the forest
because of their fright, and
shared the meager food we had
for meals. It has been difficult
for me but more difficult for
them — who have lost homes,
possessions, father, wife.
"Because I have shared with
them in these last three days
of crisis, I have felt their feel
ings turn towards accepting me
where before there never was
acceptance, towards liking me
where before there was suspi
cion and towards talking with
me where before there was ac
quiescence. I am involved with
these people now and I can feel
their pulse — and finally my
own also."
Sitzer's conclusion is bitter:
"The people will survive. This
disaster has united many —
many in suffering, many in fear,
many in suspicion, home in hat
red. The people have lost their
peace and the Americans have
lost the people."
