## Otis: Debate Needed To Correct Misunderstandings 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I am greatly disappointed by
the letters in yesterday's Wed
nesday, April 12, edition of the
Stanford Daily. Not one of them
seems to have any notion of the
main things I was trying to
say.
But I don't want to let the
matter rest there, since my con
cern is, as I stated, to get if pos
sible, "specific, reasonable, tol
erant, public and reiterated de
bate" going on the campus. For
my part, I am willing to meet
publicly with Hunshinger, Deh
linger, Weiner, Swan and any
body else who wants to discuss
the issue. When such extremes
of misunderstanding can exist,
the fault probably belongs to
all of us. I, for my part, am
willing to do what I can to cor
rect it.

Editor, The Daily:
Although it is only 1967, it ap
pears that the rapid develop
ment of our complex society,
junforseen by George Orwell,
has prematurely advanced us
17 years into the future to the
time of 1984. Minds have al
ready become accustomed to
"double-thinking" so that two
entirely contradictory concepts
can be held at the same time.
The slogans of our time fore
shadow those of 1984: War is
Peace, Slavery is Freedom, and
Hate is Love.
Listen to the vast majority
of those who defend the war
in Vietnam (if we just kill a few
more of the Viet Cong, peace
will inevitably follow for all
time.), or those who defend the
draft (we grant that the draft
is authoritarian in the sense
that the decisions come from
the top down, but a little disci
pline is good for you.). It is
time to affirm that peace is
peace and that the type of peace
that follows war is subjugation
of one of the parties involved
which does not make peace, but
merely postpones more war till
a future time.
I will man the tables of the
"We Won't Go" statement Wed
nesday and Friday and welcome
debate as to how one can ration
ally hold that they are bringing
about peace by working for war.

* Beyond Dialectic
Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum, in his let
ter to the Daily, asks the people
in the peace movement to reflect
on their own moral postures and
censures us for indulging in
moral enthusiasm. He concludes
by calling for self-examination,
posing a Kantian test for the
peace movement to measure the
aggression in its own attitudes.
In April 1967, after hundreds
of thousands of deaths, and four
years of undeclared war, one
feels a kind of outrage and des
perate melancholy at thinking
through the arguments of two
years ago to give Mr. Ketchum
the replies he has a right to ex
pect. One wishes to remind him,
though, with whatever humility
one can muster, that he looks to
many of us like the old painter
in a story by Evelyn Waugh who
shut himself up for twenty years
to complete a canvas of Welling
ton meeting Joshua in Heaven,
emerged from his studio to the
world of Picasso, and died try
ing to beat down an autobus with
his umbrella.
Our moral postures, it is true,
do not appear as sweetly reason
able as they did in the days of
the teach-ins. Since then, Nor
man Morrison, a Quaker from
Boston, burned himself alive in
front of the White House, a hun
dred other young men have been
jailed for refusing the draft,
hundreds more have been jailed,
expelled or suspended from
school, beaten up or beaten down
by years of trying to arouse
other Americans to what they
regarded as an immoral and bar
barous war. I think it is import
ant for Mr. Ketchum to under
stand that if we must realize our
obligation to engage in debate at
a time when it seems to many of
us politically futile then he must
realize that many, many of us
spent a great part of our time
trying to start such a debate be
fore the American occupation of
South Vietnam had occurred in
force.
Since the assassination of
Diem and Kennedy in 1963, we
have witnessed an escalation of
acts of violence against the Viet
namese, north and south, and of
deception and outright lying to
the American people (Franz
Schurrman et. al., The Politics
of Escalation in Vietnam; Mario
Rosso, "U Thant and Vietnam:
The Untold Story," NYRB, Vol.
VII, No. 8, pp. 8-13), we have
seen government experts con
firm our understanding that the
National Liberation Front was

the only popular political faction
in South Vietnam which had
any real power (Douglas Pike,
Viet Cong 1 , MIT Press, 1966); and
we have come to feel that the
explanation for this disastrous
war does rest finally with Ameri
can imperialism, however mor
al American politicians conceive
their imperial role to be (Noam
Chomsky, "The Responsibility of
the Intellectuals," NYRB, Vol. 8,
No. 6; also between the lines of
Robert M. Heilbroner, "Is Ameri
ca Counterrevolutionary?", Com
mentary, May, 1967.)
The teach-ins failed to create
a politically significant move
ment and did not even enlist the
reasoning powers of a signifi
cant proportion of university
faculties. The peace candidates
were roundly defeated at the
polls. The movement to reform
the draft produced a newly-pack
aged version of the status-quo.
This failure may have resulted
from our deafness to the wisdom
of the men Mr. Ketchum calls
"two of our culture's greatest
teachers, Socrates and Jesus",
but I am more inclined to think
that it is because we are not able
to appeal to the economic inter
ests of the American people. We
are, as Mr. Ketchum says, caught
in our own moral postures. If
Mr. Ketchum thinks that his
"social dialectic" will replace
war or that the enclave strategy
will end it, then I invite him to
join us and suggest whatever

strategies their political imple
mentation will involve.
I confess that, at present, I
am more interested in an end to
the killing than in forging a dia
lectic, or defeating American
imperialism, but the ends are not
incompatible. In the meantime,
the people in the peace move
ment, well-informed and unin
formed, rationalists and intui
tionists, haters and lovers, will
march as they did last Saturday,
without much hope and without
much debate, because they are
disgusted and ashamed and out
raged and because their feelings
which are a response to mutila
tion and holocaust administered
as a political strategy require
them to act.

• An Apology
Editor, The Daily:
Eugene Staley, Prof, of Educa
tion, and Homer Meaders, public
relations man at SRI, both last
week disputed the veracity of
my recent article in Resistance.
Meaders was wrong: Staley was
right.
Mr. Meaders told The Daily
that I had never asked anyone
"of authority" what is being
done at SRI. As he was away at
the time, he was unaware I had
called to discover whom I should
question and had been told to
address my inquiries to the Pen
tagon. Mr. Meaders denied that
chemical weapons are being de

veloped at SRI. The answers to
the inquiries I addressed to the
Pentagon are to the contrary, as
is the SRI project report I quot
ed in my article.
I owe Prof. Staley an apology.
He was not the author of the
strategic hamlet plan as my
sources indicated. I ought to
have waited to talk with Prof.
Staley when he returned from
abroad, but bowed to the pres
sure of deadline. However, the
involvement his letter makes
public is both significant and
questionable.
Prof. Staley says that his
group "prepared estimates for
amounts and costs of military
and security forces" for the
Diem administration, a govern
ment generally conceded to have
been cruelly dictatorial.
According to Robert Scigliano
(South Vietnam: Nation Under
Stress, Boston, 1963; Scigliano
was in Vietnam from 1957-59 and
again in 1961), the agroville pro
gram involved "nothing less
than a transformation in the
whole style of rural living." It
was undertaken apparently with
out peasant participation in de
cision-making, and even the pre
viously loyal were ""unanimous
ly bitter" when they were
"asked, or in most cases, com
pelled" to change the place and
the pattern of their living.
Prof. Staley must have been
ignorant that such change was
being demand. But perhaps
the greatest mistake was to par

ticipate in decision-making in
which those affected where not
significantly represented.
I have reason to believe that
since his visit to Vietnam Prof.
Staley has been persuaded that
our support of Diem was un
fortunate. Consequently, it
seems to me of great importance
that such things as his involve

ment in Vietnam be brought to
light and analyzed, lest we re
peat ourselves. If men as sin
cerely humane as he, continue
to find themselves involved in
such programs for such govern
ments, then it is likely that we
will continue to fight such wars.

of thousands of deaths, and four
years of undeclared war, one
feels a kind of outrage and des
perate melancholy at thinking
through the arguments of two
years ago to give Mr. Ketchum
the replies he has a right to ex
pect. One wishes to remind him,
though, with whatever humility
one can muster, that he looks to
many of us like the old painter
in a story by Evelyn Waugh who
shut himself up for twenty years
to complete a canvas of Welling
ton meeting Joshua in Heaven,
emerged from his studio to the
world of Picasso, and died try
ing to beat down an autobus with
his umbrella.
Our moral postures, it is true,
do not appear as sweetly reason
able as they did in the days of
the teach-ins. Since then, Nor
man Morrison, a Quaker from
Boston, burned himself alive in
front of the White House, a hun
dred other young men have been
jailed for refusing the draft,
hundreds more have been jailed,
expelled or suspended from
school, beaten up or beaten down
by years of trying to arouse
other Americans to what they
regarded as an immoral and bar
barous war. I think it is import
ant for Mr. Ketchum to under
stand that if we must realize our
obligation to engage in debate at
a time when it seems to many of
us politically futile then he must
realize that many, many of us
spent a great part of our time
trying to start such a debate be
fore the American occupation of
South Vietnam had occurred in
force.
Since the assassination of
Diem and Kennedy in 1963, we
have witnessed an escalation of
acts of violence against the Viet
namese, north and south, and of
deception and outright lying to
the American people (Franz
Schurrman et. al., The Politics
of Escalation in Vietnam; Mario
Rosso, "U Thant and Vietnam:
The Untold Story," NYRB, Vol.
VII, No. 8, pp. 8-13), we have
seen government experts con
firm our understanding that the
National Liberation Front was

the only popular political faction
in South Vietnam which had
any real power (Douglas Pike,
Viet Cong 1 , MIT Press, 1966); and
we have come to feel that the
explanation for this disastrous
war does rest finally with Ameri
can imperialism, however mor
al American politicians conceive
their imperial role to be (Noam
Chomsky, "The Responsibility of
the Intellectuals," NYRB, Vol. 8,
No. 6; also between the lines of
Robert M. Heilbroner, "Is Ameri
ca Counterrevolutionary?", Com
mentary, May, 1967.)
The teach-ins failed to create
a politically significant move
ment and did not even enlist the
reasoning powers of a signifi
cant proportion of university
faculties. The peace candidates
were roundly defeated at the
polls. The movement to reform
the draft produced a newly-pack
aged version of the status-quo.
This failure may have resulted
from our deafness to the wisdom
of the men Mr. Ketchum calls
"two of our culture's greatest
teachers, Socrates and Jesus",
but I am more inclined to think
that it is because we are not able
to appeal to the economic inter
ests of the American people. We
are, as Mr. Ketchum says, caught
in our own moral postures. If
Mr. Ketchum thinks that his
"social dialectic" will replace
war or that the enclave strategy
will end it, then I invite him to
join us and suggest whatever

strategies their political imple
mentation will involve.
I confess that, at present, I
am more interested in an end to
the killing than in forging a dia
lectic, or defeating American
imperialism, but the ends are not
incompatible. In the meantime,
the people in the peace move
ment, well-informed and unin
formed, rationalists and intui
tionists, haters and lovers, will
march as they did last Saturday,
without much hope and without
much debate, because they are
disgusted and ashamed and out
raged and because their feelings
which are a response to mutila
tion and holocaust administered
as a political strategy require
them to act.

• An Apology
Editor, The Daily:
Eugene Staley, Prof, of Educa
tion, and Homer Meaders, public
relations man at SRI, both last
week disputed the veracity of
my recent article in Resistance.
Meaders was wrong: Staley was
right.
Mr. Meaders told The Daily
that I had never asked anyone
"of authority" what is being
done at SRI. As he was away at
the time, he was unaware I had
called to discover whom I should
question and had been told to
address my inquiries to the Pen
tagon. Mr. Meaders denied that
chemical weapons are being de

veloped at SRI. The answers to
the inquiries I addressed to the
Pentagon are to the contrary, as
is the SRI project report I quot
ed in my article.
I owe Prof. Staley an apology.
He was not the author of the
strategic hamlet plan as my
sources indicated. I ought to
have waited to talk with Prof.
Staley when he returned from
abroad, but bowed to the pres
sure of deadline. However, the
involvement his letter makes
public is both significant and
questionable.
Prof. Staley says that his
group "prepared estimates for
amounts and costs of military
and security forces" for the
Diem administration, a govern
ment generally conceded to have
been cruelly dictatorial.
According to Robert Scigliano
(South Vietnam: Nation Under
Stress, Boston, 1963; Scigliano
was in Vietnam from 1957-59 and
again in 1961), the agroville pro
gram involved "nothing less
than a transformation in the
whole style of rural living." It
was undertaken apparently with
out peasant participation in de
cision-making, and even the pre
viously loyal were ""unanimous
ly bitter" when they were
"asked, or in most cases, com
pelled" to change the place and
the pattern of their living.
Prof. Staley must have been
ignorant that such change was
being demand. But perhaps
the greatest mistake was to par

ticipate in decision-making in
which those affected where not
significantly represented.
I have reason to believe that
since his visit to Vietnam Prof.
Staley has been persuaded that
our support of Diem was un
fortunate. Consequently, it
seems to me of great importance
that such things as his involve

ment in Vietnam be brought to
light and analyzed, lest we re
peat ourselves. If men as sin
cerely humane as he, continue
to find themselves involved in
such programs for such govern
ments, then it is likely that we
will continue to fight such wars.

faculties. The peace candidates
were roundly defeated at the
polls. The movement to reform
the draft produced a newly-pack
aged version of the status-quo.
This failure may have resulted
from our deafness to the wisdom
of the men Mr. Ketchum calls
"two of our culture's greatest
teachers, Socrates and Jesus",
but I am more inclined to think
that it is because we are not able
to appeal to the economic inter
ests of the American people. We
are, as Mr. Ketchum says, caught
in our own moral postures. If
Mr. Ketchum thinks that his
"social dialectic" will replace
war or that the enclave strategy
will end it, then I invite him to
join us and suggest whatever

strategies their political imple
mentation will involve.
I confess that, at present, I
am more interested in an end to
the killing than in forging a dia
lectic, or defeating American
imperialism, but the ends are not
incompatible. In the meantime,
the people in the peace move
ment, well-informed and unin
formed, rationalists and intui
tionists, haters and lovers, will
march as they did last Saturday,
without much hope and without
much debate, because they are
disgusted and ashamed and out
raged and because their feelings
which are a response to mutila
tion and holocaust administered
as a political strategy require
them to act.

• An Apology
Editor, The Daily:
Eugene Staley, Prof, of Educa
tion, and Homer Meaders, public
relations man at SRI, both last
week disputed the veracity of
my recent article in Resistance.
Meaders was wrong: Staley was
right.
Mr. Meaders told The Daily
that I had never asked anyone
"of authority" what is being
done at SRI. As he was away at
the time, he was unaware I had
called to discover whom I should
question and had been told to
address my inquiries to the Pen
tagon. Mr. Meaders denied that
chemical weapons are being de

veloped at SRI. The answers to
the inquiries I addressed to the
Pentagon are to the contrary, as
is the SRI project report I quot
ed in my article.
I owe Prof. Staley an apology.
He was not the author of the
strategic hamlet plan as my
sources indicated. I ought to
have waited to talk with Prof.
Staley when he returned from
abroad, but bowed to the pres
sure of deadline. However, the
involvement his letter makes
public is both significant and
questionable.
Prof. Staley says that his
group "prepared estimates for
amounts and costs of military
and security forces" for the
Diem administration, a govern
ment generally conceded to have
been cruelly dictatorial.
According to Robert Scigliano
(South Vietnam: Nation Under
Stress, Boston, 1963; Scigliano
was in Vietnam from 1957-59 and
again in 1961), the agroville pro
gram involved "nothing less
than a transformation in the
whole style of rural living." It
was undertaken apparently with
out peasant participation in de
cision-making, and even the pre
viously loyal were ""unanimous
ly bitter" when they were
"asked, or in most cases, com
pelled" to change the place and
the pattern of their living.
Prof. Staley must have been
ignorant that such change was
being demand. But perhaps
the greatest mistake was to par

ticipate in decision-making in
which those affected where not
significantly represented.
I have reason to believe that
since his visit to Vietnam Prof.
Staley has been persuaded that
our support of Diem was un
fortunate. Consequently, it
seems to me of great importance
that such things as his involve

ment in Vietnam be brought to
light and analyzed, lest we re
peat ourselves. If men as sin
cerely humane as he, continue
to find themselves involved in
such programs for such govern
ments, then it is likely that we
will continue to fight such wars.

* Beyond Dialectic
Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum, in his let
ter to the Daily, asks the people
in the peace movement to reflect
on their own moral postures and
censures us for indulging in
moral enthusiasm. He concludes
by calling for self-examination,
posing a Kantian test for the
peace movement to measure the
aggression in its own attitudes.
In April 1967, after hundreds
of thousands of deaths, and four
years of undeclared war, one
feels a kind of outrage and des
perate melancholy at thinking
through the arguments of two
years ago to give Mr. Ketchum
the replies he has a right to ex
pect. One wishes to remind him,
though, with whatever humility
one can muster, that he looks to
many of us like the old painter
in a story by Evelyn Waugh who
shut himself up for twenty years
to complete a canvas of Welling
ton meeting Joshua in Heaven,
emerged from his studio to the
world of Picasso, and died try
ing to beat down an autobus with
his umbrella.
Our moral postures, it is true,
do not appear as sweetly reason
able as they did in the days of
the teach-ins. Since then, Nor
man Morrison, a Quaker from
Boston, burned himself alive in
front of the White House, a hun
dred other young men have been
jailed for refusing the draft,
hundreds more have been jailed,
expelled or suspended from
school, beaten up or beaten down
by years of trying to arouse
other Americans to what they
regarded as an immoral and bar
barous war. I think it is import
ant for Mr. Ketchum to under
stand that if we must realize our
obligation to engage in debate at
a time when it seems to many of
us politically futile then he must
realize that many, many of us
spent a great part of our time
trying to start such a debate be
fore the American occupation of
South Vietnam had occurred in
force.
Since the assassination of
Diem and Kennedy in 1963, we
have witnessed an escalation of
acts of violence against the Viet
namese, north and south, and of
deception and outright lying to
the American people (Franz
Schurrman et. al., The Politics
of Escalation in Vietnam; Mario
Rosso, "U Thant and Vietnam:
The Untold Story," NYRB, Vol.
VII, No. 8, pp. 8-13), we have
seen government experts con
firm our understanding that the
National Liberation Front was

the only popular political faction
in South Vietnam which had
any real power (Douglas Pike,
Viet Cong 1 , MIT Press, 1966); and
we have come to feel that the
explanation for this disastrous
war does rest finally with Ameri
can imperialism, however mor
al American politicians conceive
their imperial role to be (Noam
Chomsky, "The Responsibility of
the Intellectuals," NYRB, Vol. 8,
No. 6; also between the lines of
Robert M. Heilbroner, "Is Ameri
ca Counterrevolutionary?", Com
mentary, May, 1967.)
The teach-ins failed to create
a politically significant move
ment and did not even enlist the

Stress, Boston, 1963; Scigliano
was in Vietnam from 1957-59 and
again in 1961), the agroville pro
gram involved "nothing less
than a transformation in the
whole style of rural living." It
was undertaken apparently with
out peasant participation in de
cision-making, and even the pre
viously loyal were ""unanimous
ly bitter" when they were
"asked, or in most cases, com
pelled" to change the place and
the pattern of their living.
Prof. Staley must have been
ignorant that such change was
being demand. But perhaps
the greatest mistake was to par

ticipate in decision-making in
which those affected where not
significantly represented.
I have reason to believe that
since his visit to Vietnam Prof.
Staley has been persuaded that
our support of Diem was un
fortunate. Consequently, it
seems to me of great importance
that such things as his involve

ment in Vietnam be brought to
light and analyzed, lest we re
peat ourselves. If men as sin
cerely humane as he, continue
to find themselves involved in
such programs for such govern
ments, then it is likely that we
will continue to fight such wars.

* Beyond Dialectic
Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum, in his let
ter to the Daily, asks the people
in the peace movement to reflect
on their own moral postures and
censures us for indulging in
moral enthusiasm. He concludes
by calling for self-examination,
posing a Kantian test for the
peace movement to measure the
aggression in its own attitudes.
In April 1967, after hundreds
of thousands of deaths, and four
years of undeclared war, one
feels a kind of outrage and des
perate melancholy at thinking
through the arguments of two
years ago to give Mr. Ketchum
the replies he has a right to ex
pect. One wishes to remind him,
though, with whatever humility
one can muster, that he looks to
many of us like the old painter
in a story by Evelyn Waugh who
shut himself up for twenty years
to complete a canvas of Welling
ton meeting Joshua in Heaven,
emerged from his studio to the
world of Picasso, and died try
ing to beat down an autobus with
his umbrella.
Our moral postures, it is true,
do not appear as sweetly reason
able as they did in the days of
the teach-ins. Since then, Nor
man Morrison, a Quaker from
Boston, burned himself alive in
front of the White House, a hun
dred other young men have been
jailed for refusing the draft,
hundreds more have been jailed,
expelled or suspended from
school, beaten up or beaten down
by years of trying to arouse
other Americans to what they
regarded as an immoral and bar
barous war. I think it is import
ant for Mr. Ketchum to under
stand that if we must realize our
obligation to engage in debate at
a time when it seems to many of
us politically futile then he must
realize that many, many of us
spent a great part of our time
trying to start such a debate be
fore the American occupation of
South Vietnam had occurred in
force.
Since the assassination of
Diem and Kennedy in 1963, we
have witnessed an escalation of
acts of violence against the Viet
namese, north and south, and of
deception and outright lying to
the American people (Franz
Schurrman et. al., The Politics
of Escalation in Vietnam; Mario
Rosso, "U Thant and Vietnam:
The Untold Story," NYRB, Vol.
VII, No. 8, pp. 8-13), we have
seen government experts con
firm our understanding that the
National Liberation Front was

the only popular political faction
in South Vietnam which had
any real power (Douglas Pike,
Viet Cong 1 , MIT Press, 1966); and
we have come to feel that the
explanation for this disastrous
war does rest finally with Ameri
can imperialism, however mor
al American politicians conceive
their imperial role to be (Noam
Chomsky, "The Responsibility of
the Intellectuals," NYRB, Vol. 8,
No. 6; also between the lines of
Robert M. Heilbroner, "Is Ameri
ca Counterrevolutionary?", Com
mentary, May, 1967.)
The teach-ins failed to create
a politically significant move
ment and did not even enlist the
reasoning powers of a signifi
cant proportion of university
faculties. The peace candidates
were roundly defeated at the
polls. The movement to reform
the draft produced a newly-pack
aged version of the status-quo.
This failure may have resulted
from our deafness to the wisdom
of the men Mr. Ketchum calls
"two of our culture's greatest
teachers, Socrates and Jesus",
but I am more inclined to think
that it is because we are not able
to appeal to the economic inter
ests of the American people. We
are, as Mr. Ketchum says, caught
in our own moral postures. If
Mr. Ketchum thinks that his
"social dialectic" will replace
war or that the enclave strategy
will end it, then I invite him to
join us and suggest whatever

strategies their political imple
mentation will involve.
I confess that, at present, I
am more interested in an end to
the killing than in forging a dia
lectic, or defeating American
imperialism, but the ends are not
incompatible. In the meantime,
the people in the peace move
ment, well-informed and unin
formed, rationalists and intui
tionists, haters and lovers, will
march as they did last Saturday,
without much hope and without
much debate, because they are
disgusted and ashamed and out
raged and because their feelings
which are a response to mutila
tion and holocaust administered
as a political strategy require
them to act.

• An Apology
Editor, The Daily:
Eugene Staley, Prof, of Educa
tion, and Homer Meaders, public
relations man at SRI, both last
week disputed the veracity of
my recent article in Resistance.
Meaders was wrong: Staley was
right.
Mr. Meaders told The Daily
that I had never asked anyone
"of authority" what is being
done at SRI. As he was away at
the time, he was unaware I had
called to discover whom I should
question and had been told to
address my inquiries to the Pen
tagon. Mr. Meaders denied that
chemical weapons are being de

veloped at SRI. The answers to
the inquiries I addressed to the
Pentagon are to the contrary, as
is the SRI project report I quot
ed in my article.
I owe Prof. Staley an apology.
He was not the author of the
strategic hamlet plan as my
sources indicated. I ought to
have waited to talk with Prof.
Staley when he returned from
abroad, but bowed to the pres
sure of deadline. However, the
involvement his letter makes
public is both significant and
questionable.
Prof. Staley says that his
group "prepared estimates for
amounts and costs of military
and security forces" for the
Diem administration, a govern
ment generally conceded to have
been cruelly dictatorial.
According to Robert Scigliano
(South Vietnam: Nation Under

in Vietnam (if we just kill a few
more of the Viet Cong, peace
will inevitably follow for all
time.), or those who defend the
draft (we grant that the draft
is authoritarian in the sense
that the decisions come from
the top down, but a little disci
pline is good for you.). It is
time to affirm that peace is
peace and that the type of peace
that follows war is subjugation
of one of the parties involved
which does not make peace, but
merely postpones more war till
a future time.
I will man the tables of the
"We Won't Go" statement Wed
nesday and Friday and welcome
debate as to how one can ration
ally hold that they are bringing
about peace by working for war.

* Beyond Dialectic
Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum, in his let
ter to the Daily, asks the people
in the peace movement to reflect
on their own moral postures and
censures us for indulging in
moral enthusiasm. He concludes
by calling for self-examination,
posing a Kantian test for the
peace movement to measure the
aggression in its own attitudes.
In April 1967, after hundreds
of thousands of deaths, and four
years of undeclared war, one
feels a kind of outrage and des
perate melancholy at thinking
through the arguments of two
years ago to give Mr. Ketchum
the replies he has a right to ex
pect. One wishes to remind him,
though, with whatever humility
one can muster, that he looks to
many of us like the old painter
in a story by Evelyn Waugh who
shut himself up for twenty years
to complete a canvas of Welling
ton meeting Joshua in Heaven,
emerged from his studio to the
world of Picasso, and died try
ing to beat down an autobus with
his umbrella.
Our moral postures, it is true,
do not appear as sweetly reason
able as they did in the days of
the teach-ins. Since then, Nor
man Morrison, a Quaker from
Boston, burned himself alive in
front of the White House, a hun
dred other young men have been
jailed for refusing the draft,
hundreds more have been jailed,
expelled or suspended from
school, beaten up or beaten down
by years of trying to arouse
other Americans to what they
regarded as an immoral and bar
barous war. I think it is import
ant for Mr. Ketchum to under
stand that if we must realize our
obligation to engage in debate at
a time when it seems to many of
us politically futile then he must
realize that many, many of us
spent a great part of our time
trying to start such a debate be
fore the American occupation of
South Vietnam had occurred in
force.
Since the assassination of
Diem and Kennedy in 1963, we
have witnessed an escalation of
acts of violence against the Viet
namese, north and south, and of
deception and outright lying to
the American people (Franz
Schurrman et. al., The Politics
of Escalation in Vietnam; Mario
Rosso, "U Thant and Vietnam:
The Untold Story," NYRB, Vol.
VII, No. 8, pp. 8-13), we have
seen government experts con
firm our understanding that the
National Liberation Front was

the only popular political faction
in South Vietnam which had
any real power (Douglas Pike,
Viet Cong 1 , MIT Press, 1966); and
we have come to feel that the
explanation for this disastrous
war does rest finally with Ameri
can imperialism, however mor
al American politicians conceive
their imperial role to be (Noam
Chomsky, "The Responsibility of
the Intellectuals," NYRB, Vol. 8,
No. 6; also between the lines of
Robert M. Heilbroner, "Is Ameri
ca Counterrevolutionary?", Com
mentary, May, 1967.)
The teach-ins failed to create
a politically significant move
ment and did not even enlist the
reasoning powers of a signifi
cant proportion of university
faculties. The peace candidates
were roundly defeated at the
polls. The movement to reform
the draft produced a newly-pack
aged version of the status-quo.
This failure may have resulted
from our deafness to the wisdom
of the men Mr. Ketchum calls
"two of our culture's greatest
teachers, Socrates and Jesus",
but I am more inclined to think
that it is because we are not able
to appeal to the economic inter
ests of the American people. We
are, as Mr. Ketchum says, caught
in our own moral postures. If
Mr. Ketchum thinks that his
"social dialectic" will replace
war or that the enclave strategy
will end it, then I invite him to
join us and suggest whatever

strategies their political imple
mentation will involve.
I confess that, at present, I
am more interested in an end to
the killing than in forging a dia
lectic, or defeating American
imperialism, but the ends are not
incompatible. In the meantime,
the people in the peace move
ment, well-informed and unin
formed, rationalists and intui
tionists, haters and lovers, will
march as they did last Saturday,
without much hope and without
much debate, because they are
disgusted and ashamed and out
raged and because their feelings
which are a response to mutila
tion and holocaust administered
as a political strategy require
them to act.

• An Apology
Editor, The Daily:
Eugene Staley, Prof, of Educa
tion, and Homer Meaders, public
relations man at SRI, both last
week disputed the veracity of
my recent article in Resistance.
Meaders was wrong: Staley was
right.
Mr. Meaders told The Daily
that I had never asked anyone
"of authority" what is being
done at SRI. As he was away at
the time, he was unaware I had
called to discover whom I should
question and had been told to
address my inquiries to the Pen
tagon. Mr. Meaders denied that
chemical weapons are being de

veloped at SRI. The answers to
the inquiries I addressed to the
Pentagon are to the contrary, as
is the SRI project report I quot
ed in my article.
I owe Prof. Staley an apology.
He was not the author of the
strategic hamlet plan as my
sources indicated. I ought to
have waited to talk with Prof.
Staley when he returned from
abroad, but bowed to the pres
sure of deadline. However, the
involvement his letter makes
public is both significant and
questionable.
Prof. Staley says that his
group "prepared estimates for
amounts and costs of military
and security forces" for the
Diem administration, a govern
ment generally conceded to have
been cruelly dictatorial.
According to Robert Scigliano
(South Vietnam: Nation Under
Stress, Boston, 1963; Scigliano
was in Vietnam from 1957-59 and
again in 1961), the agroville pro
gram involved "nothing less
than a transformation in the
whole style of rural living." It
was undertaken apparently with
out peasant participation in de
cision-making, and even the pre
viously loyal were ""unanimous
ly bitter" when they were
"asked, or in most cases, com
pelled" to change the place and
the pattern of their living.
Prof. Staley must have been
ignorant that such change was
being demand. But perhaps
the greatest mistake was to par

ticipate in decision-making in
which those affected where not
significantly represented.
I have reason to believe that
since his visit to Vietnam Prof.
Staley has been persuaded that
our support of Diem was un
fortunate. Consequently, it
seems to me of great importance
that such things as his involve

ment in Vietnam be brought to
light and analyzed, lest we re
peat ourselves. If men as sin
cerely humane as he, continue
to find themselves involved in
such programs for such govern
ments, then it is likely that we
will continue to fight such wars.

Editor, The Daily:
I am greatly disappointed by
the letters in yesterday's Wed
nesday, April 12, edition of the
Stanford Daily. Not one of them
seems to have any notion of the
main things I was trying to
say.
But I don't want to let the
matter rest there, since my con
cern is, as I stated, to get if pos
sible, "specific, reasonable, tol
erant, public and reiterated de
bate" going on the campus. For
my part, I am willing to meet
publicly with Hunshinger, Deh
linger, Weiner, Swan and any
body else who wants to discuss
the issue. When such extremes
of misunderstanding can exist,
the fault probably belongs to
all of us. I, for my part, am
willing to do what I can to cor
rect it.

• Debate Offer
Editor, The Daily:
Although it is only 1967, it ap
pears that the rapid develop
ment of our complex society,
junforseen by George Orwell,
has prematurely advanced us
17 years into the future to the
time of 1984. Minds have al
ready become accustomed to
"double-thinking" so that two
entirely contradictory concepts
can be held at the same time.
The slogans of our time fore
shadow those of 1984: War is
Peace, Slavery is Freedom, and
Hate is Love.
Listen to the vast majority
of those who defend the war
in Vietnam (if we just kill a few
more of the Viet Cong, peace
will inevitably follow for all
time.), or those who defend the
draft (we grant that the draft
is authoritarian in the sense
that the decisions come from
the top down, but a little disci
pline is good for you.). It is
