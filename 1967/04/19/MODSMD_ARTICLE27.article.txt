# Logical Extension
## 
### 
Last week's extension of pass-fail grading to
include entire courses at the discretion of the
professor was described by one member of the
Registrar's Advisory Committee as a "logical
extension" of the system introduced earlier this
year. This decision to broaden pass-fail was a
wise one and the University is to be commended
for aiming its approach to grades in the right
direction.
We trust, however, that this is just a first step
toward total re-evaluation of the concept of
grading. In an institution like Stanford, it is no
longer unrealistic to consider that the present
system may be inconsistent with the educational
aims of the University.
One cannot help but ask the same question:
who are grades for? And the answer inevitably
is: graduate schools, draft boards, professors
who find no other way to excite their students,
and students who are not interested in their
studies.
If grades are necessary for graduate schools,
then one of the purposes of a university is to
weed out students for graduate schools. Instead,
it seems the undergraduate college should con
centrate on providing the best possible educa
tion for its members, in the hope that perhaps
all who want to attend a graduate school may
do so because their undergraduate career has
prepared them adequately. The sorting process
should be left to the graduate schools, partic
ularly since they already rely on many other
criteria for selection. It is inconceivable that this
process could not be carried out just as well with
out having to depend on statistics so often based
on the whims of section leaders or the rigid
mathematics of a professor's curve.
The absence of a grading system would pro
vide an exceptional challenge for both professors
and students. One can only begin to speculate
on the effort some professors would have to make
just to keep students in their courses. But for
professors who already provide more incentive
than a possible A, the absence of grading would
create a new spirit in the classroom: students
would be able to share with the professor an en

joyment for the course material without an exag
gerated concern for computerized acknowleg
ment of their work.
The elimination of grades would encourage
students to approach their education with a
different attitude. Paul Goodman best expresses
this when he writes that "for the students, it
seems that a primary duty of the university is
to deprive them of their props, their dependence
on extrinsic motivation and valuation, and to
force them to confront the difficult enterprise
itself and finally lose themselves in it." The ab
sence of grades would also force them to rely
on their own self-awareness to determine the
results of their work.
To suggest that grades immediately be abol
ished at Stanford would be absurd, not because
the idea lacks merit, but because of the inertia
of the status quo. A realistic proposal, however,
would be that the University seriously consider
further "logical extension" of pass-fail to general
studies requirements and major courses. The
same arguments apply which are offered in favor
of the present pass-fail system, namely that it
encourages people to pursue individual interests,
that the burden of education is shifted to the
students, that grades do not measure what a
student derives from a course, and that learning
is fostered for learning's sake. Even within a
major or within the general studies requirements
there are courses which are more challenging
than others, but which students do not take,
simply because they fear the possibility of lower
ing their grade point average. And to suggest
that students would not be forced to learn
enough in these courses if they did not receive
a letter grade is either a reflection on the courses
and the fact that they are required or it is an
admission that Stanford is not really the institu
tion of higher learning it claims to be.
Not any university can establish a complete
pass-fail system and have it function success
fully. But Stanford, given it allegedly elite stu
dent body and its interest in educational inno
vation, should accept the challenge to demon
strate that it really is working toward academic
excellence.
