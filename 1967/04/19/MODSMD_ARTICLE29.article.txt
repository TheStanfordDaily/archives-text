## Stanford, Vietnam: To Each His Own 
### 
Edityr, The Daily:
As much as I applaud your
editorial "Shock Treatment" in
Thursday's Daily, I must take
exception to one item. You state
that "... a university com
posed of a large number of stu
dents, faculty, and staff in dis
agreement with the present U.S.
foreign policy should not have
any connection at all with the
production of war materials."
This makes about as much
sense and is as justified as my
saying that a university com
posed of a large number of stu
dents, faculty, and staff who
support the present U.S. foreign
policy is obligated to the produc
tion of war materials. Sincere
in its opposition to the war as
your "large number" might be,
they have absolutely no right to
direct the thinking OR the work
of those who disagree with
them. This "large group", al
though not as vocal as yours,
does exist — who is doing this
horrendous amount of immoral
work if not "a large number of
students, faculty, and staff,
who, for one reason or another,
feel that their work is necessary
and important?

Editor, The Daily:
America's emphasis on mili
tary strength to solve foreign
problems is destroying more
than the lives of the Americans
and Vietnamese in Vietnam. It is
causing the slow, steady brutal
ization of the American people.
With little or no thought we can
sit down to eat dinner in front
of our television sets and watch
Americans drop napalm on
small villages "suspected of har
boring Viet Cong," spray poi
sons on rice crops and forests,
and uproot hundreds of thou
sands of peasants on "sweep and
destroy" and "scorched earth"
operations. Or if we wish, we
are able to take our children
to a museum in New Mexico
where they can play with the
shells of atomic and hydrogen
bombs. In the Sunday, April 9,
San Francisco Examiner's "Cali
fornia Living" section the cover
photograph showed a child
climbing over an atomic bomb
that is on display at the Los
Alamos Scientific Museum. It is
a replica of the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima on Aug
ust 6, 1945, killing 78,150 and in
juring 37,425. A model of the
bomb dropped on Nagasaki, also
on display, is described as "the
favorite of young bomb climb
ers." There were 198,000 inhabi
tants in Nagasaki when that
bomb was dropped.
How has it come to be that
weapons which killed over a
100,000 human beings are now
used as play things for our
children? How would we feel if
the German government opened
a museum so that German chil
dren could climb over and play
with the gas ovens that killed
millions of Jews?

Editor, The Daily:
Advancement of science and
civilization has brought forth a
very pertinent question for the
first time, viz.,—ls it possible to
overcome ideological and social
differences and provide a better
understanding among human
beings at an international level?
Is it possible to eliminate prej
udices and see objectively?
The possibility of interaction
of ideas is opened to us through
travel and through literature. It
seems quite paradoxical that we
are still unable to strip reli
gions of their dogmas and find a
common base which is satisfac
tory to most and not to a select
few. We tend to be intolerant
towards the beliefs of others no
matter how rich, but tolerate

our own misconceptions. Why?
Can't we wipe out this intoler
ance and hatred by interacting
with the viewpoint of others?
We have on the Stanford cam
pus people of all religious per
suasions and beliefs. It is there
fore proposed to arrange a
meeting where all can share
their views. Instead of criticiz
ing, we can contribute to a more
universal base of understanding.
Here people could bring forth
ideas which impress them most,
not to convince others of their
supremacy, but to enrich their
thoughts. A broader meaning
could be understood through
learning devotional songs of
various religions and their sig
nificance, the endeavor being to
bring people together instead of
throwing them apart.

• Prisons Vs. Zoos?
Editor, The Daily:
I was particularly pleased
with your editorial about Stern
Hall. You managed to attack an
existing ill, the Stern situation,
and still get in another crack
against fraternities in general;
Phi Delts in particular. Don't
you guys ever get tired of writ
ing about us? It's nice to make
the paper, but this is getting
ridiculous.
Since we have no practical
way of defending ourselves
from your stilted journalism, we
too can only sit back and read
the endless barrage of criticism.
It just hurts us a little bit more.
Getting back to the Stern sit
uation, you fail to realize that
university grants were subsi
dized by large alumni donations
when the fraternity clusters
were built. Thus, these "palaces"
were built because of alumni
and administration co-ordination.
Maybe if all the proud Stern
alumni would get together, they
too could afford their present day
counterparts a better lot. I've
noticed little such action, how
ever. It looks then, as if these
academic independents surely
are destined to "cell-block" ex
istence, while the animals can
roam free in their cluster man
sions. Maybe there's something
in this group living after all.

• Closed-minded?
Editor, The Daily:
The Monday editorial concern
ing the Experiment, while inter
nally logical and consistent, ex
hibits the same atti
tude as does the Experiment it
self. Both deny the rationality of
their opponents; both preclude
the possibility of discussing the
principles which they oppose.
Barry Greenberg was quoted
in Friday's Daily: " 'We have
no hope of changing these men's
minds. . . . '"
The Daily editorial states that
the Experiment "seems to have
developed a certain close-mind
edness. ..."
Implicit in both of these state
ments is a pessimistic argument
ad hominem, a pre-judgment of
the other side's unwillingness
to listen to reason. Certainly,
the political opinions expressed
by the Experiment are one
sided, but we can hardly expect
a homogeneous group to argue
against its own point of view.
On the other hand, Barry Green
berg has invited Conservatives
to express their opinions in Re
sistance. We cannot judge the
Experiment as close-minded un
less we prove that this invita
tion is insincere. We must not
preclude the possibility of con
structive discussion by talking
only to ourselves.

• Who's Accusing?
Editor, The Dally:
In criticism of the "We Ac
cuse" posters, many have argued
that to claim that six men alone
are guilty for the War in Viet
nam is simplistic and absurd.
As one who was involved in the
production of the posters, I
agree. This was not our intent.
These men are merely examples

of those that we accuse. They
are men in power, and their
power supports the war. The is
sue is not that these men want
the war. They don't. The fact
that some profit from the war
is not the main issue. Motive
should not be our main concern.
Effect should.
The effect of the complicity of
these and other men in the war
is oppression, suffering, and
death. These issues were treated
and are being treated emotion
ally because they are emotional
problems. Oppression and suf
fering are not questions of logic.
A man who is not emotionally
concerned with the Vietnam
War —on either side—has aban
doned morality.
The intent of the posters, how
ever, was not to crucify these
men. It was to indicate, in a
limited way, the forces that lead
us into war and keep us at war.
Too many people regard war as
an accident, a mistake, or the
work of a few men in govern
ment. This is naive. In Resis
tance we have attempted to pre
sent an analysis of the military'
industrial complex and have
tried to outline how Stanford is
being used as a tool in the war
machine. We cannot say, and
don't say, exactly who is re
sponsible for the war. But we do
say that these men, their col
leagues, and the University arc
guilty of complicity in the war.
Indeed, we are all guilty unless
we dedicate ourselves to fight
ing the war.
It is sad that many who con
demn our temporary abandon
ment of a "rational approach"
have not read the research pub
lished in Resistance.
It is a damned shame that
those who condemn our tactics
and tell us how to stop the war
do nothing themselves.
