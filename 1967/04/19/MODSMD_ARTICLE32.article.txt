# Out Of The Blue
## Athletics In The University: Hutchins Missed The Point 
### Wells Shoemaker 
Robert Hutchins' reprinted
guest column "College Athletics:
Matter of Education" in Mon
day's Daily demonstrates a lack
of rationality and vision hardly
becoming an educator of such
renown.
After a tirade against the Chi
cago Tribune for its stand on the
firing of the Illinois coaches,
Hutchins proceeds to throw out
a few sarcastic insinuations
about "gladiatorial combat" and
an unsupported statement that
the American university is "at
present an outmoded art form."
Hutchins finally makes it to
the meat of his article when he
states that "intercollegiate ath
letics cannot be the purpose or
even a purpose of a university."
The Purpose?
The purpose of a university,
a rather dangerous term to de
fine, has never to my knowledge
been claimed to be athletics. Ath
letics are, however, an integral
part of American culture,
whether or not that suits Mr.
Hutchins.
Sport is the great American
pastime, both in active partici
pation and spectatorship. To
eliminate athletics as a purpose
of a university is to close one's
eyes on an established part of
our environment. Such 'make
believe it's not there and maybe
it will go away' tactics can hard
ly suit a broadminded intellect
ual community.
Hutchins goes on to say, con
descendingly, "Sport is a fine
thing. So is education. But they

are not the same, and only in
America have they been re
garded as identical."
Who Says 'Identical'?
No fool would say that educa
tion and sport are identical. How
ever, it requires an extraordin
arily narrow mind to say they
are mutually exclusive proposi
tions. Success in one realm does
not in the least mean dismal
failure in the other.
Stanford's swimming team,
while on its way to the national
collegiate championship, com
piled a GPA well over three
point. While that is only one ex
ample, it is by no means unique
at Stanford or anywhere else.
To succeed in both athletics
and academics requires a num
ber of sacrifices that obviously
some choose not to make. It may
not suit the intellectual purpose,
whatever that is, to give up
something one might ordinarily
enjoy doing.
Dedication and Discipline
However, the dedication and
discipline acquired in setting
goals for oneself and striving
toward their accomplishment,
perhaps to the elimination of
several smaller pleasures, are
valuable now and will become
ever more so in that misty
realm outside the University.
Hutchins seeks to widen his
supposed rift between achieve
ment in athletics and accomplish
ment in academics when he
points out that "The require
ments for success in one are
quite different from the require-

ments in the other."
It is certainly true that an
athlete cannot broadjump on his
cerebral cortex, and a scholar
cannot absorb much philosophy
via a taut hamstring.
Common Requirement
The basic requirement for sue
cess in either area, however, is
common to both. It is a mental
drive—courage, perseverance,
pick your favorite term. Har
nessed, trained, and cultured
through demanding competition
either physical or scholastic, this
drive flows with surprising
into one's outlook to
ward all of his endeavors.
The phenomenon of athletic
academic complementation is, not
universal, but it is widespread,
and its very existence invalidates
Hutchins' thesis.
Hutchins nears the end of his
article with the dubious proposi
tion that, because a basketball
coach offers scholarships to tali
and skillful young men, the
coach is necessarily proclaiming,
"You can't afford to attend this
University unless you are 6Vfe
feet tall."
Hutchins' sideways attack on
athletics in general follows a pat
tern not foreign to the noble LA
Times and our favorite SF
Chronicle. The logic flaws in his
arguments, the aloof sarcasm of
his insinuation, and his cute
pseudoiniellectual approach to
the problem occlude the several
valid points he could have made
about professionalism in col
legiate athletics.

Robert Hutchins' reprinted
guest column "College Athletics:
Matter of Education" in Mon
day's Daily demonstrates a lack
of rationality and vision hardly
becoming an educator of such
renown.
After a tirade against the Chi
cago Tribune for its stand on the
firing of the Illinois coaches,
Hutchins proceeds to throw out
a few sarcastic insinuations
about "gladiatorial combat" and
an unsupported statement that
the American university is "at
present an outmoded art form."
Hutchins finally makes it to
the meat of his article when he
states that "intercollegiate ath
letics cannot be the purpose or
even a purpose of a university."
The Purpose?
The purpose of a university,
a rather dangerous term to de
fine, has never to my knowledge
been claimed to be athletics. Ath
letics are, however, an integral
part of American culture,
whether or not that suits Mr.
Hutchins.
Sport is the great American
pastime, both in active partici
pation and spectatorship. To
eliminate athletics as a purpose
of a university is to close one's
eyes on an established part of
our environment. Such 'make
believe it's not there and maybe
it will go away' tactics can hard
ly suit a broadminded intellect
ual community.
Hutchins goes on to say, con
descendingly, "Sport is a fine
thing. So is education. But they

are not the same, and only in
America have they been re
garded as identical."
Who Says 'Identical'?
No fool would say that educa
tion and sport are identical. How
ever, it requires an extraordin
arily narrow mind to say they
are mutually exclusive proposi
tions. Success in one realm does
not in the least mean dismal
failure in the other.
Stanford's swimming team,
while on its way to the national
collegiate championship, com
piled a GPA well over three
point. While that is only one ex
ample, it is by no means unique
at Stanford or anywhere else.
To succeed in both athletics
and academics requires a num
ber of sacrifices that obviously
some choose not to make. It may
not suit the intellectual purpose,
whatever that is, to give up
something one might ordinarily
enjoy doing.
Dedication and Discipline
However, the dedication and
discipline acquired in setting
goals for oneself and striving
toward their accomplishment,
perhaps to the elimination of
several smaller pleasures, are
valuable now and will become
ever more so in that misty
realm outside the University.
Hutchins seeks to widen his
supposed rift between achieve
ment in athletics and accomplish
ment in academics when he
points out that "The require
ments for success in one are
quite different from the require-

ments in the other."
It is certainly true that an
athlete cannot broadjump on his
cerebral cortex, and a scholar
cannot absorb much philosophy
via a taut hamstring.
Common Requirement
The basic requirement for sue
cess in either area, however, is
common to both. It is a mental
drive—courage, perseverance,
pick your favorite term. Har
nessed, trained, and cultured
through demanding competition
either physical or scholastic, this
drive flows with surprising
into one's outlook to
ward all of his endeavors.
The phenomenon of athletic
academic complementation is, not
universal, but it is widespread,
and its very existence invalidates
Hutchins' thesis.
Hutchins nears the end of his
article with the dubious proposi
tion that, because a basketball
coach offers scholarships to tali
and skillful young men, the
coach is necessarily proclaiming,
"You can't afford to attend this
University unless you are 6Vfe
feet tall."
Hutchins' sideways attack on
athletics in general follows a pat
tern not foreign to the noble LA
Times and our favorite SF
Chronicle. The logic flaws in his
arguments, the aloof sarcasm of
his insinuation, and his cute
pseudoiniellectual approach to
the problem occlude the several
