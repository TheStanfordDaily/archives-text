# Shanahan First Candidate To Enter For Presidency
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Tom Shanahan, a junior in Kappa
Sigma Fraternity, yesterday became
the first candidate to officially an
nounce his candidacy for ASSU Presi
dent.
Shanahan has chosen as his run
ning-mate Henry Levinson, a fresh
man who is president of the Inter-
Wilbur Council, and a Kappa Sigma
pledge. Levinson was on the Steering
Committee of the OFF Strike. Shana

han Is considered by many to be a
conservative.
Liberal And Aware
"We're running together because
Stanford as a student body is not
radical, but liberal and aware," says
Shanahan. "I believe students have
an absolute right to their own opin
ions which should be taken into ac
count and heard officially in the Uni
versity."
Shanahan has been a member of
LASSU for three years, is alumni
chairman of IFC and a member of
IFB. He is also director of the Stan
ford Management Intern Program,
and a member of ROTC.
Platform
Shanahan and Levinson have re
leased a platform committing them
selves to "the legitimacy of student
power, a non graded freshman year,
extension of the pass-fail option to
General Studies courses, and end to
in loco parentis, a draw system for
overseas campus selection, a 1:1 men
women ratio at the undergraduate
level, and off-campus living for
women.
Among the things they "realistic
ally" think they achieve are: open
meetings of the Packer Committee,
direct student access to the Board of
Trustees, increased opportunities for
coed living, student studies of admis
sions policies and room and board
bills.

Shanahan would like to see the elec
tion as "something other than a re
jection or affirmation of David
Harris."
He hopes that the dichotomy be
tween the principles he and his run
ning mate hold will produce a
"dynamic tension" which will give
the University life. "We don't want
to drive the left or the traditional
away from student government." he
said.
Shanahan also seeks to establish a
student - faculty - administration com
mittee to examine the student govern
ment in terms of its relevance to Uni
versity decision-making.
Two other candidates have infor
mally announced their candidacy for
the ASSU presidency: Joe Reich, a
junior who has not yet announced a
running mate, and Pete Hanson, a
business student who will run with
Forrest Church, freshman president
of Trancos House.
No One Filed
Bill Berry, Elections Commissioner,
yesterday said no candidate has yet
filed a petition for nomination. Such
petitions, signed by 15 students, are
due next Monday. The primary elec
tion will be held May 3 and 4 with the
runoff to be held about one week
later.
Senior class officers will be elected
at the same time. Petitions are also
due for these positions Monday.
