# 'American Wise Man' Needed In 1968
## 
### 
The "Still Unknown Hero, the Amer
ican Wise Man," who will cut the
world's birthrate and destroy the
bomb, is the man who Fletcher Kne
bel announced as his nominee for
President of the United States last
night in Dinkelspiel.
Introduced by Prof. William Rivers
of the Communication Department,
Knebel addressed an audience of 120
on "Politics Inside Out."
Knebel, author of Seven Days in
May and several other political novels,
began a swift, humorous survey of
the American social and political
arenas. His topics ranged from a
1968 Presidential ticket of Timothy
Leary and Jean Dickson, backed
by Playboy Magazine and Alan Gins
berg to a 6000 percent CIA cut in
bribery offers to unfriendly regimes.-
Claiming "the future is by no
means as bleak as some would have
us believe," Knebel presented a 1968
GOP nominating speech for a can
didate who is "all image and no sub
stance," "a man who can carry
Miami, Palm Springs, and Las Vegas
on his breeding habits alone," Fidel
Castro.
He seriously pledged his support
to the man who would "dedicate his
life, patronage, judgeships, and pres
tige to eradicating the two evils of
the world," the population explosion
and what he called the "inevitability"
of nuclear warfare.
The measures such a president
would undertake would include use
of the "$6OO Understanding," the in
come tax weapon which would pro
hibit exemptions granted for third
children and impose a $600 penalty
for having four or more children. He
would give foreign aid to countries
with birth control programs, but deny
funds to those countries without
them.
On the educational level the Presi

dent would declare "Ideal Family
Day" at the White House, honoring
those parents who had "confined their
enthusiasm for fertility to two
babies." He would deny funds to those
institutions which had not made in
formation on birth control available
and reward those which had.
A World Anti-Proliferation Treaty
would be forged through his efforts,
and he would plead with the Pope in
the name of reason. In short, the

President's policy would "exalt the
pill and decry the pillow which holds
the head of the ever-pregnant wife."
Knebel said that th enlightened
President would realize that total nu
clear disarmament with United Na
tions control is the only hope of
world survival. While admitting ar
guments to the contrary, he replied
that disarmament must be attempted
and the world should not "take for
granted that control is impossible."

"I'd like to see somebody give it a
try," he concluded.
Knebel is Stern Hall's latest Guest
in-Residence. Today he will have
lunch in Holladay and dinner in Don
ner. Tonight at 8 he will lead a dis
cussion in the Burbank lounge on the
Peace Corps, and tomorrow he will
have lunch in Muir, dinner in Larkin,
and at 8 hold a discussion in the Lar
kin lounge on the role of the political
novel and the CIA.
