# Committee To Work With Phi Delts
## 
### 
A steering committee will soon be
formed to advise Phi Delta Theta
about their return to campus. Prof.
James T. Watkins of the Political
Science Department will chair the
committee and members will be
chosen by Dean of Students Joel
Smith.
According to Watkins it is "too
soon to have a story on the commit
tee." He said that membership is still
indefinite. The first formal meeting
will be held next week.
Assistant Dean John Hanson added
that the decision on the Phi Delts' re
instatement will be made late this
quarter after a recommendation from
the steering committee.
It is expected that the committee
will help the fraternity "get squared
away with such problems as rush,
pledge training, and house mainten
ance," Phi Delt member John Suttle
commented.
Informal Meeting
An informal meeting to discuss the
Phi Delts' future is planned for Fri
day and Smith, Watkins, plus some
Phi Delt members and alumni are
expected to attend. "We will discuss
progress of proposals which have
been submitted for next year," Phi

Delt President Jeff Thigpen said.
Phi Delta Theta was suspended
last November for the remainder of
the academic year, following a series
of campus incidents.
The action was taken by President
Wallace Sterling after a recommenda

tion from the Intrafraternity Board.
The Board recommended that the
Phi Delts be reinstated on probation
next fall, if their conduct during the
year is acceptable, and if they pre
sent acceptable written proposals for
next year's activity.
