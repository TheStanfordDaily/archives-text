# Peierls Speaks Tonight
## 
### 
Psychiatrist Frederick S. Peierls,
originator of the theories of Gestalt
therapy, will speak in Tresidder's
large lounge tonight at 8:15.
Peierls proposes a far-reaching revi
sion of Freudian theory which has
immediate application to creative and
innovative educational ideas.
He believes that the vicarious and
artificial character of much of con
temporary existence can be alleviated
by concentration techniques which
heighten awareness of life's here-and
now and I-and-Thou nature.
Peierls Is the author of Ego, Hun
ger, and Aggression and co-author
with Paul Goodman and Ralph Hes
serlinge of G«»Btalt Therapy. In G©s

talt Therapy, he says, "All overt ex
pressions of destructiveness, annihi
lation, anger, combativeness, is sup
pressed in the interests of civil order.
The feeling of anger is inhibited and
even repressed.
"People are sensible, tolerant, po
lite, and co-operative in being pushed
around. But the occasions of anger
are by no means minimized.
"On the contrary, when the larger
movements of initiative are circum
scribed in the competitive routines of
offices, bureaucracies, and factories,
there is petty friction, hurt feelings,
being crossed. Small anger is con
tinually generated, never discharged;
big anger, that goes with big initia
tive, is repressed," according to Peierls,
