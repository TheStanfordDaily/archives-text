# Ballet Review
## Bauer Amuses Lacks Finesse 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
"This sure beats going to the
flicks," commented the young
lady at my side. Indeed, Sunday
evening's performance by the
American Ballet Theater at Me
morial Auditorium was enter
taining at times, but, was it
good?
Kenneth Macmillan's choreo
graphy for the dance "Con
certo", the first exhibit, was dull,
stark, symmetrical. It was also
new. However, "modern" does
not mean mechanical, and the
dance is more than a string of
warm-up exercises.
The choreographer should pro
vide a vehicle for full, free ex
pression, not a tool. Having dan
cers leap across the stage in suc
cession can be effective if they
are all up to it, as was Edward
Verso. But it is embarrassing if
the troupe can't follow their
leader.
Empty Clashes
The stage was either too full
or too empty. The orange solo
ists clashed with the ruby-red
and yellow chorus lines, and
there was too much hand-hold
ing in the number.
Next, "The Combat", suggest
ed by Tasso's poem, "Jerusalem
Delivered", brought out the ac
tion. Clorinda, the pagan girl,
meets Tancred, the Christian
warrior. There is a great deal
of choppy prancing about until,
finally, the two meet in mortal
combat. Tancred discovers that
the masked knight he has fatal
ly wounded is the girl he loves.
Not much of a story, it is true.
But Jeanne Armin and Paul Su
therland's love duo transcended
the vague sentimentality of the
Canti and approached movement
in its purest form. There was
magic in their movements. Miss
Armin's body is as supple as
her long, dark hair. Together,
the lovers danced into death. Ar
min moved more gracefully
when she was dying in Tan
cred's arms than many of the
other dancers who were alive
and well.
"Black .Swan"
Ballet is attitudes. A dancer
must move even when standing
still. The "Black Swan" from
act three of "Swan Lake, which
followed, is deceptively simple.
The dancers seemed nervous
and stiff. Eleanor D'Antuono
was wooden and heavy-legged.
Her limbs didn't flutter and she
forgot to move her neck. The
dance of her prince, Royes Fer
nandez, was effortless, because
it lacked effort, and he almost
fell twice because of it.

When Nureyev falls, there is
a reason for it. He thinks he's
God. One can't help slipping.
But, please, not in a pas de deux
from "Swan Lake".
The troupe seemed more re
laxed and at home in "Rodeo",
and so did the audience. Agnes
de Milles's setting for Aaron
Copland's music kept the horse
play moving. So did Christine
Sarry, the cowgirl who learned
to become a lady the hard way
—from men.
Trades in Pants
In the evening, after the ro
deo, the same men dance with
the womenfolk in squares and
rounds. The cowgirl, laughed at
for trying her hand in the man's
world of the rodeo, decides to
trade her pants for a dress and
is an instant success.
But clothes don't make the
man—or, the woman — and she
can't seem to get used to her
new ones. In a humorous mo
ment she is seen tugging at the
front of her dress in search of
her pants.
Girls get pinched, and every
one is happy. These young
dancers have potential. What
they really lack is style. Oh, and
also the pianoforte in the audi
torium is out of tune. So care
less.

"Black .Swan"
Ballet is attitudes. A dancer
must move even when standing
still. The "Black Swan" from
act three of "Swan Lake, which
followed, is deceptively simple.
The dancers seemed nervous
and stiff. Eleanor D'Antuono
was wooden and heavy-legged.
Her limbs didn't flutter and she
forgot to move her neck. The
dance of her prince, Royes Fer
nandez, was effortless, because
it lacked effort, and he almost
fell twice because of it.

When Nureyev falls, there is
a reason for it. He thinks he's
God. One can't help slipping.
But, please, not in a pas de deux
from "Swan Lake".
The troupe seemed more re
laxed and at home in "Rodeo",
and so did the audience. Agnes
de Milles's setting for Aaron
Copland's music kept the horse
play moving. So did Christine
Sarry, the cowgirl who learned
to become a lady the hard way
—from men.
Trades in Pants
In the evening, after the ro
deo, the same men dance with
the womenfolk in squares and
rounds. The cowgirl, laughed at
for trying her hand in the man's
world of the rodeo, decides to
trade her pants for a dress and
is an instant success.
But clothes don't make the
man—or, the woman — and she
can't seem to get used to her
new ones. In a humorous mo
ment she is seen tugging at the
front of her dress in search of
her pants.
Girls get pinched, and every
one is happy. These young
dancers have potential. What
they really lack is style. Oh, and
also the pianoforte in the audi
torium is out of tune. So care
less.
"This sure beats going to the
flicks," commented the young
lady at my side. Indeed, Sunday
evening's performance by the
American Ballet Theater at Me
morial Auditorium was enter
taining at times, but, was it
good?
Kenneth Macmillan's choreo
graphy for the dance "Con
certo", the first exhibit, was dull,
stark, symmetrical. It was also
new. However, "modern" does
not mean mechanical, and the
dance is more than a string of
warm-up exercises.
The choreographer should pro
vide a vehicle for full, free ex
pression, not a tool. Having dan
cers leap across the stage in suc
cession can be effective if they
are all up to it, as was Edward
Verso. But it is embarrassing if
the troupe can't follow their
leader.
Empty Clashes
The stage was either too full
or too empty. The orange solo
ists clashed with the ruby-red
and yellow chorus lines, and
there was too much hand-hold
ing in the number.
Next, "The Combat", suggest
ed by Tasso's poem, "Jerusalem
Delivered", brought out the ac
tion. Clorinda, the pagan girl,
meets Tancred, the Christian
warrior. There is a great deal
of choppy prancing about until,
finally, the two meet in mortal
combat. Tancred discovers that
the masked knight he has fatal
ly wounded is the girl he loves.
Not much of a story, it is true.
But Jeanne Armin and Paul Su
therland's love duo transcended
the vague sentimentality of the
Canti and approached movement
in its purest form. There was
magic in their movements. Miss
Armin's body is as supple as
her long, dark hair. Together,
the lovers danced into death. Ar
min moved more gracefully
when she was dying in Tan
cred's arms than many of the
other dancers who were alive
and well.
