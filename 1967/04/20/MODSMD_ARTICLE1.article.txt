# National Suspends Kappa Sigma Amid Negro Pledge Controversy
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Kappa Sigma fraternity has been
suspended from its national organiza
tion, apparently because of difficulties
arising after a Negro was pledged two
years ago. The action has not yet been
made definite, and certain alumni are
now trying to reverse the decision.
The chapter is awaiting a letter of ex
planation from the national.
According to Dan Kirby, president
of Stanford's Beta Zeta chapter, ten
sion had been building between the
chapter and the national for about
two years. A representative of the na
tional who has been watching the
chapter for some months criticized it
for a number of apparent violations
of national rules. These included not
maintaining a high enough grade
point average, not maintaining the
house "in proper order" and not fol
lowing the prescriptions of fraternity
ritual.
Flaming Bigots
Commenting on representatives of
Kappa Sigma's national organization,
one local member said, "They're such
a bunch of flaming bigots, it makes
me sick to associate with them." He
added that he thought the reasons
given for the suspension were "petty."
One of Beta Zeta's coordinators for
rush is a Negro; the other's grades
apparently do not meet the standards
of the national.
The two were depledged last quar
ter at the insistence of the national
but were allowed to remain living in

the house. Kirby said this was not in
violation of any rules.
Suspended Monday
The district representative of Kap
pa Sigma, Howard M. Leggett of Ala
mo, announced the suspension at a
house meeting Monday night. Kirby
said Leggett's reasons for suspension
were "vague." The reaction in the
house, he said, was one of "disgusted
amazement."
One member remarked, "The guy
(Leggett) just talked around in cir
cles. The main bone of contention was
the acting rush chairmen, mainly that
Rafe (Rafael Palacio) is a Negro. But
it's been a lot of things in the last
year."
Regarding the question of disaffili
ating from the national, Kirby said it
was still an open matter and would
depend on the exact nature of the
charges and the suspension. A letter
from the national is expected today
or tomorrow. One Kappa Sig com
mented, "If I had my way, we would
have gone local a long time ago." Kir
by said it was unlikely that the chap
ter would disaffiliate "unless they
make us kow-tow."
Leggett called the suspension a
"punitive measure to get 'em on the
ball." He cited "non-conformance to
agreements between the chapter and
the national fraternity." He declined
to be specific, saying "I don't think it's
anybody's business."
Asked why the University had not
been notified of the action, Leggett

said "I don't think it's any of their
business. It doesn't enter the Univer
sity politics any." He vigorously de
nied that racial discrimination entered
the matter. "You're either a fraternity
or a dormitory," he said. Leggett is
Kappa Sigma's district Grand Master
for Northern California.
No Financial Aid
Beta Zeta now receives no financial
aid from the national. It does receive
guidelines on rituals, the national
Kappa Sigma magazine and, as one
member sarcastically put it,"the
privilege of belonging to an esteemed
national organization."
Gordon Surprised
Contacted by The Daily, Associate
Dean of Students Robert Gordon ex
pressed great surprise at the suspen
sion. He said that neither he nor As
sistant Dean John Hanson had been
notified by Leggett, the national fra
ternity or the local chapter, and that
the University administration would
have to await official action by the
fraternity before it could make a re
sponse.
Gordon added that if a fraternity
wanted to suspend a chapter, "they
can conjure up all kinds of reasons
for doing so which may or may not
be based on facts." He added that the
given reasons "seem to me to be
phony."

Kappa Sigma was Stanford's sec
ond highest ranking fraternity last
fall. House members include Interfra
ternity Council President Drennon
Jones, ASSU Elections Commissioner
Bill Berry, ASSU presidential candi
date Tom Shanahan, and former Dally
Sports Editor Wells Shoemaker.
Pledges this year include Shanahan's
running mate, Henry Levinson and
Daily Sports Editor Nick Selby. There
are now about 50 active members of
Beta Zeta chapter.
Discrimnatory Clauses
In accord with a 1957 Board of Trus
tee resolution, the University has con
sistently supported voluntary student
efforts to abolish racial and religious
discriminatory clauses and practices
in fraternities.
ATO went local in a disput with its
national over the pledging of Jewish
students in 1961. Sigma Nu (now
Beta Chi) voluntarily severed its ties
with the national in 1962 when the
chapter became convinced that the
national discriminated against Ne
groes. The Stanford chapter of Sigma
Chi was suspended by the national
in 1965, after rushing Negroes, and
severed its ties last year.
Several other Stanford fraternities
have been among the first in the na
tionals to pledge Negroes, but have
done so without controversy.

added that he thought the reasons
given for the suspension were "petty."
One of Beta Zeta's coordinators for
rush is a Negro; the other's grades
apparently do not meet the standards
of the national.
The two were depledged last quar
ter at the insistence of the national
but were allowed to remain living in

the house. Kirby said this was not in
violation of any rules.
Suspended Monday
The district representative of Kap
pa Sigma, Howard M. Leggett of Ala
mo, announced the suspension at a
house meeting Monday night. Kirby
said Leggett's reasons for suspension
were "vague." The reaction in the
house, he said, was one of "disgusted
amazement."
One member remarked, "The guy
(Leggett) just talked around in cir
cles. The main bone of contention was
the acting rush chairmen, mainly that
Rafe (Rafael Palacio) is a Negro. But
it's been a lot of things in the last
year."
Regarding the question of disaffili
ating from the national, Kirby said it
was still an open matter and would
depend on the exact nature of the
charges and the suspension. A letter
from the national is expected today
or tomorrow. One Kappa Sig com
mented, "If I had my way, we would
have gone local a long time ago." Kir
by said it was unlikely that the chap
ter would disaffiliate "unless they
make us kow-tow."
Leggett called the suspension a
"punitive measure to get 'em on the
ball." He cited "non-conformance to
agreements between the chapter and
the national fraternity." He declined
to be specific, saying "I don't think it's
anybody's business."
Asked why the University had not
been notified of the action, Leggett

said "I don't think it's any of their
business. It doesn't enter the Univer
sity politics any." He vigorously de
nied that racial discrimination entered
the matter. "You're either a fraternity
or a dormitory," he said. Leggett is
Kappa Sigma's district Grand Master
for Northern California.
No Financial Aid
Beta Zeta now receives no financial
aid from the national. It does receive
guidelines on rituals, the national
Kappa Sigma magazine and, as one
member sarcastically put it,"the
privilege of belonging to an esteemed
national organization."
Gordon Surprised
Contacted by The Daily, Associate
Dean of Students Robert Gordon ex
pressed great surprise at the suspen
sion. He said that neither he nor As
sistant Dean John Hanson had been
notified by Leggett, the national fra
ternity or the local chapter, and that
the University administration would
have to await official action by the
fraternity before it could make a re
sponse.
Gordon added that if a fraternity
wanted to suspend a chapter, "they
can conjure up all kinds of reasons
for doing so which may or may not
be based on facts." He added that the
given reasons "seem to me to be
phony."

Kappa Sigma was Stanford's sec
ond highest ranking fraternity last
fall. House members include Interfra
ternity Council President Drennon
Jones, ASSU Elections Commissioner
Bill Berry, ASSU presidential candi
date Tom Shanahan, and former Dally
Sports Editor Wells Shoemaker.
Pledges this year include Shanahan's
running mate, Henry Levinson and
Daily Sports Editor Nick Selby. There
are now about 50 active members of
Beta Zeta chapter.
Discrimnatory Clauses
In accord with a 1957 Board of Trus
tee resolution, the University has con
sistently supported voluntary student
efforts to abolish racial and religious
discriminatory clauses and practices
in fraternities.
ATO went local in a disput with its
national over the pledging of Jewish
students in 1961. Sigma Nu (now
Beta Chi) voluntarily severed its ties
with the national in 1962 when the
chapter became convinced that the
national discriminated against Ne
groes. The Stanford chapter of Sigma
Chi was suspended by the national
in 1965, after rushing Negroes, and
severed its ties last year.
Several other Stanford fraternities
have been among the first in the na
tionals to pledge Negroes, but have
done so without controversy.
Kappa Sigma fraternity has been
suspended from its national organiza
tion, apparently because of difficulties
arising after a Negro was pledged two
years ago. The action has not yet been
made definite, and certain alumni are
now trying to reverse the decision.
The chapter is awaiting a letter of ex
planation from the national.
According to Dan Kirby, president
of Stanford's Beta Zeta chapter, ten
sion had been building between the
chapter and the national for about
two years. A representative of the na
tional who has been watching the
chapter for some months criticized it
for a number of apparent violations
of national rules. These included not
maintaining a high enough grade
point average, not maintaining the
house "in proper order" and not fol
lowing the prescriptions of fraternity
ritual.

Regarding the question of disaffili
ating from the national, Kirby said it
was still an open matter and would
depend on the exact nature of the
charges and the suspension. A letter
from the national is expected today
or tomorrow. One Kappa Sig com
mented, "If I had my way, we would
have gone local a long time ago." Kir
by said it was unlikely that the chap
ter would disaffiliate "unless they
make us kow-tow."
Leggett called the suspension a
"punitive measure to get 'em on the
ball." He cited "non-conformance to
agreements between the chapter and
the national fraternity." He declined
to be specific, saying "I don't think it's
anybody's business."
Asked why the University had not
been notified of the action, Leggett

said "I don't think it's any of their
business. It doesn't enter the Univer
sity politics any." He vigorously de
nied that racial discrimination entered
the matter. "You're either a fraternity
or a dormitory," he said. Leggett is
Kappa Sigma's district Grand Master
for Northern California.
No Financial Aid
Beta Zeta now receives no financial
aid from the national. It does receive
guidelines on rituals, the national
Kappa Sigma magazine and, as one
member sarcastically put it,"the
privilege of belonging to an esteemed
national organization."
Gordon Surprised
Contacted by The Daily, Associate
Dean of Students Robert Gordon ex
pressed great surprise at the suspen
sion. He said that neither he nor As
sistant Dean John Hanson had been
notified by Leggett, the national fra
ternity or the local chapter, and that
the University administration would
have to await official action by the
fraternity before it could make a re
sponse.
Gordon added that if a fraternity
wanted to suspend a chapter, "they
can conjure up all kinds of reasons
for doing so which may or may not
be based on facts." He added that the
given reasons "seem to me to be
phony."

Kappa Sigma was Stanford's sec
ond highest ranking fraternity last
fall. House members include Interfra
ternity Council President Drennon
Jones, ASSU Elections Commissioner
Bill Berry, ASSU presidential candi
date Tom Shanahan, and former Dally
Sports Editor Wells Shoemaker.
Pledges this year include Shanahan's
running mate, Henry Levinson and
Daily Sports Editor Nick Selby. There
are now about 50 active members of
Beta Zeta chapter.
Discrimnatory Clauses
In accord with a 1957 Board of Trus
tee resolution, the University has con
sistently supported voluntary student
efforts to abolish racial and religious
discriminatory clauses and practices
in fraternities.
ATO went local in a disput with its
national over the pledging of Jewish
students in 1961. Sigma Nu (now
Beta Chi) voluntarily severed its ties
with the national in 1962 when the
chapter became convinced that the
national discriminated against Ne
groes. The Stanford chapter of Sigma
Chi was suspended by the national
in 1965, after rushing Negroes, and
severed its ties last year.
Several other Stanford fraternities
have been among the first in the na
tionals to pledge Negroes, but have
done so without controversy.
Kappa Sigma fraternity has been
suspended from its national organiza
tion, apparently because of difficulties
arising after a Negro was pledged two
years ago. The action has not yet been
made definite, and certain alumni are
now trying to reverse the decision.
The chapter is awaiting a letter of ex
planation from the national.
According to Dan Kirby, president
of Stanford's Beta Zeta chapter, ten
sion had been building between the
chapter and the national for about
two years. A representative of the na
tional who has been watching the
chapter for some months criticized it
for a number of apparent violations
of national rules. These included not
maintaining a high enough grade
point average, not maintaining the
house "in proper order" and not fol
lowing the prescriptions of fraternity
ritual.
Flaming Bigots
Commenting on representatives of
Kappa Sigma's national organization,
one local member said, "They're such
a bunch of flaming bigots, it makes
me sick to associate with them." He
added that he thought the reasons
given for the suspension were "petty."
One of Beta Zeta's coordinators for
rush is a Negro; the other's grades
apparently do not meet the standards
of the national.
The two were depledged last quar
ter at the insistence of the national
but were allowed to remain living in

the house. Kirby said this was not in
violation of any rules.
Suspended Monday
The district representative of Kap
pa Sigma, Howard M. Leggett of Ala
mo, announced the suspension at a
house meeting Monday night. Kirby
said Leggett's reasons for suspension
were "vague." The reaction in the
house, he said, was one of "disgusted
amazement."
One member remarked, "The guy
(Leggett) just talked around in cir
cles. The main bone of contention was
the acting rush chairmen, mainly that
Rafe (Rafael Palacio) is a Negro. But
it's been a lot of things in the last
year."
