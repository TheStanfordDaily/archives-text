# Student Committee Urges Viet Victory By Bombing All Vital Military Targets
## 
### 
(CPS) â€”Often overshadowed
by strident anti-war protests,
campus supporters of the Viet
nam conflict have organized the
National Student Committee for
Victory in Vietnam to help pre
sent their viewpoint.
President of the Committee is
Mike Thompson, a University of
Missouri junior. Thompson said
in an interview that the group
has no single basic approach ex
cept the "uniting principle to
end the war on a positive vic
tory for the United States."
The Missouri student said the
group has organized demonstra
tions on several campuses,
created "Victory in Vietnam"
buttons and bumper stickers,
and mailed reprints of novelist
John Steinbeck's reports from
Southeast Asia to interested stu
dents.
AH Military Targets
A "17 point plan" with a "ba
sic outline of how to organize
on campus" has been drawn up
by the Victory Committee.
; Indicating his disagreement
with the Johnson Administra
tion's tactical approach to the
war, Thompson said that all
military targets in North Viet
nam should be bombed. "If we're
}n the war, he stated, 'vital tar
gets should not be kept off lim
its. If our planes can fly above
the MlG's, there's no reason in
the world not to bomb these tar
gets."
. He added, "Of course, we are
not advocating the leveling of
Hanoi . . . because we don't
think that's necessary to win."
To Counter Protesters
Thompson said his organiza
tion was set up "kind of to coun
ter" anti-war protestors, but
that they did not exist solely to

provide opposition to anti-war
groups.
He said the Victory Commit
tee "just doesn't have the money
. . . to demonstrate in the streets
just when they demonstrate.
We're using that money for a
nation-wide, long-range type pro
gram instead."
Of the student left, Thompson
said, "they not only get the ex
pensive type literature, but
they've got people travelling all
over the place. That's a heck of
a lot of money they've got avail
able."
Although Thompson said that
his committee works through
contacts usually from Young
Republican Clubs and the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF),
he indicated that money from
these other organizations is not
always available.
Thompson stated that his com
mittee persuaded the governors

from seven states, including
Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland, to
declare this week "Victory in
Vietnam Week."
In addition, 145,000 pieces of
literature were sent out to the
Committee's campus contracts
for this week's counter-demon
strations.
The campus of Indiana Uni
versity has a well-organized Vic
tory Committee which, Thomp
son said, sponsored a "tremen
dous rally" last week. The rally
was endorsed by several student
organizations on campus as well
as some of the campus beauty
queens.
"America Day"
An "America Day" has been
organized at Temple University
in Philadelphia by the campus
chapter of Young Americans for
Freedom.
According to the YAF campus
coordinator, Richard Gold,

"America Day" will include a
rally, distribution of literature,
a book sale and a collection of
paperback books for soldiers at
Valley Forge Veterans Hospital
who were wounded in Vietnam.
An Alternative
"We do not intend to degrade
the peace mobilization activi
ties," Gold said, "but we do in
tend to offer students an alterna
tive to the anti-war viewpoint."
At the University of Pennsyl
vania, 14 students "painted out"
and whitewashed a Mobilization
for Peace 'paint in' on the walls
surrounding the construction
site of a new campus building.
Last Sunday, 100 students
covered the walls with paintings
calling for an end to the war.
In less than 24 hours, however,
the counter "paint out" artists
had left only several signs read
ing "love" and a large arrow
pointing "To the Library."
