is Condemned," directed by
Charlotte Boothe, and Eugene
lonesco's "The Lesson," directed
by Annette Boushey, will sand
wich a short film, "A Jug of
Wine and Thou," written and
produced by Louis Taupper.

The freshman group was or
ganized by Mark Mirsky and
Professor Larry Freidlander
Fall quarter. The first produc
tion by the group was a Christ
mas performance in Memorial
Church, which attracted con
siderable attention.
Constantly hampered by prob
lems of money, stage and re
hearsal space, and simply con
vincing the freshman of the
abundant opportunities avail
able in such a group, the initi
ating group has staged a num
ber of difficult productions.
"Death of a Hired Man," "The
Love Song of J. Alfred Pru
frock," "Under Milkwood," and
finally "Riders to the Sea."
The three productions tonight
will offer different views of life,

and of acadameia specifically.
lonesco's "The Lesson" portrays
a professor who attempts to Im
part wisdom to his single female
student, who for her part, re
fuses to learn. The frustration
of the situation leads the pro
fessor to homicide, and the audi
ence to ponder the split-level
meaning of lonesco's play.
"A Jug of Wine and Thou"
is described as a classical melo
drama in a Stanford setting,
with over present triad of hero,
heroine, and villain. The light
hearted movie will provide a
break between weighty plays,
and will be followed by "This
Property is Condemned," which
was produced as a Hollywood
regurgitation late last year,
starring Natalie Wood.
