# Anti-CIA Pickets Elicit Varied Wisconsin Debate
## 
### 
(CPS) — Demonstrators at
the University of Wisconsin en
circled the law building and
lined the corridors in the build
ing where Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) recruiters were
interviewing students last week.
About 18 policemen from uni
versity protection and security
forces were placed around the
building, and officials said that
both city and county police were
"on reserve."
Nearly 1,000 demonstrators
listened to speeches and a tele
gram of support from National
Student Association Vice-Presi
dent Ed Schwartz while CIA re
cruiters were interviewing stu
dents.
Sidney Glass, representing the
campus Concerned Black Stu
dents (CBS), charged that the
CIA is designed to "thwart and
straightjacket any movement of
people to control their own des
tinies."

Glass added, "If the CIA
agents are willing to walk alone
without the protection of 49 po
licemen, CBS is ready to take
care of them."
No Berkeley Here
Another student supported the
position of the Wisconsin admin
istration in allowing CIA re
cruiters on campus. Steve Field,
chairman of the "No Berkeley
Here Committee," said that
while his committee does "not
necessarily approve of the ac
tions taken by the CIA In the
past, nevertheless, it supports
the right of the CIA to use the
facilities of this campus to re
cruit.
"To refuse to let the CIA re
cruit on campus," Field said, "is
to make a moral judgment for
all students. We believe that
the university should not be
asked to make a moral judg
ment."
Wisconsin Board of Regents

president Arthur Deßardeleben,
however, questioned the univer
sity's policy of taking stands on
some moral issues like racial
discrimination but not on oth
ers.
In a regents meeting last Sat
urday, Deßardeleben said that
some students would think it
mysterious how the university
determines which issues to take
a stand on.
The regents president added
that industrialists were tried af
ter World War n as war crimi
nals, and, he said, the students
demands "are not as preposter
ous as some might think."
Student's Own Choice
University Chancellor Robben
Fleming said, however, that the
university as a corporation
should not take a stand on a
moral issue. Each student has
to make his own choice, Flem
ing said.
The Chancellor issued a state
ment outlining the consequences
for student demonstrators who
were asked by police to move.
Fleming said that if the student
refused to move or to give his
name to the authority, then the
city or county police would be
asked to take responsibility for
the individual.
There was no incident during

the picketing. However, a grad
uate student in mathematics,
Jonathan Golan, issued a strong
ly worded statement demanding
an investigation into relation
between the Dean ol Public Ser
vices, Leroy E. Luberg, and the
CIA.
Golan questioned whether Lu
berg's activities for the CIA had
ended in the early 50's, as Lu
berg has said.
Citing Luberg's past record as
a CIA consultant and a CIA re
cruiter on campus prior to the
Korean War, Golan asked "if his
CIA connections had influenced
his handling of university mat
ters."
The administration made no
comment on Golan's demand.
