The newly-formed group is
working in conjunction with the
Peninsula and Bay Area chap

~*id War-Injured Vietnamese
Children, and will be selling dai
sies through Friday as their
first fund-raising project.
In addition to the flower sale,
information sheets describing
"ie Committee's work will be
distributed in campus resi

headed by Steve VanTuyl and
Marsden Blois, will continue to
work throughout the quarter
through the UCCM.
Vietnamese Children
The Committee of Responsi
.ility is a national organization
set up last December by con
cerned individuals, many of
them physicians, with the inten
tion of bringing Vietnamese
"hildren to the U.S. for treat
ment.
According to Pat Burbank,
lurmer secretary-treasurer for
the Bay Area Chapter of the
Committee for Responsibility,
the organization received its
"original impetus" from articles
a national magazines and re
ports from individuals return
ing from Vietnam who described
*he injuries of Vietnamese chil
dren.
Mrs. Burbank said that while
there are no exact figures avail
able concerning the number of
children suffering from war in
juries, the hospitals are over

crowded and "most children in
jured by napalm don't even
reach the hospitals. . . . they re
main permanently disabled or
die before receiving treatment."
State Department Approves
According to information put
out by the Committee for Re
sponsibility, in Vietnam there
are only one doctor and nine
nurses for every 100,000 persons.
The entry of the Vietnamese
children into the U.S. has been
approved by the State Depart
ment, and the children will
be allowed to remain
for . xung a time as the treat
ment requires in each case.
This period will include not
only the time spent in hospital
treatment, but also a period of
readjustment in individual
homes.
No Government Funds
While the extent and effective
ness of the Committee's work
depends upon individual contri
butions, army doctors and hospi
tals have volunteered services.
The organization has received
no government funds or other
large amounts from any partic
ular organizations, but rely
mostly on many small, individ
ual gifts. There is some possi
bility that the government may
provide transportation for the
children to the U.S. and for their
return to Vietnam.
In addition to the Stanford ad
hoc committee, those participat
ing locally include Dr. June M.
Fisher and Dr. Raymond Kivel,
physicians at the Stanford-Palo
Alto Hospital. In addition, Ed
Bernstein and Peter Wright, two
Stanford medical students, have
been active in planning the proj
ect.
Orphans First
At present a team of doctors
is in Vietnam to organize the

Committee's work there. Among
them is Dr. Henry Mayer, a
Redwood City physician. Part of
the organization's job in Viet
nam will be to determine which
children will come to the U.S.
for treatment.
While many of those to re
ceive treatment will probably be
orphans, others will be selected
only with the approval of their
parents.
There will be at least one
Vietnamese adult to accompany
each group of five or six chil
dren. In addition, foster homes
will be provided for the children
during their stay in the U.S.
Vietnamese students in the area
where children will be treated
will also be asked to help the
children to adjust in the stay in
the U.S.
Aid In Adjustment
The Saigon branch of the
Committee of Responsibility,
which will select the children to
be treated, will also aid the chil
dren in readjusting to their
home country when they return.
What psychological effects is
the treatment likely to have on
the children? Mrs. Burbank said
that the transition which the
children will have to make in
coming to the U.S. will be a
difficult one, but "children can
usually adjust easily."
Most of them will be in the
U.S.* from six months to a year,
depending on the extent of the
treatment. The project will not
be concentrated in any one par
ticular center in the U.S.; rather
children will be sent to the
places which are best able to
take care of their particular
needs.
Plastic Surgery
Many of the children will re
quire plastic surgery, an expen
sive and tedious treatment.

While the exact cost of treat
ment for each child will vary,
estimates run up to four and
even five figures for each case.
The Committee for Responsi
bility has precedent organiza
tions in other countries working
on similar projects. A Swiss hu
manitarian organization, Terre
des Hommes, has been responsi
ble for aiding other children re
ceive treatment in European
countries.

tion of bringing Vietnamese
"hildren to the U.S. for treat
ment.
According to Pat Burbank,
lurmer secretary-treasurer for
the Bay Area Chapter of the
Committee for Responsibility,
the organization received its
"original impetus" from articles
a national magazines and re
ports from individuals return
ing from Vietnam who described
*he injuries of Vietnamese chil
dren.
Mrs. Burbank said that while
there are no exact figures avail
able concerning the number of
children suffering from war in
juries, the hospitals are over

crowded and "most children in
jured by napalm don't even
reach the hospitals. . . . they re
main permanently disabled or
die before receiving treatment."
State Department Approves
According to information put
out by the Committee for Re
sponsibility, in Vietnam there
are only one doctor and nine
nurses for every 100,000 persons.
The entry of the Vietnamese
children into the U.S. has been
approved by the State Depart
ment, and the children will
be allowed to remain
for . xung a time as the treat
ment requires in each case.
This period will include not
only the time spent in hospital
treatment, but also a period of
readjustment in individual
homes.
No Government Funds
While the extent and effective
ness of the Committee's work
depends upon individual contri
butions, army doctors and hospi
tals have volunteered services.
The organization has received
no government funds or other
large amounts from any partic
ular organizations, but rely
mostly on many small, individ
ual gifts. There is some possi
bility that the government may
provide transportation for the
children to the U.S. and for their
return to Vietnam.
In addition to the Stanford ad
hoc committee, those participat
ing locally include Dr. June M.
Fisher and Dr. Raymond Kivel,
physicians at the Stanford-Palo
Alto Hospital. In addition, Ed
Bernstein and Peter Wright, two
Stanford medical students, have
been active in planning the proj
ect.
Orphans First
At present a team of doctors
is in Vietnam to organize the

Committee's work there. Among
them is Dr. Henry Mayer, a
Redwood City physician. Part of
the organization's job in Viet
nam will be to determine which
children will come to the U.S.
for treatment.
While many of those to re
ceive treatment will probably be
orphans, others will be selected
only with the approval of their
parents.
There will be at least one
Vietnamese adult to accompany
each group of five or six chil
dren. In addition, foster homes
will be provided for the children
during their stay in the U.S.
Vietnamese students in the area
where children will be treated
will also be asked to help the
children to adjust in the stay in
the U.S.
Aid In Adjustment
The Saigon branch of the
Committee of Responsibility,
which will select the children to
be treated, will also aid the chil
dren in readjusting to their
home country when they return.
What psychological effects is
the treatment likely to have on
the children? Mrs. Burbank said
that the transition which the
children will have to make in
coming to the U.S. will be a
difficult one, but "children can
usually adjust easily."
Most of them will be in the
U.S.* from six months to a year,
depending on the extent of the
treatment. The project will not
be concentrated in any one par
ticular center in the U.S.; rather
children will be sent to the
places which are best able to
take care of their particular
needs.
Plastic Surgery
Many of the children will re
quire plastic surgery, an expen
sive and tedious treatment.

While the exact cost of treat
ment for each child will vary,
estimates run up to four and
even five figures for each case.
The Committee for Responsi
bility has precedent organiza
tions in other countries working
on similar projects. A Swiss hu
manitarian organization, Terre
des Hommes, has been responsi
ble for aiding other children re
ceive treatment in European
countries.

be allowed to remain
for . xung a time as the treat
ment requires in each case.
This period will include not
only the time spent in hospital
treatment, but also a period of
readjustment in individual
homes.
No Government Funds
While the extent and effective
ness of the Committee's work
depends upon individual contri
butions, army doctors and hospi
tals have volunteered services.
The organization has received
no government funds or other
large amounts from any partic
ular organizations, but rely
mostly on many small, individ
ual gifts. There is some possi
bility that the government may
provide transportation for the
children to the U.S. and for their
return to Vietnam.
In addition to the Stanford ad
hoc committee, those participat
ing locally include Dr. June M.
Fisher and Dr. Raymond Kivel,
physicians at the Stanford-Palo
Alto Hospital. In addition, Ed
Bernstein and Peter Wright, two
Stanford medical students, have
been active in planning the proj
ect.
Orphans First
At present a team of doctors
is in Vietnam to organize the

Committee's work there. Among
them is Dr. Henry Mayer, a
Redwood City physician. Part of
the organization's job in Viet
nam will be to determine which
children will come to the U.S.
for treatment.
While many of those to re
ceive treatment will probably be
orphans, others will be selected
only with the approval of their
parents.
There will be at least one
Vietnamese adult to accompany
each group of five or six chil
dren. In addition, foster homes
will be provided for the children
during their stay in the U.S.
Vietnamese students in the area
where children will be treated
will also be asked to help the
children to adjust in the stay in
the U.S.
Aid In Adjustment
The Saigon branch of the
Committee of Responsibility,
which will select the children to
be treated, will also aid the chil
dren in readjusting to their
home country when they return.
What psychological effects is
the treatment likely to have on
the children? Mrs. Burbank said
that the transition which the
children will have to make in
coming to the U.S. will be a
difficult one, but "children can
usually adjust easily."
Most of them will be in the
U.S.* from six months to a year,
depending on the extent of the
treatment. The project will not
be concentrated in any one par
ticular center in the U.S.; rather
children will be sent to the
places which are best able to
take care of their particular
needs.
Plastic Surgery
Many of the children will re
quire plastic surgery, an expen
sive and tedious treatment.

While the exact cost of treat
ment for each child will vary,
estimates run up to four and
even five figures for each case.
The Committee for Responsi
bility has precedent organiza
tions in other countries working
on similar projects. A Swiss hu
manitarian organization, Terre
des Hommes, has been responsi
ble for aiding other children re
ceive treatment in European
countries.

Vietnamese Children
The Committee of Responsi
.ility is a national organization
set up last December by con
cerned individuals, many of
them physicians, with the inten
tion of bringing Vietnamese
"hildren to the U.S. for treat
ment.
According to Pat Burbank,
lurmer secretary-treasurer for
the Bay Area Chapter of the
Committee for Responsibility,
the organization received its
"original impetus" from articles
a national magazines and re
ports from individuals return
ing from Vietnam who described
*he injuries of Vietnamese chil
dren.
Mrs. Burbank said that while
there are no exact figures avail
able concerning the number of
children suffering from war in
juries, the hospitals are over

crowded and "most children in
jured by napalm don't even
reach the hospitals. . . . they re
main permanently disabled or
die before receiving treatment."
State Department Approves
According to information put
out by the Committee for Re
sponsibility, in Vietnam there
are only one doctor and nine
nurses for every 100,000 persons.
The entry of the Vietnamese
children into the U.S. has been
approved by the State Depart
ment, and the children will
be allowed to remain
for . xung a time as the treat
