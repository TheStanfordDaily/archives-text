# Carnegie, Ford Grants To Assist Vassar, Yale In Mating Game
## 
### 
(CPS)â€”Co-education in the
Ivy League schools received a
boost last week when the Carne
gie Corporation and the Ford
foundation announced two
grants totalling $320,000 to as
-Ist Vassar College and Yale
University in their joint study of
possible cooperative arrange
ments.
The foundations said that the

grants are for both schools to
explore the desirability and the
feasibility of inter-institutional
cooperation.
Plans for the study of re-es
tablishing Vassar in New Haven
have been under preparation
since December by a joint trus
tee committee headed by Vassar
President Alan Simpson and

Yale President Kingman Brew
ster, Jr.
The grants will be used pri
marily to pay the salaries of of
ficers and teachers of the two
schools who will be released
from their duties to spend more
time on the study.
In the New York State Legis
lature, Vassar's plans to move
to Connecticut have not been
received enthusiastically.
State Assemblyman Bertram
Podell said about the Carnegie
and Ford grants that he is "al
ways in favor of studies that
try to improve education in this
country. But I still want to keep
Vassar in New York."
Wooing Away
"Our state is proud of our
girls," Podell continued. "I don't
see why Yale can't start a girls'
school on its own. Why do they
have to woo ours away from
us?"
Podell co-sponsored a bill this
year to build a New York State
University complex centered
around Vassar. The bill was
postponed by the Legislature un
til next January.
