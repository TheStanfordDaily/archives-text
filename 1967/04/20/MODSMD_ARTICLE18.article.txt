# Danforth Fellows Regret 'Publish or Perish' Syndrome
## 
### 
(CPS) — A fear of being
pressured to publish" is the
major dissatisfaction expressed
by would-be college teachers, ac
cording to a study of 100 Dan
forth fellowship recipients re
'eased today by the U.S. Office
of Education.
The students involved in the
study said that they had an ex
pectation of being forced to
take part in publication for its
own sake . . . before they have
something to say.
Students who participated in
the study expected to get the
greatest satisfaction from "work
association, and friendship with
college-age students," and the
intellectual challenge of the aca
demic community.
The most common reason
given for wanting a college
teaching career was: "I felt that
r would make the greatest con
tribution to society in this area."
About a fifth of the Danforth
Fellows wanted to be college
teachers before entering college,
and more than two-fifths had
made such a decision by their
junior year. Virtually all had
decided on this profession by
their senior year.
As new faculty members, the
study participants reported they

wanted to spend about 55 per
cent of their time in teaching
activities. Twenty years later,
they would hope to spend less
time teaching and devote more
time to research and writing.
The students also stated that
they hope to begin their teach
ing careers at the same kind
of institution where they did
their undergraduate study.
