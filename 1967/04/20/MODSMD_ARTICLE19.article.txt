# Texas Coeds Now In Step, Move Modern To Mini Skirts
## 
### 
(ACP) — A small but increas
ing number of University of
Texas coeds have decided to get
in step with the "What's Hap
pening" centers of the world
and to leave men they pass
twisted like pretzels, straining
for a good, long, lasting look,
Peter Heyne writes in the Daily
Texan.
These are the coeds who have
the courage — but often not the
proportions — to wear mini
skirts and dresses.
Essentially, a "mini" is a gar
ment whose hemline ranges
from three (mini-mini) to seven
inches (maxi-mini) above the
knee. It gained popularity two
years ago on London's Carnaby
Street whore the Mod look still
reigns.
Hemline Iron Curtain
In Eastern cities and in Cali
fornia, the mini look is not only
in but is also fairly well estab
lished. However, in the South,
including Texas, Austin, and
consequently the university
women are suffering from a
hemline gap that is being closed
not much faster than grandma
can thread rope through a
needle's eye.
Mrs. Binnie Briggs, owner of
Pizzazz Inc., which stocks lots
of mini clothing, says, "When
ever anyone is leaving town
they come in here to buy a
short dress — they say they
have to have one for where
they are going, which is usually
out of state."
Why do coeds wear minis?
Other than strictly for fashion—
"Simply to attract attention,"
says a former coed. "A lot of
girls are husband-hunting and
want to be noticed by the op

posite sex," adds an assistant
professor of home economics.
Zebra-Striped Hang Up
Noticed they are. "There's not
a moment's doubt that you are
looked at; people practically
hang out windows and wreck
cars to get a good look," says
Mrs. Briggs, recalling the time
she wore her zebra-striped fur
mini down the Drag.
Most mini-wearers say they
wear them primarily to parties,
picnics, and "just generally
messing around." Few wear
them to class, since even dresses
an inch above the knee can ride
up embarrassingly. Teachers, at
times, find short skirts in class
a little rattling. "We may be
teachers, but we are still men,"
a sociology teaching assistant
says. Professors agree, how
ever, that after a while "it all
becomes part of the scenery."
Bend and Sit Exposure
Like all innovations, minis
have their hazards. Wearers say
chief among them are bending
over and sitting down "in a way
as not to be lurid." Most of them
avoid difficulty by slipping into
light tights or textured stock
ings which prevent over-expo
sure while still keeping the sub
ject interesting.
Why haven't more coeds join
ed the mini crowd? First, the
South is one to three years be
hind other parts of the world
in fashion, say clothing buyers
on the Drag. Second, while uni
versity males enjoy mini-watch
ing, they are not yet ready to
see their own girls outfitted in
one. Third, in at least one frosh
dorm, advisers tell girls not to
wear them. In soroities, group
standards prevail. Fourth, not
every coed can suitably wear

one. It takes a special figure —
preferably long, slender legs, a
small waistline, and small bust
line. And fifth, many people
consider the mini downright in
decent.
In spite of all the inhibiting
factors, the adventurous few
will finds lots of mini-cut fash
ions on the market this spring,
fashion buyers say. They will
be primarily of the playwear
variety, such as the mini cu
lotte .which combines the com
fort of shorts with the look of
a dress.
