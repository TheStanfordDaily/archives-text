# Panel Explores Sex Values
## 
### 
A student panel discussion
moderated by keynote speaker
Benson R. Snyder in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium yesterday afternoon
ended the 1967 series of Jake
Gimbel Sex Psychology Lectures
on "Sex and the Invisible Cur
riculum.'
About fifty people came to
hear the discussion, which as a
result of the small size of the
audience, was less formal than
originally planned.
The "Invisible Curriculum" of
the title is defined by Dr. Snyder,
psychiatrist-in-chief at M.1.T., in
an article on the subject, as "the
sum of the nonneurotic stresses
inherent in higher education to
day," the neurotic stresses being

those that a student brings with
him.
The panel was an exploration
of what sort of stresses Stanford
places on an individual and what
sexual values are encouraged as
a result.
Sox As Recreation
David Bell, a senior on the
panel, opened the discussion by
suggesting a continuation of the
conversation the six panelists
had begun with Dr. Snyder at
a luncheon earlier in the day, on
birth-control pills as a cultural
force, the implications for the
University, and the dichotomy
between sex as procreation and
as recreation.
Dr. Snyder discussed the prob

lem of a student health service,
where ideally a physician would
decide on the advisability of pre
scribing any medication, but
where contraception is regarded
not as a medical treatment but
a social issue.
Dr. Maurice Osborn com
mented from the audience on
the fact that in the "very gossipy
reverberating living situation"
that a university can be, doctors
may fear what they are contrib
uting to or what they appear to
be promoting.
Mature Decision
Health Center Psychiatrist
John Maurer, also in the aud
ience, suggested that a mature
decision on whether or not to
have intercourse "should not be
based on the fear of getting preg
nant, and the University should
set itself up to permit decisions
of this type."
A girl in the audience pointed
out that the Health Center's pol
icy was actually easily circum
vented: "you might have to ride
your bike into Palo Alto, but it's
just not that expensive," while
a more liberal policy might be
quite expensive in terms of lost
alumni financial support.
Other panel members, who in
cluded Zan Henson, Bob Yeager,
freshman Denise Holmes, junior
Bill Rosenfeld and senior Liz
Wilson, pointed out open house
hours, housing policy, and living
group pressures as further ele
ments of Stanford's invisible
curriculum that tend to discour
age maturity in personal rela
tionships.

the title is defined by Dr. Snyder,
psychiatrist-in-chief at M.1.T., in
an article on the subject, as "the
sum of the nonneurotic stresses
inherent in higher education to
day," the neurotic stresses being

those that a student brings with
him.
The panel was an exploration
of what sort of stresses Stanford
places on an individual and what
sexual values are encouraged as
a result.
Sox As Recreation
David Bell, a senior on the
panel, opened the discussion by
suggesting a continuation of the
conversation the six panelists
had begun with Dr. Snyder at
a luncheon earlier in the day, on
birth-control pills as a cultural
force, the implications for the
University, and the dichotomy
between sex as procreation and
as recreation.
Dr. Snyder discussed the prob

lem of a student health service,
where ideally a physician would
decide on the advisability of pre
scribing any medication, but
where contraception is regarded
not as a medical treatment but
a social issue.
Dr. Maurice Osborn com
mented from the audience on
the fact that in the "very gossipy
reverberating living situation"
that a university can be, doctors
may fear what they are contrib
uting to or what they appear to
be promoting.
Mature Decision
Health Center Psychiatrist
John Maurer, also in the aud
ience, suggested that a mature
decision on whether or not to
have intercourse "should not be
based on the fear of getting preg
nant, and the University should
set itself up to permit decisions
of this type."
A girl in the audience pointed
out that the Health Center's pol
icy was actually easily circum
vented: "you might have to ride
your bike into Palo Alto, but it's
just not that expensive," while
a more liberal policy might be
quite expensive in terms of lost
alumni financial support.
Other panel members, who in
cluded Zan Henson, Bob Yeager,
freshman Denise Holmes, junior
Bill Rosenfeld and senior Liz
Wilson, pointed out open house
hours, housing policy, and living
group pressures as further ele
ments of Stanford's invisible
curriculum that tend to discour
age maturity in personal rela
tionships.
A student panel discussion
moderated by keynote speaker
Benson R. Snyder in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium yesterday afternoon
ended the 1967 series of Jake
Gimbel Sex Psychology Lectures
on "Sex and the Invisible Cur
riculum.'
About fifty people came to
hear the discussion, which as a
result of the small size of the
audience, was less formal than
originally planned.
