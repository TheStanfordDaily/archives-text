# LIU Student, Faculty Protest Ends
## 
### 
(CPS) — After a two-week
undergraduate strike, the Brook
lyn center of Long Island Uni
versity (LIU) is beginning to
move back to normality.
The strike resulted from the
dismissal of University Provost
Dr. William M. Birenbaum by
LIU Chancellor Ralph Gordon
Hoxie March 13. The student
newspaper, the Seawanhaka,
claimed the move was the "cul
mination of a deep and growing
philosophical, political and edu
cational conflict between the
Provost and the Chancellor."
The dismissal was followed
by a week of angry protests
from students and faculty mem
bers. When the Easter recess
ended on April 3, the Brooklyn
center's student council called
for the strike. Both students
and faculty are now urging
the reinstatement of Birenbaum
and the resignation of Hoxie.
Conservative Chancellor
Dr. Hoxie, a conservative both
politically and educationally, has

long been the target of under
graduate criticism, while Dr.
Birenbaum has had the over
whelming support of students
since he abolished stiff dress
regulations upon his arrival two
years ago.
In ramifications from the
Hoxie-Birenbaum dispute, Char
les Isaacs, LIU student council
president, presented the Board
of Trustees with three addition
al demands for increased stu
dent participation; a guarantee
that tuition would not be raised
for at least three years; pub
lication of the University bud
get for all "genuinely concerned
parties;" and the opening of
University financial records to
"scrutiny by an auditor approv
ed by a student-faculty commit
tee."
These demands stemmed from
a tuition raise from $790 to $846
last semester, when Dr. Hoxie
maintained that a hike was nec
essary, but reportedly reneged
on promises to supply figures

to support his claim. During one
sit-in, students shoved and kick
ed Dr. Hoxie and pelted him
with snow-balls, as he was try
ing to get into his office. Some
demonstrators claimed that he
had deliberately stepped on
them.
No Confidence Vote
The faculty, meanwhile, de
livered a 168 to 32 no confidence
vote against Hoxie and backed
the student-proposed "Univer
sity in exile." This vote came on
April 10, after the Board of
Trustees turned down a demand
for "open-end mediation" of the
disputes from the students. That
same day, the strike spread to
the Southpamton College cam
pus of LIU, also shutting down
that branch.
Student government president
Isaacs criticized the Board of
Trustees and Hoxie for their
actions. He praised the efforts
of board member Rep. Ogden
Reid (R. N.Y.), calling him "one
of the few alive members on

the Board." Isaacs said that "if
we are crushed, the demoraliza
tion would ruin the University."
He hailed the actions of the stu
dent body, noting that "they've
really grown up this year."
Isaacs, who has kept the
sometimes faltering student
strike together, temporarily sus
pended the strike on April 11,
pending "the outcome of fruit
ful negotiations with the board."
Ends and the Means
He noted that "student and
faculty power go hand in hand.
We have a legitimate right to
this power, but we sometimes
have to resort to drastic means
to get it."
At a rally in Brooklyn on April
13, 75 to 80 per cent of the stu
dents voted to suspend their
boycott indefinitely following an
agreement on negotiations
among their representatives, fac
ulty members and university of
ficials.
The agreement provides that
five faculty-student committees
be set up to examine all grie
vances put forth by students.
Although a few students call
ed the pact a "sellout," Isaacs
said that the strike has "accom
plished its purpose and is no
longer necessary."
The committee agreement,
Isaacs added, "is the best means
of establishing participatory
democracy at this university."
The committees will make rec
ommendations on finances, au
tonomy in faculty promotions,
tenure, salary and campus de

velopment; faculty and student
participation in rulings by the
administration; and extracurri
cular programs.
Greater Autonomy
"It has been clearly demon
strated," Isaacs said, "that there
is the need for decentralization
and greater autonomy on a cam
pus-by-campus basis."
Dr. Robert Spector of the LIU
English department, one of the
leaders of faculty opposition to
Hoxie, stated that a chapter of
the United Federation of College
Teachers is being formed on
campus, as an indirect result of
the dispute. Although a mem
ber of the American Association
of University Professors, he
claimed that the AAUP is "too
slow moving."
Concerning the immediate sit
uation at the University, he
said that "Hoxie has now learn
ed the sentiment of LIU. I think
he should resign. This crisis
has great implications: it is the
first time that student power
has been effectively, orderly,
and responsibly organized and
used — successfully."
Ex-provost Birenbaum has re
mained relatively calm about
the entire affair. "The future of
LIU," he remarked, "is great,
whether I'm here or not. It
will never be the same. Neither
the student nor the faculty can
be pushed around now."
"I regret these events," he
said, "but they've consolidated
the University, and made a new
alliance between students, fac
ulty and administration."

13, 75 to 80 per cent of the stu
dents voted to suspend their
boycott indefinitely following an
agreement on negotiations
among their representatives, fac
ulty members and university of
ficials.
The agreement provides that
five faculty-student committees
be set up to examine all grie
vances put forth by students.
Although a few students call
ed the pact a "sellout," Isaacs
said that the strike has "accom
plished its purpose and is no
longer necessary."
The committee agreement,
Isaacs added, "is the best means
of establishing participatory
democracy at this university."
The committees will make rec
ommendations on finances, au
tonomy in faculty promotions,
tenure, salary and campus de

velopment; faculty and student
participation in rulings by the
administration; and extracurri
cular programs.
Greater Autonomy
"It has been clearly demon
strated," Isaacs said, "that there
is the need for decentralization
and greater autonomy on a cam
pus-by-campus basis."
Dr. Robert Spector of the LIU
English department, one of the
leaders of faculty opposition to
Hoxie, stated that a chapter of
the United Federation of College
Teachers is being formed on
campus, as an indirect result of
the dispute. Although a mem
ber of the American Association
of University Professors, he
claimed that the AAUP is "too
slow moving."
Concerning the immediate sit
uation at the University, he
said that "Hoxie has now learn
ed the sentiment of LIU. I think
he should resign. This crisis
has great implications: it is the
first time that student power
has been effectively, orderly,
and responsibly organized and
used — successfully."
Ex-provost Birenbaum has re
mained relatively calm about
the entire affair. "The future of
LIU," he remarked, "is great,
whether I'm here or not. It
will never be the same. Neither
the student nor the faculty can
be pushed around now."
"I regret these events," he
said, "but they've consolidated
the University, and made a new
alliance between students, fac
ulty and administration."
(CPS) — After a two-week
undergraduate strike, the Brook
lyn center of Long Island Uni
versity (LIU) is beginning to
move back to normality.
The strike resulted from the
dismissal of University Provost
Dr. William M. Birenbaum by
LIU Chancellor Ralph Gordon
Hoxie March 13. The student
newspaper, the Seawanhaka,
claimed the move was the "cul
mination of a deep and growing
philosophical, political and edu
cational conflict between the
Provost and the Chancellor."
The dismissal was followed
by a week of angry protests
from students and faculty mem
bers. When the Easter recess
ended on April 3, the Brooklyn
center's student council called
for the strike. Both students
and faculty are now urging
the reinstatement of Birenbaum
and the resignation of Hoxie.
Conservative Chancellor
Dr. Hoxie, a conservative both
politically and educationally, has

long been the target of under
graduate criticism, while Dr.
Birenbaum has had the over
whelming support of students
since he abolished stiff dress
regulations upon his arrival two
years ago.
In ramifications from the
Hoxie-Birenbaum dispute, Char
les Isaacs, LIU student council
president, presented the Board
of Trustees with three addition
al demands for increased stu
dent participation; a guarantee
that tuition would not be raised
for at least three years; pub
lication of the University bud
get for all "genuinely concerned
parties;" and the opening of
University financial records to
"scrutiny by an auditor approv
ed by a student-faculty commit
tee."
These demands stemmed from
a tuition raise from $790 to $846
last semester, when Dr. Hoxie
maintained that a hike was nec
essary, but reportedly reneged
on promises to supply figures

to support his claim. During one
sit-in, students shoved and kick
ed Dr. Hoxie and pelted him
with snow-balls, as he was try
ing to get into his office. Some
demonstrators claimed that he
had deliberately stepped on
them.
No Confidence Vote
The faculty, meanwhile, de
livered a 168 to 32 no confidence
vote against Hoxie and backed
the student-proposed "Univer
sity in exile." This vote came on
April 10, after the Board of
Trustees turned down a demand
for "open-end mediation" of the
disputes from the students. That
same day, the strike spread to
the Southpamton College cam
pus of LIU, also shutting down
that branch.
Student government president
Isaacs criticized the Board of
Trustees and Hoxie for their
actions. He praised the efforts
of board member Rep. Ogden
Reid (R. N.Y.), calling him "one
of the few alive members on

the Board." Isaacs said that "if
we are crushed, the demoraliza
tion would ruin the University."
He hailed the actions of the stu
dent body, noting that "they've
really grown up this year."
Isaacs, who has kept the
sometimes faltering student
strike together, temporarily sus
pended the strike on April 11,
pending "the outcome of fruit
ful negotiations with the board."
Ends and the Means
He noted that "student and
faculty power go hand in hand.
We have a legitimate right to
this power, but we sometimes
have to resort to drastic means
to get it."

that tuition would not be raised
for at least three years; pub
lication of the University bud
get for all "genuinely concerned
parties;" and the opening of
University financial records to
"scrutiny by an auditor approv
ed by a student-faculty commit
tee."
These demands stemmed from
a tuition raise from $790 to $846
last semester, when Dr. Hoxie
maintained that a hike was nec
essary, but reportedly reneged
on promises to supply figures

to support his claim. During one
sit-in, students shoved and kick
ed Dr. Hoxie and pelted him
with snow-balls, as he was try
ing to get into his office. Some
demonstrators claimed that he
had deliberately stepped on
them.
No Confidence Vote
The faculty, meanwhile, de
livered a 168 to 32 no confidence
vote against Hoxie and backed
the student-proposed "Univer
sity in exile." This vote came on
April 10, after the Board of
Trustees turned down a demand
for "open-end mediation" of the
disputes from the students. That
same day, the strike spread to
the Southpamton College cam
pus of LIU, also shutting down
that branch.
Student government president
Isaacs criticized the Board of
Trustees and Hoxie for their
actions. He praised the efforts
of board member Rep. Ogden
Reid (R. N.Y.), calling him "one
of the few alive members on

the Board." Isaacs said that "if
we are crushed, the demoraliza
tion would ruin the University."
He hailed the actions of the stu
dent body, noting that "they've
really grown up this year."
Isaacs, who has kept the
sometimes faltering student
strike together, temporarily sus
pended the strike on April 11,
pending "the outcome of fruit
ful negotiations with the board."
Ends and the Means
He noted that "student and
faculty power go hand in hand.
We have a legitimate right to
this power, but we sometimes
have to resort to drastic means
to get it."
At a rally in Brooklyn on April
13, 75 to 80 per cent of the stu
dents voted to suspend their
boycott indefinitely following an
agreement on negotiations
among their representatives, fac
ulty members and university of
ficials.
The agreement provides that
five faculty-student committees
be set up to examine all grie
vances put forth by students.
Although a few students call
ed the pact a "sellout," Isaacs
said that the strike has "accom
plished its purpose and is no
longer necessary."
The committee agreement,
Isaacs added, "is the best means
of establishing participatory
democracy at this university."
The committees will make rec
ommendations on finances, au
tonomy in faculty promotions,
tenure, salary and campus de

velopment; faculty and student
participation in rulings by the
administration; and extracurri
cular programs.
Greater Autonomy
"It has been clearly demon
strated," Isaacs said, "that there
is the need for decentralization
and greater autonomy on a cam
pus-by-campus basis."
Dr. Robert Spector of the LIU
English department, one of the
leaders of faculty opposition to
Hoxie, stated that a chapter of
the United Federation of College
Teachers is being formed on
campus, as an indirect result of
the dispute. Although a mem
ber of the American Association
of University Professors, he
claimed that the AAUP is "too
slow moving."
Concerning the immediate sit
uation at the University, he
said that "Hoxie has now learn
ed the sentiment of LIU. I think
he should resign. This crisis
has great implications: it is the
first time that student power
has been effectively, orderly,
and responsibly organized and
used — successfully."
Ex-provost Birenbaum has re
mained relatively calm about
the entire affair. "The future of
LIU," he remarked, "is great,
whether I'm here or not. It
will never be the same. Neither
the student nor the faculty can
be pushed around now."
"I regret these events," he
said, "but they've consolidated
the University, and made a new
alliance between students, fac
ulty and administration."
(CPS) — After a two-week
undergraduate strike, the Brook
lyn center of Long Island Uni
versity (LIU) is beginning to
move back to normality.
The strike resulted from the
dismissal of University Provost
Dr. William M. Birenbaum by
LIU Chancellor Ralph Gordon
Hoxie March 13. The student
newspaper, the Seawanhaka,
claimed the move was the "cul
mination of a deep and growing
philosophical, political and edu
cational conflict between the
Provost and the Chancellor."
The dismissal was followed
by a week of angry protests
from students and faculty mem
bers. When the Easter recess
ended on April 3, the Brooklyn
center's student council called
for the strike. Both students
and faculty are now urging
the reinstatement of Birenbaum
and the resignation of Hoxie.
Conservative Chancellor
Dr. Hoxie, a conservative both
politically and educationally, has

long been the target of under
graduate criticism, while Dr.
Birenbaum has had the over
whelming support of students
since he abolished stiff dress
regulations upon his arrival two
years ago.
In ramifications from the
Hoxie-Birenbaum dispute, Char
les Isaacs, LIU student council
president, presented the Board
of Trustees with three addition
al demands for increased stu
dent participation; a guarantee
that tuition would not be raised
for at least three years; pub
lication of the University bud
get for all "genuinely concerned
parties;" and the opening of
University financial records to
"scrutiny by an auditor approv
