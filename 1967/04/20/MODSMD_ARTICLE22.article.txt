# Colorado Prof Guarantees C's
## 
### 
(ACP) — A Colorado State
University professor has his
own ideas about grading — he
would like to give his students
a choice of receiving a guaran
teed C or trying to achieve a
higher grade, the Collegian re
ports.
Edward B. Reed, assistant
professor of zoology, said he
first proposed the system to his
classes last quarter "partly in
fun and partly because a num
ber of students had complained

they were too busy trying to
make grades to learn anything."
The proposal met with mixed
reactions from students in his
limnology and freshwater inver
tebrates classes.
The arbitrary grade is based
on Reed's impression, over the
years, that a grade of C is about
average for his classes. "I don't
plan the grade distribution this
way," he said. "That's just the
way it happens." He added, how
ever, that C is not a popular
grade.

Reed pointed out that his pro
posal would imply a kind of
honor system on the part of stu
dents who chose to receive the
C. They "would be expected to
read the text," he said, "and
they would definitely be expect
ed to attend class."
He said he feels certain the
system would work, at least in
his upper series courses, be
cause students in these courses
see them as being "of definite
value in their careers."
