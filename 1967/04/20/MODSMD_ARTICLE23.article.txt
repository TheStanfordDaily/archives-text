# Alabama Students Back President In Censorship Battle
## 
### 
(CPS) â€”University of Ala
bama students have rallied to
the support of Alabama presi
dent Frank A. Rose following an
attack on university administra
tors by members of the state
legislature and Governor Lur
leen Wallace.
Rose, who said he would re
sign his post rather than bow to
political pressures, came under
fire for supporting the magazine
"Revolution" published in con
nection with the university's
Emphasis '67 speakers program.
"Trash"
State representative Ralph
Slate called the publication
"trash" and asked for the crea
tion of a legislative committee
to investigate the magazine and
its student activity fund finan
cing.
Slate told the Alabama house
that the magazine contained ar
ticles by persons who "want to
turn the university over to the
students to run like they do in
Berkeley, California."
Included in the publication
were articles by Berkeley acti

vist Bettina Aptheker, a Com
munist Party member; Gen.
Earle G. Wheeler; Student Non
violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) leader Stokely Carmi
chael; National Association for
the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) head Roy Wil
kins; Alabama professor Theo
dore Klitzke; and Episcopal
chaplain Earl H. Brill.
No Censorship
Rose stated that "except to
make certain that the material
is not libelous, seditious or ob
scene, the university has never
censored publications by stu
dents" in its history.
A university statement com
mented that "unfortunately, . . .
the good people of this state will
now be led to think that higher
education threatens government.
The implication is the only one
to be drawn from Montgomery."
The governor's office issued a
statement supporting the attack
on the university by Slate and
other legislators.
University officials said, "It is
not just a question of academic

freedom. It is a question of the
right of any American citizen to
express his views, so long as he
does not advocate violent over
throw of the government."
President Rose stated, "I'm
not for sale and the University
of Alabama, as long as I'm presi
dent, is not for sale. It is too
great to become for sale, po
litically or otherwise."
A petition signed by 4,000 Uni
versity of Alabama students
who support Rose will be pre
sented to the university presi
dent by student leaders, accord
ing to Student Government As
sociation president Ralph
Knowles.
Demonstration
Knowles said in an interview
that the state legislature has
"backed off" since its initial at
tack, which included the intro
duction of a bill banning appear
ances by Communists at state
supported colleges. A similar bill
met defeat in the legilsature two
years ago.
Among the signs of student
backing for the university's ad

ministrators was a spontaneous
demonstration on the lawn of
the university president's man
sion, which saw students carry
ing placards with the messages
"This is not Wallace University,"
and "Freedom is a Rose."
The demonstrators also solici
ted money to send a rose to Gov.
Wallace.
Troy State College
Repercussions of the Univer
sity of Alabama controversy
were felt at other schools in the
state.
At Troy State College, the stu
dent newspaper was censored by
the school president, the paper's
adviser, and the college board of
publications.
The paper, the TROPOLITAN,
ran a white square on its edito
rial page, headlined, "A Lament
for Dr. Rose." Under the head
line in the middle of the white
square was the word "censored."
Troy State president Ralph
Adams said "the editor of a pa
per should not criticize its own

er," by which he meant the col
lege's board of trustees. Adams
said the paper "had wide free
dom to criticize professors,
school policy, activities, and
most any other subject or per
son."
Mobile Faculty Protest
The University of South Ala
bama at Mobile is also involved
in the state's higher education
controversy. Several members
of the faculty at Mobile signed
an advertisement expressing
"dismay" over Gov. Wallace's
announced intention to defy fed
eral court orders for desegrega
tion of elementary and second
ary school facilities.
The professors were attacked
by state legislator Mylan R. En
gel, a member of USA's board of
trustees, who called the ad "vi
cious and unfounded."
Engel's speech almost touched
off a massive demonstration on
the USA campus. Instead, a
resolution condemning En g e 1
and defending academic freedom

was drafted. The resolution was
followed by an open air meeting
of 2,000 students at which En
gel, the Wallaces, and the legis
lature came under fire.
The student body presidents
at 12 Alabama colleges have
signed a statement opposing
Gov. Wallace's stance against
desegregation.
