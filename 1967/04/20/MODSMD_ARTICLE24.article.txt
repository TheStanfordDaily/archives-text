# SDS Council Endorses Mass Civil Disobedience
## 
### 
(CPS) —A new program to
train campus organizers and a
plan for "massive civil disobedi
ence" in opposition to the Viet
nam war highlighted the na
tional council meeting of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS) held at Harvard Univer
sity recently.
The "New Left" group as
signed to its Radical Education
Project (REP) the task of train
ing the "teacher-organizers" in

a six- to eight-week program
this summer.
Some delegates expressed dis
pleasure with the action because
it left undecided the methods to
be used by the new staffers. Be
cause of the political diversity
within SDS, the measure's oppo
nents saw in its inexplicitness a
potential source of organization
al dissension.
REP was also given responsi
bility for publishing the SDS
newspaper, "New Left Notes,"

and other related literature. In
stituted this past fall in Ann
Arbor, the research and study
operation will move its offices to
Chicago, where the SDS national
offices are located.
The resolution endorsing
"massive civil disobedience"
calls for demonstrations at the
White House. However, a mo
tion calling for similar protests
during Congressional hearings
on the Selective Service System
was defeated.

Opponents of the anti-draft
protests said that such demon
strations might result in a Se
lective Service law which they
would find less desirable than
the existing system.
In an attempt to solve the
group's financial problems, dele
gates voted to increase dues

from four dollars to five dollars
annually, and to institute a
chapter tax of five dollars per
person to be raised by the
chapter members collectively.
National secretary Greg Cal
vert said that staff members in
the Chicago office had not been
paid their full $30 a week salary
for almost two months.
