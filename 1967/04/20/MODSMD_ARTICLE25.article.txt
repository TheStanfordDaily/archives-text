# Student Tax Credit Faces Hurdles
## 
### 
(CPS) â€”Senator Abraham Ri
bicoff's student tax credit bill
may become a scapegoat for
Senator Russell Long's effort to
assure passage of the controver
sial new presidential election
campaign financing act.
The tax credit measure was
passed in the Senate last Friday
by a 53 to 26 vote as an amend
ment to a House business tax
relief measure. The day before,
the Senate passed another
amendment, introduced by Sen
ator Albert Gore of Tenn., to
repeal the campaign financing
act.
When the bill reaches a Sen
ate-House Conference commit
tee, it is widely assumed that

the Ribicoff amendment will be
deleted along with the other
Senate amendments.
Chairman Wilbur Mills of the
House Ways and Means Com
mittee, where the bill will go
upon Senate passage, has not
yet taken a public position on
student tax credits.
However, an aide of Mills, in
an interview with the Collegiate
Press Service, said, "it's kind of
an expensive proposition, isn't
it? I hope you mention that in
your story."
The cost to the Treasury De
partment is estimated at $1.3
billion annually by 1970. Since
Ribicoff has been introducing
the bill, every year since 1964,
the Administration has also op

posed it largely because of the
prospective cost.
The bill provides credit on the
first $1,500 paid for tuition fees,
books, and supplies for any stu
dent at an institution of higher
education. The amount of the
credit is 75 per cent of the first
$200, 25 per cent of the next $300
and 10 per cent of the next
$1,000.
The maximum credit allow
able for any one student is $325.
