# War Spurs Faculty Letter
## 
### 
The Vietnam conflict and the
Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences met
head on, and the result was a
letter to President Johnson ex
pressing the "overwhelming
fear" of the consequences of
that war and signed by 32 of
the 36 faculty members at the
Center.
Those who signed the letter
had agreed that "Despite the
best intentions of good men, vio
lence feeds upon itself and all
too easily overwhelms and cor
rupts the purposes to which it
is put." The letter made clear

that the 32 signees had come
from divergent backgrounds and
varying degrees of feeling to
ward the Vietnam situation.
The letter from the Center
represents economists (Stan
ford), historians (Rochester,
Yale, Chicago, Virginia, Berke
ley, Dartmouth, and Oregon),
anthropologists and sociologists
(Washington, Davis, and Chi
cago), political scientists and
professors of government and
law (UCLA, Yale, Wisonsin, Ore
gon, and Indiana), as well as
professors in psychiatry and En
glish.
The faculty members fear
"What a great German scholai
called 'the diabolic forces lurk
ing in all violence.' . . . Nor are
we any longer completely cer
tain that we understand the
goals now sought by the Ameri
can presence in Vietnam. We are
increasingly fearful that our po
licies are based upon, and justi
fied by, misleading historical
analogies."
Copies of the letter were alsf
sent to members of the Senate,
Representatives on the Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs, and sev
eral large newspapers.
