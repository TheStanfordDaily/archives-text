san Politics and in Independent Poli
tical Journal, will be in the large
lounge of Tresidder.
Way Right or Left
Rusher, as the Publisher of Nation
al Review, is regarded as one of the
leading advocates of the conservative

position in America today. Scheer, be
sides serving as Managing Editor of
Ramparts, is the author of How the
U.S. got involved in Vietnam.
The two met in a debate in Prince
ton last year. Rusher's reaction to
that initial encounter was that Scheer
"is a very articulate speaker."
"With the program structured such
as it is, we will have a chance to de
bate something beside Vietnam,"
Rusher stated on his arrival at Stan
ford last night.
Original for Goldwater
In his position as a spokesman for
conservative Republicanism, he was
one of the GOP party members who
began the drive to draft Barry Gold
water in 1961.
Referring to the present political
speculation on the Republican party's
Presidential nominee in 1968, Rusher
feels a majority of the Republicans
in the country currently support
Richard Nixon.
"However," Rusher added, "he isn't
necessarily who I would like to see be
nominated." However, Rusher refused
to mention who he sees as the "dark
horse candidate" who could capture
the nomination
