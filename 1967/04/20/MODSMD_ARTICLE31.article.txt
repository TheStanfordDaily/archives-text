# Baseballers Key For Stiff Test With USC, UCLA
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's untested Indians
will get a chance to prove their
baseball prowess this weekend
against a good USC squad and
a come through UCLA team.
This weekend and the next
will be the showdown games in
the Pacific 8 as USC, UCLA, and
Stanford exchange visits. The
team that comes out on top
will earn a trip to Omaha and
a probable NCAA champion
ship.
Stanford, 18-1 overall, has a
2-0 AAWU record. UCLA is 4-0
and USC 3-1 in league play.
The Bruins host the Tribe
Friday afternoon at 2:30 for a
single game. UCLA is 4-0 in the
league; and the question mark
before the season, their pitching,
has definitely cleared up. Al
ways a slugging club, UCLA
now boasts of three top flight
starters.

The Tribe will probably lace
their ace fire bailer, righthander
Rick Kester. It could be quite
a test for the preponderantly
right handed hitting Tribe.
Many of Stanford's games
have been rained out this sea
son which will be a slight ad
vantage for the Bruins. UCLA
has played 40 games while Stan
ford has played 19.
Chances vs. USC
USC has its usual fine team;
however they have lost a game
— a 2-1 extra inning tilt to
Washington State.
Senior second baseman Dick
Swan summed up Stanford's
chances, "We'll hit SC's lefties,
and our pitchers will hold
them." The Trojans have a
good right hander, though, and
he could spell trouble if the In
dians get nervous.

Daro Quiring, Don Rose, and

able pitchers for the Indians.
