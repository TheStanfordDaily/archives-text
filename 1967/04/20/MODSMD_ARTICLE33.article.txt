# The 						ISSUE: Will the draft hurt your business career?
## 
### 
Dear Mr. Kokalas:
Whatever shape the new draft law finally takes, the
fact of military service will continue to be a very real
factor in the career planning of young men
including all six of you students writing these open
letters with me. This is why I am writing each of you
this same open letter on the subject.
Although this letter will deal primarily with the three
direct questions students have raised with me, the
basic question of a citizen's obligation to his country
underlies my thinking throughout. Here are those
specific issues:
1. Why should a student head for a business career
when graduate study for teaching, for example, will
gain him further deferment—or when completing
medical school will gain him a commission if and
when he serves? Why shouldn't a student pick the
Peace Corps or VISTA as "an attractive alternative
to combat?"
2. What chance has a man with a 1-A classification to
get a good job in the first place? Will a company hire
him?
3. Isn't the time spent in service a worse handicap
for a man planning a career in the competitive world
of business than for his classmate who wants to be
a doctor or lawyer?
Although the new draft law may change the rules in
some of these areas, it will not change the fact that
the way a student or a company reacts to the present
situation tells a lot about his or its basic thinking. So
let's consider these issues in order:
1. Other careers provide more deferments.
Look closely at this one. Isn't the student who raises
this point actually saying that he i< reach '° select his
lifetime occupation solely on the basis of a very
short-term draft preference? Isn't this somewhat like
choosing a college major because its classes are held
in a new building?

The Peace Corps and VISTA don't exempt, by the
way, although they can deter. Sufficient deferments,
it appears, may leave one too old to be drafted.
Whether one avoids the draft by going to Canada
or by going to graduate school with only draft
deferment in mind, it is still draft-dodging. And it
seems that those who would have others fulfill their
own military obligations are often the ones who carp
at "selfish" businessmen or vow that business has
questionable ethics.
2. Will a company hire a man who is 1-A?
Yes. Good men are hard to find these days. A
company who wants a certain man would be very
foolish not to hire him just because he hasn't yet
fulfilled his military obligations. You can probably
find companies which won't hire 1-A's, but why look?
There are enough which will. Our own feeling, for
example, is that a man we want now is a man we
will want later as well. We would hope he returns
to Motorola after his service. He will be on military
leave while he is gone; his time of company service
continues; he gets his old job or a comparable one
when he returns. Matter of fact, that's the law.
3. The military detour hurts a young businessman
most.
Many of our own returned veterans rejoin us in more
responsible positions than they had when they left.
Most of these men have achieved a greater maturity
in the service; they have had to adapt themselves
readily to changing situations; they have lived
through hardships and some have faced personal
danger. They know better who they are and what
they want and why—they know the values of
the things they have fought for.
One important thing to be learned in the service is
how better to cope. A man must cope, in business
and out, all his life long. Additionally, many service
men received training which is directly applicable to
their civilian careers. Our own returning servicemen
usually get into the s\\ ing of things at a faster pace
than before. They keep this up and most catch up
quite quickly.

As this letter is written, consideration proceeds on
possible revisions of the draft law. The President's
Commission and the House advisory panel agreed
on two basic questions: that the draft law continues
to be needed, and that younger men should be
drafted first. If I correctly understand large parts of
student opinion, this should be welcomed as
removing many uncertainties in your planning.
No matter what the details of the new draft law may
be, two facts will remain: The government's main
lask will be, as always, determining who will serve
when not all serve. Avoiding service through subter
fuge is a pretty shaky platform upon which to build
a life.
Do my feelings about our specific commitment in
Viet Nam color my thinking about the draft? I am
the father of mid-teenage sons. I believe we have
an absolute responsibility to resist a communist
take-over of the free nations of the world whether
by the use of force from without or subversion
within; this resistance may at times involve us in
military conflict. I also believe an individual who
enjoys and insists upon the inalienable privileges
of a democratic country likewise has an absolute
obligation to protect them; and this obligation may
at times involve him in military service.

a businessman are being published. Other issues
of especial interest to students concerned about
business as a possible career or as a social force
have been discussed in previous open letters.
These letters have appeared regularly since
October. Edward Kokalas is a student at Michigan

THE EFFECT OF THE DRAFT...
is of concern to every student on the 29 campuses
where these open letters between six students and
a businessman are being published. Other issues
of especial interest to students concerned about
business as a possible career or as a social force
have been discussed in previous open letters.
These letters have appeared regularly since
October. Edward Kokalas is a student at Michigan
State. Mr. Galvin welcomes your own comments

Dear Mr. Kokalas:
Whatever shape the new draft law finally takes, the
fact of military service will continue to be a very real
factor in the career planning of young men
including all six of you students writing these open
letters with me. This is why I am writing each of you
this same open letter on the subject.
Although this letter will deal primarily with the three
direct questions students have raised with me, the
basic question of a citizen's obligation to his country
underlies my thinking throughout. Here are those
specific issues:
1. Why should a student head for a business career
when graduate study for teaching, for example, will
gain him further deferment—or when completing
medical school will gain him a commission if and
when he serves? Why shouldn't a student pick the
Peace Corps or VISTA as "an attractive alternative
to combat?"
2. What chance has a man with a 1-A classification to
get a good job in the first place? Will a company hire
him?
3. Isn't the time spent in service a worse handicap
for a man planning a career in the competitive world
of business than for his classmate who wants to be
a doctor or lawyer?
Although the new draft law may change the rules in
some of these areas, it will not change the fact that
the way a student or a company reacts to the present
situation tells a lot about his or its basic thinking. So
let's consider these issues in order:
1. Other careers provide more deferments.
Look closely at this one. Isn't the student who raises
this point actually saying that he i< reach '° select his
lifetime occupation solely on the basis of a very
short-term draft preference? Isn't this somewhat like
choosing a college major because its classes are held
in a new building?

The Peace Corps and VISTA don't exempt, by the
way, although they can deter. Sufficient deferments,
it appears, may leave one too old to be drafted.
Whether one avoids the draft by going to Canada
or by going to graduate school with only draft
deferment in mind, it is still draft-dodging. And it
seems that those who would have others fulfill their
own military obligations are often the ones who carp
at "selfish" businessmen or vow that business has
questionable ethics.
2. Will a company hire a man who is 1-A?
Yes. Good men are hard to find these days. A
company who wants a certain man would be very
foolish not to hire him just because he hasn't yet
fulfilled his military obligations. You can probably
find companies which won't hire 1-A's, but why look?
There are enough which will. Our own feeling, for
example, is that a man we want now is a man we
will want later as well. We would hope he returns
to Motorola after his service. He will be on military
leave while he is gone; his time of company service
continues; he gets his old job or a comparable one
when he returns. Matter of fact, that's the law.
3. The military detour hurts a young businessman
most.
Many of our own returned veterans rejoin us in more
responsible positions than they had when they left.
Most of these men have achieved a greater maturity
in the service; they have had to adapt themselves
readily to changing situations; they have lived
through hardships and some have faced personal
danger. They know better who they are and what
they want and why—they know the values of
the things they have fought for.
One important thing to be learned in the service is
how better to cope. A man must cope, in business
and out, all his life long. Additionally, many service
men received training which is directly applicable to
their civilian careers. Our own returning servicemen
usually get into the s\\ ing of things at a faster pace
than before. They keep this up and most catch up
quite quickly.

As this letter is written, consideration proceeds on
possible revisions of the draft law. The President's
Commission and the House advisory panel agreed
on two basic questions: that the draft law continues
to be needed, and that younger men should be
drafted first. If I correctly understand large parts of
student opinion, this should be welcomed as
removing many uncertainties in your planning.
No matter what the details of the new draft law may
be, two facts will remain: The government's main
lask will be, as always, determining who will serve
when not all serve. Avoiding service through subter
fuge is a pretty shaky platform upon which to build
a life.
Do my feelings about our specific commitment in
Viet Nam color my thinking about the draft? I am
the father of mid-teenage sons. I believe we have
an absolute responsibility to resist a communist
take-over of the free nations of the world whether
by the use of force from without or subversion

obligation to protect them; and this obligation may
at times involve him in military service.

THE EFFECT OF THE DRAFT...
is of concern to every student on the 29 campuses
where these open letters between six students and
a businessman are being published. Other issues
of especial interest to students concerned about
business as a possible career or as a social force
have been discussed in previous open letters.
These letters have appeared regularly since
October. Edward Kokalas is a student at Michigan
State. Mr. Galvin welcomes your own comments

Dear Mr. Kokalas:
Whatever shape the new draft law finally takes, the
fact of military service will continue to be a very real
factor in the career planning of young men
including all six of you students writing these open
letters with me. This is why I am writing each of you
this same open letter on the subject.
Although this letter will deal primarily with the three
direct questions students have raised with me, the
basic question of a citizen's obligation to his country
underlies my thinking throughout. Here are those
specific issues:
1. Why should a student head for a business career
when graduate study for teaching, for example, will
gain him further deferment—or when completing
medical school will gain him a commission if and
when he serves? Why shouldn't a student pick the
Peace Corps or VISTA as "an attractive alternative
to combat?"
2. What chance has a man with a 1-A classification to
get a good job in the first place? Will a company hire
him?
3. Isn't the time spent in service a worse handicap
for a man planning a career in the competitive world
of business than for his classmate who wants to be
a doctor or lawyer?
Although the new draft law may change the rules in
some of these areas, it will not change the fact that
the way a student or a company reacts to the present
situation tells a lot about his or its basic thinking. So
let's consider these issues in order:
1. Other careers provide more deferments.
Look closely at this one. Isn't the student who raises
this point actually saying that he i< reach '° select his
lifetime occupation solely on the basis of a very
short-term draft preference? Isn't this somewhat like
choosing a college major because its classes are held
in a new building?

The Peace Corps and VISTA don't exempt, by the
way, although they can deter. Sufficient deferments,
it appears, may leave one too old to be drafted.
Whether one avoids the draft by going to Canada
or by going to graduate school with only draft
deferment in mind, it is still draft-dodging. And it
seems that those who would have others fulfill their
own military obligations are often the ones who carp
at "selfish" businessmen or vow that business has
questionable ethics.
2. Will a company hire a man who is 1-A?
Yes. Good men are hard to find these days. A
company who wants a certain man would be very
foolish not to hire him just because he hasn't yet
fulfilled his military obligations. You can probably
find companies which won't hire 1-A's, but why look?
There are enough which will. Our own feeling, for
example, is that a man we want now is a man we
will want later as well. We would hope he returns
to Motorola after his service. He will be on military
leave while he is gone; his time of company service
continues; he gets his old job or a comparable one
when he returns. Matter of fact, that's the law.
3. The military detour hurts a young businessman
most.
Many of our own returned veterans rejoin us in more
responsible positions than they had when they left.
Most of these men have achieved a greater maturity
in the service; they have had to adapt themselves
readily to changing situations; they have lived
through hardships and some have faced personal
danger. They know better who they are and what
they want and why—they know the values of
the things they have fought for.

and out, all his life long. Additionally, many service
