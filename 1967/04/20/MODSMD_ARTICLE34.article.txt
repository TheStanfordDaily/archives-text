# Stanford Hosts Nation's Two Top-Ranked Tennis Powers
## 
### NICK SELBY 
The two best college tennis
teams In the country — U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. — charge onto the
Stanford courts this weekend
for matches with underdog but
steadily improving Tribe teams.
The Trojans and Bruins both
clobbered the Card netters 9 0
in matches in Southern Califor
nia two weeks ago, and unfortu
nately for coach Dick Gould's
charges, are unbelievably favor
ed to repeat the feat.
But Gould is hoping that large
crowds and the consequent
home advantage, plus some
super • performances from his
lower-numbered players, will re
duce the margin.
The UCLA contest starts at
2:00 Friday afternoon, as does
the Saturday match with USC.

U.C.L.A. features lan Crook
endon in the number one posi
tion against Stanford's Brian
Leek. Crookendon finished sec
ond in the National Indoor In
tercollegiate Tournament be
hind U.S.C.'s number one, Stan
Smith.
Crookendon is also twice a
national doubles champion, hav

ing teamed with Arthur Ashe in
1965 and Chuck Pasarell in 1966.
Gary Rose will go in the
number two slot against Stan
ford's Dean Schlobaum. Rose, a
senior, was eliminated in the
national indoors by Smith, but
still boasts considerable talent.
In the number three slot for
the Tribe will be senior Craig
Baise. The hard-working Baise
will also team with Leek for
Stanford's number one doubles
team.
Rounding out the top six for

the Tribe are Chuck Alloo in
the fourth slot, Dale Wong in
the fifth, and Rick Reed in the
sixth position. Jamie Carroll and
Alloo will go in second doubles,
and Chuck Herlands and Wong
will serve in third doubles.
The only changes in the Stan
ford lineup for the USC match
will be John McCabe at the
number six spot in place of
Reed, and Brad Cornell with
Dean Schlobom in third dou
bles.
Terrifying Trojans
Besides winning the National
Indoor tournament, Smith also
won the Southern California
Championships. He defeated his
teammate Bob Lutz there by the
slim margin of 6-4 and 7-5.
The two make a terrifying
pair when teamed as doubles
partners, a sadistic combination
Trojans play here. The third top
U.S.C. star is Joaquin Loyo-
Mayo.
Stanford will probably have
a better chance against U.S.C.
than U.C.L.A. because of the
Bruins greater depth. Despite
U.S.C.'s top three stars, the
Bruins won a recent dual match
6y 4 -2tt.

national doubles champion, hav

ing teamed with Arthur Ashe in
1965 and Chuck Pasarell in 1966.
Gary Rose will go in the
number two slot against Stan
ford's Dean Schlobaum. Rose, a
senior, was eliminated in the
national indoors by Smith, but
still boasts considerable talent.
In the number three slot for
the Tribe will be senior Craig
Baise. The hard-working Baise
will also team with Leek for
Stanford's number one doubles
team.
Rounding out the top six for

the Tribe are Chuck Alloo in
the fourth slot, Dale Wong in
the fifth, and Rick Reed in the
sixth position. Jamie Carroll and
Alloo will go in second doubles,
and Chuck Herlands and Wong
will serve in third doubles.
The only changes in the Stan
ford lineup for the USC match
will be John McCabe at the
number six spot in place of
Reed, and Brad Cornell with
Dean Schlobom in third dou
bles.
Terrifying Trojans
Besides winning the National
Indoor tournament, Smith also
won the Southern California
Championships. He defeated his
teammate Bob Lutz there by the
slim margin of 6-4 and 7-5.
The two make a terrifying
pair when teamed as doubles
partners, a sadistic combination
Trojans play here. The third top
U.S.C. star is Joaquin Loyo-
Mayo.
Stanford will probably have
a better chance against U.S.C.
than U.C.L.A. because of the
Bruins greater depth. Despite
U.S.C.'s top three stars, the
Bruins won a recent dual match
6y 4 -2tt.

The two best college tennis
teams In the country — U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. — charge onto the
Stanford courts this weekend
for matches with underdog but
steadily improving Tribe teams.
The Trojans and Bruins both
clobbered the Card netters 9 0
in matches in Southern Califor
nia two weeks ago, and unfortu
nately for coach Dick Gould's
charges, are unbelievably favor
ed to repeat the feat.
But Gould is hoping that large
crowds and the consequent
home advantage, plus some
super • performances from his
lower-numbered players, will re
duce the margin.
The UCLA contest starts at
2:00 Friday afternoon, as does
the Saturday match with USC.
