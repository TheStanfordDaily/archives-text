# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Free Speechâ€”Students Only 
### Art Buchwald 
The free speech movements
on various campuses have be
come more militant in recent
months and I naturally was in
terested to know what they
were up to. So I went over to
the Sitdown Institute of Tech
nology to confer with an organ
ization called the Students for
Utterly Free Speech and the
Preservation of Democratic In
stitutions Through the Ex

change of Ideas Movement.
The young man in charge of
the organization was very happy
to speak to me.
"Sir," I said, "what is the
purpose of the Students for Ut
terly Free Speech?"
"Our main purpose is to keep
speakers who come to college
campuses from speaking."
"That's a very idealist goal,"
I said. "How do you do this?"

"It's quite simple. When the
speaker starts talking we begin
to heckle and shout at him so
he can't be heard. The more he
persists, the noisier we get and
pretty soon everyone Is shout
ing and if we're lucky it turns
into a brawl."
If s For Ourselves
"This probably sounds like a
stupid question but if your or
ganization is presumably for
free speech, why don't you let
the speaker say what he has
on his mind?"
"But we're not for free speech
for the speaker. We're for free
speech for ourselves. We de
mand the right to interrupt any
body any time he opens his
mouth. This is still a demo
cratic country and we have a
right to prevent anyone we want
from speaking."
"But if you don't hear what
the speaker has to say, how do
you know you disagree with
him?"
"We know we disagree with
him before he comes. Anything
he says might just confuse us.
We're not fools, you know."
"I didn't say you were," I
said. "But let's say, for argu
ment's sake, that a speaker may
have something new to add to
the debate. Don't you think he
should be able to put forth his
position at the university?"
Act, Not Listen
"None of the speakers has
anything new to say. Besides,
if we let one speaker put forth
his arguments, then we'd have
to let other speakers put forth
their arguments, and pretty

soon you'd have all sorts of
ideas floating around and it
would hurt the free speech
movement."
"How could it hurt the free
speech movement?"
"Well, our members don't
want to sit around listening to
people making a lot of speeches
all day. They like action. That's
why they joined the free speech
movement. We prefer to boo
and shout a lot. It gets rid of
our hostilities."
"I can see that. But on the
other hand, look at it from the
speaker's point of view. He's
probably worked on his speech
for several days; taken time off
to come to the university.
Shouldn't he be allowed to
talk?"
Four Letter Words
"It's not our fault he went
to all that trouble. If he were
smart he would have just writ
ten the opening lines of his
speech, and we would have seen
to it that no one knew that was
all he had to say. We'll co-oper
ate with a speaker if he co-op
erates with us."
"Is there any situation where
you would allow a speaker to
finish his speech?"
"We don't like to make ex
ceptions but I guess if he used
four-letter words we might let
him finish. You see, our free
speech movement believes we
should be allowed to use four
letter words."
"How do four-letter words
contribute to the cause of free
speech?"
"It helps us understand the
exchange of ideas."
