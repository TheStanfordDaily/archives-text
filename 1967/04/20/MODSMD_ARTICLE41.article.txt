## Reasons For Anti-Communism 
### Fritz Schaefer 
The New Left has told us that
in order to understand the "im
moral" nature of the war in
Vietnam, "you have to get off
that anti-Communist kick. And
yet, in 1967, I feel that there are
still good reasons to be a sen
sible anti-Communist (I can't
think of a single reason to be
an anti-Communist of the Rob
ert Welch variety). Today, as
was the case twenty years ago,
Communism is still the greatest
single barrier between man and
his basic freedoms.
The Berlin Wall is still stand
ing. East Germans trying to es
cape to the West are still shot
as they leap over the wall. Is
this the freedom that the New
Left extols?
The Eastern European satel
lite governments are just finish
ing up an effective job of elimi
nating freedom of religion from
their countries. The Soviet Un
ion has been working to kill God
for so long that there's little left
for them to destroy and all we

hear about now are occasional
persecutions of the Jews.
Over in China, that admirable
humanitarian Mao Tse-tung con
tinues not only to deny his peo
ple all of the basic freedoms, but
also to place strict adherence to
the divine revelations of Mao
ahead of less important issues
such as food for the people of
China. Where is the nobleness
of which the New Left speaks?
Fidel Castro got the Cubans
to overthrow the dictatorship of
Batista. But no sooner was Cas
tro in control than did he set up
his own Marxist dictatorship,
the result of which has put the
people of Cuba in an even worse
plight that that which they en
countered previously.
Nowhere in the world do So
viet-inspired Communism and
liberty coexist. It is a fact that
Communism and dictatorship
walk hand in hand in today's
world.
And yet there are signs that
indicate that the Communists

are softening. In the Soviet Un
ion and Eastern Europe it is be
coming difficult to distinguish
Communism from socialism.
The example of Rumania gives
hope that someday there may
actually be freedom in these
lands.
If the Communist-controlled
countries continue in the direc
tion in which some of them ap
pear headed and do eventually
attain democracy, historians will
look back and see clearly the
writing on the wall. Communism
will have softened because the
United States refused to allow
Communist aggression to be
profitable.
After facing repeated setbacks
in foreign aggression — Greece,
Korea, Lebanon, the Cuban mis
sile crisis, the Dominican Re
public, and yes, South Vietnam
—the Communists find that the
crying needs of their own peo
ple can no longer be put off by
empty promises of global su
premacy.

Communism becomes social
ism when the Communists are
forced to face the injustices
within their own countries in
order to avert massive revolu
tions of the type which even the
militaristic Communistic
regimes could not handle.
American Foreign Policy
should have as its primary aim
the cultivation of mutual under
standing and respect between
the Soviet Union and the United
States. The new Consular Trea
ty with Russia is a commenda
ble move towards understand
ing, and the proposed East-West
Trade Bill appears to be another
appropriate step.
But it must be remembered
that these achievements have
only been made possible by the
firm commitment of four Amer
ican Presidents, including Presi
dent Kennedy, to the proposition
that Communism must be con
tained. This is the proposition
for which Americans are fight
ing in South Vietnam.

The New Left has told us that
in order to understand the "im
moral" nature of the war in
Vietnam, "you have to get off
that anti-Communist kick. And
yet, in 1967, I feel that there are
still good reasons to be a sen
sible anti-Communist (I can't
think of a single reason to be
an anti-Communist of the Rob

was the case twenty years ago,
Communism is still the greatest
single barrier between man and
his basic freedoms.
The Berlin Wall is still stand

this the freedom that the New

The Eastern European satel

their countries. The Soviet Un

hear about now are occasional
persecutions of the Jews.
Over in China, that admirable

Fidel Castro got the Cubans

If the Communist-controlled
countries continue in the direc

After facing repeated setbacks

empty promises of global su
