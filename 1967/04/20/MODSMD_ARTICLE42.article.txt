## Lane: Invitation To Debate 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The various scholars, lawyers
and other critics who have stu
died the Warren Commission Re
port and contrasted its findings
with the Commission's own evi
dence are worse than Senator
McMarthy, states your Mr. Kap
lan. He then uses the word
"reckless" to describe the critics.
When I invited Mr. Kaplan to
a debate so that the student
body at Stanford might better
judge his harsh condemnation
against the facts, he declined. I
suggested that he bring his own
moderator and his own set of

rules for the debate. Mr. Kap
lan was quoted on the front
page of your newspaper as fol
lows: "I'd sooner enter a stink
ing match with a skunk ..."
One can appreciate his prefer
ence for a contest where vic
tory appears more certain but
issue was joined with the cri
tics by Mr. Kaplan.
His accusations of "distortion"
and "misrepresentation" require
exploration. My book, Rush To
Judgment, has been reviewed
by hundreds of critics including
judges, lawyers and scholars.
The almost five thousand ref
erences and citations present
there have not yet been chal
lenged by a responsible critic.
Under the circumstances Mr.
Kaplan's hysterical generalities
deserve severe public scrutiny.
It is for that reason that I have
invited him to a public confron
tation. His refusal to support
his charges in open debate may
indicate a lack of intellectual
commitment to his highly pub
licized view.
Therefore, should some stu
dent organization on the cam
pus invite me to do so (328-0420,
860 Lathrop Drive, Stanford) I
will appear at a public meeting
after giving suitable notice to
Mr. Kaplan. Should he fail to
appear I will answer every ir
responsible allegation that he
has made in his emotional de
fense of a discredited document.

A hearty second to Mr. Fletch
er Knebel's nomination for Pres
ident of the United States of a
man dedicated to population sta
bilization and abolition of the
atom bomb. The University
could lead the way in this direc
tion by establishing a new school
under the title "SCHOOL FOR
HUMANITY" with departments
as follows: International Under
standing, Population, Pollution,
Conservation, Urban Amenities,
Environmental Engineering, Ra
cial Problems, Poverty, etc., etc.
Those of us who feel strongly
about or more of the above
might feel less guilty about tak
ing time from other duties for
our efforts if we were supported
by University departments.

• Wrong Equation
Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum's plea for
reflection and self-criticism on
the part of those at Stanford
who oppose the Vietnam war
seems to have been made with
total disregard for present reali
ties. Certainly self-questioning
is an indispensable quality of
the civilized man, but it is ab
surd to assume that the process
should preclude the adoption of
a firm moral position.
There are times when moral
outrage must be the response
of those who are concerned
with the fate of other human
beings. This is such a time,
since it is obvious that one par
ticipant in the controversy over
the war has long since abandon
ed reflection and self-criticism
in favor of action.
To put it bluntly, for the past
several years the U.S. govern
ment has been slaughtering
Vietnamese peasants in increas
ing numbers, with massive fire
power and a tonnage of bombs
that already exceeds the highest
rates of World War 11.
Professors Brown, Ruotolo,
Novak, et al have been writing
and speaking in opposition to
this continuing slaughter, with
statements that have been nei--
their uninformed nor unrefiec
tive. Yet, according to Mr.
Ketchum, "they have engaged
in the same thoughtless aggres
sion and uncritical moral certi
tude which they impute to our
government."
To equate reasoned protest

against war with the act of war
itself involves a kind of lo*?ic
which perhaps only a graduate
student in philosophy can un
derstand. It is a kind of logic
which ignores the actual fact
of human pain and bloodshed
and which confuses commitment
with violence.
I have the ghastly feeling
that on the day when a hydro
gen bomb is finally being load
ed for delivery, Mr. Ketchum
will still be urging the rest of
us to reflect, become informed,
and engage in debate, before we
take a position on the matter.

This is an open letter to the
women's residences at Stanford.
Due to the excessive rain the
peninsula has witnessed of late,
Burbank House has undertaken
the construction of an Ark. In
conjunction with this project,
Burbank is seeking to find a
women's residence interested in
helping to preserve the race.
If it stops raining, Burbank is
willing to preserve the race any
way.

• Technocrat
Editor, the Dally:
As a future member of the
Grand Order of Technocrats,
and as someone extremely con
cerned about the role of tech
nology in our society, I am dis
turbed by some of the recent
criticism of SRI. Heaven knows,
a critical reevaluation of the
Technological Establishment is
needed. But the blanket accusa
tions of the SRI-baiters aren't
accomplishing this very well.
Their thesis, as far as I can
see, is that the technical indus
tries are part of a great confed
eracy designed to further the
aims of The System (whatever
that is)—these aims being prin
cipally imperialistic war. Conse
quently, SRI and everyone con
nected with it are guilty of im
moral acts, and are to be con
demned. I only wish it were that
simple.
Technology is an amoral
creature. Like fire or the stone
ax, it is a tool, and its moral
force lies in the hands of the
user. The technologist as tech
nologist answers the questions:
"Can this device be made? Given
the state of the art, what is the
best way to make it?"
Human Responsibility
Presumably there are objec
tive answers to these questions,
and a technologist who allows
his preconceptions (moral or
otherwise) to interfere with his
objectivity in finding them is
serving neither technology nor
morality. However, the question
that the technologist as human
being must also ask is: "Should
it be made?" The great danger
is that too many technologists
are abdicating their human re
sponsibility for asking this
question.
To make things even worse,
scientific projects have a nasty
habit of refusing to stay within
neat moral boxes. Thus, a de
fense-oriented project to study
the effect of fallout on post
atomic agriculture leads to a
model for determining the optim
al agricultural use of land in
present-day underdeveloped
countries—and SRI works as

hard on the latter application a
on the former. Fundamental r<
search into the structure of mai
ter led to a deeper understand
ing of our world—and to therm<
nuclear weapons. Where do w
draw the line? At what poin
must we say: "This far, and n>
farther"?
Constructive, Too
SRI has been singled out fq
attack because it is close ti
home, and discrediting the Stan
ford Establishment is always i
progressive thing to do. In fact
SRI (and Stanford generally) i
probably one of the less culpabll
members of the Technologlca
Establishment. I am going to i
seminar tonight, given by ai
SRI staff member; the topic is;
"Analysis of Alternative Meth
ods of Improving Racial Balanct
in a School District". Real war
crime stuff.
SRI probably has a lower per
centage of specifically defense
oriented projects with prede
fined objectives, and its stafl
members probably exercise more
control and restraint over th«
direction of their research, than
is normally the case in the tech
nical industries. SRI isn't inno
cent; no technologist is. But ij
SRI must accept collective guilt
for its destructive
shouldn't it also take collective
credit for its constructive ones?
Moral Questions
Should an SRI scientist who Is
engaged in what he believes to
be interesting and genuinely usf
ful work, and who knows thai
most other places where he
could work would be worse, quit
his job because he disapproves
of the project that the group
down the hall is doing? There
are moral questions here, and
the answers aren't obvious. And
it's possible that Stanford engi
neers ask them more often than
you think.
I am not indulging in this pole
mic simply out of annoyance. I
think it is vitally important that
we take a long, critical look at
where technology is taking us.
One of the main obstacles to do
ing this is the widespread separ
ation of technical knowledge
from decision-making power and
responsibility. The technician is
treated as a machine which ans
wers the question "Can it be
made?", and all too often, he ac
cepts this position.
System Rolls On
The politicians and business
men who hire him don't have the
technical knowledge (even il
they have the inclination) to
evaluate all the implications of
"Should it be made?" And the
tragedy is that most of the vocal
minority who perceive that some
thing is very wrong with this
arrangement have such stereo
typed ideas of Technocracy that
they really cannot offer effective
criticism, and attack the abstrac
tion without ever quite under
standing what it is, or how it
works. Meanwhile, The System'
rolls on, and nobody pays too
much attention to the picket
signs.
Many scientists and engineers
in the Stanford community, my
self included, don't like this situ
ation. But we are close enough
to it to realize that, unfortun
ately, crying "We Accuse!' is not
really a way out, and that
object of "accuse" is very hara
to pin down.
If we are going to pin it down
—and I believe we must —some
lines of communication between
the technologists and the pro
testors will have to be opened up,
and shouting "Murderer!" a f
SRI isn't the way to do this.
Andrew Kopkind has written
that planning (social or techno
logical) is too important to be
left to the planners. Perhaps
criticism, on these issues, is also
too important to be left to the
critics.

men who hire him don't have the
technical knowledge (even il
they have the inclination) to
evaluate all the implications of
"Should it be made?" And the
tragedy is that most of the vocal
minority who perceive that some
thing is very wrong with this
arrangement have such stereo
typed ideas of Technocracy that
they really cannot offer effective
criticism, and attack the abstrac
tion without ever quite under
standing what it is, or how it
works. Meanwhile, The System'
rolls on, and nobody pays too
much attention to the picket
signs.
Many scientists and engineers
in the Stanford community, my
self included, don't like this situ
ation. But we are close enough
to it to realize that, unfortun
ately, crying "We Accuse!' is not
really a way out, and that
object of "accuse" is very hara
to pin down.
If we are going to pin it down
—and I believe we must —some
lines of communication between
the technologists and the pro
testors will have to be opened up,
and shouting "Murderer!" a f
SRI isn't the way to do this.
Andrew Kopkind has written
that planning (social or techno
logical) is too important to be
left to the planners. Perhaps
criticism, on these issues, is also
too important to be left to the
critics.

The various scholars, lawyers
and other critics who have stu
died the Warren Commission Re
port and contrasted its findings
with the Commission's own evi
dence are worse than Senator
McMarthy, states your Mr. Kap
lan. He then uses the word
"reckless" to describe the critics.
When I invited Mr. Kaplan to
a debate so that the student
body at Stanford might better
judge his harsh condemnation
against the facts, he declined. I
suggested that he bring his own
moderator and his own set of

rules for the debate. Mr. Kap
lan was quoted on the front
page of your newspaper as fol
lows: "I'd sooner enter a stink
ing match with a skunk ..."
One can appreciate his prefer
ence for a contest where vic
tory appears more certain but
issue was joined with the cri
tics by Mr. Kaplan.
His accusations of "distortion"
and "misrepresentation" require
exploration. My book, Rush To
Judgment, has been reviewed
by hundreds of critics including
judges, lawyers and scholars.
The almost five thousand ref
erences and citations present
there have not yet been chal
lenged by a responsible critic.
Under the circumstances Mr.
Kaplan's hysterical generalities
deserve severe public scrutiny.
It is for that reason that I have
invited him to a public confron
tation. His refusal to support
his charges in open debate may
indicate a lack of intellectual
commitment to his highly pub
licized view.
Therefore, should some stu
dent organization on the cam
pus invite me to do so (328-0420,
860 Lathrop Drive, Stanford) I
will appear at a public meeting
after giving suitable notice to
Mr. Kaplan. Should he fail to
appear I will answer every ir
responsible allegation that he
has made in his emotional de
fense of a discredited document.

Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum's plea for
reflection and self-criticism on
the part of those at Stanford
who oppose the Vietnam war
seems to have been made with
total disregard for present reali
ties. Certainly self-questioning
is an indispensable quality of
the civilized man, but it is ab
surd to assume that the process
should preclude the adoption of
a firm moral position.
There are times when moral
outrage must be the response
of those who are concerned
with the fate of other human
beings. This is such a time,
since it is obvious that one par
ticipant in the controversy over
the war has long since abandon
ed reflection and self-criticism
in favor of action.
To put it bluntly, for the past
several years the U.S. govern
ment has been slaughtering
Vietnamese peasants in increas
ing numbers, with massive fire
power and a tonnage of bombs
that already exceeds the highest
rates of World War 11.
Professors Brown, Ruotolo,
Novak, et al have been writing
and speaking in opposition to
this continuing slaughter, with
statements that have been nei--
their uninformed nor unrefiec
tive. Yet, according to Mr.
Ketchum, "they have engaged
in the same thoughtless aggres
sion and uncritical moral certi
tude which they impute to our
government."
To equate reasoned protest

against war with the act of war
itself involves a kind of lo*?ic
which perhaps only a graduate
student in philosophy can un
derstand. It is a kind of logic
which ignores the actual fact
of human pain and bloodshed
and which confuses commitment
with violence.
I have the ghastly feeling
that on the day when a hydro
gen bomb is finally being load
ed for delivery, Mr. Ketchum
will still be urging the rest of
us to reflect, become informed,
and engage in debate, before we
take a position on the matter.

• Technocrat
Editor, the Dally:
As a future member of the
Grand Order of Technocrats,
and as someone extremely con
cerned about the role of tech
nology in our society, I am dis
turbed by some of the recent
criticism of SRI. Heaven knows,
a critical reevaluation of the
Technological Establishment is
needed. But the blanket accusa
tions of the SRI-baiters aren't
accomplishing this very well.
Their thesis, as far as I can
see, is that the technical indus
tries are part of a great confed
eracy designed to further the
aims of The System (whatever
that is)—these aims being prin
cipally imperialistic war. Conse
quently, SRI and everyone con
nected with it are guilty of im
moral acts, and are to be con
demned. I only wish it were that
simple.
Technology is an amoral
creature. Like fire or the stone
ax, it is a tool, and its moral
force lies in the hands of the
user. The technologist as tech
nologist answers the questions:
"Can this device be made? Given
the state of the art, what is the
best way to make it?"
Human Responsibility
Presumably there are objec
tive answers to these questions,
and a technologist who allows
his preconceptions (moral or
otherwise) to interfere with his
objectivity in finding them is
serving neither technology nor
morality. However, the question
that the technologist as human
being must also ask is: "Should
it be made?" The great danger
is that too many technologists
are abdicating their human re
sponsibility for asking this
question.
To make things even worse,
scientific projects have a nasty
habit of refusing to stay within
neat moral boxes. Thus, a de
fense-oriented project to study
the effect of fallout on post
atomic agriculture leads to a
model for determining the optim
al agricultural use of land in
present-day underdeveloped
countries—and SRI works as

hard on the latter application a
on the former. Fundamental r<
search into the structure of mai
ter led to a deeper understand
ing of our world—and to therm<
nuclear weapons. Where do w
draw the line? At what poin
must we say: "This far, and n>
farther"?
Constructive, Too
SRI has been singled out fq
attack because it is close ti
home, and discrediting the Stan
ford Establishment is always i
progressive thing to do. In fact
SRI (and Stanford generally) i
probably one of the less culpabll
members of the Technologlca
Establishment. I am going to i
seminar tonight, given by ai
SRI staff member; the topic is;
"Analysis of Alternative Meth
ods of Improving Racial Balanct
in a School District". Real war
crime stuff.
SRI probably has a lower per
centage of specifically defense
oriented projects with prede
fined objectives, and its stafl
members probably exercise more
control and restraint over th«
direction of their research, than
is normally the case in the tech
nical industries. SRI isn't inno
cent; no technologist is. But ij
SRI must accept collective guilt
for its destructive
shouldn't it also take collective
credit for its constructive ones?
Moral Questions
Should an SRI scientist who Is
engaged in what he believes to
be interesting and genuinely usf
ful work, and who knows thai
most other places where he
could work would be worse, quit
his job because he disapproves
of the project that the group
down the hall is doing? There
are moral questions here, and
the answers aren't obvious. And
it's possible that Stanford engi
neers ask them more often than
you think.
I am not indulging in this pole
mic simply out of annoyance. I
think it is vitally important that
we take a long, critical look at
where technology is taking us.
One of the main obstacles to do
ing this is the widespread separ
ation of technical knowledge
from decision-making power and
responsibility. The technician is
treated as a machine which ans
wers the question "Can it be
made?", and all too often, he ac
cepts this position.

centage of specifically defense
oriented projects with prede
fined objectives, and its stafl
members probably exercise more
control and restraint over th«
direction of their research, than
is normally the case in the tech
nical industries. SRI isn't inno
cent; no technologist is. But ij
SRI must accept collective guilt
for its destructive
shouldn't it also take collective
credit for its constructive ones?
Moral Questions
Should an SRI scientist who Is
engaged in what he believes to
be interesting and genuinely usf
ful work, and who knows thai
most other places where he
could work would be worse, quit
his job because he disapproves
of the project that the group
down the hall is doing? There
are moral questions here, and
the answers aren't obvious. And
it's possible that Stanford engi
neers ask them more often than
you think.
I am not indulging in this pole
mic simply out of annoyance. I
think it is vitally important that
we take a long, critical look at
where technology is taking us.
One of the main obstacles to do
ing this is the widespread separ
ation of technical knowledge
from decision-making power and
responsibility. The technician is
treated as a machine which ans
wers the question "Can it be
made?", and all too often, he ac
cepts this position.
System Rolls On
The politicians and business
men who hire him don't have the
technical knowledge (even il
they have the inclination) to
evaluate all the implications of
"Should it be made?" And the
tragedy is that most of the vocal
minority who perceive that some
thing is very wrong with this
arrangement have such stereo
typed ideas of Technocracy that
they really cannot offer effective
criticism, and attack the abstrac
tion without ever quite under
standing what it is, or how it
works. Meanwhile, The System'
rolls on, and nobody pays too
much attention to the picket
signs.
Many scientists and engineers
in the Stanford community, my
self included, don't like this situ
ation. But we are close enough
to it to realize that, unfortun
ately, crying "We Accuse!' is not
really a way out, and that
object of "accuse" is very hara
to pin down.
If we are going to pin it down
—and I believe we must —some
lines of communication between
the technologists and the pro
testors will have to be opened up,
and shouting "Murderer!" a f
SRI isn't the way to do this.
Andrew Kopkind has written
that planning (social or techno
logical) is too important to be
left to the planners. Perhaps
criticism, on these issues, is also
too important to be left to the
critics.

The various scholars, lawyers
and other critics who have stu
died the Warren Commission Re
port and contrasted its findings
with the Commission's own evi
dence are worse than Senator
McMarthy, states your Mr. Kap
lan. He then uses the word
"reckless" to describe the critics.
When I invited Mr. Kaplan to
a debate so that the student
body at Stanford might better
judge his harsh condemnation
against the facts, he declined. I
suggested that he bring his own
moderator and his own set of

rules for the debate. Mr. Kap
lan was quoted on the front
page of your newspaper as fol
lows: "I'd sooner enter a stink
ing match with a skunk ..."
One can appreciate his prefer
ence for a contest where vic
tory appears more certain but
issue was joined with the cri
tics by Mr. Kaplan.
His accusations of "distortion"
and "misrepresentation" require
exploration. My book, Rush To
Judgment, has been reviewed
by hundreds of critics including
judges, lawyers and scholars.
The almost five thousand ref
erences and citations present
there have not yet been chal
lenged by a responsible critic.
Under the circumstances Mr.
Kaplan's hysterical generalities
deserve severe public scrutiny.
It is for that reason that I have
invited him to a public confron
tation. His refusal to support
his charges in open debate may
indicate a lack of intellectual
commitment to his highly pub
licized view.
Therefore, should some stu
dent organization on the cam
pus invite me to do so (328-0420,
860 Lathrop Drive, Stanford) I
will appear at a public meeting
after giving suitable notice to
Mr. Kaplan. Should he fail to
appear I will answer every ir

has made in his emotional de

Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum's plea for
reflection and self-criticism on
the part of those at Stanford
who oppose the Vietnam war
seems to have been made with
total disregard for present reali
ties. Certainly self-questioning
is an indispensable quality of
the civilized man, but it is ab
surd to assume that the process
should preclude the adoption of
a firm moral position.
There are times when moral
outrage must be the response
of those who are concerned
with the fate of other human
beings. This is such a time,
since it is obvious that one par
ticipant in the controversy over
the war has long since abandon
ed reflection and self-criticism
in favor of action.
To put it bluntly, for the past
several years the U.S. govern
ment has been slaughtering
Vietnamese peasants in increas
ing numbers, with massive fire
power and a tonnage of bombs
that already exceeds the highest
rates of World War 11.
Professors Brown, Ruotolo,
Novak, et al have been writing
and speaking in opposition to
this continuing slaughter, with
statements that have been nei--
their uninformed nor unrefiec
tive. Yet, according to Mr.
Ketchum, "they have engaged
in the same thoughtless aggres
sion and uncritical moral certi
tude which they impute to our
government."
To equate reasoned protest

against war with the act of war
itself involves a kind of lo*?ic
which perhaps only a graduate
student in philosophy can un
derstand. It is a kind of logic
which ignores the actual fact
of human pain and bloodshed
and which confuses commitment
with violence.
I have the ghastly feeling
that on the day when a hydro
gen bomb is finally being load
ed for delivery, Mr. Ketchum
will still be urging the rest of
us to reflect, become informed,
and engage in debate, before we
take a position on the matter.

Editor, the Dally:
As a future member of the
Grand Order of Technocrats,
and as someone extremely con
cerned about the role of tech
nology in our society, I am dis
turbed by some of the recent
criticism of SRI. Heaven knows,
a critical reevaluation of the
Technological Establishment is
needed. But the blanket accusa
tions of the SRI-baiters aren't
accomplishing this very well.
Their thesis, as far as I can
see, is that the technical indus
tries are part of a great confed
eracy designed to further the
aims of The System (whatever
that is)—these aims being prin
cipally imperialistic war. Conse
quently, SRI and everyone con
nected with it are guilty of im
moral acts, and are to be con
demned. I only wish it were that
simple.
Technology is an amoral
creature. Like fire or the stone
ax, it is a tool, and its moral
force lies in the hands of the
user. The technologist as tech
nologist answers the questions:
"Can this device be made? Given
the state of the art, what is the
best way to make it?"
Human Responsibility
Presumably there are objec
tive answers to these questions,
and a technologist who allows
his preconceptions (moral or
otherwise) to interfere with his
objectivity in finding them is
serving neither technology nor
morality. However, the question
that the technologist as human
being must also ask is: "Should
it be made?" The great danger
is that too many technologists
are abdicating their human re
sponsibility for asking this
question.
To make things even worse,
scientific projects have a nasty
habit of refusing to stay within
neat moral boxes. Thus, a de
fense-oriented project to study
the effect of fallout on post
atomic agriculture leads to a
model for determining the optim
al agricultural use of land in
present-day underdeveloped
countries—and SRI works as

hard on the latter application a
on the former. Fundamental r<
search into the structure of mai
ter led to a deeper understand
ing of our world—and to therm<
nuclear weapons. Where do w
draw the line? At what poin
must we say: "This far, and n>
farther"?
Constructive, Too
SRI has been singled out fq
attack because it is close ti
home, and discrediting the Stan
ford Establishment is always i
progressive thing to do. In fact
SRI (and Stanford generally) i
probably one of the less culpabll
members of the Technologlca

"Analysis of Alternative Meth

that the technologist as human
being must also ask is: "Should
it be made?" The great danger
is that too many technologists
are abdicating their human re
sponsibility for asking this
question.
To make things even worse,
scientific projects have a nasty
habit of refusing to stay within
neat moral boxes. Thus, a de
fense-oriented project to study
the effect of fallout on post
atomic agriculture leads to a
model for determining the optim
al agricultural use of land in
present-day underdeveloped
countries—and SRI works as

hard on the latter application a
on the former. Fundamental r<
search into the structure of mai
ter led to a deeper understand
ing of our world—and to therm<
nuclear weapons. Where do w
draw the line? At what poin
must we say: "This far, and n>
farther"?
Constructive, Too
SRI has been singled out fq
attack because it is close ti
home, and discrediting the Stan
ford Establishment is always i
progressive thing to do. In fact
SRI (and Stanford generally) i
probably one of the less culpabll
members of the Technologlca
Establishment. I am going to i
seminar tonight, given by ai
SRI staff member; the topic is;
"Analysis of Alternative Meth
ods of Improving Racial Balanct
in a School District". Real war
crime stuff.
SRI probably has a lower per
centage of specifically defense
oriented projects with prede
fined objectives, and its stafl
members probably exercise more
control and restraint over th«
direction of their research, than
is normally the case in the tech
nical industries. SRI isn't inno
cent; no technologist is. But ij
SRI must accept collective guilt
for its destructive
shouldn't it also take collective
credit for its constructive ones?
Moral Questions
Should an SRI scientist who Is
engaged in what he believes to
be interesting and genuinely usf
ful work, and who knows thai
most other places where he
could work would be worse, quit
his job because he disapproves
of the project that the group
down the hall is doing? There
are moral questions here, and
the answers aren't obvious. And
it's possible that Stanford engi
neers ask them more often than
you think.
I am not indulging in this pole
mic simply out of annoyance. I
think it is vitally important that
we take a long, critical look at
where technology is taking us.
One of the main obstacles to do
ing this is the widespread separ
ation of technical knowledge
from decision-making power and
responsibility. The technician is
treated as a machine which ans
wers the question "Can it be
made?", and all too often, he ac
cepts this position.
System Rolls On
The politicians and business
men who hire him don't have the
technical knowledge (even il
they have the inclination) to
evaluate all the implications of
"Should it be made?" And the
tragedy is that most of the vocal
minority who perceive that some
thing is very wrong with this
arrangement have such stereo
typed ideas of Technocracy that
they really cannot offer effective
criticism, and attack the abstrac
tion without ever quite under
standing what it is, or how it
works. Meanwhile, The System'
rolls on, and nobody pays too
much attention to the picket
signs.
Many scientists and engineers
in the Stanford community, my
self included, don't like this situ
ation. But we are close enough
to it to realize that, unfortun
ately, crying "We Accuse!' is not
really a way out, and that
object of "accuse" is very hara
to pin down.
If we are going to pin it down
—and I believe we must —some
lines of communication between
the technologists and the pro
testors will have to be opened up,
and shouting "Murderer!" a f
SRI isn't the way to do this.
Andrew Kopkind has written
that planning (social or techno
logical) is too important to be
left to the planners. Perhaps
criticism, on these issues, is also
too important to be left to the
critics.

The various scholars, lawyers

died the Warren Commission Re
port and contrasted its findings
with the Commission's own evi
dence are worse than Senator
McMarthy, states your Mr. Kap
lan. He then uses the word
"reckless" to describe the critics.
When I invited Mr. Kaplan to
a debate so that the student
body at Stanford might better
judge his harsh condemnation
against the facts, he declined. I
suggested that he bring his own
moderator and his own set of

rules for the debate. Mr. Kap
lan was quoted on the front
page of your newspaper as fol
lows: "I'd sooner enter a stink

One can appreciate his prefer
ence for a contest where vic
tory appears more certain but
issue was joined with the cri
tics by Mr. Kaplan.
His accusations of "distortion"
and "misrepresentation" require
exploration. My book, Rush To
Judgment, has been reviewed
by hundreds of critics including
judges, lawyers and scholars.
The almost five thousand ref
erences and citations present
there have not yet been chal
lenged by a responsible critic.
Under the circumstances Mr.
Kaplan's hysterical generalities
deserve severe public scrutiny.
It is for that reason that I have
invited him to a public confron
tation. His refusal to support
his charges in open debate may
indicate a lack of intellectual
commitment to his highly pub
licized view.
Therefore, should some stu

will appear at a public meeting
after giving suitable notice to
Mr. Kaplan. Should he fail to

Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum's plea for
reflection and self-criticism on
the part of those at Stanford
who oppose the Vietnam war
seems to have been made with
total disregard for present reali
ties. Certainly self-questioning
is an indispensable quality of
the civilized man, but it is ab
surd to assume that the process
should preclude the adoption of
a firm moral position.
There are times when moral
outrage must be the response
of those who are concerned
with the fate of other human
beings. This is such a time,
since it is obvious that one par
ticipant in the controversy over
the war has long since abandon
ed reflection and self-criticism
in favor of action.
To put it bluntly, for the past
several years the U.S. govern
ment has been slaughtering
Vietnamese peasants in increas
ing numbers, with massive fire
power and a tonnage of bombs
that already exceeds the highest
rates of World War 11.
Professors Brown, Ruotolo,
Novak, et al have been writing
and speaking in opposition to
this continuing slaughter, with
statements that have been nei--
their uninformed nor unrefiec
tive. Yet, according to Mr.
Ketchum, "they have engaged
in the same thoughtless aggres
sion and uncritical moral certi
tude which they impute to our
government."
To equate reasoned protest

against war with the act of war
itself involves a kind of lo*?ic
which perhaps only a graduate
student in philosophy can un
derstand. It is a kind of logic
which ignores the actual fact
of human pain and bloodshed
and which confuses commitment
with violence.
I have the ghastly feeling
that on the day when a hydro
gen bomb is finally being load
ed for delivery, Mr. Ketchum
will still be urging the rest of
us to reflect, become informed,
and engage in debate, before we
take a position on the matter.

Editor, the Dally:
As a future member of the
Grand Order of Technocrats,
and as someone extremely con
cerned about the role of tech
nology in our society, I am dis
turbed by some of the recent
criticism of SRI. Heaven knows,
a critical reevaluation of the
Technological Establishment is
needed. But the blanket accusa
tions of the SRI-baiters aren't
accomplishing this very well.
Their thesis, as far as I can
see, is that the technical indus
tries are part of a great confed
eracy designed to further the
aims of The System (whatever
that is)—these aims being prin
cipally imperialistic war. Conse
quently, SRI and everyone con
nected with it are guilty of im
moral acts, and are to be con
demned. I only wish it were that
simple.
Technology is an amoral
creature. Like fire or the stone
ax, it is a tool, and its moral
force lies in the hands of the
user. The technologist as tech
nologist answers the questions:
"Can this device be made? Given
the state of the art, what is the
best way to make it?"
Human Responsibility
Presumably there are objec
tive answers to these questions,
and a technologist who allows
his preconceptions (moral or
otherwise) to interfere with his
objectivity in finding them is
serving neither technology nor
morality. However, the question
that the technologist as human
being must also ask is: "Should
it be made?" The great danger
is that too many technologists
are abdicating their human re
sponsibility for asking this
question.

As a future member of the
Grand Order of Technocrats,
and as someone extremely con
cerned about the role of tech
nology in our society, I am dis
turbed by some of the recent
criticism of SRI. Heaven knows,
a critical reevaluation of the
Technological Establishment is
needed. But the blanket accusa
tions of the SRI-baiters aren't
accomplishing this very well.
Their thesis, as far as I can
see, is that the technical indus
tries are part of a great confed
eracy designed to further the
aims of The System (whatever
that is)—these aims being prin
cipally imperialistic war. Conse
quently, SRI and everyone con
nected with it are guilty of im
moral acts, and are to be con
demned. I only wish it were that
simple.
Technology is an amoral
creature. Like fire or the stone
ax, it is a tool, and its moral
force lies in the hands of the
user. The technologist as tech
nologist answers the questions:
"Can this device be made? Given
the state of the art, what is the
best way to make it?"
Human Responsibility
Presumably there are objec
tive answers to these questions,
and a technologist who allows
his preconceptions (moral or
otherwise) to interfere with his
objectivity in finding them is
serving neither technology nor
morality. However, the question
that the technologist as human
being must also ask is: "Should
it be made?" The great danger
is that too many technologists
are abdicating their human re
sponsibility for asking this
question.
To make things even worse,
scientific projects have a nasty
habit of refusing to stay within
neat moral boxes. Thus, a de
fense-oriented project to study
the effect of fallout on post
atomic agriculture leads to a
model for determining the optim
al agricultural use of land in
present-day underdeveloped
countries—and SRI works as

hard on the latter application a
on the former. Fundamental r<
search into the structure of mai
ter led to a deeper understand
ing of our world—and to therm<
nuclear weapons. Where do w
draw the line? At what poin
must we say: "This far, and n>
farther"?
Constructive, Too
SRI has been singled out fq
attack because it is close ti
home, and discrediting the Stan
ford Establishment is always i
progressive thing to do. In fact
SRI (and Stanford generally) i
probably one of the less culpabll
members of the Technologlca
Establishment. I am going to i
seminar tonight, given by ai
SRI staff member; the topic is;
"Analysis of Alternative Meth
ods of Improving Racial Balanct
in a School District". Real war
crime stuff.
SRI probably has a lower per
centage of specifically defense
oriented projects with prede
fined objectives, and its stafl
members probably exercise more
control and restraint over th«
direction of their research, than
is normally the case in the tech
nical industries. SRI isn't inno
cent; no technologist is. But ij
SRI must accept collective guilt
for its destructive
shouldn't it also take collective
credit for its constructive ones?
Moral Questions
Should an SRI scientist who Is
engaged in what he believes to
be interesting and genuinely usf
ful work, and who knows thai
most other places where he
could work would be worse, quit
his job because he disapproves
of the project that the group
down the hall is doing? There
are moral questions here, and
the answers aren't obvious. And
it's possible that Stanford engi
neers ask them more often than
you think.
I am not indulging in this pole
mic simply out of annoyance. I
think it is vitally important that
we take a long, critical look at
where technology is taking us.
One of the main obstacles to do
ing this is the widespread separ
ation of technical knowledge
from decision-making power and
responsibility. The technician is
treated as a machine which ans
wers the question "Can it be
made?", and all too often, he ac
cepts this position.
System Rolls On
The politicians and business
men who hire him don't have the
technical knowledge (even il
they have the inclination) to
evaluate all the implications of
"Should it be made?" And the
tragedy is that most of the vocal
minority who perceive that some
thing is very wrong with this
arrangement have such stereo
typed ideas of Technocracy that
they really cannot offer effective
criticism, and attack the abstrac
tion without ever quite under
standing what it is, or how it
works. Meanwhile, The System'
rolls on, and nobody pays too
much attention to the picket
signs.
Many scientists and engineers
in the Stanford community, my
self included, don't like this situ
ation. But we are close enough
to it to realize that, unfortun
ately, crying "We Accuse!' is not
really a way out, and that
object of "accuse" is very hara
to pin down.
If we are going to pin it down
—and I believe we must —some
lines of communication between
the technologists and the pro
testors will have to be opened up,
and shouting "Murderer!" a f
SRI isn't the way to do this.
Andrew Kopkind has written
that planning (social or techno
logical) is too important to be
left to the planners. Perhaps
criticism, on these issues, is also
too important to be left to the
critics.

The various scholars, lawyers
and other critics who have stu
died the Warren Commission Re
port and contrasted its findings
with the Commission's own evi
dence are worse than Senator
McMarthy, states your Mr. Kap
lan. He then uses the word
"reckless" to describe the critics.
When I invited Mr. Kaplan to
a debate so that the student
body at Stanford might better
judge his harsh condemnation
against the facts, he declined. I
suggested that he bring his own
moderator and his own set of

rules for the debate. Mr. Kap
lan was quoted on the front
page of your newspaper as fol
lows: "I'd sooner enter a stink
ing match with a skunk ..."
One can appreciate his prefer
ence for a contest where vic
tory appears more certain but
issue was joined with the cri
tics by Mr. Kaplan.
His accusations of "distortion"
and "misrepresentation" require
exploration. My book, Rush To
Judgment, has been reviewed
by hundreds of critics including
judges, lawyers and scholars.
The almost five thousand ref
erences and citations present
there have not yet been chal
lenged by a responsible critic.
Under the circumstances Mr.
Kaplan's hysterical generalities
deserve severe public scrutiny.
It is for that reason that I have
invited him to a public confron
tation. His refusal to support
his charges in open debate may
indicate a lack of intellectual
commitment to his highly pub
licized view.
Therefore, should some stu
dent organization on the cam
pus invite me to do so (328-0420,
860 Lathrop Drive, Stanford) I
will appear at a public meeting
after giving suitable notice to
Mr. Kaplan. Should he fail to
appear I will answer every ir
responsible allegation that he
has made in his emotional de
fense of a discredited document.

• Wrong Equation
Editor, The Daily:
Jonathan Ketchum's plea for
reflection and self-criticism on
the part of those at Stanford
who oppose the Vietnam war
seems to have been made with
total disregard for present reali
ties. Certainly self-questioning
is an indispensable quality of
the civilized man, but it is ab
surd to assume that the process
should preclude the adoption of
a firm moral position.
There are times when moral
outrage must be the response
of those who are concerned
with the fate of other human
beings. This is such a time,
since it is obvious that one par
ticipant in the controversy over
the war has long since abandon
ed reflection and self-criticism
in favor of action.
To put it bluntly, for the past
several years the U.S. govern
ment has been slaughtering
Vietnamese peasants in increas
ing numbers, with massive fire
power and a tonnage of bombs
that already exceeds the highest
rates of World War 11.
Professors Brown, Ruotolo,
Novak, et al have been writing
and speaking in opposition to
this continuing slaughter, with
statements that have been nei--
their uninformed nor unrefiec
tive. Yet, according to Mr.
Ketchum, "they have engaged
in the same thoughtless aggres
sion and uncritical moral certi
tude which they impute to our
government."
To equate reasoned protest

against war with the act of war
itself involves a kind of lo*?ic
which perhaps only a graduate
student in philosophy can un
derstand. It is a kind of logic
which ignores the actual fact
of human pain and bloodshed
and which confuses commitment
with violence.
I have the ghastly feeling
that on the day when a hydro
gen bomb is finally being load
ed for delivery, Mr. Ketchum
will still be urging the rest of
us to reflect, become informed,
and engage in debate, before we
take a position on the matter.

itself involves a kind of lo*?ic
which perhaps only a graduate
student in philosophy can un
derstand. It is a kind of logic
which ignores the actual fact
of human pain and bloodshed
and which confuses commitment
with violence.
I have the ghastly feeling
that on the day when a hydro
gen bomb is finally being load
ed for delivery, Mr. Ketchum
will still be urging the rest of
us to reflect, become informed,
and engage in debate, before we
take a position on the matter.

This is an open letter to the
women's residences at Stanford.
Due to the excessive rain the
peninsula has witnessed of late,
Burbank House has undertaken
the construction of an Ark. In
conjunction with this project,
Burbank is seeking to find a
women's residence interested in
helping to preserve the race.
If it stops raining, Burbank is
willing to preserve the race any
way.

• Technocrat
Editor, the Dally:
As a future member of the
Grand Order of Technocrats,
and as someone extremely con
cerned about the role of tech
nology in our society, I am dis
turbed by some of the recent
criticism of SRI. Heaven knows,
a critical reevaluation of the
Technological Establishment is
needed. But the blanket accusa
tions of the SRI-baiters aren't
accomplishing this very well.
Their thesis, as far as I can
see, is that the technical indus
tries are part of a great confed
eracy designed to further the
aims of The System (whatever
that is)—these aims being prin
cipally imperialistic war. Conse
quently, SRI and everyone con
nected with it are guilty of im
moral acts, and are to be con
demned. I only wish it were that
simple.
Technology is an amoral
creature. Like fire or the stone
ax, it is a tool, and its moral
force lies in the hands of the
user. The technologist as tech
nologist answers the questions:
"Can this device be made? Given
the state of the art, what is the
best way to make it?"
Human Responsibility
Presumably there are objec
tive answers to these questions,
and a technologist who allows
his preconceptions (moral or
otherwise) to interfere with his
objectivity in finding them is
serving neither technology nor
morality. However, the question
that the technologist as human
being must also ask is: "Should
it be made?" The great danger
is that too many technologists
are abdicating their human re
sponsibility for asking this
question.
To make things even worse,
scientific projects have a nasty
habit of refusing to stay within
neat moral boxes. Thus, a de
fense-oriented project to study
the effect of fallout on post
atomic agriculture leads to a
model for determining the optim
al agricultural use of land in
present-day underdeveloped
countries—and SRI works as

hard on the latter application a
on the former. Fundamental r<
search into the structure of mai
ter led to a deeper understand
ing of our world—and to therm<
nuclear weapons. Where do w
draw the line? At what poin
must we say: "This far, and n>
farther"?
Constructive, Too
SRI has been singled out fq
attack because it is close ti
home, and discrediting the Stan
ford Establishment is always i
progressive thing to do. In fact
SRI (and Stanford generally) i
probably one of the less culpabll
members of the Technologlca
Establishment. I am going to i
seminar tonight, given by ai
SRI staff member; the topic is;
"Analysis of Alternative Meth
ods of Improving Racial Balanct
in a School District". Real war
crime stuff.
SRI probably has a lower per
centage of specifically defense
oriented projects with prede
fined objectives, and its stafl
members probably exercise more
control and restraint over th«
direction of their research, than
is normally the case in the tech
nical industries. SRI isn't inno
cent; no technologist is. But ij
SRI must accept collective guilt
for its destructive
shouldn't it also take collective
credit for its constructive ones?
Moral Questions
Should an SRI scientist who Is
engaged in what he believes to
be interesting and genuinely usf
ful work, and who knows thai
most other places where he
could work would be worse, quit
his job because he disapproves
of the project that the group
down the hall is doing? There
are moral questions here, and
the answers aren't obvious. And
it's possible that Stanford engi
neers ask them more often than
you think.
I am not indulging in this pole
mic simply out of annoyance. I
think it is vitally important that
we take a long, critical look at
where technology is taking us.
One of the main obstacles to do
ing this is the widespread separ
ation of technical knowledge
from decision-making power and
responsibility. The technician is
treated as a machine which ans
wers the question "Can it be
made?", and all too often, he ac
cepts this position.
System Rolls On
The politicians and business
men who hire him don't have the
technical knowledge (even il
they have the inclination) to
evaluate all the implications of
"Should it be made?" And the
tragedy is that most of the vocal
minority who perceive that some
thing is very wrong with this
arrangement have such stereo
typed ideas of Technocracy that
they really cannot offer effective
criticism, and attack the abstrac
tion without ever quite under
standing what it is, or how it
works. Meanwhile, The System'
rolls on, and nobody pays too
much attention to the picket
signs.
Many scientists and engineers
in the Stanford community, my
self included, don't like this situ
ation. But we are close enough
to it to realize that, unfortun
ately, crying "We Accuse!' is not
really a way out, and that
object of "accuse" is very hara
to pin down.
If we are going to pin it down
—and I believe we must —some
lines of communication between
the technologists and the pro
testors will have to be opened up,
and shouting "Murderer!" a f
SRI isn't the way to do this.
Andrew Kopkind has written
that planning (social or techno
logical) is too important to be
left to the planners. Perhaps
criticism, on these issues, is also
too important to be left to the
critics.
