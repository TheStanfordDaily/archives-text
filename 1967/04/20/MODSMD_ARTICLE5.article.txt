# Campus Queen Contest Director Inquires, Jeopardizes Wendy G. Wonka Candidacy
## 
### 
Wendy G. Wonka's candidacy for
National College Queen was in jeop
ardy yesterday when national officials
began to question her existence.
The revelation followed her success
in reaching the California state semi
finals in the contest.
Virginia Durstine, national director
for the contest, yesterday asked Dean
of Students Joel Smith to investigate
the affair, but later requested he hold
back until a meeting in New York
today.
Miss Durstine, an employee of IN
FOPLAN, a public relations Ann
handling the contest for Best Foods,
revealed to Smith that a fellow em
ployee and Stanford alumnus tipped
her off about Miss Wonka's question
able identity.

Smith said he "tried very conscien
tiously to contact Miss Wonka, but
was unable to reach her."
Contacted last night by The Daily,
Miss Wonka said, "It was, well, like
being on the edge of greatness."
In a prepared statement, she an
grily charged that "they've made a
joke out of this contest. How can they
say I don't exist— here I am." When
notified that the tipster was an alum
nus, she exclaimed, "What a fink!
Alumni aren't all bad—look at my
brother Warren G."
Very Involved
According to a full-page ad in yes
terday's Daily, Miss Wonka is very
involved in campus activities. She is
reportedly on the Dean's list, a mem
ber of Cardinals Board, treasurer of

UCCM, Poetry Editor of Sequoia, and
president of Stillman House.
Last fall. Miss Wonka was unsuc
cessful in her bid to become Stanford's
first homecoming queen in the Uni
versity's 75-year history. Shortly
thereafter, a student referendum
voted to abolish queen contests.
Miss Wonka's brother, Warren G.
of Watsonville, visited the campus in
January while taking a rest after his
unsuccessful campaign in support of
the CLEAN amendment in November.
At the time he said in reference to
her Homecoming campaign, "I am not
surprised you students voted out
homecoming queens. When Wendy
starts something, she usually finishes
it."
Warren also denied off the record

that his "pull as an alumnus" helped
Wendy get into the University.
University spokesmen said the Won
ka family reputation was "beyond re
pute, truly global in scope." Wendy's
brother, Warren, first achieved fame
in the columns of the 1938 Chapparal.
Clean Bible Society
Since then the wandering Wonkas
have been discovered in Anartica, Tim
buktu, several graduation lists, Presi
dent Sterling's private files, and the
Clean Bible Society of Watsonville.
Wendy had hoped to appear in a
national television spectacular with
finalists from 49 other states, but her
uncertain status as a contestant now
makes this doubtful.
The Thirteenth Annual College
Queen Contest is being sponsored by
Best Foods.
