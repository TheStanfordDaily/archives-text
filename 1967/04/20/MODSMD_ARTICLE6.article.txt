# Hansen-Church, Reich-Kane Add Names To Associated Students Presidential Race
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Pete Hansen of the Business School
and Joe Reich, a junior in El Capitan
Eating Club, yesterday announced
their candidacies for ASSU President.
Hansen has joined with freshman
Forrest Church, who recently ran
third in the vice-presidential primary
to replace Mike Collins when Collins
became ASSU President. Joe Reich's
runningmate is Jeff Kane, a sopho
more who lives off-campus and has
started the Photography Club.
Hansen and Church yesterday re
leased a statement "that a consider
able amount of progress can be made
next year toward curriculum reform,
grading reform, housing development
and increased student freedom from
the idea of University 'parental' con
trol."
Respectful Confrontation
They call for a "firm, but respect
ful and responsible confrontation
with faculty and administration. We
propose a realistic approach that fa
vors the emphasis on problems that
are important to a great number of
students and can realistically be im
plemented by convincing the admini
stration to consider new and signi
ficantly different approaches to many
old educational 'habits.' "
Hansen has been at Stanford for
five years, and now is Vice President
of the Business Students Association
and a Resident Assistant in Toyon
Hall. "Having communicated myself
would like to see this develop more.
Harris has developed some good ideas
but there has been a lack of commu

nication between the people who are
going to have communicate if any
thing is to be done."
Hansen denied he fills the image
of the conservative business student.
"The stereotype view of the business
student is just as inaccurate as the
stereotypes of any other student
groups," he says. Hansen picketed
against the Dow Chemical recruiters
when they visited the Business School
two months ago.
He emphasizes the "tolerance of
students for one another, for the ad
ministration, and the tolerance of the
administration for students." "It's
got to be a constructive approach,"
says Church, "not a defensive one."
Church is president of Trancos
House in Wilbur Hall and has just
pledged Theta Xi. Both Hansen and
Church state they will live on cam
pus next year if elected.
Hansen and Church call for a
graded freshman year, but with no
freshman grades on transcripts, an
end to "in-group" student govern
ment, an independently sponsored
scratch sheet, a Spanish speaking
overseas campus in Latin America,
the reduction of the size of LASSU,
and OFF to accompany the Wilbur
Experiment.
Reich and Kane
Joe Reich and Jeff Kane are run
ning on the platform of LASSU re
form. "It was because student gov
ernment was ineffective that Harris
resorted to working outside this sys
tem," they claim in a statement to
The Daily.

"The administration is opposed to
student community, and to make the
student association an effective means
for student representation will re
quire some very basic changes in its
structure," they continue. "LASSU
sets up as an effective company
union," says Reich, "our interests are
opposed to the administration at least
half the time and we have to have an
effective means of aggregating and
articulating our opinions."
Reich criticized the attitude "that
the administration is friendly, and all
we have to do is cut our hair and
go and shake their hands." "The ad
ministration has been working against
student community since 1892 and
this is not unintentional," he says.
15 Members In LASSU
Reich and Kane specifically call for
LASSU to be composed of 15 mem
bers, a change which they feel will
improve the quality of the candidates.
Feculty members and administrators
would also be eligible to run for
these 15 positions but if elected would
have no vote. All members would re
ceive a salary.
When asked what place the ASSU
President and Vice-President would
have in this type of student govern
ment, Reich answered: "I don't real
ly know, you might be able to dis
pense with them — or maybe they
could head LASSU."
Reich and Kane would also greatly
limit the expenditures made by LAS
SU, particularly to the Speech Asso
ciation and the NSA. They seek to
give priority to the interests of a cof

fee house and the Experiment, but
have articulated no more definite
proposals. "Every candidate calls for
about the same things anyway," says
Kane.
Also mentioned as a possible ASSU
Presidential candidate is Jan Jacobi,
Housing Commission Chairman. Con
tacted last night, Jacobi said he had
not yet made up his mind. Petitions
are due Monday afternoon for all of
ficers.
The primary election for the ASSU
positions will be held on May 3 and 4
with the runoff about one week later.
Elections will also be held for Senior
Class Officers, Women's Recreational
Association Officers, Associated Wom
en's Students Officers, and for two
representatives to the NSA confer
ence this summer.

The Daily.

"The administration is opposed to
student community, and to make the
student association an effective means
for student representation will re
quire some very basic changes in its
structure," they continue. "LASSU
sets up as an effective company
union," says Reich, "our interests are
opposed to the administration at least
half the time and we have to have an
effective means of aggregating and
articulating our opinions."
Reich criticized the attitude "that
the administration is friendly, and all
we have to do is cut our hair and
go and shake their hands." "The ad
ministration has been working against
student community since 1892 and
this is not unintentional," he says.
15 Members In LASSU
Reich and Kane specifically call for
LASSU to be composed of 15 mem
bers, a change which they feel will
improve the quality of the candidates.
Feculty members and administrators
would also be eligible to run for
these 15 positions but if elected would
have no vote. All members would re
ceive a salary.
When asked what place the ASSU
President and Vice-President would
have in this type of student govern
ment, Reich answered: "I don't real
ly know, you might be able to dis
pense with them — or maybe they
could head LASSU."
Reich and Kane would also greatly
limit the expenditures made by LAS
SU, particularly to the Speech Asso
ciation and the NSA. They seek to
give priority to the interests of a cof

fee house and the Experiment, but
have articulated no more definite
proposals. "Every candidate calls for
about the same things anyway," says
Kane.
Also mentioned as a possible ASSU
Presidential candidate is Jan Jacobi,
Housing Commission Chairman. Con
tacted last night, Jacobi said he had
not yet made up his mind. Petitions
are due Monday afternoon for all of
ficers.
The primary election for the ASSU
positions will be held on May 3 and 4
with the runoff about one week later.
Elections will also be held for Senior
Class Officers, Women's Recreational
Association Officers, Associated Wom
en's Students Officers, and for two
representatives to the NSA confer
ence this summer.
Pete Hansen of the Business School
and Joe Reich, a junior in El Capitan
Eating Club, yesterday announced
their candidacies for ASSU President.
Hansen has joined with freshman
Forrest Church, who recently ran
third in the vice-presidential primary
to replace Mike Collins when Collins
became ASSU President. Joe Reich's
runningmate is Jeff Kane, a sopho
more who lives off-campus and has
started the Photography Club.
Hansen and Church yesterday re
leased a statement "that a consider
able amount of progress can be made
next year toward curriculum reform,
grading reform, housing development
and increased student freedom from
the idea of University 'parental' con
trol."
Respectful Confrontation
They call for a "firm, but respect
ful and responsible confrontation
with faculty and administration. We
propose a realistic approach that fa
vors the emphasis on problems that
are important to a great number of
students and can realistically be im
plemented by convincing the admini
stration to consider new and signi
ficantly different approaches to many
old educational 'habits.' "
Hansen has been at Stanford for
five years, and now is Vice President
of the Business Students Association
and a Resident Assistant in Toyon
Hall. "Having communicated myself
would like to see this develop more.
Harris has developed some good ideas
but there has been a lack of commu

nication between the people who are
going to have communicate if any
thing is to be done."
Hansen denied he fills the image
of the conservative business student.
"The stereotype view of the business
student is just as inaccurate as the
stereotypes of any other student
groups," he says. Hansen picketed
against the Dow Chemical recruiters
when they visited the Business School
two months ago.
He emphasizes the "tolerance of
students for one another, for the ad
ministration, and the tolerance of the
administration for students." "It's
got to be a constructive approach,"
says Church, "not a defensive one."
Church is president of Trancos
House in Wilbur Hall and has just
pledged Theta Xi. Both Hansen and
Church state they will live on cam
pus next year if elected.
Hansen and Church call for a
graded freshman year, but with no
freshman grades on transcripts, an
end to "in-group" student govern
ment, an independently sponsored
scratch sheet, a Spanish speaking
overseas campus in Latin America,
the reduction of the size of LASSU,
and OFF to accompany the Wilbur
Experiment.
Reich and Kane
Joe Reich and Jeff Kane are run
ning on the platform of LASSU re

able amount of progress can be made
next year toward curriculum reform,
grading reform, housing development
and increased student freedom from
the idea of University 'parental' con
trol."
Respectful Confrontation
They call for a "firm, but respect
ful and responsible confrontation
with faculty and administration. We
propose a realistic approach that fa
vors the emphasis on problems that
are important to a great number of
students and can realistically be im
plemented by convincing the admini
stration to consider new and signi
ficantly different approaches to many
old educational 'habits.' "
Hansen has been at Stanford for
five years, and now is Vice President
of the Business Students Association
and a Resident Assistant in Toyon
Hall. "Having communicated myself
would like to see this develop more.
Harris has developed some good ideas
but there has been a lack of commu

nication between the people who are
going to have communicate if any
thing is to be done."
Hansen denied he fills the image
of the conservative business student.
"The stereotype view of the business
student is just as inaccurate as the
stereotypes of any other student
groups," he says. Hansen picketed
against the Dow Chemical recruiters
when they visited the Business School
two months ago.
He emphasizes the "tolerance of
students for one another, for the ad
ministration, and the tolerance of the
administration for students." "It's
got to be a constructive approach,"
says Church, "not a defensive one."
Church is president of Trancos
House in Wilbur Hall and has just
pledged Theta Xi. Both Hansen and
Church state they will live on cam
pus next year if elected.
Hansen and Church call for a
graded freshman year, but with no
freshman grades on transcripts, an
end to "in-group" student govern
ment, an independently sponsored
scratch sheet, a Spanish speaking
overseas campus in Latin America,
the reduction of the size of LASSU,
and OFF to accompany the Wilbur
Experiment.
Reich and Kane
Joe Reich and Jeff Kane are run
ning on the platform of LASSU re
form. "It was because student gov
ernment was ineffective that Harris
resorted to working outside this sys
tem," they claim in a statement to
The Daily.

"The administration is opposed to
student community, and to make the
student association an effective means
for student representation will re
quire some very basic changes in its
structure," they continue. "LASSU
sets up as an effective company
union," says Reich, "our interests are
opposed to the administration at least
half the time and we have to have an
effective means of aggregating and
articulating our opinions."
Reich criticized the attitude "that
the administration is friendly, and all
we have to do is cut our hair and
go and shake their hands." "The ad
ministration has been working against
student community since 1892 and
this is not unintentional," he says.
15 Members In LASSU
Reich and Kane specifically call for
LASSU to be composed of 15 mem
bers, a change which they feel will
improve the quality of the candidates.
Feculty members and administrators
would also be eligible to run for
these 15 positions but if elected would
have no vote. All members would re
ceive a salary.
When asked what place the ASSU
President and Vice-President would
have in this type of student govern
ment, Reich answered: "I don't real
ly know, you might be able to dis
pense with them — or maybe they
could head LASSU."
Reich and Kane would also greatly
limit the expenditures made by LAS
SU, particularly to the Speech Asso
ciation and the NSA. They seek to
give priority to the interests of a cof

fee house and the Experiment, but
have articulated no more definite
proposals. "Every candidate calls for
about the same things anyway," says
Kane.
Also mentioned as a possible ASSU
Presidential candidate is Jan Jacobi,
Housing Commission Chairman. Con
tacted last night, Jacobi said he had
not yet made up his mind. Petitions
are due Monday afternoon for all of
ficers.
The primary election for the ASSU
positions will be held on May 3 and 4
with the runoff about one week later.
Elections will also be held for Senior
Class Officers, Women's Recreational
Association Officers, Associated Wom
en's Students Officers, and for two
representatives to the NSA confer
ence this summer.
Pete Hansen of the Business School
and Joe Reich, a junior in El Capitan
Eating Club, yesterday announced
their candidacies for ASSU President.
Hansen has joined with freshman
Forrest Church, who recently ran
third in the vice-presidential primary
to replace Mike Collins when Collins
became ASSU President. Joe Reich's
runningmate is Jeff Kane, a sopho
more who lives off-campus and has
started the Photography Club.
