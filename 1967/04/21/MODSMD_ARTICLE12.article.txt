Stanford Protests
At Stanford, over 100 male
students have signed similar
statements indicating that they
will not fight in Vietnam or be
drafted, according to the Stan
ford Anti-Draft Union.
About one third of this group
would not fight in Vietnam,

not be conscripted into the mili
tary at all.
The Anti-Draft Union plans to
publish a list of their names in
newspaper advertisements, sim
ilar to Princeton's, according
to Gary Coutin, sophomore ma
jor in philosophy from Glen
dale.
The Anti-Draft Union has not
yet prepared information on the
students' class, major, or cur
rent draft status. Stanford has
over 8,700 male students.
Tax Payments
Reflecting student sentiment,
fifteen Cornell University pro
fessors, who are opposed to the
war in Vietnam, announced that
they would pay only 50 per cent
of their federal income taxes.
A spokesman said the figure
of 50 per cent was chosen be
cause half of the nation's an
nual budget was spent on the

war. The protest was aimed at
the war and not at the govern
ment's right to collect taxes.
