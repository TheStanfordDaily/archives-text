the highlight.

or theme. The professors speak
on any subject of relevance to
their field and the occasion.
Exciting Afternoon

the balloting held during regi
stration week and acceptance of

the parents," Coffey said.
There have been two further
developments regarding gradu
ation. Seniors are asked to sign
the class scroll when they are
measured for cap and gown at
the Bookstore this week. Also,
engraved announcements of
Stanford's 1967 Commencement,
to be sent to relatives and
friends of graduates, have ar
rived and may be purchased at
the Bookstore.
Information regarding actual
tickets to the event will be sent
each Senior shortly.
