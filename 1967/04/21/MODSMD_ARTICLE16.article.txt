# Mao Now Becomes Stylish Through US Misconceptions
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
(CPS) â€” Chairman Mao Tse
tung has received the ultimate
insult from the West. He has be
come the latest fad. He is heir
to the loyal admirers of hoola
hoops, skate-boards, and mini
skirts. And he is taken just
about as seriously.
Quotations From Chairman
Mao Tse-tung has become a run
away bestseller, first in France
and now in Britain and Amer
ica.
Mao's works have always
been available to Western read
ers but he never came near the
best seller list before. There is
nothing intrinsically popular
about Mao's thought. The public
is obviously not buying the book
to read seriously, for it is a col
lection of utterly dry and un
quotable quotes from Mao's
speeches. They are not pithy
aphorisms, but rather dull and
long-winded paragraphs, some
times running more than a page.
Misguided Camp
A sample: "It is dogmatism
to approach Marxism from a
metaphysical point of view and
to regard it as something rigid.
It is revisionism to negate the
basic principles of Marxism and
to negate its universal truth. Re
visionism is one form of bour
geois ideology. The revisionists
deny..."
Mao's ideas are often mis
guided and unrealistic but they
certainly don't deserve the label
"camp." But the Mao fad can
only be explained by the fact
that the Western public regards
him and the Cultural Revolu
tion as the purest camp. The
millions of Red Guards madly
waving their little red books
was a camp tableau. So the
West bought the book and imi
tated the spectacle.
Likewise, the poster craze
sweeping the U.S. is in part at
tributable to the influence of the
Red Guards' poster mania. The
portraits of Mao blooming at
smart suburban cocktail parties
are mimicking the adulant
Chinese masses. (It would be
much more original to have a
Johnson portrait at one's party.)
True Threat
Despite the fact that the
United States and China are
battling each other Indirectly in
a fierce and potentially catastro

phic war in Asia, the western
public still sees China as a
silly, hopeless, backward, impos
sibly unreal land on the other
side of the globe. China seems
so ridiculous that the true
threat she poses is all but over
looked.
If this is not true, how then
account for the easy acceptance
of the latest fashion from Car
naby Street, the Red Guard
uniform? The London hippies
wouldn't have dared to deck
themselves in Hitierjugend kha
ki thirty years ago.
Fifteen years ago you cer
tainly would not have been in
vited to a Manhattan cocktail
party in honor of Comrade Sta
lin.
Mad Hatter's Party
Why is Mao's image so dan
gerously distorted in the West

ern mind? The blame rests with
the popular press. The Cultural
Revolution spawned a carnival
of exciting front page news
but there was little or no at
tempt to analyze and explain the
Chinese turmoil to Western
readers. To report nothing at all
would have been preferable to
making the Cultural Revolu
tion look like the Mad Hatter's
tea party.
If a foreign correspondent
were to report only about Fort
Lauderdale, pop art, Boy Scout
jamboree and Ev Dirksen with
out an attempted explanation,
America might look every bit
as silly and contemptible as
China does to us.
As it is, our misunderstanding
mockery of Mao adds yet an
other ironic twist to America's
Asian involvement.
