The Midnite Mafia, which functions Saturday nights in the Nitery
(11:30 p.m.), has announced its program for the whole of this
quarter: April 22: Enchanted Tailor, from The World of Scholom
Alelchem (your guess is as good as... ), features Charles Edelman,
Joseph Medalis, Sergei Tschernisch, Carrillo Gantner and Stephen
Newman, all of the cosiddetta 'Mafia.' The show will be directed
by Gil Green, and also playing are Lindi Press, Reba Waters, Paul
Schneider and Barbara Richards.
April 29: Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter, features Gantner
and Newman; William Garry directs this recent British play,
from the pen, by the way, of the husband of the aborted wife in
Alfle.
May 6: The Harmfuiness Of Smoking Tobacco. Again Feldner
stars in this. Also The Reluctant Tragedian, with Edelman and
Tschernisch. Both plays, in case you didn't know, are by Chekhov,
and we are told that certain elements in the Mafia feel that they
"stand or fall by their Chekhov."

On May 13 our campus drama neophytes offer The Actor's Sweat
shop, or Great Scenes From Acting Class. But I don't like the al
ternative title so much, because everything on this campus is
either verging toward or verged on greatness. In the Dinkelspiel
Laudatorium, May 20, an "obstreperous view of society", The Best
Of The Mafia, will be played. Show starts at 11:30, they're asking
a buck. Otherwise shows include victuals for fifty cents.

ACT opens Under Milk Wood in San Francisco on Sunday. April
30 they are making a benefit visit to Stanford. They will play the
George Bernard Shaw pastiche by Jerome Kilty, Dear Liar, in
the Dinkelspiel at 8:00 p.m. Michael O'Sullivan works quite bril
liantly in this 2-man show, with Sada Thompson as Mrs. Campbell.
It is a strong dramatization of the correspondence and friendship
which Campbell quipping called "lustless lions at play."

Jack Aranson's new production of The Playboy Of The Western
World opened at the City Theatre, 465 Post Street, San Francisco,
Wednesday of this week. This great comedy-drama by J. M. Synge
caused riots when it was first performed in Dublin and the cur
rent production is considered by Irish critics the definitive one to
1 date. Note that the Abbey Theatre Company, many of whose play
ers were dismissed as incompetent amateurs in Time Magazine,
review of the movie Ulysses, are acting in it. Believe me, they are
very good.

Guitar Music: the Romeros Ensemble are presenting a concert
of classical and Flamenco music at the Memorial Auditorium, to
night at 8:30. The group is a family concern, consisting of Cale
donio Romero plus his three sons, Angel, Pepe and Celin. Sabicas,
the great, the fabulous, King of the Spanish Guitar, hits Stanford
on May Ist.
We are told that at first he clasps his instrument gently like a
beautiful woman, then "suddenly strikes a thunderous roll in the
bass which resolves to a dulcet tremolo." I'm glad I'm not a Span
ish female gypsy. Perfect pitch, absolute musical retention, no for
mal instruction. His Majesty should be good to hear.
Ballet: L'Homme Et Son Desir, written in 1918 by French poet
Claudel and the composer Darius Milhaud, will wind up the Mills
College performing season in the College Hall, April 25 at 8:30 p.m.
The show will be reviewed in The Daily next week.

Italian Commedia dell'Arte is being given gratis in the parks and
playgrounds of San Francisco. On Sunday April 23 the S.F. mime
troupe will present Olive Pits, at Washington Square Park, 2 p.m.
On April 29 and 30 Olive Pits will be played again, this time at
Mission Dolores Park, equally free of charge.

Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass, (no, not immoral earnings in the
Blue Fox) the nation's top selling recording group for over two
years, will appear in concert in San Francisco's Civic Auditorium.
Their spots are June 16 and 17, 8:15. Closer in time as well as
message is Michael McClure's The Beard.
The highly controversial one-act is performed Thursday through
Sunday nites at the Encore Theater, 422 Mason Street near Geary
in S.F. Beard was in Stanford on Wednesday evening, but you
wouldn't have guessed it if you take the friendly family paper, the
Palo Alto Times.
