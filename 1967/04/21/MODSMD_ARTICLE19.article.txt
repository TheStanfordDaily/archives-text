# Iowa Student President Resigns Under Pressure
## 
### 
(AP) — The student govern
ment president who shook the
crew-cut world of lowa State
University with his Castro-style
beard and a New Left political
philosophy, has left the campus
he planned to drag "kicking and
screaming into the 20th cen
tury."
Donald R. Smith withdrew
from school yesterday, a day be
fore he was scheduled to appear
before the student senate for
an impeachment hearing de
manded after he admitted at
tending a marijuana party. The
admission apparently turned a
part of the 15,000-member stu
dent body against him.
Illegal Drugs
Smith, 21, rattled lowans with
his unorthodox views. lowa
State University President W.
Robert Parks, who had refused
to comment one way or another
about Smith before, immediately
announced an intensified probe
of illegal use of drugs among
ISU students.
Parks said, however, he felt
probably "only a handful of stu
dents" has used illegal drugs.
Smith, an engineering senior
from Rockwell, lowa, said he

quit because the impeachment
case had grown into a "smear
campaign against me and my
friends."
The decision drew mixed re
actions. One of Smith's sternest
critics, State Sen. William J.
Reichardt, D-Des Moines, com
mented: "Although I have dis
agreed with some of his actions,
I am disappointed that threw in
the towel. He takes a stand and
gets into the arena... My con
cern is for the wholesome young
people that would let such a
person represent them."
On the other side of the coin,
another legislator said he was
happy to see Smith leave. "This
tickles me," said Rep. Charles
Grassley, R-New Hartford. "It
shows that the people are still
running the university, after
all."
Smith — "Bitter"
Mary Lou Lifka, sophomore
from Berwyn, 111., said she would
be elevated from student Vice-
President to the Presidency. She
was Smith's running mate on a
platform to abolish most uni
versity regulations outside the
classroom, and she voted to con
tinue Smith's program.

actions. One of Smith's sternest
critics, State Sen. William J.
Reichardt, D-Des Moines, com
mented: "Although I have dis
agreed with some of his actions,
I am disappointed that threw in
the towel. He takes a stand and
gets into the arena... My con
cern is for the wholesome young
people that would let such a
person represent them."
On the other side of the coin,
another legislator said he was
happy to see Smith leave. "This
tickles me," said Rep. Charles
Grassley, R-New Hartford. "It
shows that the people are still
running the university, after
all."
Smith — "Bitter"
Mary Lou Lifka, sophomore
from Berwyn, 111., said she would
be elevated from student Vice-
President to the Presidency. She
was Smith's running mate on a
platform to abolish most uni
versity regulations outside the
classroom, and she voted to con
tinue Smith's program.
