# Anachronistic Rules?
## Dirty Rush Controversy Rages On 
### JAY BOSWORTH DAVID LEVINTHAL 
Dirty rush remains a problem at
Stanford despite recent changes in
the IFC Rush .Rules. The fact that
there exist illegal rush practices in
dicates that either the rush rules
must be changed to encompass these
"necessary" violations or the IFC
must strictly enforce its present rules.
Rush at Present
Dirty rush is considered to be any
form of contact with freshmen that
is not permitted by the IFC. The pur
pose of any rush regulations should
be to allow maximum contact be
tween the fraternities and the fresh
men without permitting any "situa
tion in which a freshman may be
pressured into accepting a bid with
out making a rational decision," said
Michael Quinn, newly elected Presi
dent of the IFC.
According to the present rules,
dirty rush is defined as a fraternity
party attended by more than five
freshmen or one at which liquor is
served. Any contact with Wilbur is
also forbidden.
Quinn feels that the present rules
are an anachronism. In his words,
"freshmen have to be protected from
the pressures fraternities are accused
of subjecting them to." Quinn wOuld

like to have informal contact in
creased, while eliminating artificial
rush situations in which freshmen
are "... coerced into pledging."
The IFC Judicial Council is em
powered to punish the offending fra
ternities. The council is composed
entirely of fraternity members and
their decision can be appealed to the
fraternity and faculty members of
the IFB.
In recent years, penalties have
ranged from a five hundred dollar
fine to a number of hours working at
the Children's Convalescent Home.
In the most recent case, a house was
charged with holding two parties for
freshmen during Winter quarter. A
report was lodged against the house
by a Wilbur sponsor, and testimony
by the freshmen involved was subse
quently sought by the judicial coun
cil. The guilty house was fined two
hundred dollars and a number of
hours at the Children's Convalescent
Home.
The Need For Dirty Rush
Among the twenty-four fraternities
on campus, members of most will
candidly admit that their houses have
been guilty of dirty rush at some
time this year. In recent Daily inter
views, many fraternity men expressed
regret that a number of means by

which they could really get to know
freshmen were considered as illegal
by the IFC. They felt that freshmen
had the maturity to consider houses
objectively and to choose for them
selves, taking into consideration any
inordinate pressures applied by the
fraternities.
Many also felt that dirty rush was
a necessity. For many fraternities
which did not have an "image" on
campus, or suffered from a poor fin
ancial condition, an increased amount
of contact with freshmen was man
datory.
In order to eliminate dirty rush the
present rules should be liberalized,
they felt. Some even advocated open
ing Wilbur to rush chairmen and in
stalling pro-fraternity advisors to
counterbalance what they considered
to be anti-fraternity sponsors in Wil
bur. Some also felt that the IFC Judi
cial Council should not have the
power to fine or assign other penalties.
View of the Conflict
Freshmen, too, felt that rush should
be changed, although there was no
consensus on the way this should be
done. Some felt that too much is ex
pected of the freshmen in too short
a time. Others felt that fraternity con
tact with Wilbur would "only make a

hectic situation worse." A number of
those interviewed expressed the feel
ing that the rules, whatever they may
be, must be adhered to.

According to the present rules,
dirty rush is defined as a fraternity
party attended by more than five
freshmen or one at which liquor is
served. Any contact with Wilbur is
also forbidden.
Quinn feels that the present rules
are an anachronism. In his words,
"freshmen have to be protected from
the pressures fraternities are accused
of subjecting them to." Quinn wOuld

like to have informal contact in

rush situations in which freshmen
are "... coerced into pledging."
The IFC Judicial Council is em

the IFB.
In recent years, penalties have
ranged from a five hundred dollar
fine to a number of hours working at
the Children's Convalescent Home.
In the most recent case, a house was
charged with holding two parties for
freshmen during Winter quarter. A
report was lodged against the house
by a Wilbur sponsor, and testimony
by the freshmen involved was subse
quently sought by the judicial coun

hundred dollars and a number of
hours at the Children's Convalescent
Home.
The Need For Dirty Rush
Among the twenty-four fraternities
on campus, members of most will
candidly admit that their houses have
been guilty of dirty rush at some
time this year. In recent Daily inter
views, many fraternity men expressed
regret that a number of means by

which they could really get to know
freshmen were considered as illegal
by the IFC. They felt that freshmen
had the maturity to consider houses
objectively and to choose for them
selves, taking into consideration any
inordinate pressures applied by the
fraternities.
Many also felt that dirty rush was
a necessity. For many fraternities
which did not have an "image" on
campus, or suffered from a poor fin
ancial condition, an increased amount
of contact with freshmen was man
datory.
In order to eliminate dirty rush the
present rules should be liberalized,
they felt. Some even advocated open
ing Wilbur to rush chairmen and in
stalling pro-fraternity advisors to
counterbalance what they considered
to be anti-fraternity sponsors in Wil
bur. Some also felt that the IFC Judi
cial Council should not have the
power to fine or assign other penalties.
View of the Conflict
Freshmen, too, felt that rush should
be changed, although there was no
consensus on the way this should be
done. Some felt that too much is ex
pected of the freshmen in too short
a time. Others felt that fraternity con
tact with Wilbur would "only make a

hectic situation worse." A number of
those interviewed expressed the feel
ing that the rules, whatever they may
be, must be adhered to.
Dirty rush remains a problem at
Stanford despite recent changes in
the IFC Rush .Rules. The fact that
there exist illegal rush practices in
dicates that either the rush rules
must be changed to encompass these
"necessary" violations or the IFC
must strictly enforce its present rules.
Rush at Present
Dirty rush is considered to be any
form of contact with freshmen that
is not permitted by the IFC. The pur
pose of any rush regulations should
be to allow maximum contact be
tween the fraternities and the fresh
men without permitting any "situa
tion in which a freshman may be
pressured into accepting a bid with
out making a rational decision," said
Michael Quinn, newly elected Presi
dent of the IFC.
