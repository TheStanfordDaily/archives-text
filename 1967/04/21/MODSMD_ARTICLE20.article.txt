# DRAMA REVIEW
## Obscenity Innocuous 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The Beard, so-called because
both the male and the female
character in the play wear
beards under their chin, stopped
off at Stanford on its way from
public nuisance prosecutions in
Berkeley to U.C. Davis.
Michael McCUure's play is
controversial because and al
though it achieves the unasham
ed pronunciation (ad nauseam)
of the staidly respectable Chau
cerain four-letter words.
Then why do the two actors
wear beards? I believe the ans
wer lies in the mistaken belief
that oral sex practices causes
women to grow facial hair.
Others think that the Jean
Harlow-Billy the Kid axis creat
ed by the actors is supposed to
have Egyptian divinity connota
tions. Hence they sport the chin
fuzz to suggest those amorous
old sister-lovers, the Egyptian
pharohs.
Whatever the symbolism, the
play's intent is obvious. Nine
teenth century France had a
phrase for it: epater les bour
geois, and we would say "to
shock people into not flinching"
at the public use of archaic En
glish. Women are always sup
posed to suffer most at the use
of four-letter words, but I have
it from the horse's mouth that
in fact they find them rather in
nocuous.
The Stanford dollies at Wed
nesday night's no holds barred
performance in the Dinkelspiel
Auditorium loved every minute
of it. No ofl'ense meant, of
course; furthermore the Stan
ford Police and the Palo Alto
Times never showed, the former
represented only by the eternal
indefatigable traffic cops yawn
ing in Tresic'lder, the latter a
family concern.
Man and Woman, The Kid

and Harlow, are sitting in a
celestial vault, bored, randy
and perfunctory. Their vocabu
lary is limited to about 500
words and the you-know-whats
are about ten of them.
The play opens with Billie
Dixon, as the girl, sitting on one
side of a table and Richard
Bright, the Kid, at the other.
Bright says to Harlow: "Come
and sit on my lap." She refuses,
naturally, but he hardly gives
up.
Not only does he want her
on his lap, but also he desires
that she lick his boots. However
it rapidly becomes evident that
by "lick my boots" the Kid is
referring to an essential part of
his anatomy. Wearing a split
thigh sheath, backless and
breathless, Miss Dixon goes
through all the motions of re
jection and withdrawal that
Simone de Beauvoir has describ
ed so tidily in The Second Sex.
In fact Harlow wants it, real
bad.
One argument that Billy is
constantly introducing to prove
the validity of his virility is that
they are all alone: nobody can
see. Just like grown-ups, so why
doesn't Jean just shut up and
get on with the job, after all,
they are there for all eternity
and there's nothing else to do
but .... Finally they do it, of
course, in full view of the au
dience with technicolor sound
effects that make it clear that
Harlow is having a pubic or
gasm and really enjoying it.
But you should have heard
the whining when Kid bit her
stocking on the toe, or when
he told her to take down her
underpants, smelt and felt them
until the moment when he
simply tore them in three. What
really offended Harlow, and
maybe that is why she berated

the Kid with so many four-let
ter obscenities, is that he re
fused to pursue her.
Ripping up her underpants —
and, readers, I can assure you
that from this point on Miss
Dixon was notably less gener
ous with the panoramic views
of her crotch — cut off the
woman's retreat into "games
playing." Now the chips were
on the table, as it were, and the
smell was in Bill's nostrils.
The acting was dead-pan and
unaffected. I especially liked
the Kid when he got between
Harlow's legs and started the
good work. It was like a banker
putting out the milk bottles to
save his wife the trouble.
The aching, lustful bit as Miss
Dixon let her head roll back
and the tail go limp was no
more than Chatterleyesque. Ob
serving audience reaction illu
minated little, surprisingly few
titters from the girls and the
men with dates were being
stoical about the whole thing
anyway. Nobody walked out.
When the lights dimmed and
the Kid relaxed, the ceaseless
battle of the sexes had been
portrayed most adequately. Ken
neth Tynan, who has made a
professional career out of spon
soring stage pornogi-aphy, is
nevertheless a stimulating cri
tic to cite: from the fastness of
London he muttered: "The
Beard is a milestone in the his
tory of heterosexual art."
