# Krips Lyric But Indolent
## 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
The San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra is serious and vener
able. At Wednesday night's
performance it was obvious that
Conductor Krips doesn't always
make them see the light.
The opening number, Wag
ner's overture to the Flying
Dutchman, was not a revelation.
The sections of the orchestra,
well constrained by Krips in
preparation for the dramatic
finale, almost succeeded in
blocking each other out.
Individual instruments, parti
cularly in the brass section, got
lost amid the confusion. Then
unwelcome silences intruded on
the Maestro's lyrically romantic
reading of the allegro.
Pedantic Rendering
Krips remained strictly pedan
tic in the second Wagner. The
Siegfried Ldyll is a later and
richer work than the overture;
it was written for his second
wife, one of Franz Liszt's illegi
timate daughters. This number
they glided through with disap
pointing flatness. It was con
vincingly monotonous.
Finally Bruckner's soaring
and tremendous Ninth Sym
phony burst on the hall. With
the whole stage creaking and
the violin tremolos exquisitely
suggesting a flock of daves,
there was evidence of deep com
mitment in both musicians and
conductor.
However, some not infre
quently hasty entrances overdid
the total impression of "feier
lich" (joyousness) which per
meates the first movement.
The scherzo saw a reversal
of the originally overcritical in
terpretation of this apocalypic
work, left unfinished by the
composer's death.
Bruckner's Last Wish
"Dear God, let me get well
soon; you see I need my health
to finish the Ninth." This was
his last ungranted wish. Bruck
ner admirers are not however
too despondent about its incom
pleteness.
Wagner and Bruckner compa
triots, romantics and giants,
were given an essentially ade
quate treatment by the SFSO,
which didn't always obey Mr.
Krip's well-tempered baton.
