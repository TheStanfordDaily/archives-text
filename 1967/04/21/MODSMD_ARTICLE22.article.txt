# Teacher's Ouster Inspires Strike
## 
### 
(AP) â€” Cheering students
and an angry faculty closed
down Catholic University in
Washington yesterday to pro
test the dismissal of a young
theology teach er by the school's
Board of Trus tees.
Dr. Malcolm Henderson, a His
tory professor representing the
600-member faculty, told a cheer
ing crowd of some 2,500 that
"we cannot and will not func
tion" until th<2 Rev. Charles E.
Curran is reinstated.
Curran, 33, who is known for
his liberal views on moral theo
logy and birth control, was noti
fied Monday that the board had
refused to renew his contract
when it expires August 31.
Demonstrations have been
held by 6,600-member student
body for the past three days
but it was not until the 22-mem
ber faculty of the School of Sac
red Theology voted to go strike
Wednesday that a boycott of
classes began.
Students Demonstrate
Before the (entire faculty met
behind closed doors for an hour
and a half, nearly 95 per cent of
the coeducational student body,
estimated by campus leaders,
stayed away I'rom their classes.
Many of them joined in a rally
in front of ';he administration
building, blocking vehicular traf
fic while singing folk songs
readily identified with civil
rights demonstrations.
The growing number of dem
onstrators then moved to the
front of McMahon Hall where
the faculty meeting was being
held and continued the rally un
til word was received on the
group's action.
Henderson read a resolution,
passed by a vote of more than
400 to 18, in. which the faculty
called the board's action "an un
usual exercise of administrative
power" and said it "is tanta
mount to a rejection and a repu
diation of the entire faculty of
the school arid its teaching."

"The academic freedom of the
man, of the faculty of the school,
and of the whole university is
thereby jeopardized to the peril
of its reputation, accreditation
and academic standing," Hen
derson said.
He toldi n#wsmen later the
number voting for the resolu
tion was more than 400 but an
exact count was not taken ex
cept for those opposed.
"The room was packed and it
legally holds 488," he said.
"During the discussion on the
resolution there were only two
or three who spoke against a
strike in principle. They said
they did not want to hold a gun
to the heads of the Board of
Trustees."
He said, however, the general
mood of the meeting was "we've
got to stop the meddling of the
trustees . . . this interference by
the religious side on academic
matters.
"We can't say that in a reso
lution," Henderson said. "But
that was the attitude. They said
we've sent notes of protests to
the board during the past 10
years. Now we had something
we could really hit them with."
Spellman Refuses Comment
In New York, a spokesman
for Francis Cardinal Spellman,
who heads the board of 33 cler
gymen and 11 laymen, said the
Cardinal would have no com
ment on the matter.
In Baltimore, however, Law
rence Cardinal Shehan, a mem
ber of the board, issued a state
ment in which he said Curran
should be "restored to his for
mer status."
Cardinal Shehan said "the en
tire matter should be referred
to the full Board of Trustees for
consideration."
The rector of the university,
the Most Reverent William J.
McDonald, declined comment on
the situation.
