# Rain, Rain Go Away?
## DAILY SPORTS PICTURES Some Reflections On Weather And Sports Daily SPORTS 
### Nick Selby DAVE BITTS 
For the sake of the Stanford
fiend, I hope it doesn't
«ain this weekend. But for his
soul's sake, I hope it does rain.
The sad fact of the matter is
that this may well be the out
standing weekend of sports con
tests at three distance-separated
sites during spring quarter.
The Runner-Eating Mud
On the Foothill J.C. all
weather track — the meet is be
■aAg held there to avoid any run
nres disappearing in the mud of
the Stanford Stadium track —
the track team meets an out
standing U.S.C. squad. The Tro
pins, as Jim Mallery's preview
shows, threaten the pride and
perhaps the very existence of
vne Stanford squad.
The meet will display the ex
citing O. J. Simpson of football
fame in the sprints—Simpson is
timed at 9.5 in the 100—and the
collegiate astronaut, pole
vaulter Bob Seagren.
Wet Balls Don't Bounce
Next the sports fan should
remember the tennis matches on
the Stanford courts Friday and
Saturday. UCLA and USC have
the outstanding talent of the na
«iOn: Stan Smith and lan Crook
endon will probably battle in the
finals of the national Intercol
legiate tournament.
And on the Stanford golf
course, last year's conference
champion USC tees off Saturday
at noon against the Tribe in a
.natch which could decide the
outcome of the league competi
'ion this year.
Only the jet-set sports fans

seem definitely assured of see
ing Sports action. For the hardy
commuters, Stanford battles
UCLA and USC in ultra-impor
tant league contests in sunny (if
smoggy) Southern California.
The L.A. contests will indicate
which team will be the league
champions and probably the
NCAA champions.
Let's Hope For Rain??
Thinking about it, perhaps
the sports fan will be saved con
siderable agony if it does rain.
No one, except that anti-intel
lectual animal known as the
Daily sports staff, is übiquitous.
A choice is consequently man
datory. But who could suffer
the anguish of missing great
tennis because of a choice to
spectate elsewhere? Or great
golf, track, and baseball?
If it rains steadily through
Saturday night, no choice will
be necessary. And being bored,
the Stanford student will, of all
things, study, thereby leaving
Sunday, which I predict will be
gorgeous, free for a day at the
beach.
So if you hope for clear
weather, you necessarily rule
out a trip to the beach, heavy
storms obviously following an
unprecedented two days of no
rain. But then if you hope for
rain and Sunday's beach blast,
you miss the top athletic
events of the spring, although
saved the agony of choosing
which event to attend.
Anyone for no rain and a
Stanford beach campus?

tance runners in the mile are
bunched together at the start.
The race was part of the Stan
ford Frosh - Cabrfllo College •
Hartnell College triangular meet
yesterday afternoon in Angell
Field. The Papooses won the
meet by a runaway margin of
fifty points over both teams.

volley bailers battle at the top
of the net for a deciding point
on the Encina gym courts.

vaulter Clint Ostrander readies

Steve Flannery was second for
the Frosh at 14'6".


In the top right photograph, an
unidentified Intramural hero
leaps high to slam the ball into
the other court for a point and
possible victory. The intramural
action is proceeding slowly due
to the rain, and yesterday after
noon marked the first competi
tion.
