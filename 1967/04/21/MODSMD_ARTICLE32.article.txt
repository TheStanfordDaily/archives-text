# Abolish The Draft
## 
### 
Although there is no topic occupying the
minds of today's student generation more than
the draft, remarkably little original thinking has
been stimulated on the subject. It has become
axiomatic that conscription must exist and the
college-age group has unfortunately resigned
itself to the fact that no viable alternatives are
possible.
No one in this country, with the exception of
General Hershey, will deny that the present
system needs drastic change. But the alterna
tives that have been presented are disappointing.
President Johnson recommends the implemen
tation of a national lottery, while others suggest
the adoption of universal national service.
Neither of these proposals will solve the
fundamental problems of the present system.
The loudest complaints against the existing draft
come from those who claim it discriminates in
favor of the educated and the wealthy, among
others. Although a lottery would no longer favor
these particular groups, it would still force some
men to dedicate two years to the military, while
allowing others to go about their business with
out incurring any obligation. And it is only more
equitable in that it relieves the consciences of the
men who now have to decide who is to serve.
But as author Bruce Chapman points out, in
justice handed out by a machine is not neces
sarily more tolerable than justice handed out by
other men. •
Universal service, while it forces a commit
ment from everyone, still does not solve the prob
lem of deciding who must risk his life in the
military and who may work in service projects.
Dr. Milton Friedman refers to universal service
as the regimentation of all youth to camouflage
the regimentation of some.
Of primary concern should be the principle
of having a draft. Except in major wars, the
United States has always had a tradition of man
ning its armed forces only with volunteers. In a
country which prides itself on allowing each man
maximum freedom from intrusion by govern
ment, conscription can only be considered when
survival of the nation is at stake. And the survival
of the United States is not at stake today.
The present selective service system does not
even provide the armed forces with the neces
sary quality of soldiers. No matter how many
men it can provide, the high turnover rate of
draftees (95 per cent) prevents the possibility
of an army with properly qualified and experi
enced personnel. Modern warfare calls for
greater specialization, therefore requiring a
smaller, more highly trained military, rather
than a mass army. Such a force cannot be created
with draftees; the $3 billion spent annually to
train draftees is in large part responsible for the
inefficiency and high cost of the present system.
Universal national service would only compound
this problem to the point of absurdity.
The solution to the nation's manpower needs
does not lie either with a lottery or with national
service, but rather with a volunteer military.
That this would solve the problem of inequities
is obvious. And although many have argued that
it is practically and economically impossible,
several noted scholars have recently advanced
convincing arguments purporting the feasibility
of an all-volunteer system.
The two practical arguments against a volun

tary military have always been that it would
be too costly and that sufficient manpower could
not be obtained. Defense Secretary Robert Mac-
Namara has given figures as high as $20 billion
for the implementation of a voluntary system,
although a recent study by Dr. Walter Oi, a
University of Washington economist who has
worked on draft manpower in the Pentagon,
reveals that the cost of replacing the draft with
a voluntary army would be closer to $4 billion.
Likewise, the Defense Department study of
1965, which President Johnson refused to re
lease, confirms that conscription could be abol
ished for between $3.1 and $4.5 billion. Further
more, Dr. Oi predicts that more efficient use of
manpower would save $5 billion per annum.
Obtaining enough manpower is not a prob
lem. Dr. Oi's study shows that 70 per cent of all
who presently volunteer would do so even if
there were no draft. In order to obtain greater
numbers it would be necessary to make the
military more appealing, for instance by increas
ing salaries and improving facilities and benefits
for soldiers.
At the same time, a volunteer army of pro
fessionals would not have to be as large as our
present army. Bruce Chapman points out that
85 per cent of positions in the military are non
combatant. Surely many of these could be filled
by civilians. Also, the unnecessarily high mental
and physical qualifications could be lowered so
that many who are rejected by the military could
be accepted to do less skilled work.
But the most important benefit of a voluntary
military is that it would provide greater quality
of personnel; men who accept a job by choice
will always take pride in their work and inevit
ably be more conscientious. According to Brig.
General Lynn Smith, 43 per cent of the army
has less than one year's experience; this is cer
tainly not a force which can handle an emerg
ency situation. The examples of Korea and
Berlin illustrate that in crisis situations the
government has repeatedly relied on reserve
forces rather than draftees. Likewise, a voluntary
army, being skilled and experienced, would be
able to respond more effectively to crises than
the present system.
An objection frequently raised is that a volun
tary military may become too powerful and
could endanger civilian control of the country.
Significantly, however, the recent pattern has
been for more military coups to occur in nations
with conscription. The status of the ordinary
soldier has little bearing on the power of the
military. It is the relationship of the upper
echelons of the military to the civilian govern
ment which detennines whether a military can
become too powerful; in the United States, civil
ian authority has always been supreme.
Clearly, a voluntary military would solve
many of the problems of the present system.
Senator Mark Hatfield recently introduced a
bill proposing the establishment of a voluntary
system. It is surprising that so few have con
sidered this alternative, particularly since the
options presented so far have generated little
enthusiasm. Furthermore, the voluntary military
proposal has the particular merit of being the
only alternative which may relieve the tensions
existing in this country today. It deserves
serious consideration, even if onlv for this reason.

survival of the nation is at stake. And the survival
of the United States is not at stake today.
The present selective service system does not
even provide the armed forces with the neces
sary quality of soldiers. No matter how many
men it can provide, the high turnover rate of
draftees (95 per cent) prevents the possibility
of an army with properly qualified and experi
enced personnel. Modern warfare calls for
greater specialization, therefore requiring a
smaller, more highly trained military, rather
than a mass army. Such a force cannot be created
with draftees; the $3 billion spent annually to
train draftees is in large part responsible for the
inefficiency and high cost of the present system.
Universal national service would only compound
this problem to the point of absurdity.
The solution to the nation's manpower needs
does not lie either with a lottery or with national
service, but rather with a volunteer military.
That this would solve the problem of inequities
is obvious. And although many have argued that
it is practically and economically impossible,
several noted scholars have recently advanced
convincing arguments purporting the feasibility
of an all-volunteer system.
The two practical arguments against a volun

tary military have always been that it would
be too costly and that sufficient manpower could
not be obtained. Defense Secretary Robert Mac-
Namara has given figures as high as $20 billion
for the implementation of a voluntary system,
although a recent study by Dr. Walter Oi, a
University of Washington economist who has
worked on draft manpower in the Pentagon,
reveals that the cost of replacing the draft with
a voluntary army would be closer to $4 billion.
Likewise, the Defense Department study of
1965, which President Johnson refused to re
lease, confirms that conscription could be abol
ished for between $3.1 and $4.5 billion. Further
more, Dr. Oi predicts that more efficient use of
manpower would save $5 billion per annum.
Obtaining enough manpower is not a prob
lem. Dr. Oi's study shows that 70 per cent of all
who presently volunteer would do so even if
there were no draft. In order to obtain greater
numbers it would be necessary to make the
military more appealing, for instance by increas
ing salaries and improving facilities and benefits
for soldiers.
At the same time, a volunteer army of pro
fessionals would not have to be as large as our
present army. Bruce Chapman points out that
85 per cent of positions in the military are non
combatant. Surely many of these could be filled
by civilians. Also, the unnecessarily high mental
and physical qualifications could be lowered so
that many who are rejected by the military could
be accepted to do less skilled work.
But the most important benefit of a voluntary
military is that it would provide greater quality
of personnel; men who accept a job by choice
will always take pride in their work and inevit
ably be more conscientious. According to Brig.
General Lynn Smith, 43 per cent of the army
has less than one year's experience; this is cer
tainly not a force which can handle an emerg
ency situation. The examples of Korea and
Berlin illustrate that in crisis situations the
government has repeatedly relied on reserve
forces rather than draftees. Likewise, a voluntary
army, being skilled and experienced, would be
able to respond more effectively to crises than
the present system.
An objection frequently raised is that a volun
tary military may become too powerful and
could endanger civilian control of the country.
Significantly, however, the recent pattern has
been for more military coups to occur in nations
with conscription. The status of the ordinary
soldier has little bearing on the power of the
military. It is the relationship of the upper
echelons of the military to the civilian govern
ment which detennines whether a military can
become too powerful; in the United States, civil
ian authority has always been supreme.
Clearly, a voluntary military would solve
many of the problems of the present system.
Senator Mark Hatfield recently introduced a
bill proposing the establishment of a voluntary
system. It is surprising that so few have con
sidered this alternative, particularly since the
options presented so far have generated little
enthusiasm. Furthermore, the voluntary military
proposal has the particular merit of being the
only alternative which may relieve the tensions
existing in this country today. It deserves
serious consideration, even if onlv for this reason.


The Lottery
Although there is no topic occupying the
minds of today's student generation more than
the draft, remarkably little original thinking has
been stimulated on the subject. It has become
axiomatic that conscription must exist and the
college-age group has unfortunately resigned
itself to the fact that no viable alternatives are
possible.
No one in this country, with the exception of
General Hershey, will deny that the present
system needs drastic change. But the alterna
tives that have been presented are disappointing.
President Johnson recommends the implemen
tation of a national lottery, while others suggest
the adoption of universal national service.
Neither of these proposals will solve the
fundamental problems of the present system.
The loudest complaints against the existing draft
come from those who claim it discriminates in
favor of the educated and the wealthy, among
others. Although a lottery would no longer favor
these particular groups, it would still force some
men to dedicate two years to the military, while
allowing others to go about their business with
out incurring any obligation. And it is only more
equitable in that it relieves the consciences of the
men who now have to decide who is to serve.
But as author Bruce Chapman points out, in
justice handed out by a machine is not neces
sarily more tolerable than justice handed out by
other men. •
Universal service, while it forces a commit
ment from everyone, still does not solve the prob
lem of deciding who must risk his life in the
military and who may work in service projects.
Dr. Milton Friedman refers to universal service
as the regimentation of all youth to camouflage
the regimentation of some.
Of primary concern should be the principle
of having a draft. Except in major wars, the
United States has always had a tradition of man
ning its armed forces only with volunteers. In a
country which prides itself on allowing each man
maximum freedom from intrusion by govern
ment, conscription can only be considered when
survival of the nation is at stake. And the survival

manpower would save $5 billion per annum.
Obtaining enough manpower is not a prob
lem. Dr. Oi's study shows that 70 per cent of all
who presently volunteer would do so even if
there were no draft. In order to obtain greater
numbers it would be necessary to make the
military more appealing, for instance by increas
ing salaries and improving facilities and benefits
for soldiers.
At the same time, a volunteer army of pro
fessionals would not have to be as large as our
present army. Bruce Chapman points out that
85 per cent of positions in the military are non
combatant. Surely many of these could be filled
by civilians. Also, the unnecessarily high mental
and physical qualifications could be lowered so
that many who are rejected by the military could
be accepted to do less skilled work.
But the most important benefit of a voluntary
military is that it would provide greater quality
of personnel; men who accept a job by choice
will always take pride in their work and inevit
ably be more conscientious. According to Brig.
General Lynn Smith, 43 per cent of the army
has less than one year's experience; this is cer
tainly not a force which can handle an emerg
ency situation. The examples of Korea and
Berlin illustrate that in crisis situations the
government has repeatedly relied on reserve
forces rather than draftees. Likewise, a voluntary
army, being skilled and experienced, would be
able to respond more effectively to crises than
the present system.
An objection frequently raised is that a volun
tary military may become too powerful and
could endanger civilian control of the country.
Significantly, however, the recent pattern has
been for more military coups to occur in nations
with conscription. The status of the ordinary
soldier has little bearing on the power of the
military. It is the relationship of the upper
echelons of the military to the civilian govern
ment which detennines whether a military can
become too powerful; in the United States, civil
ian authority has always been supreme.
Clearly, a voluntary military would solve
many of the problems of the present system.
Senator Mark Hatfield recently introduced a
bill proposing the establishment of a voluntary
system. It is surprising that so few have con
sidered this alternative, particularly since the
options presented so far have generated little
enthusiasm. Furthermore, the voluntary military
proposal has the particular merit of being the
only alternative which may relieve the tensions
existing in this country today. It deserves
serious consideration, even if onlv for this reason.


The Lottery
Although there is no topic occupying the
minds of today's student generation more than
the draft, remarkably little original thinking has
been stimulated on the subject. It has become
axiomatic that conscription must exist and the
college-age group has unfortunately resigned
itself to the fact that no viable alternatives are
possible.
No one in this country, with the exception of
General Hershey, will deny that the present
system needs drastic change. But the alterna
tives that have been presented are disappointing.
President Johnson recommends the implemen
tation of a national lottery, while others suggest
the adoption of universal national service.
Neither of these proposals will solve the
fundamental problems of the present system.
The loudest complaints against the existing draft
come from those who claim it discriminates in
favor of the educated and the wealthy, among
others. Although a lottery would no longer favor
these particular groups, it would still force some
men to dedicate two years to the military, while
allowing others to go about their business with
out incurring any obligation. And it is only more
equitable in that it relieves the consciences of the
men who now have to decide who is to serve.
But as author Bruce Chapman points out, in
justice handed out by a machine is not neces
sarily more tolerable than justice handed out by
other men. •
Universal service, while it forces a commit
ment from everyone, still does not solve the prob
lem of deciding who must risk his life in the
military and who may work in service projects.
Dr. Milton Friedman refers to universal service
as the regimentation of all youth to camouflage
the regimentation of some.
Of primary concern should be the principle
of having a draft. Except in major wars, the
United States has always had a tradition of man
ning its armed forces only with volunteers. In a
country which prides itself on allowing each man
maximum freedom from intrusion by govern
ment, conscription can only be considered when
survival of the nation is at stake. And the survival
of the United States is not at stake today.
The present selective service system does not
even provide the armed forces with the neces
sary quality of soldiers. No matter how many
men it can provide, the high turnover rate of
draftees (95 per cent) prevents the possibility
of an army with properly qualified and experi
enced personnel. Modern warfare calls for
greater specialization, therefore requiring a
smaller, more highly trained military, rather
than a mass army. Such a force cannot be created
with draftees; the $3 billion spent annually to
train draftees is in large part responsible for the
inefficiency and high cost of the present system.
Universal national service would only compound
this problem to the point of absurdity.
The solution to the nation's manpower needs
does not lie either with a lottery or with national
service, but rather with a volunteer military.
That this would solve the problem of inequities
is obvious. And although many have argued that
it is practically and economically impossible,
several noted scholars have recently advanced
convincing arguments purporting the feasibility
of an all-volunteer system.
The two practical arguments against a volun

tary military have always been that it would
be too costly and that sufficient manpower could
not be obtained. Defense Secretary Robert Mac-
Namara has given figures as high as $20 billion
for the implementation of a voluntary system,
although a recent study by Dr. Walter Oi, a
University of Washington economist who has
worked on draft manpower in the Pentagon,
reveals that the cost of replacing the draft with
a voluntary army would be closer to $4 billion.
Likewise, the Defense Department study of
1965, which President Johnson refused to re
lease, confirms that conscription could be abol
ished for between $3.1 and $4.5 billion. Further
more, Dr. Oi predicts that more efficient use of
manpower would save $5 billion per annum.
