# Two Minutes of Haight
## Men Or Materialistic Puppets? 
### Tim Haight 
The hippies and activists, so
often today seen as opposites,
are only opposite in that they
occupy different sides of the
same coin.
The activist seeks to control
the institutions of our society,
to keep in check the incredibly
vast bureaucracy technology
that lumbers along the lip of
the abyss. The hippie seeks to
withdraw from this vast or
ganization enough so that he
can find himself, believing that
"they way to do is to be."
Both of these activities are
indispensable, the control of our
vast extensions and the dis
covery of our souls. Unless hu
manity and technology are
brought into balance, we are
lost.
This may not sound very ori
ginal. It isn't. The basic hang-up
is mentioned in the I Ching,
written thousands of years ago.
More recently H. G. Wells men
tioned in his Outline of
that the world was involved in
a deadly race between techno
logy and education.
Captives of Technology
What is perhaps more shock
ing, though again not original,
is the fact that materialism has
entered so far into the thinking
of man that the distinction be
tween technology and educa
tion is now almost impossible to
make. So much education today
is concerned with the means
and not the ends.
In addition to the university,
business can be singled out as
a captive of "technology". To
keep up employment, business
is compelled to produce and mar
ket goods that people really
don't need — but for some rea
son the idea of creating jobs
and products to eliminate pol
lution, poverty, and population
explosion only occurs to busi
ness when accompanied by out
side force.
Within the individual, the
usual situation seems to be that
material goods are valued more
highly than the ideals of an
end to poverty, to war, or even
to the physical and psychological
diseases that are the indirect
by-products of our economy.

This individual deplores seg
regation in the South, but will
not let a Negro into his neigh
borhood. This individual de
plores the Russian intervention
in Hungary but supports the
war in Vietnam. This individual
is afraid of communism, afraid
of the Negro, afraid of the un
derdeveloped world — and
rightly so — for this individual's
incestuous affair with money
has made those people hate
him.
The fear of these people, the
folklore of their economic in
stitutions, and the functionalism
of their education add up to
the ferocity of their foreign pol
icy and the frugality of their
poverty programs. The only "112"
that doesn't seem to be part of
the American way is freedom.
That is because we are puppets
of Hammon, the god of material
goods.
Prophets, Not Profits
Our minds will remain narrow,
our perceptions within blinders,
until we make the choice that
nothing that materialism has to
offer is as important as self
knowledge, and the feeling that
we have really, completely, done
our bit to make this world bet
ter.
This is not a task that can
be done in one's spare time. If
one does not make a choice to
work full-time on improving the
lot of his race, that lot will hard
ly improve. There is a vacuum
today in that area of goal-set
ting, of soul-finding, and of
struggling to control our vast
machines. We need prophets,
not profits.
This is not to say that basic
research and production of ma
terial goods are in themselves
bad. They are neither good nor
bad. But it does say that if you
are considering a career, the
place where you are needed the
most is not in the neutral area
but in the arena of decision
making.
Man In Control
Human beings must form
their institutions and means of
production instead of the other
way around. It is possible, but

it requires men who are free
from the fetters of desire for
material goods. To control tech
nology we must first cease to
be controlled by it.
Many ways of action are open,
provided one has the persever
ance. You can analyse our so
ciety and try to steer it, within
and without the system. You
can drop out and build your
self, in the hope that your se
renity of mind will be a call to

those who are still enmeshed
in the capitalistic games.
But there are some thingj
you should not do. You should
not allow yourself to become a
neutral quantity that can be
manipulated by lesser man. You
should not become a weapon, or
a machine, or a computer. Yc
are a human being, part of a
long tradition of acting on yoke
fellows and your environment.
You are a human being.

one does not make a choice to
work full-time on improving the
lot of his race, that lot will hard
ly improve. There is a vacuum
today in that area of goal-set
ting, of soul-finding, and of
struggling to control our vast
machines. We need prophets,
not profits.
This is not to say that basic
research and production of ma
terial goods are in themselves
bad. They are neither good nor
bad. But it does say that if you
are considering a career, the
place where you are needed the
most is not in the neutral area
but in the arena of decision
making.
Man In Control
Human beings must form
their institutions and means of
production instead of the other
way around. It is possible, but

it requires men who are free
from the fetters of desire for
material goods. To control tech
nology we must first cease to
be controlled by it.
Many ways of action are open,
provided one has the persever
ance. You can analyse our so
ciety and try to steer it, within
and without the system. You
can drop out and build your
self, in the hope that your se
renity of mind will be a call to

those who are still enmeshed
in the capitalistic games.
But there are some thingj
you should not do. You should
not allow yourself to become a
neutral quantity that can be
manipulated by lesser man. You
should not become a weapon, or
a machine, or a computer. Yc
are a human being, part of a
long tradition of acting on yoke
fellows and your environment.
You are a human being.
The hippies and activists, so
often today seen as opposites,
are only opposite in that they
occupy different sides of the
same coin.
The activist seeks to control
the institutions of our society,
to keep in check the incredibly
vast bureaucracy technology
that lumbers along the lip of
the abyss. The hippie seeks to
withdraw from this vast or
ganization enough so that he
can find himself, believing that
"they way to do is to be."
Both of these activities are
indispensable, the control of our
vast extensions and the dis
covery of our souls. Unless hu
manity and technology are
brought into balance, we are
lost.
This may not sound very ori
ginal. It isn't. The basic hang-up
is mentioned in the I Ching,
written thousands of years ago.
More recently H. G. Wells men
tioned in his Outline of
that the world was involved in
a deadly race between techno
logy and education.
Captives of Technology
What is perhaps more shock
ing, though again not original,
is the fact that materialism has
entered so far into the thinking
of man that the distinction be
tween technology and educa
tion is now almost impossible to
make. So much education today
is concerned with the means
and not the ends.
In addition to the university,
business can be singled out as
a captive of "technology". To
keep up employment, business
is compelled to produce and mar
ket goods that people really
don't need — but for some rea
son the idea of creating jobs
and products to eliminate pol
lution, poverty, and population
explosion only occurs to busi
ness when accompanied by out
side force.
Within the individual, the
usual situation seems to be that
material goods are valued more
highly than the ideals of an
end to poverty, to war, or even
to the physical and psychological
diseases that are the indirect
by-products of our economy.

This individual deplores seg
regation in the South, but will
not let a Negro into his neigh
borhood. This individual de
plores the Russian intervention
in Hungary but supports the
war in Vietnam. This individual
is afraid of communism, afraid
of the Negro, afraid of the un
derdeveloped world — and
rightly so — for this individual's
incestuous affair with money
has made those people hate
him.
The fear of these people, the
folklore of their economic in
stitutions, and the functionalism
of their education add up to
the ferocity of their foreign pol
icy and the frugality of their
poverty programs. The only "112"
that doesn't seem to be part of
the American way is freedom.
That is because we are puppets
of Hammon, the god of material
goods.
Prophets, Not Profits
Our minds will remain narrow,
our perceptions within blinders,
until we make the choice that
nothing that materialism has to
offer is as important as self
knowledge, and the feeling that
we have really, completely, done
our bit to make this world bet
ter.

and products to eliminate pol
lution, poverty, and population
explosion only occurs to busi
ness when accompanied by out
side force.
Within the individual, the
usual situation seems to be that
material goods are valued more
highly than the ideals of an
end to poverty, to war, or even
to the physical and psychological
diseases that are the indirect
by-products of our economy.

This individual deplores seg
regation in the South, but will
not let a Negro into his neigh
borhood. This individual de
plores the Russian intervention
in Hungary but supports the
war in Vietnam. This individual
is afraid of communism, afraid
of the Negro, afraid of the un
derdeveloped world — and
rightly so — for this individual's
incestuous affair with money
has made those people hate
him.
The fear of these people, the
folklore of their economic in
stitutions, and the functionalism
of their education add up to
the ferocity of their foreign pol
icy and the frugality of their
poverty programs. The only "112"
that doesn't seem to be part of
the American way is freedom.
That is because we are puppets
of Hammon, the god of material
goods.
Prophets, Not Profits
Our minds will remain narrow,
our perceptions within blinders,
until we make the choice that
nothing that materialism has to
offer is as important as self
knowledge, and the feeling that
we have really, completely, done
our bit to make this world bet
ter.
This is not a task that can
be done in one's spare time. If
one does not make a choice to
work full-time on improving the
lot of his race, that lot will hard
ly improve. There is a vacuum
today in that area of goal-set
ting, of soul-finding, and of
struggling to control our vast
machines. We need prophets,
not profits.
This is not to say that basic
research and production of ma
terial goods are in themselves
bad. They are neither good nor
bad. But it does say that if you
are considering a career, the
place where you are needed the
most is not in the neutral area
but in the arena of decision
making.
Man In Control
Human beings must form
their institutions and means of
production instead of the other
way around. It is possible, but

it requires men who are free
from the fetters of desire for
material goods. To control tech
nology we must first cease to
be controlled by it.
Many ways of action are open,
provided one has the persever
ance. You can analyse our so
ciety and try to steer it, within
and without the system. You
can drop out and build your
self, in the hope that your se
renity of mind will be a call to

those who are still enmeshed
in the capitalistic games.
But there are some thingj
you should not do. You should
not allow yourself to become a
neutral quantity that can be
manipulated by lesser man. You
should not become a weapon, or
a machine, or a computer. Yc
are a human being, part of a
long tradition of acting on yoke
fellows and your environment.
You are a human being.
The hippies and activists, so
often today seen as opposites,
are only opposite in that they
occupy different sides of the
same coin.
The activist seeks to control
the institutions of our society,
to keep in check the incredibly
vast bureaucracy technology
that lumbers along the lip of
the abyss. The hippie seeks to
withdraw from this vast or
ganization enough so that he
can find himself, believing that
"they way to do is to be."
Both of these activities are
indispensable, the control of our
vast extensions and the dis
covery of our souls. Unless hu
manity and technology are
brought into balance, we are
lost.
This may not sound very ori
ginal. It isn't. The basic hang-up
is mentioned in the I Ching,
written thousands of years ago.
More recently H. G. Wells men
tioned in his Outline of
that the world was involved in
a deadly race between techno
logy and education.
Captives of Technology
What is perhaps more shock
ing, though again not original,
is the fact that materialism has
entered so far into the thinking
of man that the distinction be
tween technology and educa
tion is now almost impossible to
make. So much education today
is concerned with the means
and not the ends.
In addition to the university,
business can be singled out as
a captive of "technology". To
keep up employment, business
is compelled to produce and mar
ket goods that people really
don't need — but for some rea
son the idea of creating jobs
and products to eliminate pol
lution, poverty, and population
explosion only occurs to busi
ness when accompanied by out
side force.
