## Wendy: Queen Of Hearts 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
From a mother's heart, thank
you for your warm support of
Wendy.
Whether she goes on to be
come National College Queen or
not is now unimportant. You
have made her a queen in the
heart of Stanford. The entire
illustrious-global family is in
your debt for this greater glory.
As to the question raised by
INFOPLAN: "Is she real?"
Well, I personally can vouch for
the reality of both Wendy and
Warren. Who can vouch for the
reality of INFOPLAN? where's
their mother?
Bless you,
MRS. W. W. WONKA

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to congratulate
The Daily on its fine series on
the architecture of Stanford,
highlighted by the forum in
Wednesday's issue. Students at
Stanford should become more
aware and perceptive of their
physical surroundings and
should understand some of the
problems of contemporary insti
tutional plannire and develop
ment.
I have been aware of the arch
itectural differences and incon
sistencies at Stanford over the
past four years which has seen
much construction, displace
ment, and progress.
Inspired by a look at Stan
ford's architecture in Geology 1
(I was told you may see some

sea shells in the pillars on Quad
or at Engineering Corner), and
by the unforgettable lecture by
Otis Pease, who, like some of
Stanford's more venerable struc
tures, is now gone, entitled
"America in Brownstone" and
emphasizing the solidarity of
such men as Richardson, Olm
stead, yea, Frederick Jackson
Turner, I have been prompted to
turn and look around me, and
to take in all that Stanford's
buildings have to offer.
Even in their remarkable
mediocrity and uniformity, they
are indicative of the times and
attitudes of Stanford. But I
must agree with Professors
Eitner and Smith that it's about
time we stopped all this red tile
roof mania and boldly stepped
forward (maybe even plunge
over that übiquitous edge of
greatness, that San Andreas
fault of the Board of Trustees
and the Committee on Univer
sity Planning) to combine the
many resources of the land, the
area, and minds unencumbered
by committee regulations, and
come up with something truly
stimulating in the line of archi
tecture at Stanford.
I would like to say that, in
this line, Jeffrey Smith's con
cept of a Stanford Business Cen
ter and a Cultural Center is re
markable in its conception and
its possibilities, and should not
be left to die on the pages of
The Daily.
