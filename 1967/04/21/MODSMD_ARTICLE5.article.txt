# Rusher, Scheer Disagree On Goals, Financial Support For Magazines

### LINDSAY BLACKMAN 
An independent political journal re
sembles a cyclops â€” fierce and power
ful but having only one eye. Yester
day afternoon William Rusher, pub
lisher of the National Review, and
Robert Scheer, managing editor of
Ramparts, confronted the cyclops in
a debate of "The Independent Poli
tical Journal and American Political
Thought."
Sheer expressed disappointment at
having an audience of only 60, com
menting that at most other univer
sities such a debate would draw a
crowd of at least 500. Rusher offered

that his presence usually "under
whelms" a campus. The journalists
welcomed the opportunity, however,
to discuss a topic other than the
Vietnam war.
Denied Conspiracy
Speaking first, Scheer described the
principles guiding Ramparts and the
problems the magazine has encount
ered. In three years the publication
has grown in circulation from 2,000
to 300,000, and aims at a readership
of a million. Ramparts, in attempting
to transcend the cold war ethic, denies
a world communist conspiracy.
Ramparts wants to create a climate

in which fundamental changes can
occur. The magazine seeks solutions
outside western capitalism, an "out
dated, irrational economic system de
pendent on war". Interested in alter
nate ways of life, it debunks Victor
ian viewpoints by examining homo
sexuality and drugs.
Rusher characterized the National
Review as opposed to the "liberal es
tablishment, the dull bunch of lib
erals running society". Given this en
vironment, he is not surprised at the
appearance of what he considers
muckraking in Ramparts. Rusher
feels that a magazine should stand
apart from politics but considers
muckraking an unsuitable substitute
for a point of view. He charged Ram
parts with being only negative and
exhibiting a "hatred for American so
ciety".
Prejudiced Printers
Scheer feels that too many maga
zines have a timid approach to jour
nalism. He attributes this attitude to
the prejudice of advertisers, printers,
and distributors, forces which act as
unofficial censors.
Scheer is deeply disturbed at the
power which commercial forces, es
pecially advertisers, exert over pub

lishers. He cited the demise of Col
lier's magazine and the west coast
edition of The New York Times as
examples of dependence on commer
cial advertising for publication. In a
survey of some 30-add publications,
Scheer found only one, the Readers'
Digest, which was able to survive
independent of advertising revenue.
Pre-Accepted Bias
Rusher felt that small political
magazines (such as the National Re
view and Ramparts) must have an
a priori approach, treating issues ac
cording to first principles and a pre
accepted bias. He did not feel, how
ever, that a political magazine should
expect to earn a profit any more than
Stanford University or the Demo
cratic Party.
Scheer and Rusher were unable to
agree on much more than that serious
problems exist in magazine distribu
tion. Believing that sales should be
separate from the message of the
media, Scheer proposed federal gov
ernment subsidy of magazines to re
place advertising, the amount to be
based on circulation figures. Rusher
disagreed with this idea, considering
it dangerous to make opinion depen
dent on government subsidy.
