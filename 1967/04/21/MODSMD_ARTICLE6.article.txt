# Toynbee Speaks On Nationalism As Hindrance To World Peace
## 
### BONNIE SELWAY 
"The challenge of our times is to
break with the recent habit of na
tionalism . . . and subordinate our na
tionalism to the loyalty of mankind,"
said historian Arnold J. Toynbee in
the first of the Carlos McClatchy Me
morial Lectures in Memorial Audi
torium last night.
"Our only chance of survival is to
forget the distance between insiders
and outsiders, and form a revolution
ary new habit of regarding others as
members of our family ... If we
don't make this change quickly we're
going to destroy ourselves." he stated.
To a capacity audience Prof. Toyn
bee delivered the first subject, en
titled 'The Challenge," of his series
topic "Conservative Social Versus Re
volutionary Technological Change."
Toynbee traced nationalism back
to the tribalism of primitive food
gathering peoples who, due to inade
quate technology, were "forced to
live in small groups ... as the only
alternative to starvation."
With the Industrial Revolution
technology "picked up speed," and
linked the world together physically,
but not socially. "We're changing our
technological surroundings without
corresponding changes in the social
and ethical surroundings."
The closure of tribalism has be
come the closure of nationalism, he
said.
The unity given the world by the
Roman Empire and the Christian
world church, Toynbee asserted, dis
sipitated with their collapse and the
tribalism that "existed close to the
surface" reasserted itself.
If these two unities had succeeded
in the West they would have "match
ed socially what technology was do
ing to the world physically," Toynbee
claimed. Instead, the discrepancy be

tween the ideals and practices of the
Christian Commonwealth destroyed
its sovereignty; "we replaced our
Christian gods by our respective na
tions as gods."
The rest of the world is adopting
not only the technology but also the
nationalism of the Western world,
which Toynbee defined as the Adria
tic on the East to California on the
west plus Australia and New Zea
land.
"The West has been on the fringe
of the civilized world, not the center,"
which was the Mediterranean area and
the Near East, agricultural civiliza
tions. Characterized by a sparsity of
population West had to invent
machines to compensate for the lack
of manpower.
"The Western world was very pro
gressive technologically but very
backwards socially," so technology
moved into the field of weapon de
velopment to implement wars, said
Toynbee.
The habit of nationalism can be
broken if man will realize that he is
not an animal of habit, but has free
dom of choice. Our choice is that set
forward by the king in Deuteronomy,
"See, I have set before you life and
good, death and evil." Toynbee's sug
gestion for the fostering of world
peace and unity is love.
"Love is the only hope for the world
in an age of enormous technological
power. But love is no omnipotent. It
will prevail only if we resolve to let
it prevail," he said.
The challenge of today is to show
"courage, imagination and determina
tion to exercise the freedom of choice
that is our distinct human trait . . .
We must make up our mind to break
the habit of treating the majority of
our human beings as strangers and
possible enemies."

which was the Mediterranean area and
the Near East, agricultural civiliza
tions. Characterized by a sparsity of
population West had to invent
machines to compensate for the lack
of manpower.
"The Western world was very pro
gressive technologically but very
backwards socially," so technology
moved into the field of weapon de
velopment to implement wars, said
Toynbee.
The habit of nationalism can be
broken if man will realize that he is
not an animal of habit, but has free
dom of choice. Our choice is that set
forward by the king in Deuteronomy,
"See, I have set before you life and
good, death and evil." Toynbee's sug
gestion for the fostering of world
peace and unity is love.
"Love is the only hope for the world
in an age of enormous technological
power. But love is no omnipotent. It
will prevail only if we resolve to let
it prevail," he said.
The challenge of today is to show
"courage, imagination and determina
tion to exercise the freedom of choice
that is our distinct human trait . . .
We must make up our mind to break
the habit of treating the majority of
our human beings as strangers and
possible enemies."

"The challenge of our times is to
break with the recent habit of na
tionalism . . . and subordinate our na
tionalism to the loyalty of mankind,"
said historian Arnold J. Toynbee in
the first of the Carlos McClatchy Me
morial Lectures in Memorial Audi
torium last night.
"Our only chance of survival is to
forget the distance between insiders
and outsiders, and form a revolution
ary new habit of regarding others as
members of our family ... If we
don't make this change quickly we're
going to destroy ourselves." he stated.
To a capacity audience Prof. Toyn
bee delivered the first subject, en
titled 'The Challenge," of his series
topic "Conservative Social Versus Re
volutionary Technological Change."
Toynbee traced nationalism back
to the tribalism of primitive food
gathering peoples who, due to inade
quate technology, were "forced to
live in small groups ... as the only
alternative to starvation."
With the Industrial Revolution
technology "picked up speed," and
linked the world together physically,
but not socially. "We're changing our
technological surroundings without
corresponding changes in the social
and ethical surroundings."
The closure of tribalism has be
come the closure of nationalism, he
said.
The unity given the world by the
Roman Empire and the Christian
world church, Toynbee asserted, dis
sipitated with their collapse and the
tribalism that "existed close to the
surface" reasserted itself.
If these two unities had succeeded
in the West they would have "match
ed socially what technology was do
ing to the world physically," Toynbee
claimed. Instead, the discrepancy be

tween the ideals and practices of the
Christian Commonwealth destroyed
its sovereignty; "we replaced our
Christian gods by our respective na
tions as gods."
The rest of the world is adopting
not only the technology but also the
nationalism of the Western world,
which Toynbee defined as the Adria
tic on the East to California on the
west plus Australia and New Zea
land.
"The West has been on the fringe
of the civilized world, not the center,"
which was the Mediterranean area and
the Near East, agricultural civiliza
tions. Characterized by a sparsity of
population West had to invent
machines to compensate for the lack
of manpower.
