# LASSU Studies C15 Honor Code Recommendation
## 
### 
Legislature last night approved
the preliminary wording for a refer
endum on the honor code.
All students voting in the May 3
and 4 primary election for student
body president will bo asked first
whether they prefer the present Hon
or Code, a modified Honor Code, or
no Honor Code. The three student
members of the Committee of Fifteen
who presented the proposal to LASSU
warned that a rejection of the entire
Honor Code would probably result in
the faculty's imposition of a rigid
proctor system for all exams.
Martin Gerry, chairman of the Ju
dicial Council, announced at the meet
ing that the Judicial Council selection
committee, with the unanimous ap
proval of the council, had appointed
economics professor Lorie Tarshis to
fill a vacated position for the remain
der of spring quarter.
In other action LASSU appropri
ated $550 to the Organization of Afri
can Students for a program they have
already embarked on and approved
the selections of the Overseas Ex
change Schola r ship Commission.
