# Local Municpalities Challenge Industrial Parks
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
(Third in a series dealing with the
problems between Stanford and local
municipalities.)
The University is experiencing fur
ther difficulties with local municipali
ties concerning development of the
Stanford Industrial Park and another
industrial park planned for the ram
pus, which is still in its very early
planning stages.
The Palo Alto Planning Commis
sion denied but then voted to recon
sider zoning for a five acre site in the
Stanford Industrial Park, off Page
Mill Road in hopes that the University
will bargain—offering the city some
thing in return for the zoning priv
ilege.
At the same time, in the area near
the linear accelerator off Sand Hill
Road, the University has begun plan
ning another industrial park only to

meet objections from area residents
even before they begin official plan
ning.
In the Page Mill development prob
lem the University has petitioned the
city of Palo Alto for annexation of
the site with light industrial zoning.
The zoning would allow Syntex
Corporation to expand its present
facilities with the addition of a plan
ned World Research Center that
would deal with population explosion
and similar problems.
Action Postponed
The zoning board however after
taking a preliminary vote that would
not allow the zoning, postponed any
action for 60 to 90 days, instead. The
apparent intention of some commis
sion members was to force the Uni
versity to make certain agreements
and promises unrelated to Syntex in
exchange for the zoning.

It has been rumored that Syntex
will build the plant outside the United
States if it can't build on the Indus
trial Park site.
"Ideal" Industry
Dixon Arnett, University Director
of Community Relations, said that
this plant is an ideal example of the
industry desired in the area because
it "complements the academic enter
prise" so well.
"The plant should be judged on its
own merits rather than as a political
football," insisted Arnett.
The proposed industrial develop
ment off Sand Hill Road which is
slated for the proposed site of the
Ladera Dam (which the University
feels will not be constructed) is under
attack by the residents of Ladera.
In a letter to the Board of Supervis
ors of San Mateo County, A. R. Swan
son, President of the Ladera Com

munity Association pointed out the
reasons the plans "are of very great
concern to Ladera residents."
Objections Cited
The four reasons given in the letter
were:
• The nature of this development—
a very intense use of the land in the
midst of low density residential com
munities.
• The size of the development—
larger than the present Stanford In
dustrial Park.
• Its isolation from other commer
cial and industrial activities.
• Limited access to this site and its
dependence on automobile transpor
tation.
The letter explained that these con
cerns were very real ones because
the 900 acre development which would
employ 15,000 people is "adjacent to
our community."

"Problems can be foreseen," the
letter went on, "in a development of
this size and character on this par
ticular site. These Stanford lands are
totally dependent now on Alpine and
Sand Hill Roads for access, and even
when the new Junipero Serra freeway
is finished traffic still will have to
use either Alpine Road or Sand Hill
Road to reach the freeway inter
changes.
The letter also pointed out that the
area is not suited for additional access
routes to the area, pointing out ob
stacles such as the Linear Acceler
ator, the Jasper Ridge biology pre
serve, San Francisquito Creek, and
the Golf Course.
The Community Association felt
that the County should fully evaluate
"the impact and future consequences
. . . which would cause major changes
in the whole south County".

In the letter however, Mr. Swanson
admits that, "the Ladera Community
Assoeiation has "not yet had an oppor
tunity to study Stanford's plans, and
undoubtedly will have further and
specific reactions to them."
The letter did, however, register
opposition to any "developments on
Stanford lands which would:
• "Compound our present traffic
problems.
• "Interfere with the successful
completion of an Alpine parkway
which is planned to include paths for
pedestrians, cyclists, and horses.
• "Change the basic character of
the area."
University spokesmen said that the
park was still in the very early plan
ning and that any description of the
park as to size, traffic, or number of
employees is "premature' on the part
of any local body.
