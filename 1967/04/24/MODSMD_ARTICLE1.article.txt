# Trustees Vote 100 Senior Women Right To Live OFF Next Autumn
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
One hundred senior women may
live off campus next fall.
President Wallace Sterling an
nounced today that the Board of Trus
tees had "in principle" granted to
senior women the option to live off
campus, although it had stipulated
that only approximately 100 should be
allowed to do so for the 1967-68 aca
demic year.
According to Dean of Students Joel
Smith, the 100-limit was a result of
"computations as to how many the
University could accomodate." He said

the 100 would be chosen at random
from the women who apply.
He explained that such considera
tions as enrollment, transfer ratio,
and financial factors were among the
criteria used in determining this num
ber. He did, however, emphasize that
financial considerations were not a
major factor in the computation.
Smith said that he did not know
whether this number will change in
the future, but that plans will be made
on the basis of this experience." The
President of the University, in con
currence with the Trustees, will in

any given year decide how many
women may exercise this option.
Better Claim
Off campus living will be limited to
seniors, Smith explained, because the
number was already limited (by the
100 figure) and "they have lived in
dormitories for three years and have
a better claim on the value of a new
living situation." He also said they
were more mature.
David Harris, former student body
president and a leader in the OFF
movement said of the decision: "It's
like allowing 100 Negroes to vote."
He said the Trustees have "ignored
the basic principle of OFF and the
rent strike for it is not the Trustees'
God-given right to make arbitrary de
cisions infringing on the personal
rights of the students."
He called it a "bureaucratic, mech
anistic way of evading the issue" and
said that he feared that because it
was limited to 100 the University
would make it "100 of the best of
you."
Sterling also reported that informal
discussions with Walter Haas, trustee
of the Lucie Stern estate, indicate that
gift restrictions will not stand in the
way of using Stern Hall for an ex
perimental coeducational program
that may be developed next year.
Stern was built with funds from the
estate.

Therefore, Smith explained, Wilbur
Experiment plans may be extended
to Stern Hall without creating legal
complications.
He said that while plans are "still
tentative," the proposal presently un
der discussion is for two Wilbur and
two Stern houses to be used as "co
educational and integrated houses
with an academic theme."
Leadership Drain
The use of Stern Hall for an experi
mental residence plan was in question
recently. The Stern men felt that if
their residences were not included in
the plans it would mean a leadership
drain.
The Residences Subcommittee of
the Study of Education therefore
asked President Sterling to confer
with Haas concerning the possibility
of allowing Stern to be coeducational.
The decision to allow off campus
living for women came in light of the
fall campaign for the option to do so.
Unless selected under the new pol
icy, the only other undergraduate
women permitted to live off campus
must be given permission by the Dean
of Students on the basis of marriage,
living with own family, or "compel
ling personal reasons which justify
a special arrangement."
Currently, there are over 400 senior
women. A majority of them are over
21 years of age.
One hundred senior women may
live off campus next fall.

the 100 would be chosen at random
from the women who apply.
He explained that such considera
tions as enrollment, transfer ratio,
and financial factors were among the
criteria used in determining this num
ber. He did, however, emphasize that
financial considerations were not a
major factor in the computation.
Smith said that he did not know
whether this number will change in
the future, but that plans will be made
on the basis of this experience." The
President of the University, in con
currence with the Trustees, will in

any given year decide how many
women may exercise this option.
Better Claim
Off campus living will be limited to
seniors, Smith explained, because the
number was already limited (by the
100 figure) and "they have lived in
dormitories for three years and have
a better claim on the value of a new
living situation." He also said they
were more mature.
David Harris, former student body
president and a leader in the OFF
movement said of the decision: "It's
like allowing 100 Negroes to vote."
He said the Trustees have "ignored
the basic principle of OFF and the
rent strike for it is not the Trustees'
God-given right to make arbitrary de
cisions infringing on the personal
rights of the students."
He called it a "bureaucratic, mech
anistic way of evading the issue" and
said that he feared that because it
was limited to 100 the University
would make it "100 of the best of
you."
Sterling also reported that informal
discussions with Walter Haas, trustee
of the Lucie Stern estate, indicate that
gift restrictions will not stand in the
way of using Stern Hall for an ex
perimental coeducational program
that may be developed next year.
Stern was built with funds from the
estate.

Therefore, Smith explained, Wilbur
Experiment plans may be extended
to Stern Hall without creating legal
complications.
He said that while plans are "still
tentative," the proposal presently un
der discussion is for two Wilbur and
two Stern houses to be used as "co
educational and integrated houses
with an academic theme."
Leadership Drain
The use of Stern Hall for an experi
mental residence plan was in question
recently. The Stern men felt that if
their residences were not included in
the plans it would mean a leadership
drain.
The Residences Subcommittee of
the Study of Education therefore
asked President Sterling to confer
with Haas concerning the possibility
of allowing Stern to be coeducational.
The decision to allow off campus
living for women came in light of the
fall campaign for the option to do so.
Unless selected under the new pol
icy, the only other undergraduate
women permitted to live off campus
must be given permission by the Dean
of Students on the basis of marriage,
living with own family, or "compel
ling personal reasons which justify
a special arrangement."
Currently, there are over 400 senior
women. A majority of them are over
21 years of age.
One hundred senior women may
live off campus next fall.
President Wallace Sterling an
nounced today that the Board of Trus
tees had "in principle" granted to
senior women the option to live off
campus, although it had stipulated
that only approximately 100 should be
allowed to do so for the 1967-68 aca
demic year.
According to Dean of Students Joel
Smith, the 100-limit was a result of
"computations as to how many the
University could accomodate." He said

the 100 would be chosen at random
from the women who apply.
