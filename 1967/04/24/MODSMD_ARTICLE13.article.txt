# Lack Of Consistency, Not Of Talent, Ruins Netters In 9-0 Loss To USC
## 
### NICK SELBY 
USC defeated Stanford's ten
nis team here Saturday 9-0, but
you can forget about the score.
It is in no way indicative of the
talent the Tribe netters dis
played.
In the match of the after
noon, Stanford's number three
player, senior Craig Baise, push
ed the Trojans' Joaquin Loyo-
Mayo to three sets before los
ing 6-4, 4-6, 3-6.
The small Mexican ace al
most lost to Baise's backhand
and brilliant net strategy when
he fell behind 4-3 in the second
set. But he broke Baise's serve
also and rallied for the win.
In the doubles competition,
Baise teamed with Brian Leek
in a terrific show of teamwork
before losing 4-6, 5-7 to USC's
Loyo-Mayo and Jim Hobson.
In another doubles match,
Chuck Alloo and Jamie Carroll
fell 3-6, 3-6 to the Trojans Stan â– 
Smith and Jim Davidson. Sev- '

eral shots down the alley by
Carroll caught Smith, the num
ber 11 player in the nation, ab
solutely flatfooted.
Smith defeated Stanford's
number one, Brian Leek, 6-0, 6-1
in an awesome display of power
and controlled placements. His
performance was viewed by
some as trying to make up for
his loss UCLA's lan Crooken
don the week before.
It wasn't lack of talent, but
lack of consistency that hurt
the Cards. Dean Scholbaum's
backhand returns rattled Bob
Lutz in the first set, but he lost
momemtum and fell 5-7, 0-6.
Alloo lost in the same fashion
to Hobson 3-6, 6-2, 3-6.
Dale Wong fell to John Tidall
of USC 4-6, 7-9, and John Mc-
Cabe lost to Dave Ranney 6-2,
3-6, 3-6. Schlobaum and Cornell
lost to Ranney and Tidall in
third doubles 2-6, 3-6.
