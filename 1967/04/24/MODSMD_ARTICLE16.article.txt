# McCullouch Paces Troy To 104-41 Win Over Tribe
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
The skies cleared long enough
for the track meet Saturday,
but the SC Trojans brought
their own deluge to the Bay
Area as they thundered past
Stanford 104-41 in a duel meet
at Foothill College.
Leading the barrage was Earl
McCullouch, a stocky speedster
who had a hand in the breaking
of three meet records.
McCullouch started off the ac
tion with a leap of 25' 2 V in
the long to beat Bud Walsh for
the first time this season. His
winning time of 13.8 in the high
hurdles also set a new standard
and he ran the first leg of the
440 relay, which toured the one
lap in a record breaking 40.0
He also won the 220 in a fast
21.4.
Sears Surprises In 220
As expected, Troy took all
three places in the 100, but Stan

ford's Andy Sears pulled a sur
prise in the 220 and defeated O.
J. Simpson to take second place.
Sears was only .2 of a second
behind McCullouch with 21.6.
O. J. had 21.8.
Little Alan Sanford, who spent
the first two quarters this year
at Stanford in Italy, turned in
his best lifetime performance in
the mile, taking second place
with 4:10.2. Dennis Carr won
the event wor SC in 4:05.8.
Dave Harrington came back
from a week's lay-off to take
third in the shot put with a
throw of 51' BV2".
Eshelman Out Again
Another Indian, Jim Eshel
man, who was supposed to com
plete one of the best pole vault
fields ever, developed a sore
back and had to withdraw. Bob
Seagren went on to win the
event with 16' 6%".
Jim Ward was able to come
back from his pulled hamstring

of two weeks ago and gather
one of Stanford's three first
places.
He won the 440, overtaking
USC's Dave Buck in the last
70 yards to cross the finish line
in 47.8.
Arnold Wins T. J.
Triple-jumper lan Arnold also
returned to take first place. His
second jump of 48' 194" was
enough to earn first, so he re
tired after that to rest his bruis
ed heel.
The only other first place for
the Cards came in the high
jump, where Peter Boyce again
leaped 6' 10". Boyce missed
three subsequent tries at 7' 0".
Huskies Next
Next week Stanford takes on
the highly improved Washing
ton Huskies in Seattle, and the
following week is the Big Meet
against Cal in the stadium.
