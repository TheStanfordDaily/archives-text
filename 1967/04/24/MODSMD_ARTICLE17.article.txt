## Pass-Fail Not A Panacea, Says TA 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The gross oversimplifications
contained in your editorial urg
ing the further extension of the
pass-fail system at Stanford
prompts this response from a
Graduate Assistant who current
ly works within the present
grading system.
The first false assumption
contained within your editorial
is the inference that everyone
registering for the pass-fail op
tion in a given course will auto
matically pass the course be
cause he need not fear obtaining
a low final grade. The truth of
the matter is that the pass-fail
system narrows the options
available to the grader. The
variation of assigning a grade
from five possible choices, "A"
through "F" is limited to a
choice of "either - or". Under the
pass-fail system how can one
penalize an answer which indi
cates that the writer has either
not read the examination ques
tion fully or failed to follow di
rections? To pass the respond
ent would be grossly unfair to
other members of the class who
did follow directions. To fail
someone for not following direc
tions or misreading a question
exaggerates the penalty which
one normally applies in such
cases, but what alternatives re
main under the pass-fail sys
tem? In certain instances it is
quite possible that the pass-fail
grading increases rather than

retards the degree of arbitrari
ness already inherent in a sys
tem where a B plus counts as
much as a B minus when the
GPA is computed.
Your second false assumption
is that pass-fail grading is
somehow a cure all for poor or
indifferent teaching. Nor, is
pass-fail grading a solvent for
student reluctance to participate
in class discussions when such
occur.
Thirdly, it is dubious that the
present grading system places
as high a premium upon the re
gurgitation of "computerized
knowledge" as your editorial in
fers. What one seeks in grading
an examination is comprehen
sion, analytical thought and rel
evance. While pass-fail grading
would not affect these criteria,
it does provide a shield for the
"bull artist" while depriving the
really conscientious student of
his reward for a job well done
on an examination or term
paper.
Admittedly, pass-fail grading
does permit the non-specialist to
dabble in areas of knowledge
outside his immediate field of
concentration. Or, it can shield
the student from undue anxi
eties concerning the fulfillment
of his general studies require
ments. But to view pass-fail
grading as the panacea which
would solve all of the minor
academic problems raised by the

critics of education at Stanford
is overly optimistic.

• Add-A-Brick
Editor, The Daily:
While agreeing with Professor
Smith that the appearance of
Stanford leaves much to be de
sired, on the whole, after seven
years of acclimation, I find it
a most pleasant place to walk
around in. Perhaps I am an an
achronism but I like its very
non-assertiveness, its quiet hu
mility, its mild homage to a
varied past. But in one respect
there could be, quite easily I
think, a cast improvement: the
übiquitous, badly laid, patchy
and ugly-in-itself asphalt (the
same kind Reagan suggested we
pave all of Vietnam with). By
contrast, the brick terrace of
Mem Aud, on the Little Theater
side, shows what is possible. So
I propose an annual Stanford
Add-A-Brick campaign to fight
the creeping asphalt blight;
maybe it could be tied in with
the Faculty Popularity Contest,
voting with bricks instead of
pennies.

• Funstan
Editor, The Daily:
I can withstand my nausea no
longer, and I must puke my in
dignation over the Fundamental
Standard, for a standard it is
not. Rather, it is a statement
whose boundaries and proscrib
ed behaviour are so vague and
•v - biguous that those persons
whose actions are governed by
the Fundamental Standard are
not clearly warned of what may
or may not be legally done un
til after they have acted, at
which time they are then sub
ject to disciplinary measures,
including expulsion from the
University. The Standard reads:
Students are expected to show,
both within and \yithout the
University, such respect for
order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
It would be belabouring the
obvious to do any more than
to point out the wide differences
of opinion which can and do oc
cur over the meaning of words
such as respect, order, morality,
personal honor, rights of others,
and good citizens. However, the
Standard is additionally oppres
sive in that it is internally in
consistent since, for example,
what is orderly is not necessari
ly moral, and the rights of
others may be incompatible
with personal honor. Is march
ing on SRI to protest the War
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, or for that matter voting
for Ronald Reagan? Decisions
in such cases probably turn on
personal taste, yet it is this very
subjective nature of the Stand
ard which makes it abhorrent.
The Standard makes a mock
ery of justice by legitimizing

whim and willfulness under
cover of "law".
I thus submit that the Funda
mental Standard be abolished.

• Experiment For All
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman I have not
experienced the growth of edu
cation at Stanford, but within
the scope of my limited atten
dance at the university I think
the Experiment is the greatest
advance I have witnessed in this
field. With respect to Ira Sand
perl's plea to drop out of in
stitutions such as Stanford
where one can learn nothing, it
is my belief that he must have
been either a hermit or very-off
campus resident while he at
tended this university. He failed
to realize, as do many others,
that the greatest education pos
sibilities of a university stem
from the student body and not
the administration or faculty.
This is especially true of the
Stanford community where the
student body commands a vast
reservoir of potential. It is in
the conversion of this potential
into an actuality that has made
the Experiment a success.
But I now have qualms as to
the purpose of the Experiment
at present and for the future. If
the Experiment is to survive
as an educational institution it
must subordinate its political ac
tivities to its educational goals.
I concede that education in
cludes political awareness and
experience, but at what price?
The price the Experiment is
paying is its initial goal of edu
cation through student inter
change of ideas. In its present
course it is alienating a large
segment of the student popula
tion because it does not attack
politics as a rational discourse,
but rather as an emotional co
ercive drive. I interpret their
coercive efforts as demanding
that each individual choose
either their viewpoint, as put
forth in "Resistance," or be
branded a dupe for the admini
stration. How can the Experi
ment hope to expand education
ally without the support of those
students who now can only
think in terms of the Experi
ment's political activities instead
of its educational ones?
Although the present faults
of the Experiment are a direct
result of its current member
ship, I feel that those who are
most ardently opposed to its op
erations, must also bear some
of the responsibility for its im
age. The Experiment was, and
to my knowledge, still is a stu
dent organization open to the
entire student body, but as is
prevalent in politics today only
the New Left has taken advant
age of its varied educational
opportunities. I would like to
suggest to those individuals or
groups who have planned for
the destruction of the Experi
ment to shed their passive atti
tudes and join this educational
institution in whatever manner
they feel best promotes a ra
tional discussion of ideas. What
Young Republican has submit

ted a letter for publication in
Resistance and has been denied?

• Whose Victory?
Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to read in yester
day's Daily that the student pro
ponents of "Victory In Vietnam"
have finally begun to stand up
to be counted. At least now the
battle is pitched, the debaters
convoked. Now those concerned
protestors who call for self-de
termination for all the Vietna
mese know that their active op
position speaks of a conclusion
for the War alien to any mea
sure of self-determination. Stu
dent President for the recently
formed National Student Com
mittee for Victory in Vietnam
stressed a "uniting principle to
end the War on a positive vic
tory for the United States." So,
after all, this is our War, our
victory or defeat. The gains and
losses will be ours. The South-
Vietnamese people have nothing
to lose. Self - determination?
They've already lost it.

contained in your editorial urg
ing the further extension of the
pass-fail system at Stanford
prompts this response from a
Graduate Assistant who current
ly works within the present
grading system.
The first false assumption
contained within your editorial
is the inference that everyone
registering for the pass-fail op
tion in a given course will auto
matically pass the course be
cause he need not fear obtaining
a low final grade. The truth of
the matter is that the pass-fail
system narrows the options
available to the grader. The
variation of assigning a grade
from five possible choices, "A"
through "F" is limited to a
choice of "either - or". Under the
pass-fail system how can one
penalize an answer which indi
cates that the writer has either
not read the examination ques
tion fully or failed to follow di
rections? To pass the respond
ent would be grossly unfair to
other members of the class who
did follow directions. To fail
someone for not following direc
tions or misreading a question
exaggerates the penalty which
one normally applies in such
cases, but what alternatives re
main under the pass-fail sys
tem? In certain instances it is
quite possible that the pass-fail
grading increases rather than

retards the degree of arbitrari
ness already inherent in a sys
tem where a B plus counts as
much as a B minus when the
GPA is computed.
Your second false assumption
is that pass-fail grading is
somehow a cure all for poor or
indifferent teaching. Nor, is
pass-fail grading a solvent for
student reluctance to participate
in class discussions when such
occur.
Thirdly, it is dubious that the
present grading system places
as high a premium upon the re
gurgitation of "computerized
knowledge" as your editorial in
fers. What one seeks in grading
an examination is comprehen
sion, analytical thought and rel
evance. While pass-fail grading
would not affect these criteria,
it does provide a shield for the
"bull artist" while depriving the
really conscientious student of
his reward for a job well done
on an examination or term
paper.
Admittedly, pass-fail grading
does permit the non-specialist to
dabble in areas of knowledge
outside his immediate field of
concentration. Or, it can shield
the student from undue anxi
eties concerning the fulfillment
of his general studies require
ments. But to view pass-fail
grading as the panacea which
would solve all of the minor
academic problems raised by the

critics of education at Stanford
is overly optimistic.

• Add-A-Brick
Editor, The Daily:
While agreeing with Professor
Smith that the appearance of
Stanford leaves much to be de
sired, on the whole, after seven
years of acclimation, I find it
a most pleasant place to walk
around in. Perhaps I am an an
achronism but I like its very
non-assertiveness, its quiet hu
mility, its mild homage to a
varied past. But in one respect
there could be, quite easily I
think, a cast improvement: the
übiquitous, badly laid, patchy
and ugly-in-itself asphalt (the
same kind Reagan suggested we
pave all of Vietnam with). By
contrast, the brick terrace of
Mem Aud, on the Little Theater
side, shows what is possible. So
I propose an annual Stanford
Add-A-Brick campaign to fight
the creeping asphalt blight;
maybe it could be tied in with
the Faculty Popularity Contest,
voting with bricks instead of
pennies.

• Funstan
Editor, The Daily:
I can withstand my nausea no
longer, and I must puke my in
dignation over the Fundamental
Standard, for a standard it is
not. Rather, it is a statement
whose boundaries and proscrib
ed behaviour are so vague and
•v - biguous that those persons
whose actions are governed by
the Fundamental Standard are
not clearly warned of what may
or may not be legally done un
til after they have acted, at
which time they are then sub
ject to disciplinary measures,
including expulsion from the
University. The Standard reads:
Students are expected to show,
both within and \yithout the
University, such respect for
order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
It would be belabouring the
obvious to do any more than
to point out the wide differences
of opinion which can and do oc
cur over the meaning of words
such as respect, order, morality,
personal honor, rights of others,
and good citizens. However, the
Standard is additionally oppres
sive in that it is internally in
consistent since, for example,
what is orderly is not necessari
ly moral, and the rights of
others may be incompatible
with personal honor. Is march
ing on SRI to protest the War
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, or for that matter voting
for Ronald Reagan? Decisions
in such cases probably turn on
personal taste, yet it is this very
subjective nature of the Stand
ard which makes it abhorrent.
The Standard makes a mock
ery of justice by legitimizing

whim and willfulness under
cover of "law".
I thus submit that the Funda
mental Standard be abolished.

• Experiment For All
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman I have not
experienced the growth of edu
cation at Stanford, but within
the scope of my limited atten
dance at the university I think
the Experiment is the greatest
advance I have witnessed in this
field. With respect to Ira Sand
perl's plea to drop out of in
stitutions such as Stanford
where one can learn nothing, it
is my belief that he must have
been either a hermit or very-off
campus resident while he at
tended this university. He failed
to realize, as do many others,
that the greatest education pos
sibilities of a university stem
from the student body and not
the administration or faculty.
This is especially true of the
Stanford community where the
student body commands a vast
reservoir of potential. It is in
the conversion of this potential
into an actuality that has made
the Experiment a success.
But I now have qualms as to
the purpose of the Experiment
at present and for the future. If
the Experiment is to survive
as an educational institution it
must subordinate its political ac
tivities to its educational goals.
I concede that education in
cludes political awareness and
experience, but at what price?
The price the Experiment is
paying is its initial goal of edu
cation through student inter
change of ideas. In its present
course it is alienating a large
segment of the student popula
tion because it does not attack
politics as a rational discourse,
but rather as an emotional co
ercive drive. I interpret their
coercive efforts as demanding
that each individual choose
either their viewpoint, as put
forth in "Resistance," or be
branded a dupe for the admini
stration. How can the Experi
ment hope to expand education
ally without the support of those
students who now can only
think in terms of the Experi
ment's political activities instead
of its educational ones?
Although the present faults
of the Experiment are a direct
result of its current member
ship, I feel that those who are
most ardently opposed to its op
erations, must also bear some
of the responsibility for its im
age. The Experiment was, and
to my knowledge, still is a stu
dent organization open to the
entire student body, but as is
prevalent in politics today only
the New Left has taken advant
age of its varied educational
opportunities. I would like to
suggest to those individuals or
groups who have planned for
the destruction of the Experi
ment to shed their passive atti
tudes and join this educational
institution in whatever manner
they feel best promotes a ra
tional discussion of ideas. What
Young Republican has submit

ted a letter for publication in

• Whose Victory?
Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to read in yester
day's Daily that the student pro
ponents of "Victory In Vietnam"
have finally begun to stand up
to be counted. At least now the
battle is pitched, the debaters
convoked. Now those concerned
protestors who call for self-de
termination for all the Vietna
mese know that their active op
position speaks of a conclusion
for the War alien to any mea
sure of self-determination. Stu
dent President for the recently
formed National Student Com
mittee for Victory in Vietnam
stressed a "uniting principle to
end the War on a positive vic
tory for the United States." So,
after all, this is our War, our
victory or defeat. The gains and

to lose. Self - determination?

prompts this response from a
Graduate Assistant who current
ly works within the present
grading system.
The first false assumption
contained within your editorial
is the inference that everyone
registering for the pass-fail op
tion in a given course will auto
matically pass the course be
cause he need not fear obtaining
a low final grade. The truth of
the matter is that the pass-fail
system narrows the options
available to the grader. The
variation of assigning a grade
from five possible choices, "A"
through "F" is limited to a
choice of "either - or". Under the
pass-fail system how can one
penalize an answer which indi
cates that the writer has either
not read the examination ques
tion fully or failed to follow di
rections? To pass the respond
ent would be grossly unfair to
other members of the class who
did follow directions. To fail
someone for not following direc
tions or misreading a question
exaggerates the penalty which
one normally applies in such
cases, but what alternatives re
main under the pass-fail sys
tem? In certain instances it is
quite possible that the pass-fail
grading increases rather than

retards the degree of arbitrari
ness already inherent in a sys
tem where a B plus counts as
much as a B minus when the
GPA is computed.
Your second false assumption
is that pass-fail grading is
somehow a cure all for poor or
indifferent teaching. Nor, is
pass-fail grading a solvent for
student reluctance to participate
in class discussions when such
occur.
Thirdly, it is dubious that the
present grading system places
as high a premium upon the re
gurgitation of "computerized
knowledge" as your editorial in
fers. What one seeks in grading
an examination is comprehen
sion, analytical thought and rel
evance. While pass-fail grading
would not affect these criteria,
it does provide a shield for the
"bull artist" while depriving the
really conscientious student of
his reward for a job well done
on an examination or term
paper.
Admittedly, pass-fail grading
does permit the non-specialist to
dabble in areas of knowledge
outside his immediate field of
concentration. Or, it can shield
the student from undue anxi
eties concerning the fulfillment
of his general studies require
ments. But to view pass-fail
grading as the panacea which
would solve all of the minor
academic problems raised by the

critics of education at Stanford
is overly optimistic.

• Add-A-Brick
Editor, The Daily:
While agreeing with Professor
Smith that the appearance of
Stanford leaves much to be de
sired, on the whole, after seven
years of acclimation, I find it
a most pleasant place to walk
around in. Perhaps I am an an
achronism but I like its very
non-assertiveness, its quiet hu
mility, its mild homage to a
varied past. But in one respect
there could be, quite easily I
think, a cast improvement: the
übiquitous, badly laid, patchy
and ugly-in-itself asphalt (the
same kind Reagan suggested we
pave all of Vietnam with). By
contrast, the brick terrace of
Mem Aud, on the Little Theater
side, shows what is possible. So
I propose an annual Stanford
Add-A-Brick campaign to fight
the creeping asphalt blight;
maybe it could be tied in with
the Faculty Popularity Contest,
voting with bricks instead of
pennies.

• Funstan
Editor, The Daily:
I can withstand my nausea no
longer, and I must puke my in
dignation over the Fundamental
Standard, for a standard it is
not. Rather, it is a statement
whose boundaries and proscrib
ed behaviour are so vague and
•v - biguous that those persons
whose actions are governed by
the Fundamental Standard are
not clearly warned of what may
or may not be legally done un
til after they have acted, at
which time they are then sub
ject to disciplinary measures,
including expulsion from the
University. The Standard reads:
Students are expected to show,
both within and \yithout the
University, such respect for
order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
It would be belabouring the
obvious to do any more than
to point out the wide differences
of opinion which can and do oc
cur over the meaning of words
such as respect, order, morality,
personal honor, rights of others,
and good citizens. However, the
Standard is additionally oppres
sive in that it is internally in
consistent since, for example,
what is orderly is not necessari
ly moral, and the rights of
others may be incompatible
with personal honor. Is march
ing on SRI to protest the War
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, or for that matter voting
for Ronald Reagan? Decisions
in such cases probably turn on
personal taste, yet it is this very
subjective nature of the Stand
ard which makes it abhorrent.
The Standard makes a mock
ery of justice by legitimizing

whim and willfulness under
cover of "law".
I thus submit that the Funda
mental Standard be abolished.

• Experiment For All
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman I have not
experienced the growth of edu
cation at Stanford, but within
the scope of my limited atten
dance at the university I think
the Experiment is the greatest
advance I have witnessed in this
field. With respect to Ira Sand
perl's plea to drop out of in
stitutions such as Stanford
where one can learn nothing, it
is my belief that he must have
been either a hermit or very-off
campus resident while he at
tended this university. He failed
to realize, as do many others,
that the greatest education pos
sibilities of a university stem
from the student body and not
the administration or faculty.
This is especially true of the
Stanford community where the
student body commands a vast
reservoir of potential. It is in
the conversion of this potential
into an actuality that has made
the Experiment a success.
But I now have qualms as to
the purpose of the Experiment
at present and for the future. If
the Experiment is to survive
as an educational institution it
must subordinate its political ac
tivities to its educational goals.
I concede that education in
cludes political awareness and
experience, but at what price?
The price the Experiment is
paying is its initial goal of edu
cation through student inter
change of ideas. In its present
course it is alienating a large
segment of the student popula
tion because it does not attack
politics as a rational discourse,
but rather as an emotional co
ercive drive. I interpret their
coercive efforts as demanding
that each individual choose
either their viewpoint, as put
forth in "Resistance," or be
branded a dupe for the admini
stration. How can the Experi
ment hope to expand education
ally without the support of those
students who now can only
think in terms of the Experi
ment's political activities instead
of its educational ones?
Although the present faults
of the Experiment are a direct
result of its current member
ship, I feel that those who are
most ardently opposed to its op
erations, must also bear some
of the responsibility for its im
age. The Experiment was, and
to my knowledge, still is a stu
dent organization open to the
entire student body, but as is
prevalent in politics today only
the New Left has taken advant
age of its varied educational
opportunities. I would like to
suggest to those individuals or
groups who have planned for
the destruction of the Experi
ment to shed their passive atti
tudes and join this educational
institution in whatever manner
they feel best promotes a ra
tional discussion of ideas. What
Young Republican has submit

• Whose Victory?
Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to read in yester
day's Daily that the student pro
ponents of "Victory In Vietnam"
have finally begun to stand up
to be counted. At least now the
battle is pitched, the debaters
convoked. Now those concerned
protestors who call for self-de
termination for all the Vietna
mese know that their active op
position speaks of a conclusion
for the War alien to any mea
sure of self-determination. Stu
dent President for the recently
formed National Student Com
mittee for Victory in Vietnam
stressed a "uniting principle to
end the War on a positive vic
tory for the United States." So,
after all, this is our War, our
victory or defeat. The gains and

to lose. Self - determination?

The first false assumption
contained within your editorial
is the inference that everyone
registering for the pass-fail op
tion in a given course will auto
matically pass the course be
cause he need not fear obtaining
a low final grade. The truth of
the matter is that the pass-fail
system narrows the options
available to the grader. The
variation of assigning a grade
from five possible choices, "A"
through "F" is limited to a
choice of "either - or". Under the
pass-fail system how can one
penalize an answer which indi
cates that the writer has either
not read the examination ques
tion fully or failed to follow di
rections? To pass the respond
ent would be grossly unfair to
other members of the class who
did follow directions. To fail
someone for not following direc
tions or misreading a question
exaggerates the penalty which
one normally applies in such
cases, but what alternatives re
main under the pass-fail sys
tem? In certain instances it is
quite possible that the pass-fail
grading increases rather than

retards the degree of arbitrari
ness already inherent in a sys
tem where a B plus counts as
much as a B minus when the
GPA is computed.
Your second false assumption
is that pass-fail grading is
somehow a cure all for poor or
indifferent teaching. Nor, is
pass-fail grading a solvent for
student reluctance to participate
in class discussions when such
occur.
Thirdly, it is dubious that the
present grading system places
as high a premium upon the re
gurgitation of "computerized
knowledge" as your editorial in
fers. What one seeks in grading
an examination is comprehen
sion, analytical thought and rel
evance. While pass-fail grading
would not affect these criteria,
it does provide a shield for the
"bull artist" while depriving the
really conscientious student of
his reward for a job well done
on an examination or term
paper.
Admittedly, pass-fail grading
does permit the non-specialist to
dabble in areas of knowledge
outside his immediate field of
concentration. Or, it can shield
the student from undue anxi
eties concerning the fulfillment
of his general studies require
ments. But to view pass-fail
grading as the panacea which
would solve all of the minor
academic problems raised by the

critics of education at Stanford
is overly optimistic.

• Add-A-Brick
Editor, The Daily:
While agreeing with Professor
Smith that the appearance of
Stanford leaves much to be de
sired, on the whole, after seven
years of acclimation, I find it
a most pleasant place to walk
around in. Perhaps I am an an
achronism but I like its very
non-assertiveness, its quiet hu
mility, its mild homage to a
varied past. But in one respect
there could be, quite easily I
think, a cast improvement: the
übiquitous, badly laid, patchy
and ugly-in-itself asphalt (the
same kind Reagan suggested we
pave all of Vietnam with). By
contrast, the brick terrace of
Mem Aud, on the Little Theater
side, shows what is possible. So
I propose an annual Stanford
Add-A-Brick campaign to fight
the creeping asphalt blight;
maybe it could be tied in with
the Faculty Popularity Contest,
voting with bricks instead of
pennies.

• Funstan
Editor, The Daily:
I can withstand my nausea no
longer, and I must puke my in
dignation over the Fundamental
Standard, for a standard it is
not. Rather, it is a statement
whose boundaries and proscrib
ed behaviour are so vague and
•v - biguous that those persons
whose actions are governed by
the Fundamental Standard are
not clearly warned of what may
or may not be legally done un
til after they have acted, at
which time they are then sub
ject to disciplinary measures,
including expulsion from the
University. The Standard reads:
Students are expected to show,
both within and \yithout the
University, such respect for
order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
It would be belabouring the
obvious to do any more than
to point out the wide differences
of opinion which can and do oc
cur over the meaning of words
such as respect, order, morality,
personal honor, rights of others,
and good citizens. However, the
Standard is additionally oppres
sive in that it is internally in
consistent since, for example,
what is orderly is not necessari
ly moral, and the rights of
others may be incompatible
with personal honor. Is march
ing on SRI to protest the War
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, or for that matter voting
for Ronald Reagan? Decisions
in such cases probably turn on
personal taste, yet it is this very
subjective nature of the Stand
ard which makes it abhorrent.
The Standard makes a mock
ery of justice by legitimizing

whim and willfulness under
cover of "law".
I thus submit that the Funda
mental Standard be abolished.

• Experiment For All
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman I have not
experienced the growth of edu
cation at Stanford, but within
the scope of my limited atten
dance at the university I think
the Experiment is the greatest
advance I have witnessed in this
field. With respect to Ira Sand
perl's plea to drop out of in
stitutions such as Stanford
where one can learn nothing, it
is my belief that he must have
been either a hermit or very-off
campus resident while he at
tended this university. He failed
to realize, as do many others,
that the greatest education pos
sibilities of a university stem
from the student body and not
the administration or faculty.
This is especially true of the
Stanford community where the
student body commands a vast
reservoir of potential. It is in
the conversion of this potential
into an actuality that has made
the Experiment a success.
But I now have qualms as to
the purpose of the Experiment
at present and for the future. If
the Experiment is to survive
as an educational institution it
must subordinate its political ac
tivities to its educational goals.
I concede that education in
cludes political awareness and
experience, but at what price?
The price the Experiment is
paying is its initial goal of edu
cation through student inter
change of ideas. In its present
course it is alienating a large
segment of the student popula
tion because it does not attack
politics as a rational discourse,
but rather as an emotional co
ercive drive. I interpret their
coercive efforts as demanding
that each individual choose
either their viewpoint, as put
forth in "Resistance," or be
branded a dupe for the admini
stration. How can the Experi
ment hope to expand education
ally without the support of those
students who now can only
think in terms of the Experi
ment's political activities instead
of its educational ones?
Although the present faults
of the Experiment are a direct
result of its current member
ship, I feel that those who are
most ardently opposed to its op
erations, must also bear some
of the responsibility for its im
age. The Experiment was, and
to my knowledge, still is a stu
dent organization open to the
entire student body, but as is
prevalent in politics today only
the New Left has taken advant
age of its varied educational
opportunities. I would like to
suggest to those individuals or
groups who have planned for
the destruction of the Experi
ment to shed their passive atti
tudes and join this educational
institution in whatever manner
they feel best promotes a ra
tional discussion of ideas. What
Young Republican has submit

• Whose Victory?
Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to read in yester
day's Daily that the student pro
ponents of "Victory In Vietnam"
have finally begun to stand up
to be counted. At least now the
battle is pitched, the debaters
convoked. Now those concerned
protestors who call for self-de
termination for all the Vietna
mese know that their active op
position speaks of a conclusion
for the War alien to any mea
sure of self-determination. Stu
dent President for the recently
formed National Student Com
mittee for Victory in Vietnam
stressed a "uniting principle to
end the War on a positive vic
tory for the United States." So,
after all, this is our War, our
victory or defeat. The gains and

Vietnamese people have nothing
to lose. Self - determination?

tion in a given course will auto
matically pass the course be
cause he need not fear obtaining
a low final grade. The truth of
the matter is that the pass-fail
system narrows the options
available to the grader. The
variation of assigning a grade
from five possible choices, "A"
through "F" is limited to a
choice of "either - or". Under the
pass-fail system how can one
penalize an answer which indi
cates that the writer has either
not read the examination ques
tion fully or failed to follow di
rections? To pass the respond
ent would be grossly unfair to
other members of the class who
did follow directions. To fail
someone for not following direc
tions or misreading a question
exaggerates the penalty which
one normally applies in such
cases, but what alternatives re
main under the pass-fail sys
tem? In certain instances it is
quite possible that the pass-fail
grading increases rather than

retards the degree of arbitrari
ness already inherent in a sys
tem where a B plus counts as
much as a B minus when the
GPA is computed.
Your second false assumption
is that pass-fail grading is
somehow a cure all for poor or
indifferent teaching. Nor, is
pass-fail grading a solvent for
student reluctance to participate
in class discussions when such
occur.
Thirdly, it is dubious that the
present grading system places
as high a premium upon the re
gurgitation of "computerized
knowledge" as your editorial in
fers. What one seeks in grading
an examination is comprehen
sion, analytical thought and rel
evance. While pass-fail grading
would not affect these criteria,
it does provide a shield for the
"bull artist" while depriving the
really conscientious student of
his reward for a job well done
on an examination or term
paper.
Admittedly, pass-fail grading
does permit the non-specialist to
dabble in areas of knowledge
outside his immediate field of
concentration. Or, it can shield
the student from undue anxi
eties concerning the fulfillment
of his general studies require
ments. But to view pass-fail
grading as the panacea which
would solve all of the minor
academic problems raised by the

critics of education at Stanford
is overly optimistic.

• Add-A-Brick
Editor, The Daily:
While agreeing with Professor
Smith that the appearance of
Stanford leaves much to be de
sired, on the whole, after seven
years of acclimation, I find it
a most pleasant place to walk
around in. Perhaps I am an an
achronism but I like its very
non-assertiveness, its quiet hu
mility, its mild homage to a
varied past. But in one respect
there could be, quite easily I
think, a cast improvement: the
übiquitous, badly laid, patchy
and ugly-in-itself asphalt (the
same kind Reagan suggested we
pave all of Vietnam with). By
contrast, the brick terrace of
Mem Aud, on the Little Theater
side, shows what is possible. So
I propose an annual Stanford
Add-A-Brick campaign to fight
the creeping asphalt blight;
maybe it could be tied in with
the Faculty Popularity Contest,
voting with bricks instead of
pennies.

• Funstan
Editor, The Daily:
I can withstand my nausea no
longer, and I must puke my in
dignation over the Fundamental
Standard, for a standard it is
not. Rather, it is a statement
whose boundaries and proscrib
ed behaviour are so vague and
•v - biguous that those persons
whose actions are governed by
the Fundamental Standard are
not clearly warned of what may
or may not be legally done un
til after they have acted, at
which time they are then sub
ject to disciplinary measures,
including expulsion from the
University. The Standard reads:
Students are expected to show,
both within and \yithout the
University, such respect for
order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
It would be belabouring the
obvious to do any more than
to point out the wide differences
of opinion which can and do oc
cur over the meaning of words
such as respect, order, morality,
personal honor, rights of others,
and good citizens. However, the
Standard is additionally oppres
sive in that it is internally in
consistent since, for example,
what is orderly is not necessari
ly moral, and the rights of
others may be incompatible
with personal honor. Is march
ing on SRI to protest the War
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, or for that matter voting
for Ronald Reagan? Decisions
in such cases probably turn on
personal taste, yet it is this very
subjective nature of the Stand
ard which makes it abhorrent.
The Standard makes a mock
ery of justice by legitimizing

whim and willfulness under
cover of "law".
I thus submit that the Funda

• Experiment For All
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman I have not
experienced the growth of edu
cation at Stanford, but within
the scope of my limited atten
dance at the university I think
the Experiment is the greatest
advance I have witnessed in this
field. With respect to Ira Sand
perl's plea to drop out of in
stitutions such as Stanford
where one can learn nothing, it
is my belief that he must have
been either a hermit or very-off
campus resident while he at
tended this university. He failed
to realize, as do many others,
that the greatest education pos
sibilities of a university stem
from the student body and not
the administration or faculty.
This is especially true of the
Stanford community where the
student body commands a vast
reservoir of potential. It is in
the conversion of this potential
into an actuality that has made
the Experiment a success.
But I now have qualms as to
the purpose of the Experiment
at present and for the future. If
the Experiment is to survive
as an educational institution it
must subordinate its political ac
tivities to its educational goals.
I concede that education in
cludes political awareness and
experience, but at what price?
The price the Experiment is
paying is its initial goal of edu
cation through student inter
change of ideas. In its present
course it is alienating a large
segment of the student popula
tion because it does not attack
politics as a rational discourse,
but rather as an emotional co
ercive drive. I interpret their
coercive efforts as demanding
that each individual choose
either their viewpoint, as put
forth in "Resistance," or be
branded a dupe for the admini
stration. How can the Experi
ment hope to expand education
ally without the support of those
students who now can only
think in terms of the Experi
ment's political activities instead
of its educational ones?
Although the present faults
of the Experiment are a direct
result of its current member
ship, I feel that those who are
most ardently opposed to its op
erations, must also bear some
of the responsibility for its im
age. The Experiment was, and
to my knowledge, still is a stu
dent organization open to the
entire student body, but as is
prevalent in politics today only
the New Left has taken advant
age of its varied educational
opportunities. I would like to
suggest to those individuals or
groups who have planned for
the destruction of the Experi
ment to shed their passive atti
tudes and join this educational
institution in whatever manner
they feel best promotes a ra
tional discussion of ideas. What

• Whose Victory?
Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to read in yester
day's Daily that the student pro
ponents of "Victory In Vietnam"
have finally begun to stand up
to be counted. At least now the
battle is pitched, the debaters
convoked. Now those concerned
protestors who call for self-de
termination for all the Vietna
mese know that their active op
position speaks of a conclusion
for the War alien to any mea
sure of self-determination. Stu
dent President for the recently
formed National Student Com
mittee for Victory in Vietnam
stressed a "uniting principle to
end the War on a positive vic
tory for the United States." So,
after all, this is our War, our
victory or defeat. The gains and
losses will be ours. The South-
Vietnamese people have nothing
to lose. Self - determination?
