# Two New Candidates Join ASSU Contest
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Jon Reider and Fritz Schaefer have
added their names to the list of can
didates for ASSU President. Their
running mates are Joel Kugelmass
and Gene Cubbison, respectively.
Neither Reider nor Kugelmass will
be at Stanford next year, but they are
running on the statement "You can't
lose what you don't have". They be
lieve student government at Stanford
\s "essentially a joke, a fraud" and the
absence from campus of the President
and Vice President will have no effect
on the "bureaucracy of student gov
ernment."
Schaefer and Cubbison feel their
campaign will appeal to students who
are dissatisfied with the New Left
minority's leadership. "We consider
ourselves the only moderate candi
lates," Schaefer told The Daily.
Both Reider and Kugelmass are
graduating seniors. Reider will be in
England next year studying sociology
on a Marshall Scholarship; Kugel
mass will be doing graduate work
in English at Brandeis. Their cam
paign flyer says "We are running for
f his office because we feel we can
most effectively serve Stanford stu
dents from London and Boston."
End Of Illusion
"We hope to make people realize
that the office does not require the
doing of anything," Reider com
-Tnented. Kugelmass added, "The be
ginning of all improvement is the end
of illusion. . . . The beginning of mean
ingful social change is the develop
ment of awareness of reality."
The reality, as these two see it, is
that "the office of President and Vice
-"resident is bureaucratic and purely
administrative and there is no reason
why (Dean of Students) Joel Smith
couldn't appoint someone to be stu
dent body president just as he ap
points the Student Financial Man
ager."
Some specific complaints Reider
" nd Kugelmass have made are "The
administration only cooperates with
the students when the students have
some influence" and Stanford "is run
by the business office . . . decisions are
made entirely on a financial basis."
i'hey would prefer to "take decisions
which clearly have educational sig
; ificance out of the hands of the ad
ministration and place them into the
hands of faculty and students."
Antl-'New Left'
Schaefer and Cubbison believe
"Stanford students have been taken
for a ride by the New Left." Schaefer
-ommented, "I think student govern
ment is illegitimate unless it repre
sents students, and it doesn't right
now." In their statement, they say,
"It is a fact that nearly all facets

of student life at Stanford are rigidly
controlled by a constituency of at
most 500 of Stanford's 11,000 stu
dents."
Cubbison explains that they "are
trying to relieve apathy' 'and give a
voice to the 10,500 who do not sup
port "the Establishment—the in
crowd—the New Left." Schaefer em
phasized, "We think the students—all
the students—should be heard."
Schaefer, who is a Daily columnist
and LASSU member, works as a
tutor at Ravenswood High School.
Cubbison is one of the leaders of the
Black Arm Band Movement.
Fraud In Government
Reider and Kugelmass feel the other
candidates are perpetuating the fraud
of student government. "The people
who think that the office isn't a fraud
are frauds themselves," according to
Kugelmass.
Reider describes the attitude of the
other candidates as "very paternal
istic. They say 'We will do these
things for you.' We say, 'We won't do
these things for you. You must do
them for yourselves'."
Flyers appearing around campus in
support of Schaefer and Cubbison
read, "Stamp Out the Berkeley
Image." The two criticize such actions
as "the crudest forms of behavior in
an attempt to intimidate Vice Presi
dent Hubert Humphrey" which lead
to a situation in which "Stanford
can't invite anyone to the right of
Ramparts to speak here without warn
ing him that he may be heckled,
jeered and slandered."
In regard to other candidates,
Schaefer and Cubbison say, "We do
not feel that a neat little list of five
word cliches pilfered from The Daily
constitutes a meaningful candidacy."

-Tnented. Kugelmass added, "The be
ginning of all improvement is the end
of illusion. . . . The beginning of mean
ingful social change is the develop
ment of awareness of reality."
The reality, as these two see it, is
that "the office of President and Vice
-"resident is bureaucratic and purely
administrative and there is no reason
why (Dean of Students) Joel Smith
couldn't appoint someone to be stu
dent body president just as he ap
points the Student Financial Man
ager."
Some specific complaints Reider
" nd Kugelmass have made are "The
administration only cooperates with
the students when the students have
some influence" and Stanford "is run
by the business office . . . decisions are
made entirely on a financial basis."
i'hey would prefer to "take decisions
which clearly have educational sig
; ificance out of the hands of the ad
ministration and place them into the
hands of faculty and students."
Antl-'New Left'
Schaefer and Cubbison believe
"Stanford students have been taken
for a ride by the New Left." Schaefer
-ommented, "I think student govern
ment is illegitimate unless it repre
sents students, and it doesn't right
now." In their statement, they say,
"It is a fact that nearly all facets

of student life at Stanford are rigidly
controlled by a constituency of at
most 500 of Stanford's 11,000 stu
dents."
Cubbison explains that they "are
trying to relieve apathy' 'and give a
voice to the 10,500 who do not sup
port "the Establishment—the in
crowd—the New Left." Schaefer em
phasized, "We think the students—all
the students—should be heard."
Schaefer, who is a Daily columnist
and LASSU member, works as a
tutor at Ravenswood High School.
Cubbison is one of the leaders of the
Black Arm Band Movement.
Fraud In Government
Reider and Kugelmass feel the other
candidates are perpetuating the fraud
of student government. "The people
who think that the office isn't a fraud
are frauds themselves," according to
Kugelmass.
Reider describes the attitude of the
other candidates as "very paternal
istic. They say 'We will do these
things for you.' We say, 'We won't do
these things for you. You must do
them for yourselves'."
Flyers appearing around campus in
support of Schaefer and Cubbison
read, "Stamp Out the Berkeley
Image." The two criticize such actions
as "the crudest forms of behavior in
an attempt to intimidate Vice Presi
dent Hubert Humphrey" which lead
to a situation in which "Stanford
can't invite anyone to the right of
Ramparts to speak here without warn
ing him that he may be heckled,
jeered and slandered."
In regard to other candidates,
Schaefer and Cubbison say, "We do
not feel that a neat little list of five
word cliches pilfered from The Daily
constitutes a meaningful candidacy."

Neither Reider nor Kugelmass will

of student life at Stanford are rigidly
controlled by a constituency of at
most 500 of Stanford's 11,000 stu
dents."
Cubbison explains that they "are
trying to relieve apathy' 'and give a
voice to the 10,500 who do not sup
port "the Establishment—the in
crowd—the New Left." Schaefer em
phasized, "We think the students—all
the students—should be heard."
Schaefer, who is a Daily columnist
and LASSU member, works as a
tutor at Ravenswood High School.
Cubbison is one of the leaders of the
Black Arm Band Movement.
Fraud In Government
Reider and Kugelmass feel the other
candidates are perpetuating the fraud
of student government. "The people
who think that the office isn't a fraud
are frauds themselves," according to
Kugelmass.
Reider describes the attitude of the
other candidates as "very paternal
istic. They say 'We will do these
things for you.' We say, 'We won't do
these things for you. You must do
them for yourselves'."
Flyers appearing around campus in
support of Schaefer and Cubbison
read, "Stamp Out the Berkeley
Image." The two criticize such actions
as "the crudest forms of behavior in
an attempt to intimidate Vice Presi
dent Hubert Humphrey" which lead
to a situation in which "Stanford
can't invite anyone to the right of
Ramparts to speak here without warn
ing him that he may be heckled,
jeered and slandered."
In regard to other candidates,
Schaefer and Cubbison say, "We do
not feel that a neat little list of five
word cliches pilfered from The Daily
constitutes a meaningful candidacy."

Bill Berry, Elections Commissioner,
announced that petitions for the
spring ASSU elections are due today
at 4:30 p.m. in the ASSU office. The
following offices will be included In
the May 3 election: ASSU president
and vice-president, senior class presi
dent and vice-president, AWS presi
dent and vice-president, two represen
tatives for the NSA congress, and
WRA president, vice-president, and
secretary
Applications are available for these
positions: Two assistant student fi
nancial managers, student police
chief, Sunday flicks manager, ASSU
travel service manager, and four life
guards, including head lifeguard. Stu
dents may pick up applications from
the ASSU secretary. They must be
returned to her by 4:30 p.m. April 28.
Interviews will be held the following
week.
Jon Reider and Fritz Schaefer have
added their names to the list of can
didates for ASSU President. Their
running mates are Joel Kugelmass
and Gene Cubbison, respectively.
Neither Reider nor Kugelmass will
be at Stanford next year, but they are
running on the statement "You can't
lose what you don't have". They be
lieve student government at Stanford
\s "essentially a joke, a fraud" and the
absence from campus of the President
and Vice President will have no effect
on the "bureaucracy of student gov
ernment."
Schaefer and Cubbison feel their
campaign will appeal to students who
are dissatisfied with the New Left
minority's leadership. "We consider
ourselves the only moderate candi
lates," Schaefer told The Daily.
Both Reider and Kugelmass are
graduating seniors. Reider will be in
England next year studying sociology
on a Marshall Scholarship; Kugel
mass will be doing graduate work
in English at Brandeis. Their cam
paign flyer says "We are running for
f his office because we feel we can
most effectively serve Stanford stu
dents from London and Boston."
End Of Illusion
"We hope to make people realize
that the office does not require the
doing of anything," Reider com
-Tnented. Kugelmass added, "The be
ginning of all improvement is the end
of illusion. . . . The beginning of mean
ingful social change is the develop
ment of awareness of reality."
The reality, as these two see it, is
that "the office of President and Vice
-"resident is bureaucratic and purely
administrative and there is no reason
why (Dean of Students) Joel Smith
couldn't appoint someone to be stu
dent body president just as he ap
points the Student Financial Man
ager."
Some specific complaints Reider
" nd Kugelmass have made are "The
administration only cooperates with
the students when the students have
some influence" and Stanford "is run
by the business office . . . decisions are
made entirely on a financial basis."
i'hey would prefer to "take decisions
which clearly have educational sig
; ificance out of the hands of the ad
ministration and place them into the
hands of faculty and students."
Antl-'New Left'
Schaefer and Cubbison believe
"Stanford students have been taken
for a ride by the New Left." Schaefer
-ommented, "I think student govern
ment is illegitimate unless it repre
sents students, and it doesn't right
now." In their statement, they say,
"It is a fact that nearly all facets

of student life at Stanford are rigidly
controlled by a constituency of at
most 500 of Stanford's 11,000 stu
dents."
