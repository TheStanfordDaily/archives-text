# Boycott Planned
## Medical School Grant Protested 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Nearly lOC East Palo Alto residents
demonstrated at the Medical School
Friday in protest of a $59,273 grant
for the 1967 Upward Bound program.
Carrying signs reading "Stop Buy
ing Negroes" and"The NAACP Says
Stanford is Prejudiced," the demon
strators surprised a meeting of fac
ulty members who will teach in the
program.
The group, led by East Palo Alto
ternagers, presented a list of nine
"supplements", which they insist
must be included in the new Upward

Bound program or it will be boy
cotted.
The controversy appeared to center
around the last three of the supple
ments which call for a continuation of
the "sneak-out program", for all Up
ward Bound staff members to donate
part of their salaries to Upward
Bound, and for half of the Board of
Directors to be residents of East Palo
Alto or East Menlo Park.
Dr. Le√üoy Pesch, associate dean of
the Medical School and the man who
is handling the negotiations between
Stanford and the federal government,

said that he will try to meet as many
of the demands as he can, but some
of them may conflict with Upward
Bound regulations.
Sneak-out ProgTam
Continuation of the sneak-out pro
gram, which allows students from the
nearly all-black Ravenswood High
School to attend Palo Alto or Menlo-
Atherton High School by living with
a foster family, will be "difficult to
meet", Pesch said.
An Upward Bound program was
sponsored by Stanford last summer
and another was scheduled for this

summer until the 1966 Upward Bound
staff voted winter quarter to discon
tinue the program. The vote came
after the Federal Government failed
to grant a higher appropriation to
allow more students to participate in
Upward Bound.
One of the leaders of the group,
Mrs. Syrtiller Rabat, warned Pesch
and other Medical School faculty that
if they go ahead with the program
without meeting the group's demands,
"you will see us every day this sum
mer."
According to Dr. Bernadene V.
Allen, a psychologist at Stanford's
Counseling and Testing Center and
one of the demonstrators, East Palo
Alto could mount a 100 percent boy
cott of the program, due to increasing
pressure from Ravenswood High
School students, local ministers, and
other groups.
The South San Mateo County
NAACP will also support the boycott.
In a press release, NAACP president
Rev. Thomas C. Sanders stated "We
are tired of being used as guinea pigs
and we do not want our children used
to help the rich get richer.
"Get 0ut..."
"We are bitterly opposed to Stan
ford's involvement in our commun
ity," Rev. Sanders continued. "Once
Stanford was helping us, now it seems
to be a hinderance. We say 'Get out
of our community.' "
Dr. Pesch claims that "continued
opposition to Upward Bound will ren
der it relatively ineffective."
The Medical School prefers to work
with East Palo Alto rather than some
other part of San Mateo County, ac
cording to Pesch. The Medical School
has maintained a program for the
past three years, supported by the
National Science Foundation, which
has allowed Ravenswood High School
students to work in the Medical
School's laboratories during the sum
mer.
