# Potential Frosh Tour Campus
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
After being at the mercy of the
Stanford Admissions Office for six
months, 236 high school seniors final
ly got the upper hand Saturday. They
attended High School Day here, look
ing, questioning, and possibly decid
ing whether to accept an offered
place in the Class of 1971.
The day began at 8:30 a.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium when the students
met for registration. Over 350 had
been expected by Ron Nahas and
Dena Kaye, co-chairmen of the pro
gram, but the number was cut, prob
ably due to the threat of rain.
The students came from every part
of the state, many flying in for the
day. After picking up name tags and
a packet of information, they entered
Cubberley to see "The True Source
of Knowledge", a film about Stanford
made by an Australian graduate stu
dent several years ago.
The enthusiasm of the group was
immediately obvious as they reacted
to jokes and statements made by stu
dents in the movie. The high schoolers
were alert to any insight they might
pick up about Stanford.
The Dean of Chapel, B. Davie
Napier, was next on the program.
When he finished, it was clear from
the applause that 99 percent of the
students were coming to Stanford, if
only to take a course on Religion
from Napier.
Napier and Love
The theme of Napier's talk was the
need for more love in today's "crazy,
stupid world." He appealed to the
gathering to embody greater love and
spread it to others. At one point, giv
ing examples of love, he broke into
a chorus from the Turtles song
"Happy Together."
Following Napier, was an audio
visual presentation on the Overseas
Campus program. Two students de
scribed some of their experiences
abroad while showing slides picturing
all the campuses.
At about 11:00 a.m. there was a
coffee and punch break. Students
were buzzing about Napier and the
overseas program. One was heard
commenting, "But how do you decide
whether to stay here and listen to
Napier or go abroad?" A friend re
plied, "Wait until Napier goes a
broad."
The morning program ended with
performances of the Mendicants, an
all-male vocal group, and a group
from Ram's Head, the latter doing a
cut version of "The Thurber Carni
val."
Out to Lunch
All the boys went to either a fra
ternity or an eating club for lunch.
Ron Nahas explained that other resi
dences, such as Wilbur, hadn't been
used because of cost. As a result, the

great majority of male guides were
from a fraternity or eating club.
All the girls were taken to either
Lagunita or a row house for lunch.
After lunch, it was up to the tour
leader and his group to decide the
next step. A primary requirement for
touring men was to see Wilbur and
for the girls to see Roble and Bran
ner. As it turned out, the boys were
more keen to see Roble and Branner
than the girls.
The climax of the day, for at least
one group of boys, was the stop at
Roble. They were duly impressed by
the lounge and what passed through
it, but were absolutely ecstatic when
a tour of the upper floors was ar
ranged.
On their way up, they were briefed
about women's regulations and sev
eral could be seen scribbling hastily
on a piece of paper facts such as,
"25 one o'clocks first quarter, 6 six
o'clocks. ..."
After viewing several Wilbur and
Stern rooms, the boys were amazed
by the tidiness of Roble habitats.
They managed to hear a few names
and they immediately struck up con
versations with non-believing girls
who happened to pass by.
About this time the tours began to

break up as students headed off to
meet cars, friends and parents. Some,
obviously glad to be rid of their tour
leader, walked off to explore by
themselves and meet what they as
sumed must be less enthusiastic and
more objective Stanford students.
Some had been stimulated by leaf
lets distributed earlier that claimed
to offer a picture of "The True Stan
ford". Joe Reich and Jeff Kane, can
didates for ASSU President and Vice-
President, wrote and handed out
these sheets entitled, "So You Want
to Come to Stanford, or The Other
Side of The Story."
In these sheets, they covered resi
dences, the ratio, overseas campuses,
Negroes at Stanford, the power of the
administration, and pre-registration
week. They were careful to point
out what they considered to be the
shortcomings in these areas. For ex
ample, they advised passing up pre
reg week because it is "a series of
lectures and social gatherings and
won't be particularly spectacular or
enlightening."
But the basic decision was out of
their or anyone else's hands. The stu
dents had come, looked, and departed
to judge in silence. They have until
May Ist to decide.

At about 11:00 a.m. there was a
coffee and punch break. Students
were buzzing about Napier and the
overseas program. One was heard
commenting, "But how do you decide
whether to stay here and listen to
Napier or go abroad?" A friend re
plied, "Wait until Napier goes a
broad."
The morning program ended with
performances of the Mendicants, an
all-male vocal group, and a group
from Ram's Head, the latter doing a
cut version of "The Thurber Carni
val."
Out to Lunch
All the boys went to either a fra
ternity or an eating club for lunch.
Ron Nahas explained that other resi
dences, such as Wilbur, hadn't been
used because of cost. As a result, the

great majority of male guides were
from a fraternity or eating club.
All the girls were taken to either
Lagunita or a row house for lunch.
After lunch, it was up to the tour
leader and his group to decide the
next step. A primary requirement for
touring men was to see Wilbur and
for the girls to see Roble and Bran
ner. As it turned out, the boys were
more keen to see Roble and Branner
than the girls.
The climax of the day, for at least
one group of boys, was the stop at
Roble. They were duly impressed by
the lounge and what passed through
it, but were absolutely ecstatic when
a tour of the upper floors was ar
ranged.
On their way up, they were briefed
about women's regulations and sev
eral could be seen scribbling hastily
on a piece of paper facts such as,
"25 one o'clocks first quarter, 6 six
o'clocks. ..."
After viewing several Wilbur and
Stern rooms, the boys were amazed
by the tidiness of Roble habitats.
They managed to hear a few names
and they immediately struck up con
versations with non-believing girls
who happened to pass by.
About this time the tours began to

break up as students headed off to
meet cars, friends and parents. Some,
obviously glad to be rid of their tour
leader, walked off to explore by
themselves and meet what they as
sumed must be less enthusiastic and
more objective Stanford students.
Some had been stimulated by leaf
lets distributed earlier that claimed
to offer a picture of "The True Stan
ford". Joe Reich and Jeff Kane, can
didates for ASSU President and Vice-
President, wrote and handed out
these sheets entitled, "So You Want
to Come to Stanford, or The Other
Side of The Story."
In these sheets, they covered resi
dences, the ratio, overseas campuses,
Negroes at Stanford, the power of the
administration, and pre-registration
week. They were careful to point
out what they considered to be the
shortcomings in these areas. For ex
ample, they advised passing up pre
reg week because it is "a series of
lectures and social gatherings and
won't be particularly spectacular or
enlightening."
But the basic decision was out of
their or anyone else's hands. The stu
dents had come, looked, and departed
to judge in silence. They have until
May Ist to decide.
After being at the mercy of the
Stanford Admissions Office for six
months, 236 high school seniors final
ly got the upper hand Saturday. They
attended High School Day here, look
ing, questioning, and possibly decid
ing whether to accept an offered
place in the Class of 1971.
The day began at 8:30 a.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium when the students
met for registration. Over 350 had
been expected by Ron Nahas and
Dena Kaye, co-chairmen of the pro
gram, but the number was cut, prob
ably due to the threat of rain.
The students came from every part
of the state, many flying in for the
day. After picking up name tags and
a packet of information, they entered
Cubberley to see "The True Source
of Knowledge", a film about Stanford
made by an Australian graduate stu
dent several years ago.
The enthusiasm of the group was
immediately obvious as they reacted
to jokes and statements made by stu
dents in the movie. The high schoolers
were alert to any insight they might
pick up about Stanford.
The Dean of Chapel, B. Davie
Napier, was next on the program.
When he finished, it was clear from
the applause that 99 percent of the
students were coming to Stanford, if
only to take a course on Religion
from Napier.
Napier and Love
The theme of Napier's talk was the
need for more love in today's "crazy,
stupid world." He appealed to the
gathering to embody greater love and
spread it to others. At one point, giv
ing examples of love, he broke into
a chorus from the Turtles song
"Happy Together."
Following Napier, was an audio
visual presentation on the Overseas
Campus program. Two students de
scribed some of their experiences
abroad while showing slides picturing
all the campuses.

and they immediately struck up con
versations with non-believing girls
who happened to pass by.
About this time the tours began to

break up as students headed off to
meet cars, friends and parents. Some,
obviously glad to be rid of their tour
leader, walked off to explore by
themselves and meet what they as
sumed must be less enthusiastic and
more objective Stanford students.
Some had been stimulated by leaf
lets distributed earlier that claimed
to offer a picture of "The True Stan
ford". Joe Reich and Jeff Kane, can
didates for ASSU President and Vice-
President, wrote and handed out
these sheets entitled, "So You Want
to Come to Stanford, or The Other
Side of The Story."
In these sheets, they covered resi
dences, the ratio, overseas campuses,
Negroes at Stanford, the power of the
administration, and pre-registration
week. They were careful to point
out what they considered to be the
shortcomings in these areas. For ex
ample, they advised passing up pre
reg week because it is "a series of
lectures and social gatherings and
won't be particularly spectacular or
enlightening."
But the basic decision was out of
their or anyone else's hands. The stu
dents had come, looked, and departed
to judge in silence. They have until
May Ist to decide.
After being at the mercy of the
Stanford Admissions Office for six
months, 236 high school seniors final
ly got the upper hand Saturday. They
attended High School Day here, look
ing, questioning, and possibly decid
ing whether to accept an offered
place in the Class of 1971.
The day began at 8:30 a.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium when the students
met for registration. Over 350 had
been expected by Ron Nahas and
Dena Kaye, co-chairmen of the pro
gram, but the number was cut, prob
ably due to the threat of rain.
The students came from every part
of the state, many flying in for the
day. After picking up name tags and
a packet of information, they entered
Cubberley to see "The True Source
of Knowledge", a film about Stanford
made by an Australian graduate stu
dent several years ago.
The enthusiasm of the group was
immediately obvious as they reacted
to jokes and statements made by stu
dents in the movie. The high schoolers
were alert to any insight they might
pick up about Stanford.
The Dean of Chapel, B. Davie
Napier, was next on the program.
When he finished, it was clear from
the applause that 99 percent of the
students were coming to Stanford, if
only to take a course on Religion
from Napier.
Napier and Love
The theme of Napier's talk was the
need for more love in today's "crazy,
stupid world." He appealed to the
gathering to embody greater love and
spread it to others. At one point, giv
ing examples of love, he broke into
a chorus from the Turtles song
"Happy Together."
Following Napier, was an audio
visual presentation on the Overseas
Campus program. Two students de
scribed some of their experiences
abroad while showing slides picturing
all the campuses.
At about 11:00 a.m. there was a
coffee and punch break. Students
were buzzing about Napier and the
overseas program. One was heard
commenting, "But how do you decide
whether to stay here and listen to
Napier or go abroad?" A friend re
plied, "Wait until Napier goes a
broad."
The morning program ended with
performances of the Mendicants, an
all-male vocal group, and a group
from Ram's Head, the latter doing a
cut version of "The Thurber Carni
val."
Out to Lunch
All the boys went to either a fra
ternity or an eating club for lunch.
Ron Nahas explained that other resi
dences, such as Wilbur, hadn't been
used because of cost. As a result, the

great majority of male guides were
from a fraternity or eating club.
All the girls were taken to either
Lagunita or a row house for lunch.
After lunch, it was up to the tour
leader and his group to decide the
next step. A primary requirement for
touring men was to see Wilbur and
for the girls to see Roble and Bran
ner. As it turned out, the boys were
more keen to see Roble and Branner
than the girls.
The climax of the day, for at least
one group of boys, was the stop at
Roble. They were duly impressed by
the lounge and what passed through
it, but were absolutely ecstatic when
a tour of the upper floors was ar
ranged.
On their way up, they were briefed
about women's regulations and sev
eral could be seen scribbling hastily
on a piece of paper facts such as,
"25 one o'clocks first quarter, 6 six
o'clocks. ..."
After viewing several Wilbur and
Stern rooms, the boys were amazed
by the tidiness of Roble habitats.

versations with non-believing girls
