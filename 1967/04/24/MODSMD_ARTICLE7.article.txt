## Dissent Essential To Democracy 
### 
This is the first of four articles
taken from the chapter titled, "The
Citizen and the University" from The
Arrogance of Power by Senator J.
William Fulbright.
" ... it is often easier to fight for
principles than to live up to
them."
—Adlai Stevenson
To criticize one's country is to do
it a service and pay it a compliment.
It is a service because it may spur
the country to do better than it is
doing; it is a compliment because
it evidences a belief that the country
can do better than it is doing.
In a democracy dissent is an act
of faith. Criticism may embarrass the
country's leaders in the short run
but strengthen their hand in the long
run; it may destroy a consensus on
policy while expressing a consensus
of values. Criticism, in short, is more
than a right; it is an act of patriotism,
a higher form of patriotism, I believe,
than the familiar rituals of national
adulation.
We are an extraordinary nation,
endowed with a rich and productive
land, a humane and decent political
tradition and a talented and energetic
population. Surely a nation so fa

vored is capable of extraordinary
achievement, not only in the area of
producing and enjoying great wealth,
in which area our achievements have
indeed been extraordinary, but also
in the area of human and interna
tional relations, in which area, it
seems to me, our achievements have
fallen short of our capacity and
promise.
My question is whether America
can close the gap between her capa
city and her performance. My hope
and my belief are that she can, that
she has the human resources to con
duct her affairs with a maturity
which few if any great nations have
ever achieved: to be confident but
also tolerant, to be rich but also gen
erous, to be willing to teach but also
willing to learn, to be powerful but
also wise.
I believe that America is capable of
all of these things; I also believe she
is falling short of them.
The discharge of the duty of dis
sent is handicapped in America by
an unworthy tendency to fear serious
criticism of our government. In the
abstract we celebrate freedom of
opinion as part of our patriotic lit
urgy; it is only when some Ameri
cans exercise it that other Americans

are shocked. No one of course ever
criticizes the right of dissent; it is
always this particular instance of it
or its exercise under these particular
circumstances or at this particular
time that throws people into a blue
funk.
Intolerance of dissent is a well
noted feature of the American na
tional character. Louis Hartz attri
butes it to the heritage of a society
which was "born free," a society
which is unnerved by serious criti
cism because it has experienced so
little of it. Alexis de Tocqueville took
note of this tendency over a hundred
years ago: "I know of no country in
which there is so little independence
of mind and real freedom of discus
sion as in America." Profound changes
have occurred since Democrat in
America first appeared and yet it may
be asked whether recognition of the
right of dissent has gained substan
tially in practice as well as in theory.
The malady in Tocqueville's view was
one of democracy itself: "... The
smallest reproach irritates its sensi
bility and the slightest joke that has
any foundation in truth renders it in
dignant: from the forms of its langu
age up to the solid virtues of its
character, everything must be
made the subject of encomium.
No writer, whatever be his emi
nence, can escape paying this
tribute of adulation to his fellow
citizens."
From small-town gatherings
to high-policy councils, Ameri
cans are distressed when a writ
er or a politician or even a pri
vate citizen interrupts all this
self• congratulation and ex
presses himself with simple, un
adorned candor. The problem is
worsening, among other reasons,
because more and more of our
citizens earn their livings by
working for corporations and
other large organizations, few
of which are known to encour
age political and other forms of
heterodoxy on the part of their
employees. The result is that
more and more Americans face
the dilemma of how, if at all,
an individual can safely exercise
honest individual judgment, in
deed, retain his capacity for it,
in an environment in which the
surest route to advancement is
conformity with a barren and
oppressive orthodoxy.
Acute in Bureaucracy
The problem is acute in the
federal bureaucracy, whose con
genital inhospitality to unortho
dox ideas, were its dimensions
only known, would allay the
anxieties of the most agitated
superpatriot. This is unfortu
nate indeed because the most
valuable public servant, like the
true patriot, is one who gives
a higher loyalty to his country's
ideals than to its current policy
and who therefore is willing to
criticize as well as to comply.
Some time ago I met an Amer
ican poet, Mr. Ned O'Gorman,
who had just returned from a
visit to Latin America spon
sored by the State Department.
He said, and previously had writ
ten, that he had been instructed
by American Embassy officials
in the countries he visited that
if he were questioned, by stu
dents and intellectuals with
whom he was scheduled to meet,
on such "difficult" questions a*

the Dominican Republic and
Vietnam, he was to reply that he
was "unprepared." As a meet
ing with some Brazilian stu
dents he finally rebelled, with
the following result as he de
scribed it: "... the questions
came, swirling, battering, bel
lowing from the classroom. Out
side the traffic and the oily elec
tric heat. But I loved it. I was
hell bent for clarity. I knew
they wanted straight answers
and I gave them. I had been
gorged to sickness with embassy
prudence. The applause was
long and loud. The embassy
man was furious. 'You are tak
ing money dishonestly,' he told
me. 'If the government pays
you to do this tour you must
defend it and not damn it.' It
did no good when I explained to
him that if I didn't do what I
was doing, then I'd be taking
the money dishonestly. ..."
It escapes me totally why
American diplomats should not
be proud to have American
poets and professors and politi
cians demonstrate their coun
try's political and intellectual
health by expressing them
selves with freedom and can
dor. As O'Gorman put it, "... I
spoke with equal force of the
glory and the tragedy of Amer
ica. And that is what terrified
the Americans."

federal bureaucracy, whose con
genital inhospitality to unortho
dox ideas, were its dimensions
only known, would allay the
anxieties of the most agitated
superpatriot. This is unfortu
nate indeed because the most
valuable public servant, like the
true patriot, is one who gives
a higher loyalty to his country's
ideals than to its current policy
and who therefore is willing to
criticize as well as to comply.
Some time ago I met an Amer
ican poet, Mr. Ned O'Gorman,
who had just returned from a
visit to Latin America spon
sored by the State Department.
He said, and previously had writ
ten, that he had been instructed
by American Embassy officials
in the countries he visited that
if he were questioned, by stu
dents and intellectuals with
whom he was scheduled to meet,
on such "difficult" questions a*

the Dominican Republic and
Vietnam, he was to reply that he
was "unprepared." As a meet
ing with some Brazilian stu
dents he finally rebelled, with
the following result as he de
scribed it: "... the questions
came, swirling, battering, bel
lowing from the classroom. Out
side the traffic and the oily elec
tric heat. But I loved it. I was
hell bent for clarity. I knew
they wanted straight answers
and I gave them. I had been
gorged to sickness with embassy
prudence. The applause was
long and loud. The embassy
man was furious. 'You are tak
ing money dishonestly,' he told
me. 'If the government pays
you to do this tour you must
defend it and not damn it.' It
did no good when I explained to
him that if I didn't do what I
was doing, then I'd be taking
the money dishonestly. ..."
It escapes me totally why
American diplomats should not
be proud to have American
poets and professors and politi
cians demonstrate their coun
try's political and intellectual
health by expressing them
selves with freedom and can
dor. As O'Gorman put it, "... I
spoke with equal force of the
glory and the tragedy of Amer
ica. And that is what terrified
the Americans."

To criticize one's country is to do
it a service and pay it a compliment.
It is a service because it may spur
the country to do better than it is
doing; it is a compliment because
it evidences a belief that the country
can do better than it is doing.
In a democracy dissent is an act
of faith. Criticism may embarrass the
country's leaders in the short run
but strengthen their hand in the long
run; it may destroy a consensus on
policy while expressing a consensus
of values. Criticism, in short, is more
than a right; it is an act of patriotism,
a higher form of patriotism, I believe,
than the familiar rituals of national
adulation.
We are an extraordinary nation,
endowed with a rich and productive
land, a humane and decent political
tradition and a talented and energetic
population. Surely a nation so fa

vored is capable of extraordinary
achievement, not only in the area of
producing and enjoying great wealth,
in which area our achievements have
indeed been extraordinary, but also
in the area of human and interna
tional relations, in which area, it
seems to me, our achievements have
fallen short of our capacity and
promise.
My question is whether America
can close the gap between her capa
city and her performance. My hope
and my belief are that she can, that
she has the human resources to con
duct her affairs with a maturity
which few if any great nations have
ever achieved: to be confident but
also tolerant, to be rich but also gen
erous, to be willing to teach but also
willing to learn, to be powerful but
also wise.
I believe that America is capable of
all of these things; I also believe she
is falling short of them.
The discharge of the duty of dis
sent is handicapped in America by
an unworthy tendency to fear serious
criticism of our government. In the
abstract we celebrate freedom of
opinion as part of our patriotic lit
urgy; it is only when some Ameri
cans exercise it that other Americans

are shocked. No one of course ever
criticizes the right of dissent; it is
always this particular instance of it
or its exercise under these particular
circumstances or at this particular
time that throws people into a blue
funk.
Intolerance of dissent is a well
noted feature of the American na
tional character. Louis Hartz attri
butes it to the heritage of a society
which was "born free," a society
which is unnerved by serious criti
cism because it has experienced so
little of it. Alexis de Tocqueville took
note of this tendency over a hundred
years ago: "I know of no country in
which there is so little independence
of mind and real freedom of discus
sion as in America." Profound changes
have occurred since Democrat in
America first appeared and yet it may
be asked whether recognition of the
right of dissent has gained substan
tially in practice as well as in theory.
The malady in Tocqueville's view was
one of democracy itself: "... The
smallest reproach irritates its sensi
bility and the slightest joke that has
any foundation in truth renders it in
dignant: from the forms of its langu
age up to the solid virtues of its
character, everything must be
made the subject of encomium.
No writer, whatever be his emi
nence, can escape paying this
tribute of adulation to his fellow
citizens."
From small-town gatherings
to high-policy councils, Ameri
cans are distressed when a writ
er or a politician or even a pri
vate citizen interrupts all this
self• congratulation and ex
presses himself with simple, un
adorned candor. The problem is
worsening, among other reasons,
because more and more of our
citizens earn their livings by
working for corporations and
other large organizations, few
of which are known to encour
age political and other forms of
heterodoxy on the part of their
employees. The result is that
more and more Americans face
the dilemma of how, if at all,
an individual can safely exercise
honest individual judgment, in
deed, retain his capacity for it,
in an environment in which the
surest route to advancement is
conformity with a barren and
oppressive orthodoxy.

criticism of our government. In the
abstract we celebrate freedom of
opinion as part of our patriotic lit
urgy; it is only when some Ameri
cans exercise it that other Americans

are shocked. No one of course ever
criticizes the right of dissent; it is
always this particular instance of it
or its exercise under these particular
circumstances or at this particular
time that throws people into a blue
funk.
Intolerance of dissent is a well
noted feature of the American na
tional character. Louis Hartz attri
butes it to the heritage of a society
which was "born free," a society
which is unnerved by serious criti
cism because it has experienced so
little of it. Alexis de Tocqueville took
note of this tendency over a hundred
years ago: "I know of no country in
which there is so little independence
of mind and real freedom of discus
sion as in America." Profound changes
have occurred since Democrat in
America first appeared and yet it may
be asked whether recognition of the
right of dissent has gained substan
tially in practice as well as in theory.
The malady in Tocqueville's view was
one of democracy itself: "... The
smallest reproach irritates its sensi
bility and the slightest joke that has
any foundation in truth renders it in
dignant: from the forms of its langu
age up to the solid virtues of its
character, everything must be
made the subject of encomium.
No writer, whatever be his emi
nence, can escape paying this
tribute of adulation to his fellow
citizens."
From small-town gatherings
to high-policy councils, Ameri
cans are distressed when a writ
er or a politician or even a pri
vate citizen interrupts all this
self• congratulation and ex
presses himself with simple, un
adorned candor. The problem is
worsening, among other reasons,
because more and more of our
citizens earn their livings by
working for corporations and
other large organizations, few
of which are known to encour
age political and other forms of
heterodoxy on the part of their
employees. The result is that
more and more Americans face
the dilemma of how, if at all,
an individual can safely exercise
honest individual judgment, in
deed, retain his capacity for it,
in an environment in which the
surest route to advancement is
conformity with a barren and
oppressive orthodoxy.
Acute in Bureaucracy
The problem is acute in the
federal bureaucracy, whose con
genital inhospitality to unortho
dox ideas, were its dimensions
only known, would allay the
anxieties of the most agitated
superpatriot. This is unfortu
nate indeed because the most
valuable public servant, like the
true patriot, is one who gives
a higher loyalty to his country's
ideals than to its current policy
and who therefore is willing to
criticize as well as to comply.
Some time ago I met an Amer
ican poet, Mr. Ned O'Gorman,
who had just returned from a
visit to Latin America spon
sored by the State Department.
He said, and previously had writ
ten, that he had been instructed
by American Embassy officials
in the countries he visited that
if he were questioned, by stu
dents and intellectuals with
whom he was scheduled to meet,
on such "difficult" questions a*

the Dominican Republic and
Vietnam, he was to reply that he
was "unprepared." As a meet
ing with some Brazilian stu
dents he finally rebelled, with
the following result as he de
scribed it: "... the questions
came, swirling, battering, bel
lowing from the classroom. Out
side the traffic and the oily elec
tric heat. But I loved it. I was
hell bent for clarity. I knew
they wanted straight answers
and I gave them. I had been
gorged to sickness with embassy
prudence. The applause was
long and loud. The embassy
man was furious. 'You are tak
ing money dishonestly,' he told
me. 'If the government pays
you to do this tour you must
defend it and not damn it.' It
did no good when I explained to
him that if I didn't do what I
was doing, then I'd be taking
the money dishonestly. ..."
It escapes me totally why
American diplomats should not
be proud to have American
poets and professors and politi
cians demonstrate their coun
try's political and intellectual
health by expressing them
selves with freedom and can
dor. As O'Gorman put it, "... I
spoke with equal force of the
glory and the tragedy of Amer
ica. And that is what terrified
the Americans."

To criticize one's country is to do
it a service and pay it a compliment.
It is a service because it may spur
the country to do better than it is
doing; it is a compliment because
it evidences a belief that the country
can do better than it is doing.
In a democracy dissent is an act
of faith. Criticism may embarrass the
country's leaders in the short run
but strengthen their hand in the long
run; it may destroy a consensus on
policy while expressing a consensus
of values. Criticism, in short, is more
than a right; it is an act of patriotism,
a higher form of patriotism, I believe,
than the familiar rituals of national
adulation.
We are an extraordinary nation,
endowed with a rich and productive
land, a humane and decent political
tradition and a talented and energetic
population. Surely a nation so fa

vored is capable of extraordinary
achievement, not only in the area of
producing and enjoying great wealth,
in which area our achievements have
indeed been extraordinary, but also
in the area of human and interna
tional relations, in which area, it
seems to me, our achievements have
fallen short of our capacity and
promise.
My question is whether America
can close the gap between her capa
city and her performance. My hope
and my belief are that she can, that
she has the human resources to con
duct her affairs with a maturity
which few if any great nations have
ever achieved: to be confident but
also tolerant, to be rich but also gen
erous, to be willing to teach but also
willing to learn, to be powerful but
also wise.
I believe that America is capable of
all of these things; I also believe she
is falling short of them.

" ... it is often easier to fight for
principles than to live up to
them."
—Adlai Stevenson
To criticize one's country is to do
it a service and pay it a compliment.
It is a service because it may spur
the country to do better than it is
doing; it is a compliment because
it evidences a belief that the country
can do better than it is doing.
In a democracy dissent is an act
of faith. Criticism may embarrass the
country's leaders in the short run
but strengthen their hand in the long
run; it may destroy a consensus on
policy while expressing a consensus
of values. Criticism, in short, is more
than a right; it is an act of patriotism,
a higher form of patriotism, I believe,
than the familiar rituals of national
adulation.
We are an extraordinary nation,
endowed with a rich and productive
land, a humane and decent political
tradition and a talented and energetic
population. Surely a nation so fa

vored is capable of extraordinary
achievement, not only in the area of
producing and enjoying great wealth,
in which area our achievements have
indeed been extraordinary, but also
in the area of human and interna
tional relations, in which area, it
seems to me, our achievements have
fallen short of our capacity and
promise.
My question is whether America
can close the gap between her capa
city and her performance. My hope
and my belief are that she can, that
she has the human resources to con
duct her affairs with a maturity
which few if any great nations have
ever achieved: to be confident but
also tolerant, to be rich but also gen
erous, to be willing to teach but also
willing to learn, to be powerful but
also wise.
I believe that America is capable of
all of these things; I also believe she
is falling short of them.
The discharge of the duty of dis
sent is handicapped in America by
an unworthy tendency to fear serious
criticism of our government. In the
abstract we celebrate freedom of
opinion as part of our patriotic lit
urgy; it is only when some Ameri
cans exercise it that other Americans

are shocked. No one of course ever
criticizes the right of dissent; it is
always this particular instance of it
or its exercise under these particular
circumstances or at this particular
time that throws people into a blue
funk.
Intolerance of dissent is a well
noted feature of the American na
tional character. Louis Hartz attri
butes it to the heritage of a society
which was "born free," a society
which is unnerved by serious criti
cism because it has experienced so
little of it. Alexis de Tocqueville took
note of this tendency over a hundred
years ago: "I know of no country in
which there is so little independence
of mind and real freedom of discus
sion as in America." Profound changes
have occurred since Democrat in
America first appeared and yet it may
be asked whether recognition of the
right of dissent has gained substan
tially in practice as well as in theory.
The malady in Tocqueville's view was
one of democracy itself: "... The
smallest reproach irritates its sensi
bility and the slightest joke that has
any foundation in truth renders it in
dignant: from the forms of its langu
age up to the solid virtues of its
character, everything must be
made the subject of encomium.
No writer, whatever be his emi
nence, can escape paying this
tribute of adulation to his fellow
citizens."
From small-town gatherings
to high-policy councils, Ameri
cans are distressed when a writ
er or a politician or even a pri
vate citizen interrupts all this
self• congratulation and ex
presses himself with simple, un
adorned candor. The problem is
worsening, among other reasons,
because more and more of our
citizens earn their livings by
working for corporations and
other large organizations, few
of which are known to encour
age political and other forms of
heterodoxy on the part of their
employees. The result is that
more and more Americans face
the dilemma of how, if at all,
an individual can safely exercise
honest individual judgment, in
deed, retain his capacity for it,
in an environment in which the
surest route to advancement is
conformity with a barren and
oppressive orthodoxy.
Acute in Bureaucracy
The problem is acute in the
federal bureaucracy, whose con
genital inhospitality to unortho
dox ideas, were its dimensions
only known, would allay the
anxieties of the most agitated
superpatriot. This is unfortu
nate indeed because the most
valuable public servant, like the
true patriot, is one who gives
a higher loyalty to his country's
ideals than to its current policy
and who therefore is willing to
criticize as well as to comply.
Some time ago I met an Amer
ican poet, Mr. Ned O'Gorman,
who had just returned from a
visit to Latin America spon
sored by the State Department.
He said, and previously had writ
ten, that he had been instructed
by American Embassy officials
in the countries he visited that
if he were questioned, by stu
dents and intellectuals with
whom he was scheduled to meet,
on such "difficult" questions a*

the Dominican Republic and
Vietnam, he was to reply that he
was "unprepared." As a meet
ing with some Brazilian stu
dents he finally rebelled, with
the following result as he de
scribed it: "... the questions
came, swirling, battering, bel
lowing from the classroom. Out
side the traffic and the oily elec
tric heat. But I loved it. I was
hell bent for clarity. I knew
they wanted straight answers
and I gave them. I had been
gorged to sickness with embassy
prudence. The applause was
long and loud. The embassy
man was furious. 'You are tak
ing money dishonestly,' he told
me. 'If the government pays
you to do this tour you must
defend it and not damn it.' It
did no good when I explained to
him that if I didn't do what I
was doing, then I'd be taking
the money dishonestly. ..."
It escapes me totally why
American diplomats should not
be proud to have American
poets and professors and politi
cians demonstrate their coun
try's political and intellectual
health by expressing them
selves with freedom and can
dor. As O'Gorman put it, "... I
spoke with equal force of the
glory and the tragedy of Amer
ica. And that is what terrified
the Americans."
