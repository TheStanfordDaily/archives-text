# Secrecy Problems Stymie Discussion

### PAT McMAHON 
(Last in a series dealing with
the current problems encoun
tered between Stanford and the
local communities concerning
the uses of Stanford lands.)
The ideal relationship be
tween Palo Alto and Stanford,
feels Mrs. Frances Dias, mayor
of Palo Alto, is an "aura or
climate where open communica
tion could be accomplished at
all times."
And in this spirit a commit
tee has been suggested to help
work out the problem areas be
tween Stanford and Palo Alto
which would consider long
range plans and try to present
each party in the committee
with the other's viewpoint.
This city - Stanford "liaison
committee' was the suggestion
of Palo Alto City Councilman
Edward Arnold in February
but the details are still a prob
lem for the University, which
would prefer secret meetings
while the city insists on public
or open ones.
Five Members Each
Arnold felt that the commit
tee should be a five-member
group with two policy-makers
and a staff-level representative
from both the city and the Uni
versity.
The committee plan, Arnold
insisted, is not designed because
of any existing problem, but
would, instead, try to forsee
where the master plan of Stan
ford University, and the city's
general plan were at odds, and
try to come to some agreement.
Welcomed By All
The liaison committee was
welcomed by everyone when
first proposed. The City Coun
cil was enthusiastic about the
idea, and Assistant to the Presi
dent Fred Glover said he
thought certainly "such an in
vitation would be accepted."
Dixon Arnett, Director of
Community Relations, who also
welcoming the idea, said at that
time, "A committee like this
would provide a full understand
ing of (each other's) point of
view, if not full agreement."
However, the question of sec
ret meetings developed later
when President Sterling notified
by letter Mrs. Dias that the
meetings were fine, but that

they should be "informal and
private."
Public or Private
In that letter, Sterling noted
that the trustees preferred Ar
nold's plan and "would assume
the meetings of this proposed
committee be informal and pri
vate . . . and it address itself
to problems presently before
the city and the University"
and that it not be permanent.
Mrs. Dias however replied
that the meetings must be open
and that it is "one of the penal
ties of dealing with a public
body" by a private organization.
Furthermore, she explained that
the open-closed meeting ques
tion has been "a constant prob
lem of long-standing we have
had with Stanford."
Arnett feels that the commit
tee, while basically sound, had
to be "a discussion group, not
an action group." He states firm
ly that, "the Trustees cannot
religate their authority to any
two or three people who would
represent them."
Entire Board Decisions
"The decisions must be made
by the entire board," he said,
"but the representatives might
discuss what is likely or what is
planned, and can make recom
mendations to the Board."
The future of the committee
is still in doubt and has not
yet met because of the question
of secret meetings. Mayor Fran
ces Dias told the City Council
last week:
"The President said it was
his interpretation that the com
mittee's purpose was one of
communicating, and not one of
solving any problems," Mrs.
Dias said, but added that Presi
dent Sterling had agreed to dis
cuss the problem with the
Board of Trustees again.

The committee, once establish

nence and decide that communi
cation between Stanford and
Palo Alto is a basic continuing
necessity and not just a one

ghborliness.

the current problems encoun
tered between Stanford and the
local communities concerning
the uses of Stanford lands.)
The ideal relationship be
tween Palo Alto and Stanford,
feels Mrs. Frances Dias, mayor
of Palo Alto, is an "aura or
climate where open communica
tion could be accomplished at
all times."
And in this spirit a commit
tee has been suggested to help
work out the problem areas be
tween Stanford and Palo Alto
which would consider long
range plans and try to present
each party in the committee
with the other's viewpoint.
This city - Stanford "liaison
committee' was the suggestion
of Palo Alto City Councilman
Edward Arnold in February
but the details are still a prob
lem for the University, which
would prefer secret meetings
while the city insists on public
or open ones.
Five Members Each
Arnold felt that the commit
tee should be a five-member
group with two policy-makers
and a staff-level representative
from both the city and the Uni
versity.
The committee plan, Arnold
insisted, is not designed because
of any existing problem, but
would, instead, try to forsee
where the master plan of Stan
ford University, and the city's
general plan were at odds, and
try to come to some agreement.
Welcomed By All
The liaison committee was
welcomed by everyone when
first proposed. The City Coun
cil was enthusiastic about the
idea, and Assistant to the Presi
dent Fred Glover said he
thought certainly "such an in
vitation would be accepted."
Dixon Arnett, Director of
Community Relations, who also
welcoming the idea, said at that
time, "A committee like this
would provide a full understand
ing of (each other's) point of
view, if not full agreement."
However, the question of sec
ret meetings developed later
when President Sterling notified
by letter Mrs. Dias that the
meetings were fine, but that

they should be "informal and
private."
Public or Private
In that letter, Sterling noted
that the trustees preferred Ar
nold's plan and "would assume
the meetings of this proposed
committee be informal and pri
vate . . . and it address itself
to problems presently before
the city and the University"
and that it not be permanent.
Mrs. Dias however replied
that the meetings must be open
and that it is "one of the penal
ties of dealing with a public
body" by a private organization.
Furthermore, she explained that
the open-closed meeting ques
tion has been "a constant prob
lem of long-standing we have
had with Stanford."
Arnett feels that the commit
tee, while basically sound, had
to be "a discussion group, not
an action group." He states firm
ly that, "the Trustees cannot
religate their authority to any
two or three people who would
represent them."
Entire Board Decisions
"The decisions must be made
by the entire board," he said,
"but the representatives might
discuss what is likely or what is
planned, and can make recom
mendations to the Board."
The future of the committee
is still in doubt and has not
yet met because of the question
of secret meetings. Mayor Fran
ces Dias told the City Council
last week:
"The President said it was
his interpretation that the com
mittee's purpose was one of
communicating, and not one of
solving any problems," Mrs.
Dias said, but added that Presi
dent Sterling had agreed to dis
cuss the problem with the
Board of Trustees again.
