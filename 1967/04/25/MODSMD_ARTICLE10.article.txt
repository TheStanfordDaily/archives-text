No official word has yet been re
ceived from the national office of
Kappa Sigma fraternity on the status
of the Stanford chapter, which was
suspended from the national a week
ago.
The suspension was announced at
a house meeting by district Grand
Master Howard Leggett of Alamo.
House President Dan Kirby said
the reasons given by Leggett at the
house meeting were "vague," center

Leggett has denied that the pledging
