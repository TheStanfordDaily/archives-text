### ANNE BROPHY 
The ASSU Education Commission
is launching a drive for new mem
bers in an effort to increase its effec
tiveness through expanded student
participation.
According to Commission Chair
man Tom Forstenzer, "ASSU has no
business being in anything but edu
cation — that's what a university's
all about."
The group was seen as a sociolo
gical-scientific model when it was
formed last summer by Forstenzer,
David Harris, and Mike Collins.
The next task of the Commission
will be distributing a questionnaire
during fall quarter registration which
will seek to establish the academic
interests of the student body, Forsten
zer said.

Faculty consultants will be invited
to meet with student seminars or
mass discussion sessions which would
later meet in small sessions. An effort
will also be made to develop contacts
within university departments to aid
discussion about the university com
munity.
"We have to get this thing off the
ground right now," Forstenzer em
phasized. "These institutions must be
set up so that ideas for educational
improvements don't die in dorm bull
sessions."
Students interested in joining the
Education Commission should sub
mit a short essay to P"orstenzer's of
fice at the ASSU by Monday. The es
say should be concerned with how
to best gain from permanent student
representation on educational views.
