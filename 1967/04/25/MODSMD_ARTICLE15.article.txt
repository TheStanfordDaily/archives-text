# LSD: Danger To Chromosomes
## 
### MAGGIE MoCOMAS 
Just what are the physiologi
cal effects of LSD? Is there a
possibility that prolonged use
of LSD could cause genetic ef
fects?
Some "acid-heads" insist that
the worse side-effect of LSD is
the possibility of a stiff jail sen
tence. Many psychologists and
psychiatrists who have treated
LSD users have for some time
cited the potential harm of the
drug in the sociological and
psychological realms. Yet argu
ments against the use of LSD
on the grounds of physical dam
age remain scanty and lacking
in sufficient factual support.
The most recent "scare" re
port comes from researchers at
the State University of New
York in Buffalo who have re
ported (Science, March 17, and
later summarized in a national
news magazine) experiments
which showed damage in the
chromosomes of body cells re
sulting from the present of LSD
(lysergic acid diethylamide).
Chromosomes
Aided by Dr. Michelle J. Mari
nelli and Dr. Nathan Buck, gene
ticist Maimon J. Cohen, in a
"highly preliminary report,"
cited damage to human chromo
somes in two types of experi
ments, one involving the intro
duction of LSD in concentrated
doses into test tube blood sam
ples, and the other the exami
nation of the blood cells of a
51-year-old schizophrenic patient
who had been treated with LSD
15 times during a six-year
period.
Both experiments showed that
the chromosomes of the blood
cells were broken or damaged.
While the news magazine report
stated that the results did not
indicate that such effects would
be accompanied by damage to
germ cells (sperm or ova), the

story did hint that such damage
to chromosomes might cause
long-range genetic defects.
In a recent interview Dr. John
H. Frenster, medical school pro
fessor who is invo'ved with
leukemia research and experi
mentation with chromosomes,
said that the indications of gen
etic defects in the experiments
were largely distorted.
While Dr. Frenster did not
discredit the experiments per se,
he pointed out that the test
tubes involved extremely large
doses. "Sufficiently high so dos
age may cause chromosomal
change in the test tube," he
said. However, while proportion
al dosages would probably be
harmful to individuals, it is un
likely that such large dosages
would be given to patients or
unknowingly taken by "acid
heads."
Caffeine Damage?
Frenster also pointed out that
other drugs and stimulants, one
of the most common being caf
feine, have been used in similar
test tube experiments. When in
troduced into white blood cells
specimens, these substances
have caused damage to chromo
somes much in the same man
ner as in Dr. Cohen's LSD ex
periment.

In addition, Frenster stated
some doubt as to the credibility
of the experiment which involv
ed the analysis of the blood of
the patient treated with LSD.
Frenster said that the patient
had been treated with other
drugs such as librium, and that
there was "no indication" that
the chromosomal damage in this
case could be traced exclusively
to the use of LSD.
More experimentation with
LSD has been concerned with
the psychological and sociologi
cal implications of the drug and
the possibilities of its use in
conjunction with psychiatric
treatment and psychotherapy.
Dr. Jack Shelton, research as
sociate at the medical scho ' has
been involved in experiments at
the Veteran's Administration
hospital concerning the use of
LSD in the treatment of alcohol
ism. Like Frenster, who claims
that LSD is "innocent until
proven guilty," Shelton points
out that the "psychological and
sociological effects of LSD have
been made apparent in many
cases, whereas there is still a
lack of evidence for any physi
cal defects resulting from use of
the drug. If you're looking for
examples of physical damage,

says Shelton, "just look at what
tobacco and alcohol have done."
The common reaction to the
"genetics defect" claim is the
fear the damaged chromosomes
will have harmful effects to the
extent of causing mutations In
the event of procreation. Fren
ster said that evidence of dam
age to chromosomes does not
necessarily lead to this conclu
sion.
Even such drugs as thalido
mide have proven to be harm
ful to the extent of causing mu
tations only in specific cases
where the drug was administer
ed to women patients during
their term of pregnancy. (Simi
lar mutations in fetal growth
may result from diseases such
as German measles which the
mother may suffer during preg
nancy.)
Frenster hastened to empha
size that the "long-range" gen
etics changes, as indicated in
the report of the LSD experi
ment, have yet to be proven In
the case of any such drug, even
thalidomide. He said that there
has been "no indication" that
such drugs, taken even prior tc
pregnancy, will cause defects 01
mutations in the event of pro
creation.
