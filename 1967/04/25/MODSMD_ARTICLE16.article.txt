# Fulbright: Criticism And Consensus
## 
### 
This is the second of four articles
taken from the chapter titled,
"The Citizen and the University"
from"The Arrogance of Power"
by Senator J. William Fulbright.
Freedom of thought and dis
cussion gives a democracy two
concrete advantages over a dic
tatorship in the making of for
eign policy: it diminishes the
danger of an irretrievable mis
take and it introduces ideas and
opportunities that otherwise
would not come to light.
The correction of errors In a
nation's foreign policy is greatly
assisted by the timely raising of
voices of criticism within the na
tion. When the British launched
their disastrous attack on Egypt,
the Labour Party raised a col
lective voice of indignation while
the military operation was still
underway; refusing to be deter
red by calls for national unity in
a crisis, Labour began the long,
painful process of recovering
Great Britain's good name at the
very moment when the damage
was still being done. Similarly,
the French intellectuals who pro
tested France's colonial wars in
Indochina and Algeria not only
upheld the values of French
democracy but helped pave the
way for the enlightened policies
of the Fifth Republic which have
made France the most respected
Western nation in the underde
veloped world. It has been in the
hope of performing a similar ser
vice for America on a very
modest scale that I criticized
American intervention in the
Dominican Republic and that
some of my colleagues and I

have raised questions about the
wisdom of American military in
volvement in Vietnam.
New Realities
The second great advantage of
free discussion to democratic
policy-makers is its bringing to
light of new ideas and the sup
planting of old myths with new
realities. We Americans are
much in need of this benefit be
cause we are severely, if not
uniquely, afflicted with a habit
of policy-making by analogy:
North Vietnam's involvement in
South Vietnam, for example, is
equated with Hitler's invasion
of Poland and a parley with the
Viet Cong would represent "an
other Munich." The treatment of
slight and superficial resem
blances as if they were full
blooded analogous instances, as
it were, of history "repeating
itself"—is a substitute for think
ing and a misuse of history.
There is a kind of voodoo
about America*! foreign policy.
Certain drums have to be beaten
regularly to ward off evil spirits
—for example, the maledictions
regularly uttered against North
Vietnamese aggression, the
"wild men" in Peking, commun
ism in general, and President de
Gaulle.
Free and open criticism has a
third, more abstract but no less
important function in a dem
ocracy: it is therapy and cath
arsis for those who are troubled
by something their country is
doing; it helps to reassert tradi
tional values, to clear the air
when it is full of tension and
mistrust. There are times in pub

lie life as in private life when
one must protest, not solely or
even primarily because one's
protest will be politic or mater
ially productive, but because
one's sense of decency is of
fended, because one is fed up
with political craft and public
images, or simply because some
thing goes against the grain. The
catharsis thus provided may in
deed be the most valuable of
freedom's uses.
Vietnam Protest
While not unprecedented, pro
tests against a war in the middle
of the war are a rare experience
for Americans. I see it as a mark
of strength and maturity that an
articulate minority have raised
their voices against the Viet
namese war and that the ma
jority of Americans are endur
ing this dissent, not without anx
iety, to be sure, but for the mo
ment at least with better grace
and understanding than would
have been the case in any other
war of the twentieth century.
It is by no means certain that
th e relatively healthy atmo
sphere in which the debate has
been taking place will not give
way to a new era of McCarthy
ism. Critics of the Vietnamese
war are being accused of a lack
of patriotism, and these accusa
with increasing frequency, from
irresponsible columnists but,
with increasing frequency, form
the highest levels of government.
This situation is likely to become
worse. The longer the Viet
namese war goes on without
prospect of victory or negotiated

peace, the higher the war fever
will rise.
Satan On War
In Mark Twain's novel The
Mysterious Stranger a benevol
ent and clairvoyant Satan said
the following about war and its
corrosive effects on a society:
"There has never been a just
one, never an honorable one—on
the part of the instigator of the
war. I can see a million years
ahead, and this rule will never
change in so many as half a
dozen instances. The loud little
handful—as usual—will shout
for the war. The pulpit will—
warily and cautiously—object—
at first; the great, big, dull bulk
of the nation will rub its sleepy
eyes and try to make out why
there should be a war, and will
say, earnestly and indignantly,
'It is unjust and dishonorable,
and there is no necessity for it.'
Then the handful wiil shout
louder. A few fair men on the
other side will argue and reason
against the war with speech and
pen, and at first will have a hear
ing and be applauded; but it will
not last long; those others will
outshout them, and presently the
anti-war audiences will thin out
and lose popularity. Before long
you will see this curious thing:
the speakers stoned from the
platform, and free speech stran
gled by hordes of furious men
who in their secret hearts are
still at one with those stoned
speakers—as earlier—but do not
dare to say so. And now the
whole nation—pulpit and all—
will take up the war-cry, and
shout itself hoarse, and mob any

honest man who ventures to
open his mouth; and presently
such mouths will cease to open.
Next the statesmen will invent
cheap lies, putting the blame
upon the nation that is attacked,
and every man will be glad of
those conscience-soothing falsi
fies, and will diligently study
them, and refuse to examine any
refutations of them; and thus he
will by and by convince himself
that the war is just, and will
thank God for the better sleep he
enjoys after this process of gro
tesque self-deception."
Past experience provides little
basis for confidence that reason
can prevail in an atmosphere of
mounting war fever. We must
try nonetheless to bring reason
and restraint into the emotion
ally charged atmosphere in
which the Vietnamese war is
now being discussed. Instead of
'trading epithets about who is
and is not giving "aid and com
fort" to the enemy, we would do
well to focus calmly and delib
erately on the issue itself, recog
nizing that all of us make mis
takes and that mistakes can be
corrected only if they are
acknowledged and discussed, and
recognizing further that war is
not its own justification, that it
can and must be discussed un
less we are prepared to sacrifice
our traditional democratic pro
cesses to a false image of na
tional unanimity.
