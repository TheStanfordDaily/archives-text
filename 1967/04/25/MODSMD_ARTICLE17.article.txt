# Guitar Concert Ethnically Groovy
## 
### PETER WALLENSTEIN 
Celedonio Romero not only
spawned Celin, Angel and Pepe,
his swinging sons, but also leads
them in their guitar concert. At
the Memorial Auditorium last
Friday they did Stanford the in
estimable service of adding a lit
tle Spanish something to a cul
ture not yet supported by an
overseas campus.
All the major styles of guitar
music, Flamenco, classical, Ba
roque and Romantic, were exe
cuted with flawless precision.
Improvization was the trend of
the entire evening, the second
half being especially devoted to
Flamenco "Virtuosite."
Precision and Verve
The opening spot, Telemann's
Concerto In D Major for (wait
for it) four guitars, set the tone
and pace for what followed. It
rapidly became obvious that the
performing soloists were going
to stay on the ball and stash
away those numbers with phe
nomenal precision and a brilliant
verve.
Celedonio featured himself in
the next three works, demon
strating a complete mastery of
the guitar with his fluid accu
racy of touch and a rich sonor
ous tone.
The full Mozartian quality, for
example, of Sor's Variations On
A Theme By Mozart, was never
lost sight of by the paternal ace.
A number of chromatic runs,
scales and intricate ornamenta
tion tripped an unending light

fantastic off Celedonio's strings.
Celin, the eldest son, admira
bly performed Torroba's three
movement Sonatina. In the An
dante section, Celin revealed tre
mendous finger dexterity and a
sweet mellow tone. The Allegro
has an all-encompassing efferve
scence which the soloist nicely
brought across.
Grace And Poise
Angel, a gaunt striking speci
men, with a highly El Grecesque
physique, played Paganini's
Grand Sonata In A Major with
remarkable grace and poise.
Though somewhat tense and
nervous at the beginning, he
quickly adjusted to a very nat
ural style. At 21, Angel has a
grasp and comprehension of the
intricacies of the guitar which
far belie his youth.
The last solo, Pepe, performed
several traditional Flamenco
pieces with that flaming and
passionate spirit which is a "sine
qua non" for this kind of music.
The brisk tempo of the Flamen
co was thus beautifully realized
and not once did Pepe allow his
rapid pace to affect the high
standard of his work.
The audience was exceedingly
receptive, and the Romeros re
sponded to this enthusiasm for
their "bravura" by knocking off
a couple of dazzling encores.
Bravo all round for four pro
fessional guitarists as rare as a
four leaf clover, who must be
feeling grateful for the coinci
dence that Stanford understood
them.
