# Hook Sees The Freedom To Learn As A Basis For Student Criticism
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
One of the most important topics
to be covered by the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford is the academic
freedom of the university student.
The biggest problem involved in this
study is, as Sidney Hook pointed out
in a speech on the subject last night,
"Not all who are qualified to discuss
academic freedom are courageous
enough to talk about it."
Hook based his definition of aca
demic freedom on what the German
universities called "freedom to teach."
This "freedom to teach" means that
"professionally qualified people teach
the truth as they see fit. The only
restriction is the rational method of
their domain.'
A key point in Hook's definition is
that "academic freedom is not a civil
freedom or civil right."
Profs Talk Nonsense?
The first reason for this is that
"academic freedom must be earned."

One of the presuppositions which is
based on this is tenure. Hook insisted,
"You don't have the academic free
dom to talk nonsense, until you earn
it as a professor."
A second concept involved in this
idea is that "any conclusion a profes
sor reaches in the course of his in
quiry, he may be criticized for. But
he may not be punished for it."
A further right of academic free
dom, once it is earned, is the "right
to honest dissent, the right to here
sy."
This right "presupposes that the
only requirement which binds the
teacher is intellectual trust." This
trust is so binding for Hook that he
feels when a member of the teaching
profession is obligated to another
group, such as the Communist Party,
the ethics of the profession are vio
lated.
"Freedom to Learn"
The freedom which the students

have is the "freedom to learn." In
pointing out that "every person has
a right to receive that education which
will make him a better citizen," Hook
pointed out some of the obstacles to
this necessity. Among these are "pov
erty, racial prejudice, and sexual prej
udice."
Hook stressed, "All of academic
freedom is necessary for freedom to
learn, but freedom to learn isn't nec
essary to academic freedom."
