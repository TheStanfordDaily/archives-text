good time, perhaps 9.8 or 9.9.

of the season in the 220, 22.2.
Three Men Hit Personal Bests

best lifetime efforts.

49' 8%". In the long jump, Chris
Gibson again found the pit to
his liking and unleashed a jump
of 22' IVi". Baer of Chaffey won
the event on his last jump with
22' 9".
Bill Griffith improved both of
his hurdle times, winning the
highs in 15.7 and taking second
in the intermediates with 41.7.
Ostrander Wins Again
The pole vault team of Clint
Ostrander and Steve Flannery
again took first and second, both
clearing 14' 0". Ostrander won
the event on the basis of fewer
misses.
Dave Harper accounted for
the remaining first place for the

120 Yard Dash?
Because of a slight oversight
by the officials, Jim Donart was
able to set the school record in
the 120 yard dash. His time of
11.7 indicates that he passed

the 100 yard mark with a very
good time, perhaps 9.8 or 9.9.
Donart also ran his best time
of the season in the 220, 22.2.
Three Men Hit Personal Bests

best lifetime efforts.
Len Mogno placed second in

of 22' IVi". Baer of Chaffey won
the event on his last jump with
22' 9".
Bill Griffith improved both of
his hurdle times, winning the
highs in 15.7 and taking second
in the intermediates with 41.7.

The pole vault team of Clint
Ostrander and Steve Flannery
again took first and second, both
clearing 14' 0". Ostrander won
the event on the basis of fewer
misses.

the remaining first place for the
Tribe, winning the high jump at
a height of 6' 4%".
