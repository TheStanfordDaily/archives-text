# Letters To The Editor
## Lane Accused Of Refusal To Debate Warren Report 
### 
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.

• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

• Just Another
Number?
Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing
Center is distributing a question
naire to graduate students ask
ing a number of questions about
the personal significance of their
graduate experience at Stanford.
There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,
could be embarrassing to the in
dividual were the information
not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the
answers to be wholly confiden
tial." There certainly is not any

need to give your name, since
each questionnaire has a small
number handwritten on the
back of the second page. We
suggest that, as one more futile
gesture in the fight for preser
vation of privacy, each person
clip the number-bearing corner
from the questionnaire before
returning it to the Counseling
and Testing Center.

Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing
Center is distributing a question
naire to graduate students ask
ing a number of questions about
the personal significance of their
graduate experience at Stanford.
There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,
could be embarrassing to the in
dividual were the information
not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the
answers to be wholly confiden
tial." There certainly is not any

need to give your name, since
each questionnaire has a small
number handwritten on the
back of the second page. We
suggest that, as one more futile
gesture in the fight for preser
vation of privacy, each person
clip the number-bearing corner
from the questionnaire before
returning it to the Counseling
and Testing Center.
NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.
ART BERNSTEIN
Graduate, Law
• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing

naire to graduate students ask
ing a number of questions about
the personal significance of their
graduate experience at Stanford.
There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,
could be embarrassing to the in
dividual were the information
not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the
answers to be wholly confiden

need to give your name, since
each questionnaire has a small
number handwritten on the

NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.
ART BERNSTEIN
Graduate, Law
• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a

sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power

can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing

naire to graduate students ask
ing a number of questions about
the personal significance of their
graduate experience at Stanford.
There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,
could be embarrassing to the in
dividual were the information
not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the
answers to be wholly confiden

need to give your name, since
each questionnaire has a small
number handwritten on the

NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.
ART BERNSTEIN
Graduate, Law
• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad

handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years

Naturally, it is a wonderful idea

Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,

for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern

were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing

the personal significance of their

There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,
could be embarrassing to the in

not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the

need to give your name, since
each questionnaire has a small

NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.
ART BERNSTEIN
Graduate, Law
• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.

rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing

naire to graduate students ask
ing a number of questions about
the personal significance of their
graduate experience at Stanford.
There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,
could be embarrassing to the in
dividual were the information
not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the
answers to be wholly confiden

need to give your name, since
each questionnaire has a small
number handwritten on the

suggest that, as one more futile

NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.
ART BERNSTEIN
Graduate, Law
• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing

the personal significance of their

There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,

not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the

each questionnaire has a small

NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.
ART BERNSTEIN
Graduate, Law
• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality

of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing
about the university community,
not the government alone. If one
wants an edifying reference to
a novel, the figure of Mittler
('Mediator') in Goethe's Wahl
verwandtschaften comes to
mind: whenever he rushes in
with his moral imperative, he
precipitates a new disaster.
No one likes to be criticized,
least of all on topics most im
portant to him and close to his
vital certainty. Our world-views
are, I think, strongly bound up
in the structure of our egos, not
easy to separate and examine.
Mr. Hass may be accustomed
to defending himself against
what he considers to be con
servative attacks. I am obvious
ly critical of his view, though
not, I think, in the way to which
he is accustomed.
Effective Action
He feels required to act, from
feelings of disgust, shame, and
outrage. The most effective ac
tion one can undertake in the
university community is, I think,
study and articulation of the
problem. I am prepared to un
dertake examination of Ameri
can intellectual orientation in
hopes of being able to unearth
some of our more fundamental
prejudices, which may cause us
to repeat unwittingly the errors
we criticize. This is a long, dif
ficult, and rather unpopular task.
I cannot at the same time estab
lish what our political morality
ought to be, set forth practical
precepts for political action, and
do all those things one would
expect of the ideal philosopher
king.
Nonetheless, if we took up
some of these tasks together,
one of us might reach the point
of having something to say
which would command the re
spect and attention of people
with power and authority. We
would have to give up, amongst
other things, our present 'states'
rights' attitude towards aca
demic disciplines, and be pre
pared to find examples in their
structure of viewpoints we are
trying to understand and cor
rect. For it is possible that the
universities, which train and
provide many government offi
cials, are themselves cultivating
the attitudes their members
openly criticize.
If there were a way to stop the
war by fiat, and if I had some
understanding of the conse
quences of that fiat, I would par
ticipate in it. Meanwhile, I
would rather try to establish a
local environment in which in
terested people can communi
cate with one another across
differences of viewpoint.

• O'er The Ramparts
Editor, The Daily:
It was heartening to see such
an outstanding personality as
Robert Scheer of Ramparts on
the Stanford campus.
His analysis of western capi

talism ("irrational economic
system dependent on war") was
a terribly thoughtful one. There
were a few small details, how
ever, which I felt he overlooked.
Namely, that war has a depress
ing effect on a capitalist econ
omy, that the end of war in re
cent history has brought a boom
in business and the stock mar
ket, that the 1966 market crash
was primarily caused by eco
nomic pressures largely a result
of the Vietnam war, that war
often brings price controls and
excess profit taxes, and there
fore does the "profiteering" in
dustries little good.
As for the system being irra
tional, I suppose Robert Scheer
must know. How can an econom
ic system be rational if so many
people do not subscribe to Ram
parts? Obviously, allowing peo
ple to determine their own val
ues in a free market is irrational
unless they choose to buy Ram
parts.
Such a system must not be
allowed to survive. And Scheer
has a proposal to eliminate this
severe deficiency of the Ameri
can people. He suggests that
magazines be subsidized by the
government. (The American
people may not want Ramparts,
but they are damn well going
to pay for it!) This proposal is
justified by the fact that maga
zines are dependent on adver
tising for solvency. I have to ad
mit that Ramparts is acutely
handicapped by this dependency,
having in the last three years
raised its circulation only 150-
fold, from 2,000 to 300,000
And since Ramparts is de
pendent on advertising, it has
had to tone down its message
to be acceptable to its adver
tisers. I have noticed this soft
ening of the Ramparts message.
Naturally, it is a wonderful idea
to have Ramparts subsidized ac
cording to the circulation fig
ures as Scheer suggests. And
Life, Time, and Newsweek, too,
with their millions of readers,
for they too are magazines. This
will cost a lot, but the govern
ment can just tax the higher-in
come brackets. Hell, they can
afford it. Do they not send their
children to places like Stanford?
Scheer's proposal creates all
sorts of possibilities. Wouldn't it
be a wonderful thing to have a
government - subsidized univer
sity here at Stanford? Scheer is
"deeply disturbed at the power
which commercial forces . . .
exert over publishers." Similar
ly, should we not all be dis
turbed at the power which com
mercial forces (our alumni)
exert over the University? Of
course, it is a terrible miscar
riage of justice that the govern
ment does not subsidize all pri
vate universities, and free them
from the terrible influence of
commercial forces. And while
we are at it, government should
subsidize all television and ra
dio, and books, and the theater,
and the arts, for the same rea
son Scheer gives. And when
everyone is paying (the subsi
dies, through taxation) for
nothing he wants, then we will

have attained a state of perfect
society.

Editor, The Daily:
The Counseling and Testing

naire to graduate students ask
ing a number of questions about
the personal significance of their
graduate experience at Stanford.
There are a number of questions
which, if answered truthfully,
could be embarrassing to the in

not kept completely confidential.
The accompanying letter
states, "There is no need to give
your name, since we want the
answers to be wholly confiden

need to give your name, since
each questionnaire has a small
number handwritten on the
back of the second page. We
suggest that, as one more futile
gesture in the fight for preser

clip the number-bearing corner
from the questionnaire before
returning it to the Counseling
and Testing Center.
NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Daily :
The following letter is a rec
ord of my dealings with Mark
Lane in regard to a two-part
presentation sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum on Octo
ber 14th (Mark Lane) and Octo
jer 17th (Wesley Liebeler). My
only comment would be that
to the transactions de
scribed, I had never had dealings
with or opinions regarding Lane,
Liebeler, or the Warren Commis
sion or its Report. Generally, I
"till have no strong feelings re
garding the individuals or issues
'nvolved; I do have a negative
opinion of Mr. Lane, evoked
solely on the basis of the follow
ing transactions, and by what I
believe to be a misrepresenta
tion by Mr. Lane that he is will
'ng to debate anyone on the top
ic of the Warren Commission
*.nd Report.
Monday, Oct. 3: Jan Stude
baker, University Publicity, calls
Law Forum, says Mark Lane is
available to speak; do we want
him?
Tuesday: I return call, say
yes; Studebaker asks what for
.iat. I ask if panel or debate is
0.k.; Studebaker says she thinks
so, she'll check with Lane, call
me back. Later, she calls and
says debate is fine.
Wednesday: I ask Prof. Kap
ian (solely because his author
ship of Trial of Jack Ruby indi
cates some connection with the
area of the assassination) who
is a good person to debate Lane;
Kaplan says not me, Lane has
spent IV2 years with Warren Re
port, ,1 haven't; only person in
California area really familiar
with whole Report is Liebeler,
'JCLA Law Prof.
Friday morning: I reach Lieb
eler, he accepts invitation to de
bate Lane.
Monday, 8:00 a.ni.: I receive
jail from publisher's representa
tive travelling with Lane, who
.says Lane won't debate Liebeler;
an incident occurred at UCLA,
Lane is going to sue Liebeler for
libel.
Monday evening: I reach
Lane, ask if any chance he'll de
bate Liebeler, since Law Forum
had already invited him; Lane
says no: 1) he has made com
mitment to UCLA speaker's or
ganization to debate Liebeler
there exclusively; 2) he is going
to sue Liebeler for libel; says I
don't know what's going on be
vveen you and Liebeler, but I
have made a commitment to
UCLA group, and I honor my
commitments; Lane says get
somebody else to debate him, if
must have debate; or else let
Lane speak Oct. 14 (original
date agreed on), and Liebeler
.'ater that day or the next week
if must have him; I say may I
with UCLA group, if it's
o.k. with them for you to debate
Liebeler here, is it o.k. with you?
Lane says call them and see.
Tuesday afternoon: I reach
UCLA group (Art Levine, Chair
man), he says our program is
fine with them, the debate at
;r JCLA was Lane's suggestion,
they weren't sure if they wanted
to handle it, let them know how
our program turned out.

Wednesday morning: I c a 11
Lane, tell him it's fine with
UCLA group, may the debate
proceed as scheduled? Lane says
he wants to check with UCLA
group himself, will call me back.
Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: I get
call from Lane's publisher's rep
resentatives; I ask to speak to
Lane; he asks why, I say I want
to talk to Lane personally; Lane
gets on; I ask if debate may pro
ceed, Lane says no, his New
York lawyers said it would
jeopardize his libel suit (note:
Lane was a trial lawyer in New
York for 15 years); won't de
bate Liebeler; I ask, then is it
all right if we have you on Oct.
14th (Fri.), Liebeler on Monday,
as you suggested? Lane says no,
won't appear in any program of
which Liebeler is a part; I say
that I feel both sides of the issue
should be presented, it is rather
late to get another speaker, I
had been told that Liebeler was
the one person in California
truly familiar with the Warren
Report, that Law Forum had in
vited Liebeler on the informa
tion that Lane would debate
anyone, that Lane had indicated
that he would not object to a
Fri.-Lane, Mon.-Liebeler series
(in fact, it was his suggestion),
and that having invited Liebeler,
I felt Law Forum should not
withdraw the invitation to ap
pear at least at a later date;
Lane says if that's the case,
maybe we should forget the
whole thing; I say fine.
About 10 minutes later: Lane
calls back; says he has talked
to his New York lawyers (again,
Lane was himself a trial lawyer
in New York for 15 years), they
say its 0.k.; I ask, for debate?
he says no, if he goes on Fri.,
Liebeler on Monday.
P.S. No law suit has as yet
been filed by Mr. Lane; IV2
months have passed since the
alleged libel, and Mr. Lane's con
tention that he would not de
bate Prof. Liebeler because of
the impending suit; they have
debated once, at UCLA on Jan
uary 25th; Mr. Lane has refused
to engage in any subsequent de
bates with Prof. Liebeler.
ART BERNSTEIN
Graduate, Law
• Communication
Editor, The Daily:
The best response I have to
offer to Mr. Hass' letter (Daily,
Apr. 19) is an exposition of the
problems I see in coming to un
derstand our present political
and military posture in Viet
nam.
The two positions outlined by
Mr. Novak (Daily, April. 18)
are for me roughly representa
tive of conservative and liberal
outlooks. For the conservative,
there is a real danger of Chi
nese nationalism; for the lib
eral, the Vietnam problem is a
civil war in which we have no
right to interfere. He may also
criticize our presence there as
an act of imperialism.
While the second of these
two views seems to me much
closer to the truth than the first,
I would like to see it carefully
distinguished from an isolation

ist position. A country the size
and power of the United States
must recognize the necessity of
negotiation with countries of
comparable influence, and with
drawal from Vietnam involves
such negotiation.
Mr. Rosso, quoting Mr. Thant
(NYRB VII, § 8) writes, "In
my view, if only some bold steps
were taken, even as late as 1964,
in the political and diplomatic
field, I feel that much of the
tragic developments we are
witnessing today could have
been avoided."
Steps and Insight
These political and diplomatic
steps require a political and dip
lomatic insight which I think
we as a nation still lack. While
a peace march can keep the
problem before the public eye,
it cannot define or solve it. The
university community would
perform a far more valuable so
cial function if it would also
undertake to articulate our po
litical goals and methods, and
to discover the cultural setting
in which our politics take place,
and to describe the importance
of that cultural setting to other
nations.
I think I know more about the
relation of American cultural
history to American morality
than I do about political and dip
lomatic tactics, though I do not
feel at all satisfied with my
knowledge of any of these top
ics. I am convinced, nonetheless,
that lack of attention to Ameri
can cultural history, and to com
parative cultural history gen
erally, is an important factor
in generating military and po
litical involvements we do not
want, liberal, conservative, or
anyone else.
These topics have not yet
come up in debate, to my knowl
edge. When Senator Church
spoke here last year, he put
forth a view of liberalism which
I considered to be frankly iso
lationistic: we ought not to have
military involvements not di
rectly related to our national in
terest. When I tried to criticize
this view for lack of attention
to world affairs, I was branded
a totalitarian and authoritarian
— by a liberal.
Building Castles
I have often been accused of
building castles in the clouds
while others attempted at least
to engage in political action;
that seems to be the substance
of Mr. Hass' polemics. It is true
that I have been mostly silent
on these matters until now. I
can only say in partial self-de
fense that every time I have
tried to raise the relevant issues
I think I know something about,
resentment has run so high that
communication has broken down
completely. I have been advised
by people whose opinion I re
spect not to waste my time try
ing to communicate with Stan
ford students — or faculty — on
matters of social and ethical im
portance.
Mr. Chomsky, in the article
sited by Mr. Hass (NYRB VTII,
§ 3) writes, "The long tradition
of naivete and self-rightousness
that disfigures our intellectual

history . . . must serve as a
warning to the third world . . .
as to how our protestations of
sincerity and benign intent are
to be interpreted." He is writing

not the government alone. If one
