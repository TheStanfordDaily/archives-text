Wonders will never cease. The Trustees have
allowed women to live off campus, only seven
months after inception of the movement to
allow them equal rights in selecting housing
options.
The Board deserves the gratitude of the com
munity for its rapid consideration and approval
of this proposal. The decision adds credibility
to claims that the Trustees are interested in
residential innovation and raises hopes that
they will act favorably on other proposals pres
ently under consideration.
But that is not the entire story. Although the
Trustees' decision is a pleasant surprise, it can
not be concealed that the manner in which the
new plan will be implemented next year leaves
much to be desired. Specifically, restriction of
the off-campus option to only 100 seniors im
plies a rejection of equality between the sexes,
as well as a desperate attempt to cling to the
dying in loco parentis concept.
Some claim it is strategically more cautious
to begin with limited implementation of this
proposal and the chant of "it's better than
nothing" emerges loudly from Inner Quad. Last
week's decision, however, confirms that al

though the University can establish principles,
it will compromise them as soon as financial
considerations come into account. And further
more, it reveals a lack of confidence in the
decision, as well as in the principle.
Not allowing sophomore and junior women
to live off campus perpetuates the policy of
allowing men greater individual freedom than
their female counterparts. No conclusive argu
ment has yet been heard in favor of this double
standard.
The 100-limit recognizes that women should
be granted liberty to live off campus, but
fails to give all of them that freedom. It makes
off-campus living a privilege for those who are
lucky enough to be drawn, rather than a right
for all. And the limit demonstrates that the
University's approval of off-campus living for
women is token, rather than sincere.
The Trustees have implied that the details
of their decision may change after the academic
year 1967-68. Hopefully, they will at that time
consider reconciling principle with practice and
extend the off-campus option to include an
unlimited number of sophomore, junior, and
senior women.
