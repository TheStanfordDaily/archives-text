## Off Plan Obscures Real Issue 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
President Sterling and, I pre
sume, the Packer Commission,
have fulfilled the expectations
of the OFF movement complete
ly. They have instituted a
"right" for some. They have
maintained the attitude which
makes America's double stan
dard so strong. They hope to
pacify the "troublemakers"
with a small concession, while
leaving the basic problem of
sexual discrimination untouch
ed. By refusing to acknowledge
the simple fact that women have
an equal right to live independ
ently they do a disservice to
women students here. While
they admit that there are no
practical limitations to making
just regulations, they still re
fuse to do it. Do they wish to
exert a totalitarian influence
over the women? Why must a
twenty-two-year-old junior live
in a dorm if she does not want
to when a "lucky" twenty-year
old senior is allowed to move
off? Why should women be sub
ject to anxiety about such a
clear-cut issue? There are some
Stanford women who will be
lulled into apathy by letting 100
women move off; there are some
who will feel that the adminis
tration deserves thanks for be
ing human; but there are some
who will see this move for what
it is: an insult to them. If no
where else in American society,
at least within the University
women should be "protected"
from the double standard.
I am leaving Stanford soon,
and I am living off-campus
(married) so I am no longer
subject to the immediate pres
sure of this form of discrimin
ation. And I feel elated to be rid
of the oppressive burden of
social regulations and forced
housing. But the fight against
the administration's degrading
mental attitude toward me and

all women, embodied in this
latest decision to let only 100
women exercise their right, is
still mine. Therefore, I am very
concerned that Stanford under
graduate women do not give up
the struggle for legal equality
here.
Changing the laws won't, of
course, rid men's minds of
prejudice, but it will make life
a lot more possible for Stanford
women. I see the present atti
tude toward women as destruc
tive, not only to the individual
female students, but to any at
mosphere of intellectual pro
gress. I urge women who will
be here next year to react
strongly if they are kept on
campus by the lottery, or if they
are forced by their class rank
ing to live in dorms. A mass
exodus, regardless of the rules,
might even be in order—if con
ditions are right. At any rate,
to drop the issue now is to ad
mit defeat without engaging in
any real battle.

• In Favor Of Lyman
Editor, The Daily:
I am formally withdrawing
my candidacy for the Presidency
of the ASSU. I continue to hold
the same views as before about
the nature of student body gov
ernment at Stanford, but I be
lieve that in Peter Lyman, the
Stanford student body has a
candidate who is committed to
radical reform and revitaliza
tion of the University. I urge
all those who had promised to
support me to support Peter
Lyman instead. He will be here
next year.

• Cheers
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's coffee house well

deserves the attention that Mr.
Gruber, in his usual flamboyant
and somewhat exaggerated
style, lavished on Mem What?
in his Magazine article of last
week; however, I cannot accept
the personal kudos that really
belongs to so many others. It
took a small army to make the
coffee house happen in the first
place, and now it exists because
of the students and faculty who
come each night. It is these peo
ple, especially the Coffee House
Steering Committee and Tresid
der Union, who really deserve
the credit.

• Squash?
Editor, The Daily:
Physical fitness should be of
primary concern to an educa
tional institution both for stu
dents and professors, since both
depend upon physical stamina
to complement the intellectual
vigor needed for academic work.
The games of handball and
squash are excellently suited to
the needs of the university com
munity in that they are fast
moving and provide a lot of ex
ercise in a short duration, re
quire only two players, can be
played year round (even when
it rains), and are played by men
over a major portion of their
lives. These games are almost
traditional in the university
scene, so that I was surprised
to find them absent on this cam
pus; also they are not available
locally off-campus. If enough
others are interested I would
like to see facilities for these
sports made available.
