## ASSU Elections: Overall Goal Needed 
### Carl Schmidt 
(Editor's Note: Carl Schmidt
ran for ASSU President last
year. He was elected Speaker
of the Legislature, but did not
return to Stanford in the fall.)
I see that it is once again
Spring Quarter, and the annual
Dance of Student Government is
about to begin. Last week you
could hear the candidates scrap
ping and banging about back
stage like beans in an empty
box. This is the early Getting
Ready phase and is customarily
the time when the "Platform,"
or statement of principles, is re
leased. Accordingly, Candidates
Shanahan and Hansen have pro
vided us with specimens in the
grand old tradition, each divid
ing his efforts about equally be
tween insipid generalities and
plagiarisms from past cam
paigns. Each has used a respec
table number of the required
words, "involvement," "com
munity," "commitment," "activ
ism," "in-group" (which is some
thing one is against), and "alien
ated' (which indicates that the
candidate has 'had' Drekmeier,
or at least knows who he is).
Hansen has appointed himself
guardian of the word "communi
cation" for this campaign; that
is always an important word,
and I'm sure Mr. Hansen will do
it justice, Shanahan's soaring
and triumphant "meaningful dia
logue on the institutional level"
has scarcely been matched in the
whole venerable history of plat
form prose.
Mr. Shanahan's platform is a
short affair, very free and open,
leaving the reader at liberty to
assess the candidate's intentions,
motives, and abilities in almost
any way he desires. For example,
Shanahan and Levinson (the ex
tra names are the Vice-Presi
dential nominees) begin by com
mitting themselves to "The legit
imacy of student power: Student
opinion is valid—Students should
have an official role in university
decision-making." This is very
fine platform fare. It leaves us
free to speculate as to what the
nature of the students official
role in the university should be,
how this goal (whatever it may
be) can be attained, and what
is, in fact, unsatisfactory about
the manner in which students
are now involved in "decision
making."
Not The Whole Picture
But all this is away from the
point. While sarcasm (inept as
it is) may have a function and
serve to gloss over a very sad
situation, it will not answer the
need for some intelligent dis
cussion of the capabilities and
frailties of student government.
These first impressions of the
campaign are pitiful indeed.
Both Mr. Shanahan and Mr.
Hansen have gone to some
lengths to identify themselves
with the kind of student govern
ment represented by the admin
istration of Sandy MacKenzie in

1965-66. Most of the specific pro
posals they make are drawn di
rectly from the programs of
that administration or the plat
form of the preceding campaign.
Mr. Hansen even goes so far as
to list the achievements of stu
dent government in 1965-66 at
the end of his platform under
the title "Advantages of a Coop
erative 'Liberal' Approach to
Student Government."
While I am personally grati
fied that someone does in fact
remember those accomplish
ments, it must be stated that
that student government found
it necessary to enclose its lib
eralism in quotation marks, that
Mr. Shanahan was one of its
consistent opponents, and that
one of its achievements, not
listed by Mr. Hansen, was that
he held the position of Chief of
Student Police under that ad
ministration, a position for
which he is very well qualified.
Unifying Goal
What Mr. Shanahan and Mr.
Hansen fail to comprehend is
that the achievements and pro
posals of the Mackenzie admin
istration, and the Wedin and
Rosencranz administration be
fore it, were not based on a sim
ply functional view of student
government, but on a well
founded overall conception of
the student within the univers
ity and the university in society.
Mr. Shanahan, in his singular
theory of "dynamic tension"
(formerly called "broadening
the ticket") refers to himself
and his partner as "construction
ists." But "construction" (what
ever that means exactly) de
mands a goal or an orienting
plan in order to proceed in an
intelligent manner, or in fact,
in order to proceed at all.
Both Mr. Hansen and Mr.
Shanahan condemn the "in
group" that (they say) have
run student government in the
past. This is exceedingly naive
for two who claim to have had
any contact with student govern
ment. No Student Body Presi
dent has ever locked his door to
anyone who wanted to work in
any capacity, or failed to do his
utmost to encourage such par
ticipation. The plain fact of the
matter is that any Student Body
President will be lucky if he has
even a "small group of friends"
who will help him. In the long
months of Fall and Winter
Quarter neither "communica
tion" nor "construction" will
keep a student administration
on its feet. Only hard work and
a sincere dedication to a recog
nizable and attainable goal will
do that.

of the Legislature, but did not
return to Stanford in the fall.)
I see that it is once again
Spring Quarter, and the annual
Dance of Student Government is
about to begin. Last week you
could hear the candidates scrap
ping and banging about back
stage like beans in an empty
box. This is the early Getting
Ready phase and is customarily
the time when the "Platform,"
or statement of principles, is re
leased. Accordingly, Candidates
Shanahan and Hansen have pro
vided us with specimens in the
grand old tradition, each divid
ing his efforts about equally be
tween insipid generalities and
plagiarisms from past cam
paigns. Each has used a respec
table number of the required
words, "involvement," "com
munity," "commitment," "activ
ism," "in-group" (which is some
thing one is against), and "alien
ated' (which indicates that the
candidate has 'had' Drekmeier,
or at least knows who he is).
Hansen has appointed himself
guardian of the word "communi
cation" for this campaign; that
is always an important word,
and I'm sure Mr. Hansen will do
it justice, Shanahan's soaring
and triumphant "meaningful dia
logue on the institutional level"
has scarcely been matched in the
whole venerable history of plat
form prose.
Mr. Shanahan's platform is a
short affair, very free and open,
leaving the reader at liberty to
assess the candidate's intentions,
motives, and abilities in almost
any way he desires. For example,
Shanahan and Levinson (the ex
tra names are the Vice-Presi
dential nominees) begin by com
mitting themselves to "The legit
imacy of student power: Student
opinion is valid—Students should
have an official role in university
decision-making." This is very
fine platform fare. It leaves us
free to speculate as to what the
nature of the students official
role in the university should be,
how this goal (whatever it may
be) can be attained, and what
is, in fact, unsatisfactory about
the manner in which students
are now involved in "decision
making."
Not The Whole Picture
But all this is away from the
point. While sarcasm (inept as
it is) may have a function and
serve to gloss over a very sad
situation, it will not answer the
need for some intelligent dis
cussion of the capabilities and
frailties of student government.
These first impressions of the
campaign are pitiful indeed.
Both Mr. Shanahan and Mr.
Hansen have gone to some
lengths to identify themselves
with the kind of student govern
ment represented by the admin
istration of Sandy MacKenzie in

1965-66. Most of the specific pro
posals they make are drawn di
rectly from the programs of
that administration or the plat
form of the preceding campaign.
Mr. Hansen even goes so far as
to list the achievements of stu
dent government in 1965-66 at
the end of his platform under
the title "Advantages of a Coop
erative 'Liberal' Approach to
Student Government."
While I am personally grati
fied that someone does in fact
remember those accomplish
ments, it must be stated that
that student government found
it necessary to enclose its lib
eralism in quotation marks, that
Mr. Shanahan was one of its
consistent opponents, and that
one of its achievements, not
listed by Mr. Hansen, was that
he held the position of Chief of
Student Police under that ad
ministration, a position for
which he is very well qualified.
Unifying Goal
What Mr. Shanahan and Mr.
Hansen fail to comprehend is
that the achievements and pro
posals of the Mackenzie admin
istration, and the Wedin and
Rosencranz administration be
fore it, were not based on a sim
ply functional view of student
government, but on a well
founded overall conception of
the student within the univers
ity and the university in society.
Mr. Shanahan, in his singular
theory of "dynamic tension"
(formerly called "broadening
the ticket") refers to himself
and his partner as "construction
ists." But "construction" (what
ever that means exactly) de
mands a goal or an orienting
plan in order to proceed in an
intelligent manner, or in fact,
in order to proceed at all.
Both Mr. Hansen and Mr.
Shanahan condemn the "in
group" that (they say) have
run student government in the
past. This is exceedingly naive
for two who claim to have had
any contact with student govern
ment. No Student Body Presi
dent has ever locked his door to
anyone who wanted to work in
any capacity, or failed to do his
utmost to encourage such par
ticipation. The plain fact of the
matter is that any Student Body
President will be lucky if he has
even a "small group of friends"
who will help him. In the long
months of Fall and Winter
Quarter neither "communica
tion" nor "construction" will
keep a student administration
on its feet. Only hard work and
a sincere dedication to a recog
nizable and attainable goal will
do that.

Spring Quarter, and the annual
Dance of Student Government is
about to begin. Last week you
could hear the candidates scrap
ping and banging about back
stage like beans in an empty
box. This is the early Getting
Ready phase and is customarily
the time when the "Platform,"
or statement of principles, is re
leased. Accordingly, Candidates
Shanahan and Hansen have pro
vided us with specimens in the
grand old tradition, each divid
ing his efforts about equally be
tween insipid generalities and
plagiarisms from past cam
paigns. Each has used a respec
table number of the required
words, "involvement," "com
munity," "commitment," "activ
ism," "in-group" (which is some
thing one is against), and "alien
ated' (which indicates that the
candidate has 'had' Drekmeier,
or at least knows who he is).
Hansen has appointed himself
guardian of the word "communi
cation" for this campaign; that
is always an important word,
and I'm sure Mr. Hansen will do
it justice, Shanahan's soaring
and triumphant "meaningful dia
logue on the institutional level"
has scarcely been matched in the
whole venerable history of plat
form prose.
Mr. Shanahan's platform is a
short affair, very free and open,
leaving the reader at liberty to
assess the candidate's intentions,
motives, and abilities in almost
any way he desires. For example,
Shanahan and Levinson (the ex
tra names are the Vice-Presi
dential nominees) begin by com
mitting themselves to "The legit
imacy of student power: Student
opinion is valid—Students should
have an official role in university
decision-making." This is very
fine platform fare. It leaves us
free to speculate as to what the
nature of the students official
role in the university should be,
how this goal (whatever it may
be) can be attained, and what
is, in fact, unsatisfactory about
the manner in which students
are now involved in "decision
making."
Not The Whole Picture
But all this is away from the
point. While sarcasm (inept as
it is) may have a function and
serve to gloss over a very sad
situation, it will not answer the
need for some intelligent dis
cussion of the capabilities and
frailties of student government.
These first impressions of the
campaign are pitiful indeed.
Both Mr. Shanahan and Mr.
Hansen have gone to some
lengths to identify themselves
with the kind of student govern
ment represented by the admin
istration of Sandy MacKenzie in

1965-66. Most of the specific pro
posals they make are drawn di
rectly from the programs of
that administration or the plat
form of the preceding campaign.
Mr. Hansen even goes so far as
to list the achievements of stu
dent government in 1965-66 at
the end of his platform under
the title "Advantages of a Coop
erative 'Liberal' Approach to
Student Government."
While I am personally grati
fied that someone does in fact
remember those accomplish
ments, it must be stated that
that student government found
it necessary to enclose its lib
eralism in quotation marks, that
Mr. Shanahan was one of its
consistent opponents, and that
one of its achievements, not
listed by Mr. Hansen, was that
he held the position of Chief of
Student Police under that ad
ministration, a position for
which he is very well qualified.
Unifying Goal
What Mr. Shanahan and Mr.
Hansen fail to comprehend is
that the achievements and pro
posals of the Mackenzie admin
istration, and the Wedin and
Rosencranz administration be
fore it, were not based on a sim
ply functional view of student
government, but on a well
founded overall conception of
the student within the univers
ity and the university in society.
Mr. Shanahan, in his singular
theory of "dynamic tension"
(formerly called "broadening
the ticket") refers to himself
and his partner as "construction
ists." But "construction" (what
ever that means exactly) de
mands a goal or an orienting
plan in order to proceed in an
intelligent manner, or in fact,
in order to proceed at all.
Both Mr. Hansen and Mr.
Shanahan condemn the "in
group" that (they say) have
run student government in the
past. This is exceedingly naive
for two who claim to have had
any contact with student govern
ment. No Student Body Presi
dent has ever locked his door to
anyone who wanted to work in
any capacity, or failed to do his
utmost to encourage such par
ticipation. The plain fact of the
matter is that any Student Body
President will be lucky if he has
even a "small group of friends"
who will help him. In the long
months of Fall and Winter
Quarter neither "communica
tion" nor "construction" will
keep a student administration
on its feet. Only hard work and
a sincere dedication to a recog
nizable and attainable goal will
do that.

ran for ASSU President last
year. He was elected Speaker
of the Legislature, but did not
return to Stanford in the fall.)
