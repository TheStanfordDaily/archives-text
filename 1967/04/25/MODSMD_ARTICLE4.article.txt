# Alumni Honor Hayden
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Stanford alumnus Sen. Carl Hayden
became the fifth recipient of the solid
gold Herbert Hoover medal, the high
est accolade of the Stanford Alumni
Association, at a dinner honoring him
last night in Washington, D.C.
Thirty-five senators, 15 representa
tives, Secretary of Health, Education,

and Welfare John Gardner, and Chief
Justice Earl Warren were among the
audience of 270 who heard Hayden
appraise the 10 Presidents with whom
he has served during 55 years in both
houses of Congress.
In his acceptance speech, Hayden
described William Howard Taft as
"a kindly man."

"I have often thought that if his
own son, Sen. Robert Taft, had been
fortunate enough to inherit his fa
ther's friendly manner, he might have
become the Presidential candidate
that he so much wanted to be."
"President Coolidge was a typical
Yankee trader," Hayden said.
His analysis of Harry Truman was
much more flattering. "I am confi
dent" he insisted, that "he will go
down in history as one of our great
Presidents."
Turning to the two most recent
Presidents, Hayden complimented
President Kennedy for always giving
him "good attention" when he went
to the Whijte House. Of Johnson, he
claimed, "Our long-time friendship
has not abated since he entered the
White House."
A friend of Herbert Hoover, Hay
den said of him, "I find no fault in
his ideals. His faith in the American
economic system was founded on his
own outstanding record as an en
lightened businessman."
As a final tribute to Hayden, five
San Francisco alumni who attended
Stanford at the turn of the century,
asked that the record be clarified to
show that their votes were for him as
student body president in the 1900
election. In that campaign, Hayden
lost by two votes. It is the only elec
tion he has lost.
