### ROGER LaBRUCHERIE 
The recent skirmish between the
House of Best Foods and the notor
ious Wonka family has apparently
ended in stalemate, each side having
claimed a limited victory.
Wendy G. Wonka, on a daring
raid, managed to penetrate deeply
into the stronghold of the National
College Queen contest before being
detected by enemy scouts. Then, in
storied Wonka family fashion, she
slipped through the net in which the
Best Foods forces hoped to ensnare
her. At this point she continues to
elude the attempts to discover her
whereabouts, although she is alleged

to have holed up in the Stillman
House area, where she is known to
have heavy peasant support.
Best Foods, for its part, has suc
ceeded in keeping its contest intact.
A reliable source informed The
Daily that Miss Wonka's name would
probably remain on the contest bal
lot, but that votes for Miss Wonka
would go uncounted. The source
also commented that Best Foods' in
telligence agency, Infoplan, had
spread a spy network over the cam
pus, and that anyone sympathetic to
Miss Wonka's cause should watch
for certified home economists lurk
