# Four More Hopefuls Vie For ASSU Presidency
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Four more candidates filed late
yesterday in a last minute rush to
qualify for the ASSU presidential
primary May 3 and 4. One candidate,
Jon .Reider, withdrew his candidacy.
Late filings brought the number of
Senior Class President candidates to

seven. There are also seven candi
dates for NSA representative. Bill
Berry, ASSU Election's Commission
er, reported only two petitions have
been received for the five offices of
the AWS and the WRA. He has ex

tended the petition deadline for these
offices to Friday.
ASSU Presidential hopefuls who
announced their candidacies yester
day were Peter Lyman, a graduate
student in Political Science, Johnie
Scott, a sophomore in Alpha Dleta
Phi, Mark Schumacher, a Wilbur
freshman, and J. D. Jennings, a law
student. Berry reported that Jennings
had filed without a vice-presidential
candidate.
Lyman - Massarenti
Lyman was the only one of the
four new candidates to release a plat
form last night. In a statement, he
and his running mate, Cesare Massa
renti, a graduate student in sociology,
made plans to release four "white
papers" concerning campaign issues.
The Study of Education, undergrad
uate education, residences, and the
ASSU will be covered by these "white
papers."
Lyman, a teaching assistant in Po
litical Science 20, attended Stanford
as an undergraduate in philosophy,
received his masters from Berkeley,
and now is in the Ph.D. program in
Political Science. He is a tutor in the
Grove Project.
Massarenti is an Italian and for
four years was head of the union of
students at the University of Milan.
Community of Scholars
Lyman and Massarenti's statement
placed great emphasis on student
faculty cooperation in seeking "the
purpose of the University . . . educa
tion." Later Lyman said, "I'm run
ning to mobilize the community of
scholars to take over the whole ques
tion of how to recreate the univer
sity. I think these are questions the
whole university has to speak to."
"I think the faculty hasn't taken
its proper place in the decision-mak

ing in the University," says Lyman.
He criticized David Harris for "de
fining students too much as a sep
arate identity," and not enough as a
part of the whole community.
The campaign manager for Lyman
and Massarenti is Christopher Harte,
who yesterday resigned his post as
Managing Editor of The Daily.
Reider Withdraws
Candidate Jon Reider, who had
Sunday announced his candidacy for
ASSU President, yesterday withdrew
his petition. In a letter to The Daily,
he said: "I urge all those who have
promised to support me to support
Peter Lyman instead. He will be here
next year." Reider and Kugelmass
had earlier promised to provide lead
ership for the ASSU from London
and Boston where they will be attend
ing school next year.
Confusion arose after the filing
deadline yesterday after it was dis
covered that one candidate for the
ASSU Presidency and two for Senior
Class President had filed without vice
presidential running mates. Bill Berry
has not yet made a ruling on their eli
giblity for the primary next week.
No petitions were received for AWS
Vice-President, WRA President, or
WRA Secretary. Sue Heinberg of
Durand filed for AWS President and
Margaret Lindstrom of Florence
Moore Hall filed for WRA Vice-Presi
dent. Berry extended the deadline for

Community of Scholars
Lyman and Massarenti's statement
placed great emphasis on student
faculty cooperation in seeking "the
purpose of the University . . . educa
tion." Later Lyman said, "I'm run
ning to mobilize the community of
scholars to take over the whole ques
tion of how to recreate the univer
sity. I think these are questions the
whole university has to speak to."
"I think the faculty hasn't taken
its proper place in the decision-mak

ing in the University," says Lyman.
He criticized David Harris for "de
fining students too much as a sep
arate identity," and not enough as a
part of the whole community.
The campaign manager for Lyman
and Massarenti is Christopher Harte,
who yesterday resigned his post as
Managing Editor of The Daily.
