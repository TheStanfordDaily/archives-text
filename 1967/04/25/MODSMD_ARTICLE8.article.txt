# Rally Urges 'Responsible Debate'
## 
### SUE DONNELLY MICHAEL KUHL 
"If we don't start communicating
with each other, we will never be able
to debate with the United States gov
ernment," Prof. Brooks Otis of the
Classics Department asserted at a
rally in White Memorial Plaza yester
day afternoon.
"What I object to," Otis went on to
say, "is silence on one side and noisy
and intolerant allegations on the
other."
The rally, sponsored by Concerned
Students for Responsible Debate, was
presented, according to Roger Mag
nuson, to "resurrect the corpse of re
sponsible debate."
Magnuson said participation in the
rally wasn't "necessarily tantamount
to support of the war in Vietnam."
And to this extent, the speakers
weren't intended to represent a "mon
olithic ideological position."
Three Areas
One member of the organizing
group, Robert D. Clark, said the rally
had three areas of consideration. The
first of these was "Issue of debate on
campus." Secondly, a "response to the
accusations against Stanford Re
search Institute and others."
The final area of consideration was
"Vietnam and the world political sit
uation."
"The problem ordinary people, es
pecially university people, face in re

lation to the war is how to get legiti
mate action," Otis said.
"I am not for the war," he said at
the beginning of the rally. Later he
added that he would not "preclude
the possibility of unilateral with
drawal."
Insisting that debate is futile, if it
does not lead to action, Otis stressed
his belief that students should con
sider the questions, try to reach con
clusions, and then "make a deter
mined effort to communicate their
conclusions to Washington."
Hal Scott, a graduate student in
political science, told of the need for
"free and responsible debate" about
the war.
The New Left
Starting with the assumption "that
the war is a bad thing," Scott con
sidered problems of the New Left
and its rally last week.
The New Left, he said, tends to
speak in generalizations. He feels
that the New Left, like McCarthyism
in the 50's, believes in "guilt by as
sociation" without appreciating dif
ferent degrees of guilt.
Scott concluded that the New Left

needs tolerance to appreciate differ
ent moral postures.
Prof. Ivo Lederer of the History
Department said he felt moved to
speak against the nature and tone of
criticism of American policy in Viet
nam. Critics' words have a shrill, hys
terical tinge, he said, and they are
over-simplistic.
"Although I don't have full confi
dence in what America is doing in
Vietnam," Lederer said, "I have no
confidence in what the other side is
doing." He believes the activities of
the other side, such as Viet Cong ter
rorism in South Vietnam, must be
considered.
"Morailty is a complete and vary
ing force," Lederer continued. "It
assumes different purposes depend
ing on the vantage it is viewed from."
We must consider the moral conse
quences of U.S. withdrawal, he said.
Balance of Power
Dr. Milorad Drachkovitch of the
Hoover Institution deplored the ten
dency of the last several months to
present an image of the U.S. as "the
villain of the world." He cited two
reasons for continued U.S. commit

ment in Vietnam: "The people of
South Vietnam do not want to live
under Communism," he said, "and
the U.S. must stay in Vietnam" to
avoid other Vietnams elsewhere."
Danger of upset of the balance of
power in the world is reason enough
to warrant U.S. involvement in Viet
nam, according to Robert Walker, a
graduate student in history. He said
the peripheral nations bordering Com
munist China have all supported the
U.S. effort in Southeast Asia. They
are afraid that a Communist vic
tory will change the balance of
power and endanger their interests,
he added.
John Lucas, a senior in history,
concluded the rally, noting, "this has
not been a debate." In hopes of lead
ing to more discussion of the issue,
Lucas called for an "actual, formal
head-on debate" sometime in the fu
ture.
Barry Greenberg, when contacted
by The Daily, stated, "The group is
considering some sort of response
to the challenge." He added that thiÂ£
response "might not necessarily be
in the form of a debate."
