# Strict Laws Deter Conscientious Objection
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
The conscientious objector in our society
finds himself plagued by internal doubts and
' vternal pressures. After he formulates his
beliefs about war, he must decide whether
..iese beliefs conform to those required to ob
tain C.O. status and whether he will be able
to stand up to the ordeal of applying and ap
pealing.
Yet the number of classified conscientious
objectors today is rising at an unprecedented
i.ite.
How do these people decide that they are
conscientious objectors and how does the
Selective Service determine who is eligible
for C.O. status?
C.O. Make-up
The existence of the Vietnam conflict exerts
r significant influence upon the potential C.O.
"War creates the necessity of considering our
Selective Service laws," one C.O. remarked.
>'aced with the possibility of killing a >ther
human being, one must evaluate the r . ~lity
or lack of it in war.
However, as Mrs. Norma Crockett of Stan
ford's Counseling and Testing Center points
fit, "The individual's psychological make-up
determines how congruent the C.O. position
if to his personality and thus how responsive
he will be to beliefs of other C.O.'s as he
maikes his decision."
The attitude of the genuine C.O. is not

merely, "I will not fight." Rather it is, "All
human beings are brothers and therefore one
does not have the right to take the life of
another."
As Tom Sherman, a co-counselor stated,
"Once you've decided not to participate in war,
this does not free you from all responsibilities.
You still have a responsibility to your coun
try, and furthermore, a responsibility to ac
tively practice those religious beliefs upon
which you take your stand."
Deep Convictions
The sections of Form 150, the C.O. applica
tion, which require a description of the ap
plicant's actions and public expressions are
readily acceptable to some C.O.'s. Such ques
tions, nevertheless, pose difficulties for the
man who has only recently changed to an
anti-war position or not formulated any opin
ion at all.
Mrs. Donaldine Ellington, coordinator of
the San Mateo local draft board, said the
board is usually suspicious of the motives of
one who files as a C.O. after registration,
especially after he has been classified 1-A.
Does our society give C.O.'s a fair chance
to discover and express their beliefs?
"Not really," remarked Dave Ransom,
former president of the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam and a C.O. himself.
"The cultural bias is against the conscientious
objector. This is an obstacle to someone who

thinks like a C.O. but who's afraid to declare
himself as one."
Bob Lawrence, a C.O. counselor, says social
pressure against the C.O. arise from the mili
taristic tone of our culture.
Education can help to break down these
cultural barriers, but economic freedom is
also important. Lack of these elements seems
to explain the scarcity of uneducated or par
tially educated men of the lower classes
among the ranks of the C.O. movement.
As Paul Seaver, Assistant Professor of his
tory and a primary counselor of C.O.'s at
Stanford, commented, "Conscientious objec
tion has been a middle class phenomenon. Vir
tually no Negroes have become C.O.'s."
An individual must be, because of religious
training and belief, "conscientiously opposed
to participation of war in any form" to qual
ify for 1-A-O (non-combatant) status. One
must also be "opposed to participation in non
combatant training and service in the Armed
Forces" to qualify for l-O status, under which
one must perform "civilian work contribut
ing to the maintenance of the national health,
safety, or interest."
Official Policy
The original Selective Training and Service
Act of 1940 declared "Essentially political, so
ciological, or philosophical views or a merely
personal moral code" as insufficient grounds
for conscientious objection. Although the U.S.

Supreme Court liberalized the "test of be
lief" in the case of "U.S. vs. Seeger", it de
fined "belief" in negative terms, thus provid
ing no positive guidelines for the draft
boards.
Mrs. Ellington emphasized that each case
receives individual consideration, but that
the most frequent reason for rejection is the
lack of religious background in the applicant
and in his beliefs.
Furthermore, one may not, by Selective
Service law, conscientiously object to one
war if he could conceive of another war
which he might support.
As Seaver pointed out, "The criteria are
incompatible with the definition of 'conscien
tious': sincere, deeply felt. The question of
one war or all wars is irrelevant to this defi
nition. Yet under the current system, the
honest person who says, 'I can only judge
those situations that I am confronted with,
and I don't like the current war', doesn't
stand much of a chance."
Use of Force
Probably the most difficult question to
answer on the form is this one: "Under
what circumstances, if any, do you believe in
the use of force?" Many of the C.O.'s inter
viewed answered along the lines presented
in the Handbook for Conscientious Objectors,
a publication of the Central Committee for
Conscientious Objectors (CCCO).

This booklet distinguishes between violent
and non-violent force. While force merely
implies physical power exerted upon a per
son or object, violence suggests unfair or ex
cessive use of force, especially with anger.
The consicentious objector rejects the latter
out of love for and faith in his fellow man.
As one C.O. explained, "In today's world we
cannot defend ourselves against organized
military violence without heavy losses to
both sides. Therefore we must welcome our
enemies when they come. Then, should we
seek reforms, we can achieve them through
non-violent means."
Dissatisfaction
Are those students who have successfully
applied for C.O. status content with the sys
tem? Definitely not. As pointed out earlier,
they regard the system prejudiced against
the uneducated lower classes.
One C.O. pointed out that they lack the
tools of abstract reasoning which are es
sential in filling out the application. Another
noted that the concept of non-violence is it
self an abstraction and thus would be un
familiar to the uneducated.
In addition, they find the system prejudiced
against the man who does not decide that
he is a C.O. until he is inducted into the ser
vice. A later article will deal with this prob
lem.
