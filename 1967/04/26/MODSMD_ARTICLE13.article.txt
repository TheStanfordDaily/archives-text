## Who Has Baseball's Best? Daily Sports 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Who has the best baseball
team in the nation? This ques
tion remains unanswered as
number two ranked Stanford
and number one ranked USC
split a doubleheader in Los
Angeles Saturday.
Stanford won the opener 4-1
on a 3-hit, 13 strikeout perfor
mance by Sandy Vance. Vance,
who now sports a flawless 8-0
record for the season and has
yet to lose a game in his first
two seasons of college ball, re
ceived a comfortable cushion
when his mates struck for four
runs in the first two innings.
Bob Boone's two-run homer
in the first was the big blow.
The Trojans managed a run in

the first, but the tireless Vance,
despite eleven walks, white
washed them the rest of the
way.
Quick Revenge
USC got quick revenge in the
second game by jumping on
Stanford pitchers Daro Quiring
and Don Rose for a 6-2 victory.
The Indians could muster only
four hits off of Mike Adamson
and Irving House.
Tribe catcher Mike Scho
maker, who knocked two balls
up against the fence in the first
game, finally got one over it
to account for the Tribe's only
run.
Except for Schomaker, the
hitters were unimpressive. Lead
ing hitter Mark Marquess, for

example, went 0 for 5 for the
day and dropped his average
from .447 to .404.
Real Showdown
The real showdown for the
Pacific Eight title and probably
the NCAA title will be this
weekend at the Stanford Sunken

Diamond. On Friday, the In
dians (3-1 in the conference) will
meet USC (4-2) in the rubber
game of the series.
Then on Saturday, number
three ranking UCLA will put
its league-leading 6-0 mark on
the line in a doubleheader.
