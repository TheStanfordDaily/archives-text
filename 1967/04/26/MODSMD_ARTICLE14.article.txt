# Scuba Training, Club Give Fallen Surfers Diving Safety
## 
### JOHN LUBER 
Ever since a surfer slipped off
his board and discovered that
there was something to see be
low the wave as well as above,
SCUBA diving has been a devel
oping sport.
Self Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus was de
signed to give the diver maxi
mum freedom. This freedom to
explore and enjoy is, unfortu
nately, paralled by risk. The
risk is minimal, however, if the
diver receives proper instruction.

The Stanford Scuba Diving
Club, in conjunction with the
University Skin and Scuba Div
ing classes, is holding a final
preparation meeting tonight in
Tresidder at 7:15 for a dive Sat
urday in Monterey.

To accommodate the rising
demand for instruction, many
independent shops offer lessons.
Some of those shops do not pro
vide the degree of knowledge
necessary safe diving.
At Stanford, in response to
this inadequacy, there are two
forms of competent instruction:
the Skin and Scuba Diving class
and the Scuba Diving Club.
The diving club, newly re
vived after two quarters of quasi
existence, offers a new and ex
citing program of instruction

and activities. Among the or
ganizers of the new club is
Steve Webster, a NAUI (Nation
al Association of Underwater
Instructors) Instructor.
Through the club, qualified
divers are able to participate in
group dives and advanced topic
discussion.
To the novice, the club offers
a chance for advanced instruc
tion in procedures and marine
biology: to the experienced
diver it offers an opportunity
to dive with a group, a plan, and

perhaps reduced rates.
The diving class, offered each
quarter, is Stanford's second ef
fort to improve diving safety
and fun. Instructors Jim Gaugh
ran, Jimmy Smith, and Steve
Webster offer a complete NAUI
course.
The course emphasizes the im
portance of understanding div
ing physics as well as equip
ment diving. Through vigorous
pool workouts and numerous
"skull sessions", the class pro
duces safe, alert divers.
