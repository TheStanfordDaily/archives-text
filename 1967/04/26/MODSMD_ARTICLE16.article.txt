# 'UCLA Eats' Shouts Prepare Tribe Crew
## 
### JOHN HOTSON 
Cries of "UCLA Eats" can be
heard out on the bay this week
as the Stanford crew prepares
to take on its most hated and
perhaps toughest opponent this
Friday.
UCLA, along with USC, will
have to cope with what prom
ises to be one of Stanford's best
crews in the annual Harback
Cup in Los Angeles.
From 1956 Stanford and
UCLA have taken turns domi

nating this race with several bit
ter encounters between the two
on and off the water.
Stanford's crew coach Will
Condon stated, "I've put to
gether my top varsity boat so
that we can really go after
UCLA." Anchoring this boat are
Bill Stump, John Stitt, Jim Mad
den and Tim Cowles who all
rowed in last year's varsity boat
and have never lost to the
Bruins.
Bob Thomas and Gayner Daw
son, two members of last year's
"frosh fearsome foursome," oc
cupy two more seats. Russ Bar
to and John Hotson hold down
the last two positions with John
Reider, ex-future ASSU presi
dent, as coxswain.
Stanford's intense dislike of
UCLA can be traced to two
factors: 1. The Bruin's enor
mous financial support of their
crew, and 2. "Cocky" Bisset —
UCLA's coach who has no great
love of Stanford either.
According to Condon UCLA
is also getting quite "keyed" as
they hope to out-power the
smaller Stanford team. Stanford
in return is relying mainly on
conditioning and skill to out
drive the Bruins.
