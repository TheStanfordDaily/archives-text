# Anti-Draft Union Seeks Joint Effort In Bay Area
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
"Not all 170 of us are martyrs. We
don't want to spend five years in pris
on," according to Peter Ware at yes
terday's Anti-Draft Union press con
ference.
Ware and 13 others of the 169
signers of a half-page advertisement
appearing in The Daily yesterday,
called the conference to explain their
positions on the draft.
The advertisement was divided
into two parts. The first, "We will
not fight in Vietnam and further we
will not be conscripted into the mili
tary," was signed by 125. The other
44 supported a simpler statement,
"We will not fight in Vietnam."
Abdicate Humanity
The Anti-Draft Union, a smaller
group than those who signed the
above statements, had collected the
signatures. The Union "considers con
scription to be a means by which a
society forces its young men to ab
dicate humanity and believes that
young men should make an open
statement to the American nation of
that responsibility."
The students hope to place the ad
vertisement in the San Francisco
Chronicle also, according to David
Ransom. He emphasized that Anti-
Draft Union statements were not en
dorsed by all of the signators.
Gary Coutin, Secretary-Treasurer
of the group, said the organization
was formed due to a position the Stu
dents for a Democratic Society took
in January.
The reason for the simple state
ment "We will not fight in Vietnam,"
explained Coutin, is that the signers
hold many views. "Some are C.O.'s.

Some feel any conscription is wrong.
Divergent positions make it difficult
to formulate a position that many
can agree with."
Area-wide
"We hope to become Bay Area-wide
before we place our ad in the Chron
icle," added Coutin. The Anti-Draft
Union plans to meet Monday to dis
cuss ways of extending draft resis
tance, including furnishing informa
tion to high school students and non
students. Letters have been mailed
to faculty members asking for finan
cial support for advertisements.
"If five or ten percent of the col
lege community refuses to fight in
Vietnam, then Congress will debate
the draft law when it comes up for
a change," Coutin said.
"I'd like to see Senator Hatfield's
volunteer army given serious consid
eration. I want Congress to consider
this change. I feel the Anti-Draft
Union might lead to getting rid of
the draft," he concluded.
John Saari, asked if he felt North
Vietnamese students had the same
right to protest as American stu
dents, replied, "This would be too
much to expect from the North Viet
namese government. They are oeing
aggressed against. The U.S. is the
aggressor."
Value Liberties
Holt Ruffin added, "North Vietna
mese students do not have the same
freedom of speech. We value the lib
erties that exist in this country. But
my concern is with the American
government. Therefore, we have the
greatest responsibility to speak out."
Bill Goldie explained that although
his sympathies lie with the North

Vietnamese, he would be unwilling
to fight for them. "I couldn't shoot
my own people," he said.
Gary Coutin said the Anti-Draft
Union was preparing to attack the
draft legally or otherwise. One legal
attack, he contended, might be made
on the grounds that compulsory mili
tary service is involuntary servitude,
and unconstitutional under the 13th
amendment.
Want To Go?
"Very, very, few young people want
to get drafted," Norman Brown said.
"I would guess eight percent of the
young people don't want to go."
He signed, he said, to set an ex
ample, to encourage others who dis
approve of the draft, but hold a defer
ment ,to take a stand. "If this coun
try is to be a democracy, one must
stand up," he said.
The 14 present agreed they were
willing to go to jail rather than be
drafted. Some hoped to avoid jail
through conscientious objector status.
"I've applied for C.O. status," Ware
said. '"But some local boards make it
difficult to get C.O. status. One has
to prove one has been a religious
fanatic since age three."
Ware felt going to Canada to es
cape the draft would command less
respect than going to jail. Asked why
he did not burn a draft card, he ex
plained his purpose was to make a
concerted effort to bring the draft to
an end. "A lot of us feel burning a
draft card is not the most effective
way."
Leonard Siegel noted that three of
those who signed the ad are classified
1-A by Selective Service. Others on
the list are 2-S or hold C.O. status.
