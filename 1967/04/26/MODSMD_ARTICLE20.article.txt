### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The hard hitting Stanford
baseball team backed up Don
Rose's shut out performance
with 7 runs to thump San Jose
State yesterday, 7-0.
The Indians hit a home run,
a triple and threw in a couple
of doubles for good measure as
they knocked the Spartan pitch
ing staff for a loop.
Rose went all the way on the
mound allowing the Spartans
only two hits. He was never in
any serious difficulties.
Stanford hit the score column
in the first inning on two dou
bles and a single. Frank Duffy
doubled, Mark Marquess dou

bled him home, Jeff Rohlflng
walked, and a bloop single by
Mike Schomaker scored two
more runs.
Ron Shotts blasted a home
run to left center in the fourth
with two men aboard to In
crease Stanford's lead to 6-0.
A triple by Rohlfing figured
in the final Indian tally. It was
the icing on the cake.
batteries for Stanford:
Rose and Schomaker, Edie (6)
