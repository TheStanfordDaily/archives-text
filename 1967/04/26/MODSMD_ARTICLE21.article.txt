## Student Protest Shows National Conscience 
### Senator J. William Fulbright 
(This is the third of four articles
taken from the chapter titled,
"The Citizen and the Univers
ity" from"THE ARROGANCE
OF POWER" by Senator J.
William Fulbright.)

The wisdom and productivity
of the protest movement of stu
dents, professors, clergy, and
others may well be questioned,
but their courage, decency, and
patriotism cannot be doubted.
At the very least the student
protest movement of the sixties
is a moral and intellectual im
provement on the panty raids
of the fifties. In fact it is a great
deal more: it is an expression
of the national conscience and
a manifestation of traditional
American idealism.
As one university publication
characterized it, the "new radi
cal" movement "is not shallow
and sophomoric, it is not based
on the traditional formula of
generational defiance, and it is
not the result of an infusion of
foreign ideologies. It is based in
stead on personal disenchant
ment and the feeling of these
radicals that they must repudi
ate a corrupted vision of society
and replace it with a purer one."
No student generation in rec
ent history has faced both
brighter lifetime possibilities
and great short-term uncertain
ties than the present one. The
bright possibilities are those af
forded by a prosperous and dy
namic America; the uncertain
ties are those of a cruel and
costly war in Asia, a war which
has already taken thousands of
American lives, a war whose
end is not in sight, a war which
may indeed grow larger in scale
and destructiveness.
Rewards Of War
The central issue in the de
bate here at home—the issue on
which all other questions turn —
is whether the sacrifices im
posed on the present generation
of young Americans are justi
fied by the stakes cf the war,
whether the diversion of hun
dreds of thousands of our young
men from their homes and jobs
and families will yield rewards
of freedom and security com
mensurate with their sacrifices.
It is one of life's injustices
that young men must fight the
wars that older men begin. To
a great extent, therefore, the
lives of the present student gen
eration turn on the wisdom and
judgment of the men of an older
generation to whom the people
have entrusted political power.
Surely, considering what they
themselves have at stake it is
not improper for young people
to question the wisdom and
judgment of the makers of our
foreign policy.
Surely it is the right of citi-

Zens in a democracy, especially
citizens of military age, to ascer
tain that the great decisions of
war and peace are made with
care and deliberation. The call
ing of public men to account
unquestionably adds to their
burdens, but the convenience of
policy-makers is not sufficient
reason for the shutting down of
public discussion.
Use Of Power
The responsibilities of high
office are burdensome indeed
but they are borne, let it be
remembered, by men who ac
tively sought or freely accepted
them, men who accepted not
only the obligation to use power
but the obligation to account for
its use as well.
When former Press Secretary
Bill Moyers reported with re
spect to the Vietnam protests
the President's "surprise that
any one citizen would feel to
ward his country in a way that
is not consistent with the na
tional interest," he was denying
the existence of a question as to
where, in fact, the national in
terest lies.
The answer, one must con
cede, is elusive, but there is in
deed a question and it is a sign
of the good health of this na
tion that the question is being
widely and clearly posed.
With due respect for the hon
esty and patriotism of the stu
dent demonstrations, I would of
fer a word of caution to the
young people who have organ
ized and participated in them.
As most politicians discover
sooner or later, the most dra
matic expression of grievances
is not necessarily the most ef
fective.
Soft Words Carry Weight
That would seem to be espe
cially true in the United States,
a country easily and excessively
alarmed by expressions of dis
sent. We are, for better or
worse, an essentially conserva
tive society; in such a society
soft words are likely to carry
more weight than harsh words
and the mcst effective dissent is
dissent expressed in an orderly,
which is to say a conservative
manner.
For these reasons such direct
action as the burning of draft
cards probably does more to re
tard than to advance the views
of those who take such action.
The burning of a draft card is
a symbolic act, really a form
of expression rather than of ac
tion, and it is stupid and vindic
tive to punish it as a crime.
But it is also an unwise act,
unwise because it is shocking
rather than persuasive to most
Americans and because it ex
poses the individual to personal
risk without political reward.
The student, like the politi

cian, must consider not only
how to say what he means but
also how to say it persuasively.
The answer, I think, is that to
speak persuasively one must
speak in the idiom of the society
in which one lives. The form of
protest that might be rewarding
in Paris or Rome, to say noth
ing of Saigon or Santo Domingo,
would be absolutely disastrous
in Washington.

The good order and democ
racy of our society therefore
depend on the keeping open of
these channels. As long as every
tendency of opinion can get a
full and respectful hearing from
the elected representatives of
the people, as long as the class
room from primary school to
graduate school is a place where
freedom of thought is wel
comed and encouraged, the

teach-ins and the draft-card
burnings and the demonstra
tions are unlikely to become the
principal forms of dissent in
America.
