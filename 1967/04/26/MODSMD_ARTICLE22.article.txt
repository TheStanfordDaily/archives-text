### 
HAMPTON, Va. (AP)—Hamp
ton Institute students greeted
"Black Power" advocate Stokely
Carmichael with foot-stomping
applause here yesterday, but for
an emotion-charged moment a
single protestor moved to center
stage.
The moment came when Car
michael, fiery leader of the Stu
dent Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, told the predomin
antly Negro audience the Col
lege's ROTC program was
"training you to be hired kill
ers."
Near the front of the audi
torium, a Negro ROTC student
jumped to his feet and shouted
angrily, "If my government told
me to, I would shoot you down.
I would shoot you down twice."
College officials tentatively
identified the protesting student
as Roger Smith, but declined to
say more. Amid noisy confusion,
a faculty member took the uni
formed student's arm and led
him out of the auditorium.
The faculty member, who
asked not to be identified, said
Smith told him he had had two
brothers killed in the Vietnam
war "and I just couldn't listen
to anything unpatriotic like
that."
Carmichael told the crowd at
Hampton Institute—a predomin
antly Negro college—that they
should refuse to be drafted.
"They can put you in uniform
and send you 8,000 miles to
shoot a man who ain't ever
called you 'nigger'," Carmichael
said. "Shoot up those yellow
people and they give you a
medal.'
Carmichael said he'd "rather

spend five years in jail than
serve this country in Vietnam,"
and said in prison "I could do
a real service. Most prisons are
filled with my black brothers. I
would organize them, and when
we got out, we could exercise
our black power."
