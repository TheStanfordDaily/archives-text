# American Ballet Theatre Offers 'Exquisite' Program
## 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
Now the American Ballet
Theatre is gone. They will be
remembered for Saturday
night's exquisite and delightful
performance of Tschaikovsky's
Swan Lake at the Opera House,
San Francisco. Their rather
patchy show at Stanford the
week-end before faded into insig
nificance beside it.
Everything about Swan Lake
is suggestive of the theater, the
music, the mime and the fairy
tale settings. David Blair of the
English Royal Ballet did the
choreography for the peasant
dance in Act I and the dancers,
who particularly excel in en
semble work, brought to the
opening a magical doll-like qual
ity. This effect was genuinely
marred only once: a male dancer
had become so completely out of
step that it didn't matter any
how.
Bruce Marks made a hand
some Prince and a poised part
ner for Toni Lander, the Swan
Princess. On a hunt, the Prince
discovers the Swan and is over
come by love for the Princess.
She is released after dark from
a spell cast upon her by an Evil
Sorcerer. Enamoured, they dance
a long and exquisite pas de

deux, in which Miss Lander con
fidently affirmed herself as
prima ballerina of the compan l .
Lander is a fast dancer but
still the music seemed to be
pushing her. The orchestra was
so bad, at times, that it even
elicited a chuckle or two from
the audience.
Nonetheless her interpretation
emerged clear and precise. The
accord between Marks and
Lander was deservedly applaud
ed and, as is often the case, in
spired them to even niccr work
together.
The slightly hysterical, niv
eous splendor of the petits bat
tements toward the end of the
pas de deux was carefully imi
tated by the four cygnets. With
incisive, sensitive head move
ments, one soon forgot how
small these dancers really are
in comparison with the long,
stretched out look of the Royal
Ballerinas.
Dawn approaches and Odette
is compelled to return to her
guise as Swan. The stage of the
Opera House is transformed
into the Great Hall of the palace
and the Prince is asked to
choose a Princess. The colorful
Birthday Ball was punctuated
by sprightly Russian, Spanish

and Italian dances. Jeanne Ar
min, who danced so well at Stan
ford a week earlier, appeared in
the Neapolitan number revised
by Blair. Once again she demon
strated her flair and versatility.
Unwilling to decide for love
of his lost Odette, the Prince
mimes his despair. A powerful
Baron arrives, introducing his
daughter Odile, disguised as
Odette. Lander, in this double
role, and Marks displayed their
longing for each other and their
virtuosity to the audience.
In the "Black Swan Pas de
Deux" Lander's Odile lacked suf
ficient depth and she danced
quickly, trying to be seductive;
because she got carried away,
she contrived to steal the show.
All of San Francisco turned
out for this gala performance.
Even Nijinsky, who now rarely
leaves his home, was present.
The great dancer, in the com
pany of his grand niece, was
seen in his box, following every
step of the mortal novitiates
with his heart. Now pale and
old, he seemed to summon up
the ghost of his own immortal
roles from the past.
It was a big show and there
was a great feeling of joy.
"Beautiful, beautiful," everyone
was saying, and it was true.

opening a magical doll-like qual
ity. This effect was genuinely
marred only once: a male dancer
had become so completely out of
step that it didn't matter any
how.
Bruce Marks made a hand
some Prince and a poised part
ner for Toni Lander, the Swan
Princess. On a hunt, the Prince
discovers the Swan and is over
come by love for the Princess.
She is released after dark from
a spell cast upon her by an Evil
Sorcerer. Enamoured, they dance
a long and exquisite pas de

deux, in which Miss Lander con
fidently affirmed herself as
prima ballerina of the compan l .
Lander is a fast dancer but
still the music seemed to be
pushing her. The orchestra was
so bad, at times, that it even
elicited a chuckle or two from
the audience.
Nonetheless her interpretation
emerged clear and precise. The
accord between Marks and
Lander was deservedly applaud
ed and, as is often the case, in
spired them to even niccr work
together.
The slightly hysterical, niv
eous splendor of the petits bat
tements toward the end of the
pas de deux was carefully imi
tated by the four cygnets. With
incisive, sensitive head move
ments, one soon forgot how
small these dancers really are
in comparison with the long,
stretched out look of the Royal
Ballerinas.
Dawn approaches and Odette
is compelled to return to her
guise as Swan. The stage of the
Opera House is transformed
into the Great Hall of the palace
and the Prince is asked to
choose a Princess. The colorful
Birthday Ball was punctuated
by sprightly Russian, Spanish

and Italian dances. Jeanne Ar
min, who danced so well at Stan
ford a week earlier, appeared in
the Neapolitan number revised
by Blair. Once again she demon
strated her flair and versatility.
Unwilling to decide for love
of his lost Odette, the Prince
mimes his despair. A powerful
Baron arrives, introducing his
daughter Odile, disguised as
Odette. Lander, in this double
role, and Marks displayed their
longing for each other and their
virtuosity to the audience.
In the "Black Swan Pas de
Deux" Lander's Odile lacked suf
ficient depth and she danced
quickly, trying to be seductive;
because she got carried away,
she contrived to steal the show.
All of San Francisco turned
out for this gala performance.
Even Nijinsky, who now rarely
leaves his home, was present.
The great dancer, in the com
pany of his grand niece, was
seen in his box, following every
step of the mortal novitiates
with his heart. Now pale and
old, he seemed to summon up
the ghost of his own immortal
roles from the past.
It was a big show and there
was a great feeling of joy.
"Beautiful, beautiful," everyone
was saying, and it was true.
Now the American Ballet
Theatre is gone. They will be
remembered for Saturday
night's exquisite and delightful
performance of Tschaikovsky's
Swan Lake at the Opera House,
San Francisco. Their rather
patchy show at Stanford the
week-end before faded into insig
nificance beside it.
Everything about Swan Lake
is suggestive of the theater, the
music, the mime and the fairy
tale settings. David Blair of the
English Royal Ballet did the
choreography for the peasant
dance in Act I and the dancers,
who particularly excel in en
semble work, brought to the
opening a magical doll-like qual
ity. This effect was genuinely
