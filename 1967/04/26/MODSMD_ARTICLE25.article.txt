## Pass-Fail And The Merit System 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Eric Kohler's letter (April 24)
reveals a lack of understanding
of one of the basic purposes of
a pass-fail grading system:
namely, to create an atmosphere
in which rewards and punish
ments in the form of grades are
not the primary motivation for
the student, but rather a desire
to learn. In contrast to this goal,
Mr. Kohler devotes the major
part of his letter to problems
of rewarding and penalizing stu
dents. For example, he com
plains that it would be "grossly
unfair" to other members of the
class to pass someone who fails
to follow instructions on an ex
amination (presumably because
this would deprive them of be
ing rewarded by being desig
nated as superior). On the other
hand, he continues, it would also
be unfair to fail this person, be
cause this "exaggerates the
penalty which one normally ap
plies in such cases."
Only experimentation will tell
us to what extent grades can
be eliminated from an educa
tional system and what type of
educational system is feasible
without any rewards and pun
ishments. But it is disappointing
to see a member of the teaching
staff who, when given an op
portunity to be part of such an
experiment, is seemingly more
concerned with the petty prob
lems of effectively assigning
grades than with the possibili
ties of a system which does not
rely on grades to motivate learn
ing.

• Hard Facts
Editor, The Daily:
Nobody would agree more en
thusiastically with Professor
Cohn's observation in The Daily

that brick paving is more beau
tiful than asphalt than Thomas
Church, landscape architect for
Stanford, and those of us who
are concerned with the devel
opment of Stanford grounds.
The hard fact of beauty: brick
costs ten times more than as
phalt.
Even so, a generous donor
could buy a brick paved plaza
memorializing his name for a
square foot cost less than a
tenth of that of a building.

• Pride and Prejudice?
Editor, The Daily:
The Committee of Fifteen has
recommended that LASSU put
the Honor Code's future on the
spring ballot. Last week a
column in The Daily recom
mended that action be taken
against the "We Accuse" poster
bearers on the basis that they
were violating the Fundamental
Standard. These represent eva
sion of the basic problem, the
changing attitudes toward in
dividual responsibilities at Stan
ford. Having just returned to
Stanford after three years, I am
appalled by the loss of pride in
the University by some of the
student body. In the past there
was no problem of "Third Per
son Responsibility" and the
Honor Code. The code was an
expression by the students that
they wanted and would observe
self-imposed standards of inte
grity. Similarly, while the Ex
periment may criticize silence
by institutions on the war, the
specific accusations imply doubt
about Stanford's total value.
The pride extends also to pers
onal conduct and appearance. I
have no objection to men wear
ing long hair, but CARE is
going to have to distribute relief

combs soon. There was also a
time when wearing pants on
Quad was a privilege of the
men.
Ultimately, this is a question
of the ideals of personal respon
sibility and group pride which
have long symbolized Stanford
students. The University has up
held the principles of intellectual
freedom because they were not
abused. Within the academic
community any opinion could
be discussed but the total pic
ture presented to the outside
world was one of responsible
adults in pursuit of truth. When

this picture is obscured by a few
who do not respect the image,
the potential influence of
thought originating at Stanford
is lessened.
I propose therefore that
rather than isolating the prob
lems of the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard that
there be discussion of the prin
ciples behind them. Perhaps the
student body really would rath
er have proctored exams — per
sonally I like the lawn in front
of the library.
