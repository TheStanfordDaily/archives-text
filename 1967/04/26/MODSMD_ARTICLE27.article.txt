# Phi Delt Suspension Resulted In Changed Attitudes And Re-Evaluation Of Goals

(Editor's Note: Following a
conference with a member of
Phi Delta Theta, The Daily ask
ed that a letter be written in
defense of the group's activities
since their suspension last No
vember.)
Editor, The Daily:
Like many of the issues that
confront the Stanford commun
ity, the Phi Delt case has made
it evident that many of those
who are the most outspoken and
vehement about these matters
are often those who know the
least about them. Consequently,
the people who attempt to be
objective and fair are over
whelmed by a barrage of false
rumors and distorted facts. How
many of those who have mal
igned and chastized the Phi Delt
fraternity have had any per
sonal contact or social inter
action with its members? Very
few. The answer to this ques
tion would seem to indicate that
a great deal of the abuse di
rected at the Phi Delts is un
justified.
It is unfortunate that some
people base their conclusions on
conjecture and prejudice but it
would serve little purpose to in
vestigate their motives; rather,
since much of the present critic
ism has gone beyond the point
of innocuous rumor and become
injurious, not only to the Phi
Delt organization but to the in
dividual members themselves, it
seems appropriate and neces
sary to offer an honest, coherent
appraisal of the Phi Delt situa
tion.
It would be untrue to claim
that the Inter-Frate/nity Board
had no justification for suspend
ing the fraternity. As all of the
members would admit, there
were several problems and de
ficiencies within the house be

fore the suspension occurred.
These problems existed not only
because of a minority of mem
bers who originally caused them
but also because the rest of the
members were much too toler
ant and permissive toward this
minority. As a result the organi
zation was continually jeopar
dized.
Reconstruction
This continual jeopardy cul
minated in a one year suspen
sion which was sparked by the
actions of a few at the Mills ex
change. Naturally the immedi
ate reaction of the members to
the suspension was one of bit
terness and resentment. But once
this attitude subsided the mem
bers committed themselves to
the task of rebuilding the chap
ter through constant re-evalua
tion of its goals and purposes
and the means for attaining
them. It is now evident that the
sobering effect of the suspension
has stimulated the members to
seek ways to improve house
scholarship, social standards,
and discipline.
The change of attitude by the
individual members is indicative
of their willingness to establish
constructive goals and to insure
that problems like those in the
past do not exist in the future.
The numerous proposals and
suggestions with regard to these
goals illustrates the progress
that has been made, but much
more progress is needed. The
present attitude and morale of
the members indicates that this
further progress will be accom
plished. The establishment of
the Steering Committee will aid
the house considerably in im
plementing new programs and
is regarded by the members as
a welcome opportunity to work
with faculty members and in

crease student-faculty relations
within the house.
Unfortunately much of the
progress that has taken place
since the suspension is not
really evident to the rest of the
Stanford community for the
simple reason that the members
are dispersed off campus and
have not had a chance to demon
strate as a group that revision
and re-evaluation have occurred.
We feel confident, however, that
when the chapter is reinstated,
it will become clear that the
Phi Delt house is one that will
benefit both the university and
the individual members. It will
become a fraternity that is
worthwhile and meaningful to
its members not only because
of the social cohesiveness that
is a part of most fraternities
but also by developing their po
tentials.
Condemnation Unjustified
With these goals in mind we
find it disappointing to see the
obstacles that are created
through malicious criticism.
Much of the condemnation
which arose at the time of the
suspension was justified, but the
present reprehension, which
leaves one with the impression
that all Phi Delts are depraved,
nefarious people, is not only fal
lacious but destructive and dam
aging to the present goals of its
members. Paradoxically the
same people who place so much
value and stress on individual
ism are often the same people
who are so prone to stereotype
Phi Delts or fraternity men in
general rather than to look to
the qualities and characteristics
of the individuals who make up
these groups.
We do not intend this article
to be a popular-support cam

paign for the reinstatement of a
fraternity. Likewise this column
is not intended to be a rebuttal
to the "uninformed." Rather,
this is a formulation of our pres
ent attitudes of which former
and present critics are ignorant.
These present attitudes are in
deed significant. The suspension
of Phi Delta Theta has resulted
in individual introspection and
an analysis of the former living
group. We readily admit to cer
tain follies which are now mat
ters of record. This admission,
however, is not merely of a
rhetorical nature.
In the past months we have
come to recognize certain com
munal qualities which are not
only desirable but necessary for
a living group to be a productive
entity, academically as well as
socially. It is with no little con
fidence that we perceive the fu
ture as a challenge. The chal
lenge is imposing but not in
superable. We would hope that a
confidence, if but for the oppor
tunity itself, is not solely ours.
We would not choose to leave
the impression that a future Phi
Delt fraternity would retain the
atmosphere of the group now
residing in the building. Cer
tainly this atmosphere should
respond to its gravitational at
traction, which will be elsewhere
in the future. We do not intend
to become merely a living group,
which de-emphasizes the social
aspects of an educational exper
ience. We will attempt to be
come an embodiment of an ec
lecticism of the two, without re
version to past transgressions,
without sacrifice of basic per
sonal beliefs.
