# The

## 'Hardening Of The Categories' 
### Barry Greenberg 
We are caught, once again, in
what I like to call "hardening
of the categories". I do not
know if the process is inevit
able, but its lovely simplicity is
very seductive. I am referring
to the tendency of just about
everyone, including myself, to
reduce extremely complex con
crete situations to extremely
simplistic abstract generaliza
tions, often to a mere term

which glosses over a multitude
of actual differences.
There is, I think, a good his
torical and sociological explana
tion for this tendency to reduce
and simplify, and it has some
thing to do with what Karl
Marx called "false conscious
ness." I cannot go here into the
process itself, but I would like
to offer one recent and local
example of the kind of think
ing which this process involves.
In recent weeks The Experi
ment has been strongly critcized
for its political activities, parti
cularly for the first two issues
of our newspaper, Resistance,
and for the "We Accuse" post
ers. The criticism has come, it
seems to me, from two basic
sources. One is from individuals
who quite clearly have never
been too happy about The Ex
periment, and who, with the
support of the Stanford Area
Young Republicans, were quick
to use Resistance and the post
ers as justification for a peti
tion which argues that since
The Experiment clearly is a po
litical, sectarian organization
representing a particular ideolo
gical viewpoint, it deserves no
more university space for its
activities than any other politi
cal organization.
Distortion
To argue on the basis of two
specific political activities that
The Experiment is simply a po
litical organization is, as any
one either in or familiar with
The Experiment knows, a gross
distortion of the truth. Given
the critics' own ideological and
political orientation, such dis
tortion is of course to be ex
pected, for it is in the very na
ture of such an orientation —
which is basically a conservative
and reactionary one — to distort
and simplify, to reduce what
is actually much more concrete
and complex than the ideologi
cal categories to the categories
themselves.
The second basic source of
criticism is from individuals
who, either as members or
friends of The Experiment, are
genuinely and constructively
concerned about the relationship
of The Experiment's political ac
tivities to The Experiment as a
whole. They feel that the politi
cal activities may destroy the
value of The Experiment's edu
cational and cultural activities,
which are open to everyone re
gardless of his political beliefs.
Here we are involved with a
kind of simplifying which is
quite dissimilar and more diffi
cult to grasp than the first kind.
For if our conservative critics
tend to see political activity, as
they see communists, every
where, our more friendly and
liberal critics tend too readily to
separate the political from the
educational and cultural.
Interrelated
From a descriptive or analytic
viewpoint, it is of course pos
sible to distinguish between ed
ucation and political activity.
From a moral or valuational
viewpoint, however, educational
and political activity must be
understood as intimately and
inextricably related. It should
also be understood that the ma
jor reason for The Experiment's
existence is to serve as a chal
lenge to the academic commu
nity's increasing tendency to
divorce the question of educa
tion from the question of value,
which ultimately is the ques
tion on which political activity
is based.
One of the clearest signs, as
a matter of fact, of American
society's deterioration is the de
gree to which education has
come to be understood as a ma
terially useful possession rather

than as a matter of learning
for the purpose of making in
telligent and humane choices
about how we and others ought
to live.
As you can see, I am linking
the question of political activity
with the question of values, the
question of values with the
problem of choice, and the prob
lem of choice with what ought
to be central to education. View
ed from this perspective, the po
litical and the educational are
different but necessarily and in
tegrally related.
Synthesis
The Experiment is an attempt
to synthesize political, educa
tional, and cultural activities

into a community of concerned
and commited individuals; com
mited, however, not to a particu
lar ideology or set of dogmatic
political principles and assump
tions, as our conservative cri
tics would you have believe, but
to an honest and open search
for possible alternative ways of
living, both with ourselves and
with others.
I hope all Experiment mem
bers who are concerned about
The Experiment's political acti
vities and, more generally, with
its future, will come to the
meeting today at 4:15 p.m. in
The Experiment building, when
we will discuss these and other
matters more fully.
