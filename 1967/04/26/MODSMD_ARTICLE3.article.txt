# Attorneys To Argue 'Judgment' In Mock Libel Trial Next Week
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Critics of the Warren Report on
the assassination of President Ken
r ?dy will be the subject of public dis
cussion here again next week.
Author Mark Lane (Rush to Judg
ment) and Associate Professor of
Law John Kaplan will argue their
cases in a "hypothetical law suit". The
hj'pothesis is that Kaplan said Lane's
book is a "tissue of deliberate distor
tion" and that Lane is suing him for
lit^el.
Lane's book criticized the Warren
Commission for its methods and con
clusions concerning the assassination.
In a recent article in The American
Scholar, Kaplan wrote that "nowhere
near a tenth of Lane's assertions and
implication stand up to careful scrut
iny."
The rules of the "debate" call for
Lane and Kaplan each to give a five
minute opening statement. Then each
will be allowed 45 minutes to cross
e (amine the other. A judge, yet to be
selected by The Daily, will supervise
t/"> proceedings. The confrontation
is scheduled for 2:15 p.m., Tuesday
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Restrictive Rules
Lane called the rules proposed by
Kaplan "preposterous and so unduly
restrictive that they will prevent a
112 .11 exploration of the facts. Never
theless, since I have agreed to abide
by any rules which he suggested, the
rules are acceptable."
Lane continued, "One of the ob
j ctions made by Mr. Kaplan was
that I might offer new material which
he would be unprepared to rebutt.
/»,-cordingly I will present a full ana
lysis of his erroneous charges on the
day preceding the debate, so that he
may become fully familiar with my
oblections long before the debate be
gLis." Lane will speak separately Mon
day night at 7:30 in the Large Lounge
of Tresidder Union.
A'n a public statement, Kaplan said,
"The forum Mr. Lane and I agreed
to is one which is perhaps less effec
tive in bringing out a broad range of
unpleasant charges and general as-
Ss i'tions. Mr. Lane himself has com
mented on many occasions on the
virtues of cross-examination for re
v .aling sham.
"Besides, I won't deny that he
knows a great deal more about what
is in the Warren Commission testi
mony than I do."

The current controversy arose af
ter a statement published in The
Daily last Wednesday in which Lane
challenged Kaplan to a debate "ad
dressed to the validity of the (War
ren) Commission's conclusions." Lane
said that Kaplan could "bring his
own moderator and his own rules."
Kaplan's immediate reply was "I'd
sooner enter a stinking match with
a skunk." He added he would wel
come a written reply to his article so
that the critics "cannot make up as
sertions faster than responsible schol
arship can answer them."
Accusation
In his article, Kaplan accused Lane
of five methods of distortion, includ
ing "rank distortion of witnesses'
testimony," the argument of only one
side of a particular point, the use of
himself as his own expert witness,
the "gross logical fallacy," and the
attacking of the Commission on
"points where he does not even dis
agree with its conclusions."
Kaplan called the attacks on the
Warren Commission a symptom of
"the hatred that the extreme left has
developed for Lyndon Johnson."
In reply to the charges of distor
tion, Lane said, "If I have used 'meth
ods of distortion,' Mr. Kaplan will be

free to demonstrate the fact at the de
bate. If, on the other hand, Mr. Kap
lan has demonstrated hysterical ser
vility to the establishment, I shall be
entitled to demonstrate that."
The confrontation between Kaplan
and lane will be sponsored by The
Daily.

may become fully familiar with my
oblections long before the debate be
gLis." Lane will speak separately Mon
day night at 7:30 in the Large Lounge
of Tresidder Union.
A'n a public statement, Kaplan said,
"The forum Mr. Lane and I agreed
to is one which is perhaps less effec
tive in bringing out a broad range of
unpleasant charges and general as-
Ss i'tions. Mr. Lane himself has com
mented on many occasions on the
virtues of cross-examination for re
v .aling sham.
"Besides, I won't deny that he
knows a great deal more about what
is in the Warren Commission testi
mony than I do."

The current controversy arose af
ter a statement published in The
Daily last Wednesday in which Lane
challenged Kaplan to a debate "ad
dressed to the validity of the (War
ren) Commission's conclusions." Lane
said that Kaplan could "bring his
own moderator and his own rules."
Kaplan's immediate reply was "I'd
sooner enter a stinking match with
a skunk." He added he would wel
come a written reply to his article so
that the critics "cannot make up as
sertions faster than responsible schol
arship can answer them."
Accusation
In his article, Kaplan accused Lane
of five methods of distortion, includ
ing "rank distortion of witnesses'
testimony," the argument of only one
side of a particular point, the use of
himself as his own expert witness,
the "gross logical fallacy," and the
attacking of the Commission on
"points where he does not even dis
agree with its conclusions."
Kaplan called the attacks on the
Warren Commission a symptom of
"the hatred that the extreme left has
developed for Lyndon Johnson."
In reply to the charges of distor
tion, Lane said, "If I have used 'meth
ods of distortion,' Mr. Kaplan will be

free to demonstrate the fact at the de
bate. If, on the other hand, Mr. Kap
lan has demonstrated hysterical ser
vility to the establishment, I shall be
entitled to demonstrate that."
The confrontation between Kaplan
and lane will be sponsored by The
Daily.
Critics of the Warren Report on
the assassination of President Ken
r ?dy will be the subject of public dis
cussion here again next week.
Author Mark Lane (Rush to Judg
ment) and Associate Professor of
Law John Kaplan will argue their
cases in a "hypothetical law suit". The
hj'pothesis is that Kaplan said Lane's
book is a "tissue of deliberate distor
tion" and that Lane is suing him for
lit^el.
Lane's book criticized the Warren
Commission for its methods and con
clusions concerning the assassination.
In a recent article in The American
Scholar, Kaplan wrote that "nowhere
near a tenth of Lane's assertions and
implication stand up to careful scrut
iny."
The rules of the "debate" call for
Lane and Kaplan each to give a five
minute opening statement. Then each
will be allowed 45 minutes to cross
e (amine the other. A judge, yet to be
selected by The Daily, will supervise
t/"> proceedings. The confrontation
is scheduled for 2:15 p.m., Tuesday
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Restrictive Rules
Lane called the rules proposed by
Kaplan "preposterous and so unduly
restrictive that they will prevent a
112 .11 exploration of the facts. Never
theless, since I have agreed to abide
by any rules which he suggested, the
rules are acceptable."
Lane continued, "One of the ob
j ctions made by Mr. Kaplan was
that I might offer new material which
he would be unprepared to rebutt.
/»,-cordingly I will present a full ana
lysis of his erroneous charges on the
day preceding the debate, so that he
may become fully familiar with my
