# Frosh ASSU Candidates Withdraw
## 
### 
Mark Schumacher and Richard Bo
gart, freshmen candidates for ASSU
President and Vice-President, last
night withdrew their petitions for
nomination.
"We don't have the time to devote
to a conscientious campaign," said
Schumacher. "We've reconsidered and
withdrawn."
In other election developments,
Elections Commissioner Bill Berry
still has not ruled on the eligiblity of
J. D. Jennings to run for ASSU Pres
ident without a running mate. Jen
nings could not be reached by either
Berry or The Daily. Berry also waited
to rule on the candidacy of two who
filed without running mates for senior
class president.
Johnie Scott, who had not announc

ed any program until yesterday in
his campaign for ASSU President, is
sued a challenge for students "to
participate in a dialogue unbounded
by the quarter, the ASSU, or the Uni
versity."
Scott, a sophomore in Alpha Delta
Phi, is a creative writing major, and
has published works in Harpers,
Time, and Western Review. He has
attended Harvard and East Los Ange
les Junior College. Scott says his hope
is to provide "the link between Ad
ministration and student" and "to
stimulate and direct the growing so
cial consciousness at Stanford."
Scott's running mate is Ralph Bax
ter, a junior history major and mem
ber of Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
He is also assistant head of the Stu

dent Police, and was president of his
freshman house.
Scott and Baxter claim to repre
sent "those who have voiced concern
over the individual's place in social
affairs, who have found education ac
complished only through the experi
ence of personal involvement and who
have accepted the responsibilities in
volvement implies.
Lyman at Branner
The only candidate to campaign
actively yesterday was Peter Lyman,
who spoke in Branner after dinner.
He concentrated his remarks on the
Study of Education. He called for a
permanent Education Committee un
der the ASSU, open meetings of the
SES on the legislative model of Con
gress, the publication of all proceed
ings and findings, referendums of
students and faculty on all decisions
of the SES, and the right to sub
poena for the study.
Lyman placed great emphasis on
the impact of the Study on the year

ahead. "We will create an environ
ment which will drag the University
into becoming a real university," he
said. He had earlier defined the "real
"University" as consisting "of those
who participate in education, the stu
dents and faculty." "Education is
found in the close relationship of two
or more people," he told the group
in Branner last night,
Fraternal or Coed?
In speaking of residences, he said
he believed the fraternities have the
greatest independa .ee from Univer
sity control of any residence group
and the most opportunities for de
velopment. However, he claimed co
education rather than fraternal liv
ing is the most natural and desirable
mode of life.
In the question period, he was cri
tical of the part the alumni play in
the decision making of the University.
"If I were writing my ideas of the
University, I would write out the
alumni."

In other election developments,
Elections Commissioner Bill Berry
still has not ruled on the eligiblity of
J. D. Jennings to run for ASSU Pres
ident without a running mate. Jen
nings could not be reached by either
Berry or The Daily. Berry also waited
to rule on the candidacy of two who
filed without running mates for senior
class president.
Johnie Scott, who had not announc

ed any program until yesterday in
his campaign for ASSU President, is
sued a challenge for students "to
participate in a dialogue unbounded
by the quarter, the ASSU, or the Uni
versity."
Scott, a sophomore in Alpha Delta
Phi, is a creative writing major, and
has published works in Harpers,
Time, and Western Review. He has
attended Harvard and East Los Ange
les Junior College. Scott says his hope
is to provide "the link between Ad
ministration and student" and "to
stimulate and direct the growing so
cial consciousness at Stanford."
Scott's running mate is Ralph Bax
ter, a junior history major and mem
ber of Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
He is also assistant head of the Stu

dent Police, and was president of his
freshman house.
Scott and Baxter claim to repre
sent "those who have voiced concern
over the individual's place in social
affairs, who have found education ac
complished only through the experi
ence of personal involvement and who
have accepted the responsibilities in
volvement implies.
Lyman at Branner
The only candidate to campaign
actively yesterday was Peter Lyman,
who spoke in Branner after dinner.
He concentrated his remarks on the
Study of Education. He called for a
permanent Education Committee un
der the ASSU, open meetings of the
SES on the legislative model of Con
gress, the publication of all proceed
ings and findings, referendums of
students and faculty on all decisions
of the SES, and the right to sub
poena for the study.
Lyman placed great emphasis on
the impact of the Study on the year

ahead. "We will create an environ
ment which will drag the University
into becoming a real university," he
said. He had earlier defined the "real
"University" as consisting "of those
who participate in education, the stu
dents and faculty." "Education is
found in the close relationship of two
or more people," he told the group
in Branner last night,
Fraternal or Coed?
In speaking of residences, he said
he believed the fraternities have the
greatest independa .ee from Univer
sity control of any residence group
and the most opportunities for de
velopment. However, he claimed co
education rather than fraternal liv
ing is the most natural and desirable
mode of life.
In the question period, he was cri
tical of the part the alumni play in
the decision making of the University.
"If I were writing my ideas of the
University, I would write out the
alumni."
Mark Schumacher and Richard Bo
gart, freshmen candidates for ASSU
President and Vice-President, last
night withdrew their petitions for
nomination.
"We don't have the time to devote
to a conscientious campaign," said
Schumacher. "We've reconsidered and
withdrawn."
