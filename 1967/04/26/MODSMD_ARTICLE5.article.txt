# Toynbee Fears Depersonalization

### SUE DONNELLY 
Technology itself is morally neu
tral, but it can have alternative psy
chological effects, asserted Prof. Ar
nold Toynbee, distinguished British
historian, in a Memorial Auditorium
speech last night.
Technology annihilates distance,
giving us contact with more people,
Toynbee continued. But most of these
contacts are impersonal, he said. We
still have the same number of per
son (family and friend) relationships.
"Depersonalization of human be
ings is morally dangerous," Toyn
bee said. We can label aliens as "Com
munists," "heretics," or "natives,"
and we can enslave them or put them
on reservations because they are im
personal to us, he said.
But the same technology which has
minimized distances has also given
us the means to bridge the gulf be
tween people, Toynbee said, "but we
must make the moral effort to do

so." He pointed out that modern com
munications made President Ken
nedy and Pope John XXIII personal
and meaningful to hundreds of mil
lions of people.
To have a really human relation
with other human beings, Toynbee
said, we need mutual confidence. This
depends both on mutual acquaintance
and on mutual understanding. And
for understanding we need "a com
mon m r ral outlook — a degree of
likeness in feelings about good and
evil."
The world needs something strong
enough to bring it together in a hu
man family, Toynbee asserted. He
cited intermarriage and the Muslim
religion as forces contributing to free
dom from racial prejudice in some
parts of the world.
Intelligentsia has had widespread
and to some extent, unifying influ
ence, Toynbee said. "Intelligentsia,"
which is of Russian origin, came into

existence as a product of Western
dominance of the world. The non-
Western nations had to adapt them
selves to the West and to come to
terms with it.
Because Western domination will
probably be temporary, Toynbee said,
we should ask what will ensue. He
suggested that the West may some
day adopt Russian and Chinese ways
of life.
Toynbee called the Peace Corps "a
splendid organization for making a
human family." He added that al
though volunteers serve for a short
time they would be "mediators for
life" between the U.S. and the coun
try in which they work.
We should decide what form and
degree of unification we are aiming
for, Toynbee said. He feels that peo
ple need common cultural ground,
but not uniformity. "Allegiance to re
ligion and nation should be para
mount but not conclusive," he said.

us the means to bridge the gulf be
tween people, Toynbee said, "but we
must make the moral effort to do

so." He pointed out that modern com
munications made President Ken
nedy and Pope John XXIII personal
and meaningful to hundreds of mil
lions of people.
To have a really human relation
with other human beings, Toynbee
said, we need mutual confidence. This
depends both on mutual acquaintance
and on mutual understanding. And
for understanding we need "a com
mon m r ral outlook — a degree of
likeness in feelings about good and
evil."
The world needs something strong
enough to bring it together in a hu
man family, Toynbee asserted. He
cited intermarriage and the Muslim
religion as forces contributing to free
dom from racial prejudice in some
parts of the world.
Intelligentsia has had widespread
and to some extent, unifying influ
ence, Toynbee said. "Intelligentsia,"
which is of Russian origin, came into

existence as a product of Western
dominance of the world. The non-
Western nations had to adapt them
selves to the West and to come to
terms with it.
Because Western domination will
probably be temporary, Toynbee said,
we should ask what will ensue. He
suggested that the West may some
day adopt Russian and Chinese ways
of life.
Toynbee called the Peace Corps "a
splendid organization for making a
human family." He added that al
though volunteers serve for a short
time they would be "mediators for
life" between the U.S. and the coun
try in which they work.
We should decide what form and
degree of unification we are aiming
for, Toynbee said. He feels that peo
ple need common cultural ground,
but not uniformity. "Allegiance to re
ligion and nation should be para
mount but not conclusive," he said.
Technology itself is morally neu
tral, but it can have alternative psy
chological effects, asserted Prof. Ar
nold Toynbee, distinguished British
historian, in a Memorial Auditorium
speech last night.
Technology annihilates distance,
giving us contact with more people,
Toynbee continued. But most of these
contacts are impersonal, he said. We
still have the same number of per
son (family and friend) relationships.
"Depersonalization of human be
ings is morally dangerous," Toyn
bee said. We can label aliens as "Com
munists," "heretics," or "natives,"
and we can enslave them or put them
on reservations because they are im
personal to us, he said.
But the same technology which has
minimized distances has also given
us the means to bridge the gulf be
tween people, Toynbee said, "but we
must make the moral effort to do

so." He pointed out that modern com
munications made President Ken
