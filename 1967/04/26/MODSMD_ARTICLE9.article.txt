# Controversy Divides Free U.
## 
### 
The Free University, like the
Holy Roman Empire, is neither
holy, nor Roman, nor an em
pire; neither, however, is it a
university, nor, in the most ob
vious sense, is it free. In fact,
whether it is (or should be) free
in any sense has been a matter
of considerable debate.
The kind of internal dispute
which recently wracked the Free
U. and led to the resignation of
its paid Coordinator has also
been a source of division at
many nf the other free univer
sities and experimental colleges
that have sprung up across the
country in the past two years.
The basic issue is this: how
free does a free university real
ly want to be? Does it want to
be be an open forum for all
points of view and offer courses
on any and all subjects which
anyone wishes to teach or take,
or does it regard itself as be
ing in the business of promoting
a particular ideology or political
posture?
Three weeks ago Georgia
Kelly resigned as Coordinator
of our local Free U., charging
that the course offerings were
becoming too mystical, too psy
chedelic, and that the organiza
tion's original purpose of pro
moting radical political action
had been largely lost.
Shift From Left
The Free U. has clearly moved
away from its early, predomi
nantly left orientation. The
cover of its spring quarter cata
log, bearing as it does a bloom
ing lotus, gives evidence of this
shift. Yet the change came not
from a change in ideology but
was simply a reflection of the
effect of demand on supply.
Looking, for example, at the
first Free U. catalog (Winter
1966) one finds that well over
half of the courses express a
Marxist political standpoint. But
there is a great deal of differ
ence between offering a course
and teaching one. In order to
teach a course one must have
people willing to take it, and
most of the political courses
had no one attending them at
all after a week or two.
There were, of course, some
exceptions. Roy Kepler began
a seminar on non-violence over
a year ago and it is still going

strong. Likewise, Vic Lovell's
course on American youth in
revolt was consistently success
ful, as were Barry Greenberg's
courses on phenomenology and
existentialism.
Courses on mysticism and psy
chedelics have proved popular,
and as a result have tended to
continue and proliferate.
Political Courses
Political courses have also
been successful when they are
not doctrinaire but respond to
current interests. John Saari
and Alan Schmidt lead courses
on the new radicals and Ameri
can foreign policy. Anatole An
ton and A. Videl-Madjer have
put together a course on politi
cal struggle which discusses,
among other things, Robin Hood,
the Mafia, and the Diggers.
The basic goal of many par
ticipants in the Free U. is to
create some sort of viable radi
cal community. This theme
runs through a number of semi
nars. Jim Fadiman, who wrote
his doctoral dissertation on the
use of LSD in furthering crea
tivity, is dealing with the prac
tical problems of forming such
a community. Dave Harris'
group is considering the prob
lems involved in living a life of
creativity and freedom in the
U.S. today.
The Free U. has been success
ful in involving people with very
different ideologies and interests.
On and off campus groups of
all ages, including high school
students, older members of the
Palo Alto community, students
from Stanford, the College of
San Mateo, and Foothill Junior
College are represented. Hippies,
hard-line Leninists, mystics, new
Leftists, and respectable middle
class liberals also find expres
sion in the Free U.
Controversy
But the structure and charact
er of the organization remains
a source of continual contro
versy. Success, Anatole Anton
points out, is relative to one's
goals, and successful radicalism
involves action relevant to alter
ing the fundamental nature of
the larger society. He questions
whether the organization, as
presently constituted, will con
tribute to this end.
Behind this dispute lies the
question of what radical political
action really is. This is the core
of the disagreement between
the radicals and the hippies.
Robb Crist has argued that the
political radicals, with all their

posters and demonstrations, only
talk about changing society,
while the hippies are actually
changing the style and sub
stance of American life.
Every time a young man de
cides he no longer wants to live
in a suburban home, have a
new car every other year, watch
color TV, and drink beer or
bourbon, and chooses a simple
life which leaves time for love,
creativity, and self-exploration,
he has effectively cast a vote
against the present economic
and social system.
Anatole Anton disagrees, ar
guing that psychedelics are liter
ally the new opiates of the peo
ple, distracting them from po
litical struggle, and therefore
function as a means of domi
nation by the ruling class.
A different sort of dispute
was responsible for last sum

mer's split into two organiza
tions, the Experiment and the
Free U. At that time the issue
was primarily one of political
tactics. Barry Greenberg and
Ira Orlook felt that the best
base for community political ac
tion was with students, and ac
cordingly they sought to inte
grate their part of the organi
zation, the Experiment, into
campus life.
Those remaining with the
Free U. chose to focus primarily
on the people of Palo Alto al
though the initial emphasis was
on the people in East Palo Alto.
There is considerable coopera
tion between the organizations,
and both seem to be thriving,

The Free University, like the
Holy Roman Empire, is neither
holy, nor Roman, nor an em
pire; neither, however, is it a
university, nor, in the most ob
vious sense, is it free. In fact,
whether it is (or should be) free
in any sense has been a matter
of considerable debate.
The kind of internal dispute
which recently wracked the Free
U. and led to the resignation of
its paid Coordinator has also
been a source of division at
many nf the other free univer
sities and experimental colleges
that have sprung up across the
country in the past two years.
The basic issue is this: how
free does a free university real
ly want to be? Does it want to
be be an open forum for all
points of view and offer courses
on any and all subjects which
anyone wishes to teach or take,
or does it regard itself as be
ing in the business of promoting
a particular ideology or political
posture?
Three weeks ago Georgia
Kelly resigned as Coordinator
of our local Free U., charging
that the course offerings were
becoming too mystical, too psy
chedelic, and that the organiza
tion's original purpose of pro
moting radical political action
had been largely lost.
Shift From Left
The Free U. has clearly moved
away from its early, predomi
nantly left orientation. The
cover of its spring quarter cata
log, bearing as it does a bloom
ing lotus, gives evidence of this
shift. Yet the change came not
from a change in ideology but
was simply a reflection of the
effect of demand on supply.
Looking, for example, at the
first Free U. catalog (Winter
1966) one finds that well over
half of the courses express a
Marxist political standpoint. But
there is a great deal of differ
ence between offering a course
and teaching one. In order to
teach a course one must have
people willing to take it, and
most of the political courses
had no one attending them at
all after a week or two.
There were, of course, some
exceptions. Roy Kepler began
a seminar on non-violence over
a year ago and it is still going

strong. Likewise, Vic Lovell's
course on American youth in
revolt was consistently success
ful, as were Barry Greenberg's
courses on phenomenology and
existentialism.
Courses on mysticism and psy
chedelics have proved popular,
and as a result have tended to
continue and proliferate.
Political Courses
Political courses have also
been successful when they are
not doctrinaire but respond to
current interests. John Saari
and Alan Schmidt lead courses
on the new radicals and Ameri
can foreign policy. Anatole An
ton and A. Videl-Madjer have
put together a course on politi
cal struggle which discusses,
among other things, Robin Hood,
the Mafia, and the Diggers.
The basic goal of many par
ticipants in the Free U. is to
create some sort of viable radi
cal community. This theme
runs through a number of semi
nars. Jim Fadiman, who wrote
his doctoral dissertation on the
use of LSD in furthering crea
tivity, is dealing with the prac
tical problems of forming such
a community. Dave Harris'
group is considering the prob
lems involved in living a life of
creativity and freedom in the
U.S. today.
The Free U. has been success
ful in involving people with very
different ideologies and interests.
On and off campus groups of
all ages, including high school
students, older members of the
Palo Alto community, students
from Stanford, the College of
San Mateo, and Foothill Junior
College are represented. Hippies,
hard-line Leninists, mystics, new
Leftists, and respectable middle
class liberals also find expres
sion in the Free U.
Controversy
But the structure and charact
er of the organization remains
a source of continual contro
versy. Success, Anatole Anton
points out, is relative to one's
goals, and successful radicalism
involves action relevant to alter
ing the fundamental nature of
the larger society. He questions
whether the organization, as
presently constituted, will con
tribute to this end.
Behind this dispute lies the
question of what radical political
action really is. This is the core
of the disagreement between
the radicals and the hippies.
Robb Crist has argued that the
political radicals, with all their

posters and demonstrations, only
talk about changing society,
while the hippies are actually
changing the style and sub
stance of American life.
Every time a young man de
cides he no longer wants to live
in a suburban home, have a
new car every other year, watch
color TV, and drink beer or
bourbon, and chooses a simple
life which leaves time for love,
creativity, and self-exploration,
he has effectively cast a vote
against the present economic
and social system.
Anatole Anton disagrees, ar
guing that psychedelics are liter
ally the new opiates of the peo
ple, distracting them from po
litical struggle, and therefore
function as a means of domi
nation by the ruling class.
A different sort of dispute
was responsible for last sum

mer's split into two organiza
tions, the Experiment and the
Free U. At that time the issue
was primarily one of political
tactics. Barry Greenberg and
Ira Orlook felt that the best
base for community political ac
tion was with students, and ac
cordingly they sought to inte
grate their part of the organi
zation, the Experiment, into
campus life.

A different sort of dispute
was responsible for last sum

mer's split into two organiza
tions, the Experiment and the
Free U. At that time the issue
was primarily one of political
tactics. Barry Greenberg and
Ira Orlook felt that the best
base for community political ac
tion was with students, and ac
cordingly they sought to inte
grate their part of the organi
zation, the Experiment, into
campus life.
Those remaining with the
Free U. chose to focus primarily
on the people of Palo Alto al

on the people in East Palo Alto.

becoming a "residence univerÂ»

ing up for the Free U.
The Free University, like the
Holy Roman Empire, is neither
holy, nor Roman, nor an em
pire; neither, however, is it a
university, nor, in the most ob
vious sense, is it free. In fact,
whether it is (or should be) free
in any sense has been a matter
of considerable debate.
The kind of internal dispute
which recently wracked the Free
U. and led to the resignation of
its paid Coordinator has also
been a source of division at
many nf the other free univer
sities and experimental colleges
that have sprung up across the
country in the past two years.
The basic issue is this: how
free does a free university real
ly want to be? Does it want to
be be an open forum for all
points of view and offer courses
on any and all subjects which
anyone wishes to teach or take,
or does it regard itself as be
ing in the business of promoting
a particular ideology or political
posture?
Three weeks ago Georgia
Kelly resigned as Coordinator
of our local Free U., charging
that the course offerings were
becoming too mystical, too psy
chedelic, and that the organiza
tion's original purpose of pro
moting radical political action
had been largely lost.
Shift From Left
The Free U. has clearly moved
away from its early, predomi
nantly left orientation. The
cover of its spring quarter cata
log, bearing as it does a bloom
ing lotus, gives evidence of this
shift. Yet the change came not
from a change in ideology but
was simply a reflection of the
effect of demand on supply.
Looking, for example, at the
first Free U. catalog (Winter
1966) one finds that well over
half of the courses express a
Marxist political standpoint. But
there is a great deal of differ
ence between offering a course
and teaching one. In order to
teach a course one must have
people willing to take it, and
most of the political courses
had no one attending them at
all after a week or two.
There were, of course, some
exceptions. Roy Kepler began
a seminar on non-violence over
a year ago and it is still going

strong. Likewise, Vic Lovell's
course on American youth in
revolt was consistently success
ful, as were Barry Greenberg's
courses on phenomenology and
existentialism.
Courses on mysticism and psy
chedelics have proved popular,
and as a result have tended to
continue and proliferate.
Political Courses
Political courses have also
been successful when they are
not doctrinaire but respond to
current interests. John Saari
and Alan Schmidt lead courses
on the new radicals and Ameri
can foreign policy. Anatole An
ton and A. Videl-Madjer have
put together a course on politi
cal struggle which discusses,
among other things, Robin Hood,
the Mafia, and the Diggers.
The basic goal of many par
ticipants in the Free U. is to
create some sort of viable radi
cal community. This theme
runs through a number of semi
nars. Jim Fadiman, who wrote
his doctoral dissertation on the
use of LSD in furthering crea
tivity, is dealing with the prac
tical problems of forming such
a community. Dave Harris'
group is considering the prob
lems involved in living a life of
creativity and freedom in the
U.S. today.
The Free U. has been success
ful in involving people with very
different ideologies and interests.
On and off campus groups of
all ages, including high school
students, older members of the
Palo Alto community, students
from Stanford, the College of
San Mateo, and Foothill Junior
College are represented. Hippies,
hard-line Leninists, mystics, new
Leftists, and respectable middle
class liberals also find expres
sion in the Free U.
Controversy
But the structure and charact
er of the organization remains
a source of continual contro
versy. Success, Anatole Anton
points out, is relative to one's
goals, and successful radicalism
involves action relevant to alter
ing the fundamental nature of
the larger society. He questions
whether the organization, as
presently constituted, will con
tribute to this end.
Behind this dispute lies the
question of what radical political
action really is. This is the core
of the disagreement between
the radicals and the hippies.
Robb Crist has argued that the
political radicals, with all their

posters and demonstrations, only
talk about changing society,
while the hippies are actually
changing the style and sub
stance of American life.
Every time a young man de
cides he no longer wants to live
in a suburban home, have a
new car every other year, watch
color TV, and drink beer or
bourbon, and chooses a simple
life which leaves time for love,
creativity, and self-exploration,
he has effectively cast a vote
against the present economic

er of the organization remains
a source of continual contro
versy. Success, Anatole Anton
points out, is relative to one's
goals, and successful radicalism
involves action relevant to alter
ing the fundamental nature of
the larger society. He questions
whether the organization, as
presently constituted, will con
tribute to this end.
Behind this dispute lies the
question of what radical political
action really is. This is the core
of the disagreement between
the radicals and the hippies.
Robb Crist has argued that the
political radicals, with all their

posters and demonstrations, only
talk about changing society,
while the hippies are actually
changing the style and sub
stance of American life.
Every time a young man de
cides he no longer wants to live
in a suburban home, have a
new car every other year, watch
color TV, and drink beer or
bourbon, and chooses a simple
life which leaves time for love,
creativity, and self-exploration,
he has effectively cast a vote
against the present economic
and social system.
Anatole Anton disagrees, ar
guing that psychedelics are liter
ally the new opiates of the peo
ple, distracting them from po
litical struggle, and therefore
function as a means of domi
nation by the ruling class.
A different sort of dispute
was responsible for last sum

mer's split into two organiza
tions, the Experiment and the
Free U. At that time the issue
was primarily one of political
tactics. Barry Greenberg and
Ira Orlook felt that the best
base for community political ac
tion was with students, and ac
cordingly they sought to inte
grate their part of the organi
zation, the Experiment, into
campus life.
Those remaining with the
Free U. chose to focus primarily
on the people of Palo Alto al
though the initial emphasis was
on the people in East Palo Alto.
There is considerable coopera
tion between the organizations,
and both seem to be thriving,
