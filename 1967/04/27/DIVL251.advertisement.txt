A new student
enters the dialogue
and asks business
; for some answers
Dear Mr. Calvin:
After almost five months of discussion with Mr. Kokalas, it is apparent
from your exchange of dialogues that the problems business faces
today are significant ones. They center around the reluctance of the
college graduate to enter the business world because of his lack of a
special technical knowledge, his fear of little chance for indiv.dual
creative thought and potential self-satisfaction, and his attraction to
other competing fields. I know these are the true feelings of many.
But let's ask each other why? Perhaps you recall that in your invitational
letter to Mr. Kokalas of August 25, 1%6, you wrote, "Perhaps certain
college students are misinformed and should be set straight.'' From this
line I gathered—l) business is not being presented to the student in a
satisfactory manner and 2) the current information the hesitant student
receives is incorrect. Assuming business is other than the image
emanating from corporations today, let's see the good one; let the
student know with reasonable certainty what business has to offer. Such
an exchange as these letters is fine for the duration of a student's
attention equal to that of his consumption of his morning cup of coffee.
Isolated communications like this one (deserving of much respect) do
not adequately portray the realistic, honest, inside-look that business
must offer. Corporations must propagate more of this type of student
business relations if they are to change their image to a more enhancing
and inviting one. The ideal is a face-to-face look which the student
desires before plunging into this "unknown" field. The student does
need to be set straight with facts and figures, not the stories he hears
from those who are or have been disappointed in business.
The problem, quite realistically, is faulty communications and
inadequate public relations. The image that must be renovated is
the grey-flannel suit, the cold businessman's ulcerous stomach, the
nine-to-five plug-in executive. The student needs a real image based
on the truth; one which he feels is reasonable and from which he ran
intelligently decide, not one wh.ch frightens him into another vocation.
Today, the idea, the image of business turns graduates away. It is
obvious business must negate the detrimental picture and begin
creating a new and illuminating idea founded upon the truth.
