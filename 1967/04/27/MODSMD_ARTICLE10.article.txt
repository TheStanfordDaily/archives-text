# Rifle Club Moves To New Range
## 
### JIM KILGORE 
Stanford's rifle range has come
a long way, from an old World
War I cavalry shed to an old
steam plant building.
The range, previously located
near the Shell station on Campus
Drive, had to be moved to the
new site to allow construction on
the Roscoe W. Maples basketball
pavilion. Maples Pavilion, which
will replace the present cracker
box-with-hoops, has been threat
ening the rifle range for the last
three years, finally winning the
battle last quarter.
The new rifle range was allo
cated $8,000 by the University

according to John Hayes, Rifle
and Pistol Club president. The
club also managed to scrape up
$500 for the project.
Seraphim Post, the Univers
ity's Assistant Business Mana
ger, estimates that before the
range is completed Stanford's
contribution "will be consider
ably more.'
New Conveniences
Hayes feels that he's getting
a good deal, however, in the old
range, he said, "when it rained
you got wet." The new range,
complete with a non-leaking
roof, will also provide more
space for storing weapons.

It will also be "safer, heated,
and well lit," Hayes continued,
pointing out three features not
in abundance at the old range.
Harmon In Charge
Responsible for building the
new rifle range was Army Ser
geant Leonard Harmon, who is
also in charge. He was aided by
members of the Menlo Park and
Hewlett-Packard rifle clubs, but
claims, "If it hadn't been for Mr.
Post, we wouldn't have it today."
Harmon, who teaches the
Physical Education Depart
ment's rifle course, works with
Marine Sergeant James Cun
ningham, who is the instructor
for the pistol class.
Increased Enrollment
The new building will allow
more students to take the rifle
and pistol courses, Harmon said.
He can now handle an enrollment
of about 200 per quarter in his
rifle class. The old range was
larger, but instruction was more
difficult.
However, according to a policy
initiated last year by the ROTC,
only ROTC cadets will be
allowed to take the marksman
ship courses during Spring Quar
ter. Stanford is required to pro
vide a rifle range according to
its agreement with the ROTC,

and the ROTC makes the deci
sion whether to allow civilians
to use the range.
Harmon is instructing 165 ca
dets this quarter and did not feel
that he had enough time to per
mit other students to take
marksmanship.
New Site
The old rifle range was built
approximately 50 years ago for
what was then the equivalent of
the ROTC. Army horses and
mules were stabled there until
the end of the war.
The present rifle range is lo
cated in Stanford's second steam
plant, which was abandoned
about ten years ago. The first
rifle range was shaken to the
ground by the 1906 earthquake.
The new range is across the
street from the Board of Athletic
Control building.
