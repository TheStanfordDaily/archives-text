# 'In Loco Parentis' Discussed
## 
### STEVE RUTKUS 
"In loco parentis" at Stanford
means different things to dif
ferent people. This was clear
after separate interviews Mon
day with ASSU President Mi
chael Collins and his predeces
sor, David Harris.
Their contrasting interpreta
tions of the Administration's
"parental approach" to students
may help define the issues that
will prove crucial in the upcom
ing ASSU elections.
Despite recent administration
concessions as the tentative de
cision to allow 100 senior class
women to live off campus next
year, Harris contended these
changes are misleading. The for
mer ASSU president claimed
that the issues crucial to "legit
imate student autonomy' have
been glossed over, that the
essential manifestations of "in
loco parentis" have yet to be
seriously challenged.
Wrapped Up
"One is wrapped up by 'in
loco parentis' at Stanford," Har
ris said. "This looking for par
ents away from home," is still
in the "minds of some students.
It's an entire way of seeing edu
cation," he maintained.

Harris refused to equate ad
ministrative paternalism solely
with the social regulations of
student residences. He noted
that, even if and when Univers
ity social regulations are en
tirely rescinded, the gain would
be small if the ultimate struc
tures of "mechanistic authority"
are not challenged.
Educating Role
Harris saw his role in office
as one of "educating" the stu
dents to accept a new perspec
tive of their roles in the educa
tional process. "We succeeded in
shifting the focus entirely, in
achieving political redefinition,"
Harris said.
Yet statements by ASSU Pres
ident Michael Collins indicate
the "redefinition" has not been
universally accepted. Collins
said he regarded the manifesta
tions of "in loco parentis' in the
restricted sense of dorm rules
and University responsibility for
student actions outside campus.
"That the University should
act as parent is anachronistic,"
Collins said, but he added that
'in loco parentis' seems to exist
more in theory than in fact. Col
lins feels that it is "basically

accepted, even among adminis
trators, that we will get rid of
'in loco parentis.'
Divergent Views
Harris' and Collins' philoso
phy of studrnt government di
verge here. Collins feels the stu
dent should have the right to
practice his own morality and
judgment within the context of
a n administration-dominated
student community, a right
which he believes is nearly
achieved.
Harris, however, insists that
this domination must be elimin
ated before self-respect can be
achieved. Stated differently, Col
lins is comfortable working
"within the present system."
Despite what he called the "con
descending attitude of many ad
ministrators toward students."
the ASSU President expressed
confidence that, once the admin
istration's social regulations
were disposed of, enough mo
mentum would be built up to
have "serious implications for
the whole range of University
functions."
As ASSU president, Harris
had little respect for student
government as it was defined
by the ASSU Constitution. The
causes which he championed
against the administration, such
as OFF! and "responsible repre
sentation" of students in Uni
versity committees, were di
rected essentially outside
LASSU.
Boycotting tuition payments

of committees, Harris believed,
would bring more pressure on
the administration, if supported
by students, than resolutions
from an unwieldy legislature.
Rejecting Collins* view that
adequate momentum to effect
change can be built up within
the present student government
system, Harris wanted students
to refuse to give respect to the
administration's "paternalistic
position." This could be done
through "organizing outside
present ASSU structures," Har
ris said, "meeting the Adminis
tration as student representa
tives and not as dupes of a 'com
pany union' (LASSU) which the
administration helped manufac
ture to its desires decades ago."
Only by "outside organization
and pressure" will the present
ASSU government be forced to
change itself, Harris maintained.
To work only within this gov
ernment would perpetuate the
"farce," he added.
Financial Control
Harris attacked the power, as
stated in the ASSU constitution,
of the President of the Univers
ity to appoint the ASSU Fnancial
Director and the latter's power,
to appoint a Student Financial
Manager to act as his agent.
"While a pretense is made of stu
dent leaders handling ASSU
funds, the administration is firm
ly in charge," Harris said.
The political climate has been
changed significantly, said Har
ris, so students now realize that
"they must act." He lauded this,
saying "understanding" was
what he sought to achieve most
as ASSU president.
Harris, howov"" the
current ASSU "bureaucracy" in
which "students are willing to
do things but not to stand up to
things. The only way to change
the system of 'parent rule' is to
work outside as well as inside
the system," he maintained.
'No Issue'—Collins
Looking to the upcoming
ASSU elections, student body
president Collins felt that 'in loco
parentis' would not be an issue
among students, for "every can
didate is bound to be opposed to
it.' Harris, however, warned
against the 'liberal' who might
"change the frills" but not really
involve himself in the "big ques
tion" of the students' right to
govern themselves.
As is well known, Harris did
not consider himself an admin
istrator while as President, but
as an "educator". Although he
feels the "new focus" must be

re-emphasized so that to studc t
this understanding will become
"a part of their lives,' he sees a
need for a new quality in a stu
dent body president—the ability
to organize, to mobilize student
opinion behind political struc
tures other than those ultimately
dominated by the administra
tion, such as LASSU.
The polarities of political
thought as expressed by Collins
and Harris presage what may
be the dominant issue in the up
coming ASSU elections. With
Joe Reich in the race, who has
said he will attack the existing
power structure "at its roots,"
other candidates will be forced
to choose openly between "work
ing with the system to effect
change" or "changing the system
from without."
The election results in such a
case may well be an affirmation
of one of the two philosophies
of student government—Harris
or Collins-style. The elections,
seen from this perspective, may
influence the direction of Stan
ford politics for years to come.
