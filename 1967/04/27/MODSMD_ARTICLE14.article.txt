## Rinconada's Unsung Heroes 
### Nick Selby 
You may wonder why there
are no sports articles today. I
decided that other Stanford ath
letes needed some publicity In
place of the intercollegiate
heroes.
These Stanford athletes do
not compete in the Stanford
Stadium before 90,000 people on
big game day, nor do they swim
in the nationals or AAU's. They
don't smash home runs in the
sunken diamond or practice
running on Angell field.
Meaningless Victory
These great Stanford athletes
know no team spirit, nor do
they train very hard. Victory is
such a fleeting thing that it
does not matter in the least.
There is no pressure, just pure
fun in doing the activity itself.
Anyone who looks hard
enough can find these deans of
the sportmg world. Try the eat
ing club \basketball courts or
the volleyball and basketball
courts around Wilbur, or the
fraternity activity areas. They
are the true, best competitors.
"Are you for real?" I can
hear you all asking me this
right now. Well, perhaps I am,
and then maybe I'm not.
But now I have your atten
tion. I want to give you some
close sketches of a special breed

of these athletes. Their arena
is the dorm halls of Rinconada;
their sports are frisbie throwing
and hand slapping.
I have said before that these
boys did not train very hard.
But that in no way means they
aren't dedicated. No sir, they
are throwing and slapping every
day of the week, almost every
hour of the day, and night.
First, let's consider the fris
bie throwing. The prerequisites
wrist, a sharp eye and a good
frisbie, or Pluto Platter as they
are known in less civilized areas.
The object (as far as I can tell)
is to throw the frisbie the length
of the hall as fast as possible,
maiming as many innocent pass
ers-by as possible. People are
shoved out doors and —CLONK!
they are out cold for the rest
of the night.
Cracked Skulls
Sometimes, the throwers in
timidate a smoker into using a
cigarette as the target. Usually
it is in his lips. Cracked skulls
are commonplace among the
Rinconadans.
I'm sad to relate however,
that this sport may soon cease,
due to insufficient funds to
cover the hall damages. Four of
seven lights have been com
pletely sheered off, not to men
tion the broken ceiling. Com
missioner Higgins may abort
the slaughter, which would be
a disaster for "Ceps" Veiller, the
Stock, Ying and the rest of the
Frisbie gang.
Drawing Blood Reflexes
That's the action on the sec
ond floor. Now let's view the
exciting sport of drawing blood
from the back of the hands.
Two people hold out their hands
flat, palms touching. The man
with his hands on the bottom
tries to slap the hands of the
other before he can pull them
away.
The champ of the sport is
Dan "the Navel" Clement, so
called because he hypnotises his
opponents with his swaying

navel. "The Navel" has tremen
dously fast hands: "I've drawn
blood many times," he modestly
relates about his reflexes.
Second in the slapping order
is "Fists" Pfister, who uses his
great leverage to deaden re
flexes and crush bones with
tremendous slapping force. Kim
is their practice opponent, or
should I say, their slapping boy.
When a challenger walks by,
the slappers slap on their Corn
huskers and start raising welts.
Consequently, writing talent of
the Rinconadans has been de
stroyed.
Far from the fields of glory,
the sports continue. Victory?
Hah! "Thank God. I'm alive" is
the only feeling. But pain?
There is none — the fun takes
care of that.

These Stanford athletes do
not compete in the Stanford
Stadium before 90,000 people on
big game day, nor do they swim
in the nationals or AAU's. They
don't smash home runs in the
sunken diamond or practice
running on Angell field.
Meaningless Victory
These great Stanford athletes
know no team spirit, nor do
they train very hard. Victory is
such a fleeting thing that it
does not matter in the least.
There is no pressure, just pure
fun in doing the activity itself.
Anyone who looks hard
enough can find these deans of
the sportmg world. Try the eat
ing club \basketball courts or
the volleyball and basketball
courts around Wilbur, or the
fraternity activity areas. They
are the true, best competitors.
"Are you for real?" I can
hear you all asking me this
right now. Well, perhaps I am,
and then maybe I'm not.
But now I have your atten
tion. I want to give you some
close sketches of a special breed

of these athletes. Their arena
is the dorm halls of Rinconada;
their sports are frisbie throwing
and hand slapping.
I have said before that these
boys did not train very hard.
But that in no way means they
aren't dedicated. No sir, they
are throwing and slapping every
day of the week, almost every
hour of the day, and night.
First, let's consider the fris
bie throwing. The prerequisites
wrist, a sharp eye and a good
frisbie, or Pluto Platter as they
are known in less civilized areas.
The object (as far as I can tell)
is to throw the frisbie the length
of the hall as fast as possible,
maiming as many innocent pass
ers-by as possible. People are
shoved out doors and —CLONK!
they are out cold for the rest
of the night.
Cracked Skulls
Sometimes, the throwers in
timidate a smoker into using a
cigarette as the target. Usually
it is in his lips. Cracked skulls
are commonplace among the
Rinconadans.
I'm sad to relate however,
that this sport may soon cease,
due to insufficient funds to
cover the hall damages. Four of
seven lights have been com
pletely sheered off, not to men
tion the broken ceiling. Com
missioner Higgins may abort
the slaughter, which would be
a disaster for "Ceps" Veiller, the
Stock, Ying and the rest of the
Frisbie gang.
Drawing Blood Reflexes
That's the action on the sec
ond floor. Now let's view the
exciting sport of drawing blood
from the back of the hands.
Two people hold out their hands
flat, palms touching. The man
with his hands on the bottom
tries to slap the hands of the
other before he can pull them
away.
The champ of the sport is
Dan "the Navel" Clement, so
called because he hypnotises his
opponents with his swaying

navel. "The Navel" has tremen
dously fast hands: "I've drawn
blood many times," he modestly
relates about his reflexes.
Second in the slapping order
is "Fists" Pfister, who uses his
great leverage to deaden re
flexes and crush bones with
tremendous slapping force. Kim
is their practice opponent, or
should I say, their slapping boy.
When a challenger walks by,
the slappers slap on their Corn
huskers and start raising welts.
Consequently, writing talent of
the Rinconadans has been de
stroyed.
Far from the fields of glory,
the sports continue. Victory?
Hah! "Thank God. I'm alive" is
the only feeling. But pain?
There is none — the fun takes
care of that.
You may wonder why there
are no sports articles today. I
decided that other Stanford ath
letes needed some publicity In
place of the intercollegiate
heroes.
