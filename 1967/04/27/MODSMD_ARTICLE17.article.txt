# Crime Rate Moves Upward
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
During the first three months
of 1967 the Stanford Police De
partment reported 103 thefts
on campus. This figure repre
sents an increase of 23 over the
same period last year when 320
thefts occurred.
The number of reported thefts
has increased almost 250 per
cent during the past four years,
but vehicle accidents, for in
stance, have increased only 7
percent during the same period.
The number of stolen vehicles
has actually decreased from 47
in 1963 to 40 last year.
The problem doesn't seem to
be that Stanford students have
developed less regard for other

people's property. As Assistant
Chief of Police Tom Bell told
The Daily in an interview yes
terday, "In the past three years,
all of our arrests, with one ex
ception have been people from
off the campus."
Thirty-seven of the thefts re
ported during the first three
months of last year involved
vehicles. This includes either
stolen parts, such as batteries
and hub caps, or items taken
off the seats.
There seem to be two princi
pal areas for these vehicle
thefts, although they occur all
over campus.
The first principal area is the
Wilbur, Stern, Tresidder and

Crothers parking lots. Most of
the thefts here appear to occur
during the night, because, as
Bell explained, "They are the
darkest spots on campus."
The second area is beyond
Serra Street and around the
Oval where off-campus students
park their cars during the day.
With many people in and
around the cars before and after
classes, Bell claimed, "It is very
hard to tell just who is a stu
dent and should be in the cars."
Of special concern to the Sher
iff's Office is the theft which oc
curred April 19 at the home of
Mrs. Lowell, the widow of a
medical school professor. She
lost over $2000 in clothes, cam

eras, silverware, dishes, and
other items. Sergeant Beten-
Court suggested it might be
someone from the "San Fran
cisco area" who has been in
volved in a similar series of
thefts in the Los Altos Hills
area.
Also in the three day period
surrounding this theft, there
were a number of other thefts
at Stanford totaling losses of
over $12,000.
One of these was $185 stolen
from the Business School lounge
cash box. Despite the fact that

the teen agers suspected in the
case were seen in the building
for three hours before the crime,
no one has been able to identify
them.
In regard to these problems,
Bell pointed out that Stanford
is not a closed campus "like
some parts of Cal where you
must pass by a guard." Along
with the larger number of peo
ple who are driving through the
campus as a short-cut since the
relaxation of the social regula
tions, people are staying cut
later."
As a result, people are in and
out of the academic buildings
all night long. "These people
don't take the time to lock the
door or give it that extra yank
to make sure it is closed," he
said.
When asked to give his ad
vice on the best means of pre
venting the number of thefts,
Bell said, "We are no longer
down on a farm with 10 miles
of orchards separating us from
the nearest town. We are really
a part of the peninsula commu
nity. As such, it requires that
people be more careful about
their personal possessions."
