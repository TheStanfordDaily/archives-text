• Whatever the circumstances
I of the moment, whatever the
of government and in
dustry on the universities — and
"whatever the rewards for meet
ing these demands—the highest
function of higher education is
what might be called the teach
' ing of things in perspective,
toward the purposes of enrich
: Ing the life of the individual,
cultivating the free and inquir
ing mind, and advancing the ef
fort to bring reason, justice and
humanity into the relations of
men and nations. Insofar as the
study of politics is pertinent to
these ends, the university is
properly a place in which schol
ars analyze existing public poli
cies with a view to determining
whether they advance or retard
the realization of basic human
objectives and whether and how
they should be changed. Only in
sofar as the university is a place
in which ideas are valued above
their practical application, in
which there is greater interest
in contributing to the sum of hu
man knowledge than in helping
a government agency to resolve
some practical problem, is the
university meeting its academic
responsibility to its students and
its patriotic responsibility to the
country.
Obviously there are great mu
tual benefits in relations be
tween the universities and gov
ernment, but when the relation
ship becomes too close, too ex
tensive, and too highly valued
by the universities, the higher
functions of the university are in
danger of being compromised.
The danger goes far beyond con
tractual associations with the
Central Intelligence Agency,
which, unfortunate though they
are, are so egregious that once
they become known, there is a
tendency to terminate them with
all possible haste, although at a
lasting cost to the integrity of
the institutions involved. Nor
is there great danger inherent
in government - sponsored re
search of and by itself; on the
contrary, government contracts
bring needed money to the uni

versities and needed intellectual
resources to the government.
The danger lies rather in the ex
tent and the conditions, implicit
as well as explicit, of these gov
ernmental associations: as long
as they involve secondary func
tions for the university they are
not harmful, but when they be
come primary areas of activity,
when they become the major
source of the university's reve
nue and the major source of the
scholar's prestige, then the
"teaching of things in perspec
tive" is likely to be neglected
and the universality of the uni
versity compromised.
University Becomes a Business
I suspect that when a univer
sity becomes very closely orient
ed to the current needs of gov
ernment, it takes on some of the
atmosphere of a place of busi
ness while losing that of a place
of learning. The sciences are em
phasized at the expense of the
humanities, and within the hu
manities the behavioral school
of social science at the expense
of the more traditional — and
to my mind more humane—ap
proaches. Generally, I would ex
pect an interest in salable in
formation pertaining to current
problems to be emphasized at
the expense of general ideas per
taining to the human condition.
The kind of professor needed in
the government-oriented univer
sity is one, I suspect, who
though technically brilliant is
philosophically orthodox, be
cause the true dissenter, the man
who dissents about purpose and
not just technique, is likely to
lose a sale.
"Sound" scholars produce
"sound" disciples. In a research
oriented university, especially a
government - research - oriented
university, I would expect, the
student who is highly valued is
the one who can contribute to
production. Obviously the grad
uate student is a more valuable
research assistant than the un
dergraduate and the scientifi
cally-oriented student is more
valuable than the one who is in
terested in history or philoso
phy. The latter, indeed, is likely
to find himself relegated to the
charge of the lower echelon of
the faculty, those, that is, who
are condemned to teach.

In lending itself too much to
the purposes of government, a
university fails of its higher pur
poses. It is not contributing to
the re-examination of the ideas
of our ancestors on which hu
man survival depends; it is not
dealing with the central prob
lems of the first generation in
human history which holds the
power of life and death over its
progeny; it is not, in Archibald
MacLeish's phrase, trying to
produce "an idea that mankind
can hold to." It is not, therefore,
meeting its responsibilities to its
students and to society.
The university, it is true, can
not separate itself from the so
ciety of which it is a part, but
neither can the community of
scholars accept existing public
policies as if they set limits on
"responsible" inquiry, as if the
scholar's proper function, and
only proper function, were to
devise the technical means of
carrying these policies out. The
proper function of the scholar
is not to exclude certain ques
tions in the name of practicality,
or in the name of a spurious
patriotism, but to ask all possi
ble questions, to ask what has
been done wisely and what has
been done foolishly and what
the answers to these questions
imply for the future. It would
be a fine thing indeed if, instead
of spending so much of th ei r
time playing "war games," po
litical scientists were asking
how it came about that we have
had for so long to devote so
great a part of our resources to
war and its prevention, and
whether we are condemned by
forces beyond our control to
continue to do so. The scholar
can ask what is wrong with the
"other side," but he must not
fail to ask as well what is
wrong with our side, remem
bering always that the highest
devotion we can give is not to
our country as it is but to a
concept of what we would like
it to be.

• Whatever the circumstances
I of the moment, whatever the
of government and in
dustry on the universities — and
"whatever the rewards for meet
ing these demands—the highest
function of higher education is
what might be called the teach
' ing of things in perspective,
toward the purposes of enrich
: Ing the life of the individual,
cultivating the free and inquir
ing mind, and advancing the ef
fort to bring reason, justice and
humanity into the relations of
men and nations. Insofar as the
study of politics is pertinent to
these ends, the university is
properly a place in which schol
ars analyze existing public poli
cies with a view to determining
whether they advance or retard
the realization of basic human
objectives and whether and how
they should be changed. Only in
sofar as the university is a place
in which ideas are valued above
their practical application, in
which there is greater interest
in contributing to the sum of hu
man knowledge than in helping
a government agency to resolve
some practical problem, is the
university meeting its academic
responsibility to its students and
its patriotic responsibility to the
country.
Obviously there are great mu
tual benefits in relations be
tween the universities and gov
ernment, but when the relation
ship becomes too close, too ex
tensive, and too highly valued
by the universities, the higher
functions of the university are in
danger of being compromised.
The danger goes far beyond con
tractual associations with the
Central Intelligence Agency,
which, unfortunate though they
are, are so egregious that once
they become known, there is a
tendency to terminate them with
all possible haste, although at a
lasting cost to the integrity of
the institutions involved. Nor
is there great danger inherent
in government - sponsored re
search of and by itself; on the
contrary, government contracts
bring needed money to the uni

versities and needed intellectual
resources to the government.
The danger lies rather in the ex
tent and the conditions, implicit
as well as explicit, of these gov
ernmental associations: as long
as they involve secondary func
tions for the university they are
not harmful, but when they be
come primary areas of activity,
when they become the major
source of the university's reve
nue and the major source of the
scholar's prestige, then the
"teaching of things in perspec
tive" is likely to be neglected
and the universality of the uni
versity compromised.
University Becomes a Business
I suspect that when a univer
sity becomes very closely orient
ed to the current needs of gov
ernment, it takes on some of the
atmosphere of a place of busi
ness while losing that of a place
of learning. The sciences are em
phasized at the expense of the
humanities, and within the hu
manities the behavioral school
of social science at the expense
of the more traditional — and
to my mind more humane—ap
proaches. Generally, I would ex
pect an interest in salable in
formation pertaining to current
problems to be emphasized at
the expense of general ideas per
taining to the human condition.
The kind of professor needed in
the government-oriented univer
sity is one, I suspect, who
though technically brilliant is
philosophically orthodox, be
cause the true dissenter, the man
who dissents about purpose and
not just technique, is likely to
lose a sale.
"Sound" scholars produce
"sound" disciples. In a research
oriented university, especially a
government - research - oriented
university, I would expect, the
student who is highly valued is
the one who can contribute to
production. Obviously the grad
uate student is a more valuable
research assistant than the un
dergraduate and the scientifi
cally-oriented student is more
valuable than the one who is in
terested in history or philoso
phy. The latter, indeed, is likely
to find himself relegated to the
charge of the lower echelon of
the faculty, those, that is, who
are condemned to teach.

In lending itself too much to
the purposes of government, a
university fails of its higher pur
poses. It is not contributing to
the re-examination of the ideas
of our ancestors on which hu
man survival depends; it is not
dealing with the central prob
lems of the first generation in
human history which holds the
power of life and death over its
progeny; it is not, in Archibald
MacLeish's phrase, trying to
produce "an idea that mankind
can hold to." It is not, therefore,
meeting its responsibilities to its
students and to society.
The university, it is true, can
not separate itself from the so
ciety of which it is a part, but
neither can the community of
scholars accept existing public
policies as if they set limits on
"responsible" inquiry, as if the
scholar's proper function, and
only proper function, were to
devise the technical means of
carrying these policies out. The
proper function of the scholar
is not to exclude certain ques
tions in the name of practicality,
or in the name of a spurious
patriotism, but to ask all possi
ble questions, to ask what has
been done wisely and what has
been done foolishly and what
the answers to these questions
imply for the future. It would
be a fine thing indeed if, instead
of spending so much of th ei r
time playing "war games," po
litical scientists were asking
how it came about that we have
had for so long to devote so
great a part of our resources to
war and its prevention, and
whether we are condemned by
forces beyond our control to
continue to do so. The scholar
can ask what is wrong with the
"other side," but he must not
fail to ask as well what is
wrong with our side, remem
bering always that the highest
devotion we can give is not to
our country as it is but to a
concept of what we would like
it to be.

• Whatever the circumstances
I of the moment, whatever the
of government and in
dustry on the universities — and
"whatever the rewards for meet
ing these demands—the highest
function of higher education is
what might be called the teach
' ing of things in perspective,
toward the purposes of enrich
: Ing the life of the individual,
cultivating the free and inquir
ing mind, and advancing the ef
fort to bring reason, justice and
humanity into the relations of
men and nations. Insofar as the
study of politics is pertinent to
these ends, the university is
properly a place in which schol
ars analyze existing public poli
cies with a view to determining
whether they advance or retard
the realization of basic human
objectives and whether and how
they should be changed. Only in
sofar as the university is a place
in which ideas are valued above
their practical application, in
which there is greater interest
in contributing to the sum of hu
man knowledge than in helping
a government agency to resolve
some practical problem, is the
university meeting its academic
responsibility to its students and
its patriotic responsibility to the
country.
Obviously there are great mu
tual benefits in relations be
tween the universities and gov
ernment, but when the relation
ship becomes too close, too ex
tensive, and too highly valued
by the universities, the higher
functions of the university are in
danger of being compromised.
The danger goes far beyond con
tractual associations with the
Central Intelligence Agency,
which, unfortunate though they
are, are so egregious that once
they become known, there is a
tendency to terminate them with
all possible haste, although at a
lasting cost to the integrity of
the institutions involved. Nor
is there great danger inherent
in government - sponsored re
search of and by itself; on the
contrary, government contracts
bring needed money to the uni

versities and needed intellectual
resources to the government.
The danger lies rather in the ex
tent and the conditions, implicit
as well as explicit, of these gov
ernmental associations: as long
as they involve secondary func
tions for the university they are
not harmful, but when they be
come primary areas of activity,
when they become the major
source of the university's reve
nue and the major source of the
scholar's prestige, then the
"teaching of things in perspec
tive" is likely to be neglected
and the universality of the uni
versity compromised.
University Becomes a Business
I suspect that when a univer
sity becomes very closely orient
ed to the current needs of gov
ernment, it takes on some of the
atmosphere of a place of busi
ness while losing that of a place
of learning. The sciences are em
phasized at the expense of the
humanities, and within the hu
manities the behavioral school
of social science at the expense
of the more traditional — and
to my mind more humane—ap
proaches. Generally, I would ex
pect an interest in salable in
formation pertaining to current
problems to be emphasized at
the expense of general ideas per
taining to the human condition.
The kind of professor needed in
the government-oriented univer
sity is one, I suspect, who
though technically brilliant is
philosophically orthodox, be
cause the true dissenter, the man
who dissents about purpose and
not just technique, is likely to
lose a sale.
"Sound" scholars produce
"sound" disciples. In a research
oriented university, especially a
government - research - oriented
university, I would expect, the
student who is highly valued is
the one who can contribute to
production. Obviously the grad
uate student is a more valuable
research assistant than the un
dergraduate and the scientifi
cally-oriented student is more
valuable than the one who is in
terested in history or philoso
phy. The latter, indeed, is likely
to find himself relegated to the
charge of the lower echelon of
the faculty, those, that is, who
are condemned to teach.

In lending itself too much to
the purposes of government, a
university fails of its higher pur
poses. It is not contributing to
the re-examination of the ideas
of our ancestors on which hu
man survival depends; it is not
dealing with the central prob
lems of the first generation in
human history which holds the
power of life and death over its
progeny; it is not, in Archibald
MacLeish's phrase, trying to
produce "an idea that mankind
can hold to." It is not, therefore,
meeting its responsibilities to its
students and to society.
The university, it is true, can
not separate itself from the so
ciety of which it is a part, but
neither can the community of
scholars accept existing public
policies as if they set limits on
"responsible" inquiry, as if the
scholar's proper function, and
only proper function, were to
devise the technical means of
carrying these policies out. The
proper function of the scholar
is not to exclude certain ques
tions in the name of practicality,
or in the name of a spurious
patriotism, but to ask all possi
ble questions, to ask what has
been done wisely and what has
been done foolishly and what
the answers to these questions
imply for the future. It would
be a fine thing indeed if, instead
of spending so much of th ei r
time playing "war games," po
litical scientists were asking
how it came about that we have
had for so long to devote so
great a part of our resources to
war and its prevention, and
whether we are condemned by
forces beyond our control to
continue to do so. The scholar
can ask what is wrong with the
"other side," but he must not
fail to ask as well what is
wrong with our side, remem
bering always that the highest
devotion we can give is not to
our country as it is but to a
concept of what we would like
it to be.
