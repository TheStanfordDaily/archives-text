## Kappa Sig Suspension Explained 
### ROGER LaBRUCHERIE 
While the local chapter of Kappa
Sigma fraternity has definitely been
suspended, the reasons for that action
by the national headquarters are also
suspended in a welter of conflicting
claims and opinions. The reason for
this state of affairs is partly that the
local chapter has yet to receive official
communication from the national fra
ternity, headquartered in Charlottes
ville, Virginia.
That this communication has been
sent, however, was confirmed yester
day in a telephone interview with
Worthy Grand Scribe Robert Ma

honey.
Mahoney outlined the reasons for
the suspension as stemming from
financial problems and violations of
national rules and the constitution.
Elaborating on the financial picture,
he stated that the chapter had been
placed under alumni control in Jan
uary, but that the deficit had
worsened since that time.
The chapter's treasurer, Bill Vogel
pohl denied that the house's financial
situation has worsened this year. "In
fact," he said, "it's gotten better and
as it looks, it will continue to do so.'

Mahoney specifically denied that
the suspension has anything to do
with the fact that the Stanford chap
ter pledged Rafe Palacio, a Negro,
two years ago. "If he were the cause
of it, we would have acted long be
fore this, he commented. When asked
the significance of the clause that all
pledges should be "acceptable to all
members in all chapters," he said: "It
really doesn't mean a whole bunch."
Nonetheless, many of the members
of the local chapter feel that the race
issue is at the heart of the matter,
according to Chapter President Dan

Kirby. "Difficulties with the national
began accelerating two years ago
when Palacio was pledged", Kirby
said. Last quarter the national head
quarters pointed out that Palacio and
another member of the house had
failed to maintain the necessary grade
point average, and that they would
have to be depledged. Kirby com
mented that the national had brought
the rule to the chapter's attention,
but admitted that there had been no
other such cases requiring action in
the recent past.
Temporary Suspension?
National representative Mahoney,
however, pointed out that suspension
for financial reasons is common and
that there are presently nine other
chapters of Kappa Sigma on suspen
sion for these reasons. He further
stated that the suspension is intended
to be temporary, with reinstatement
hinging on these financial considera
tions.
The local chapter, for its part, is
largely in favor of working the situa
tion out with the national, according
to Kirby.
While it is believed that the Stan
ford chapter was the first to pledge
a Negro, the San Jose chapter this
year followed suit.

Mahoney outlined the reasons for
the suspension as stemming from
financial problems and violations of
national rules and the constitution.
Elaborating on the financial picture,
he stated that the chapter had been
placed under alumni control in Jan
uary, but that the deficit had
worsened since that time.
The chapter's treasurer, Bill Vogel
pohl denied that the house's financial
situation has worsened this year. "In
fact," he said, "it's gotten better and
as it looks, it will continue to do so.'

Mahoney specifically denied that
the suspension has anything to do
with the fact that the Stanford chap
ter pledged Rafe Palacio, a Negro,
two years ago. "If he were the cause
of it, we would have acted long be
fore this, he commented. When asked
the significance of the clause that all
pledges should be "acceptable to all
members in all chapters," he said: "It
really doesn't mean a whole bunch."
Nonetheless, many of the members
of the local chapter feel that the race
issue is at the heart of the matter,
according to Chapter President Dan

Kirby. "Difficulties with the national
began accelerating two years ago
when Palacio was pledged", Kirby
said. Last quarter the national head
quarters pointed out that Palacio and
another member of the house had
failed to maintain the necessary grade
point average, and that they would
have to be depledged. Kirby com
mented that the national had brought
the rule to the chapter's attention,
but admitted that there had been no
other such cases requiring action in
the recent past.
Temporary Suspension?
National representative Mahoney,
however, pointed out that suspension
for financial reasons is common and
that there are presently nine other
chapters of Kappa Sigma on suspen
sion for these reasons. He further
stated that the suspension is intended
to be temporary, with reinstatement
hinging on these financial considera
tions.
The local chapter, for its part, is
largely in favor of working the situa
tion out with the national, according
to Kirby.
While it is believed that the Stan
ford chapter was the first to pledge
a Negro, the San Jose chapter this
year followed suit.
While the local chapter of Kappa
Sigma fraternity has definitely been
suspended, the reasons for that action
by the national headquarters are also
suspended in a welter of conflicting
claims and opinions. The reason for
this state of affairs is partly that the
local chapter has yet to receive official
communication from the national fra
ternity, headquartered in Charlottes
ville, Virginia.
That this communication has been
sent, however, was confirmed yester
day in a telephone interview with
Worthy Grand Scribe Robert Ma
