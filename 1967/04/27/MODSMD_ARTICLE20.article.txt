## Candidates Account For Withdrawal 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It is my present intention to
announce withdrawal from the
•"ace for ASSU President. I wish
to make myself clear on this
point, as I entertain no notions
of re-entering nor support in the
form of a write-in campaign as
has been mentioned in certain
corners among certain of my
friends on this, the Stanford
■ampus.
I wish to say, so as not to cloud
my withdrawal with any tinges
of political chicanery or collu
sion, that I support not a one of
the candidates involved in the
rave for office. If I did, then it
would have made small sense
for me to enter in the beginning.
It was my feeling, at first an
nouncing candidacy, that the is
sues raised before the student
body were of not enough import
t.o justify a legitimate campaign
for the Presidency. Hence my en
trance.
However, there is an old say
ing that goes like, "If the Horse
ain't got it, He just can't trot it."
This refers to a social and spirit
ual condition, the first referring
f o a man's role and relationship
to others in the world about him.
The second involves the
thoughts, dreams, ambitions, de
sires of Man when, looking out
at the world, he begins to won
der where his place is and de
spairs at his emptiness.
Relate To Politics
I had hoped to relate this, in a
zeal way, to the politics of a
Stanford. I had hoped to show
where there was real need for
concern on the part of the stu
dent body as to its place in the
-vorld not four years from now,
not tomorrow from now, not to
day as opposed to this moment.
No, but rather, concern on the
part of each and every one of
you as to your own places in the
lives of others.
The best example I can think
jf is the controversy surround
ing the Upward Bound Program,
of which I am intimately con
cerned. Its aim is to lift low
grade, high-potential high school
students into the reference
frame necessary to keep on try
ing, and not to die. Its world is
clear, as is the subject matter.
The first is the deprived areas,
The Slums, of this country where
illiteracy is still rampant. Na
tional reading norms for Ne
groes as opposed to whites, for
example, are 11.0 to 12.0 on the
whole; and, in particular in
stances, as in my former high
school class, sixth grade (6.0)
is opposed to a national norm
of 12.0.
Subject: People
The subject matter is People.
People like those who live all
around us, inside of Stanford, as
we go about each day insulated
and isolated. Menlo Park, Menlo-
Atherton, East Palo Alto are to
be affected by a Federal Poverty
Program Upward Bound Pro
gram that entails Stanford's util
ization of $59,000.
There is no representation of
the residents of that area on the
soliciting boards, there is no rep
resentation of the residents of
that area on the distribution
boards, there is no representa
tion of the residents of that area
on the tutoring boards. No one,
no face. No where.
Hence, Stanford has been pick
eted, even while it voted to re
ceive this money after having
had to curtail one program last
quarter because of inadequate
funds and an even greater sense
of distancing between student
md-tutor. The hoped-for cultural
exchange involved in such a
meaningful situation had not
oeen obscured by purely pedan
tic, or purely economic, or purely
intellectual interests. It had been
completely perverted because its
Essence, the cultural confronta
tion of black and white, had de
generated into a one-track affair
* hat resulted in a complete men
ial orgasm for the white, and a

complete disenchantment for the
black.
Spoke Of Boycott
It has been said, and I had
spent the last two days in East
Palo Alto talking with concerned
citizens and students, that there
will be a 100 per cent boycott
of the program. No students for
the tutors. No cooperation for
the officials. A complete break
down in communication between
University and Community. The
continuation of a sadly lacking
educational system.
But, with one big difference.
This time the educational and
cultural lag in terms of achieve
ment norms would be extended
because the subordinated, the
needy, felt the brunt of the cold
shoulder. As with a man having
pride, so, too, with a world hav
ing a face. No matter its color.
It would be hypocrisy to say
Stanford should be purely con
cerned with its own academic
programs.
Stanford has no positive image
in the outside deprived areas,
even those closest to it, because
of the simple fact that intoler
ance, even now, is being prac
ticed and everyone is so hung
up in who's who on the social
ledger until no one could hardly
give a damn as to what is going
on in those areas.
More Than Awareness
The "Community of Scholars"
is a joke if all that comes of it is
increased academic awareness.
Education involves responsibil
ity, the responsibility of every
one on Miis campus, no matter
their family background, their
ideological orientation, their pet
hangup (i.e., psychedelphia or
Birchism, Women's Housing or
Volleyball for the Masses K
To say otherwise is to lie. To
say otherwise is to show ignor
ance. Intellectual non-sophisti
cation. Social backwardness. A
reverted mobility. A don't-care
attitude.
Reservation will never ac
complish this end. To pursue and
echo these demands in the Ad
ministrative capacity demands a
knowledge of channels, since
that is how America operates,
which is beyond my own re
sources. Whether or not my run
ning-mate, Ralph Baxter, cares
to endorse any of the particular
stable of horses is his own affair.
Myself, as Pontius Pilate, I wash
my hands clean of the affair.
I would like to thank those of
you who have helped make it
possible that I might run. I
would like to extend credit to the
members of my own campaign
staff who labored far beyond
their own capacities, only to be
hampered by time, finances, and
resources.
Most of all, I thank myself
that, before it was too late, I be
came involved in an issue that I
would have given too much of
myself to, that I believed too
seriously in.

• Opts Out
Editor, The Daily:
In withdrawing from the cam
paign for ASSU president, I
wish to urge support of Joe
Reich and Jeff Kane. They rep
resent a meaningful attempt to
provide a new basis for student
government which will end "in
loco parentis" and establish a
base for the expression of stu

dent rights as well as student
responsibilities.
I am also disturbed by the
poor coverage which Joe and
Jeff have received. Hopefully, a
more balanced coverage of the
candidates will be presented dur
ing the rest of the campaign.

• Other Endeavors
Editor, The Daily:
Two days ago, the Constitu
tional Anarchist forces in the
Law School, riding the crest of
a ground swell of popular senti
ment, buoyed by the enthusiasm
that springs from belief in a
cause which is just, prematurely
submitted my name as a candi
date for ASSU President.
At this time, I must retire my
candidacy. I am deeply grieved
that I must betray all those who
saw in me a hope for a brighter
tomorrow and a vision of an ad
ministration which would realize
the goal of social justice (while,
of course, respecting capital's
right to a fair return), which
would throb with revolutionary
vitality (but with a respectful
eye always toward the proper
seat of authority and our Stan
ford traditions).

• Too Many Odds
Editor, The Dally:
As one who spent last sum
mer teaching in an Upward
Bound program, I fully support
the East Palo Alto community
in its protests against Stanford.
Their demands are, it seems to
me, totally realistic. Such pro
grams can be successful only
when the last vestiges of pa
ternalism are removed, and
when the programs actually be
long to the people they are sup
posed to be benefitting.
Even then, given the meager
funds (e.g., Stanford), they may
prove inadequate. They become,
then, token programs, and they
work to divide the poor, who
spend their energies, not work
ing together to demand what
should be theirs, but fighting
one another for the inadequate
funds that have been put onto
what one government official
has called "the battlefield."
That the East Palo Alto com
munity recognizes this is heart
ening, and Stanford should lis
ten to them. In addition, my
own experience in the program
leads me to believe that, even
with the present cut-backs,
many more children could be in
volved, if 1) 90 percent of the
administrators were dropped,
and 2) portions of the ridicu
lously high salaries of these ad
ministrators were put back into
the program.
Students such as the ones I
taught last summer worked too
hard against too many odds to
receive short-change treatment.
And there are too many of them
who can use this kind of pro
gram to allow the waste and
paternalism to continue. If Stan
ford is on the side of the East
Palo Alto community, it will see
that their demands are met.

• Scared Away?
Editor, The Daily:
It is a frustrating feeling in
deed when one's urge to alter

an "institution" is thwarted by
the fact that the object of hos
tilities is willing to consider
reasonable and well thought out
demands. In such a case, one
must either surrender his revo
lutionary flavor, or probe about
the "institution" until he finds
some sort of Achilles Heel, and
then attack it with all the little
pins and needles than can be
fashioned out of warped facts
and discarded issues.
It would appear that Mr. Joe
Reich and Mr. Jeff Kane have
found just such a method, de
signed to stir things up without
having to worry about their de
mands being criticized for their
absurdity. Their theory is quite
sinple; don't make any demands.
Merely state "facts" and pre
sent them to a group of people
that has no way of refuting
their authenticity.
"The Other Side"
The group to which we refer
is a large number of high school
students who have been accepted
to Stanford and visited the cam
pus last Saturday to participate
in the High School Day pro
gram. As the students entered
Cubberly, they were handed a
statement composed by the
above gentlemen entitled "So
you want to come Stanford? or,
The other side of the Story."
The statement opened as fol
lows: "You have been accepted
to Stanford now, and you have
probably read several publica
tions about Stanford. But these
publications by their very na
ture are one sided. In order to
present you with the student's
point of view, we have prepared
this paper.
"It must be quite a shock to a
high school student who had
previously viewed Stanford as
an educational community, to
find out that it is actually a
divided camp. The inference
must be that on one side we
have the mighty administration
(publishing propaganda and
mailing it to unsuspecting high
school students) and on the
other side we have the students,
suppressed, but fighting back
under the leadership of Mr.
Kane and Mr. Reich.
Unhappy Campus
To one who have never attend
ed Stanford, this conclusion may
not seem quite so absurd, and
he might well infer that Stan
ford is a divided and unhappy
campus.
The leaflet went on to sum
marize "facts" concerning hous
ing, the ratio, overseas campus
es, Negroes at Stanford, admini
strative power, and Pre-Reg
week. The two authors could
have saved themselves some
trouble had they taken the time
to read the literature already in
the students' possession. They
would have found that the ad
ministration had done an elo
quent job of presenting the
same facts which they included
under their readings: Residence
at Stanford, The Ratio, and
Overseas Campuses.
The section which they in
cluded under Administrative
Power was, in fact, constructed
out of three issues long forgot
ten by the rest of the commu
nity. Perhaps the most destruc
tive part of the summary was
the short section on Pre-Reg
week: "We would advise that
you miss it if you can. What it
amounts to is a series of lec

tures and social gatherings and
it won't be particularly specta
cular or enlightening."
Pre-Reg Schedule
Obviously, these gentlemen
have not taken the trouble to
read the 1967 Pre>Reg schedule.
The events are designed to pre
sent the freshmen with the free
dom of choice to sample many
of the kinds of opportunities
available to them during their
four years in the Stanford com
munity.
Among other things there will
be hostels at faculty and ad
ministration members' homes,
an "Evening at Tressider" with
many small and large group ac
tivities going on simultaneously,
and optional lectures by profes
sors, students and other persons.
Whether the freshmen become
"enlightened" will depend on
their attitude and degree of par
ticipation.
They concluded: "We could
tell you more, but you probably
have the idea bv now.' What is
the idea gentlemen? Is it venting
personal frustrations by mas
querading as representatives of
the student body, and thereby
aggravating any dichotomy
which may exist by trying to
discourage talented students
from attending Stanford? This
does not seem to be a very con
structive program for two men
aspiring to be President and
Vice-President of the Associated
Students.
