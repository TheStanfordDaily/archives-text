# The
						Real Stanford?
## 
### 
Two hundred fifty high school students who
have been offered admission came here last
weekend to see what Stanford is really like.
Unfortunately, they only saw the country club
and were not given a glimpse of the educa
tional experience which, supposedly, is central
to university life.
The purpose of High School Day was to
help these students make their final decision
about Stanford. What they saw, however, is
very different from what they will see next
year. Saturday's intellectual experience, for in
stance, was limited to a lecture Dean Napier
delivered especially for them. Certainly the
lecture was outstanding, but is this a typical
look at Stanford education? Might they not
have seen a more accurate picture had they
been given the opportunity to attend lectures
or seminars?
The basic failure of High School Day lies in
that it was planned for a Saturday. Had the
students been invited to visit the campus
during the week, they might have seen what

Stanford offers in the area of education. They
might have been able to speak to a cross-sec
tion of students, rather than just guides from
fraternities and Cardinals Board. They might
have observed some of the many spontaneous
activities which take place on an average day,
rather than having to sit through a Ram's Head
production especially planned for them. And
maybe some of the men could have eaten in
residences other than fraternities.
Two Stanford students who recognized the
artificiality of High School Day tried to bal
ance the picture by handing out leaflets en
titled "The other side of Stanford." Unfortu
nately, they failed just as miserably, for their
statement contained blatant factual errors and
was characterized by a one-sidedness at least
equal to that of the day's program.
But Ja.V: Board did not let us down
completely. D most of the day, men and
women were kept separate, presumably be
cause men walk faster. In at least one area, the
potential freshmen saw the real Stanford.
