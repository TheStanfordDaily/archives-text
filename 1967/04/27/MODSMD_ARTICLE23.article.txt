## Will The Wilbur Experiment Be Hung Up On Social Regs? 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Sometimes no news is good
news. At Stanford no news is
usually bad news, and for the
longest while we have heard
nothing about the Wilbur Ex
periment, an experiment which
|| will demonstrate conclusively
|[the value and necessity of co
educational dormitories empha
sizing common intellectual goals.
One wonders why such a pro
posal, planned so extensively by
student, faculty, and administra
tive groups, has not been im
mediately and avidly begun. Al
ready many students, at the
freshmen dormitories, in frater
nities, at Stern, and off-campus,
are wondering where to sign up.
It would be a shame, if like
the Grove House, its approval
came so late that only a few
could consider it as a wonderful
option for next year.
Social Reg Question
Why might not the project be
approved? The physical require
ments of the Wilbur Experi
ment are minimal, and have
fortunately been worked out in
detail. Its intellectual goals
brook no quarrel. Its singular
aspect is, of course, its coedu
cational structure and the im
plications coeducation has for
University social regulations.
One would be surprised, in
this modern age, if social regu
lations were still an issue, but
perhaps to some they are. Thus
it might be pertinent to raise
the question of social regula
tions once more.
First, we must begin with
facts. There is disregard for Uni
versity social regulations in the
following living groups:
Alpha Delta Phi, Lambda
Nu, Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha

Tau Omicron, Beta Chi, Beta
Theta Pi, Chi Psi, Delta Chi,
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta
Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma
Delta, Phi Kappa Sigma, Phi
Sigma Kappa, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Theta Chi,
Theta Delta Chi, TTieta Xi,
Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall,
Roble Hall, Branner Hall. La
gunita Court, Florence Moore
Hall, Durand House, Gutherie
House, Hurlburt House, Jor
dan House, Lathrop House,
Roth House, Stillman House,
Storey House, Hoskins House,
and Toyon Hall.
Reports Say ...
There are no known viola
tions at:
Memorial Chapel, Tresidder
Union, The Stanford Libraries,
the Post Office, the Book store,
the Think Tank, and Union
Residence.
There are reports of student
discourse and intercourse at the
which therefore was not con
whole, seem desirous of coedu
cational coeducation. According
to a recent study which there
was no need to conduct and
which therefore was no con
ducted, over ninety per cent of
the students reported that "the
opposite sex is valuable." By ex
ample and teaching, the vast
majority of adults students
know seem to concur.
Limit Togetherness
However, the issue of social
regulations cannot suffer at the
hands of Human History. Many
modern universities have found
that social regulations can be
extended. One, in fact, has an
nounced that "students shall

think together only from 7 to
11 on Tuesday and Saturday eve
nings."
This was based on the dis
covery that students who think
too often tend to impregnate
each other with dangerous and
lively ideas. Studies show that
students "get into trouble" by
opposing outmoded viewpoints.
Happily, Stanford has not yet
created such extended social reg
ulations. In consequence, many
students have said they are pre
pared to become very alarmed
if even the current social regula
tions prevent them from living
in the way human beings have
traditionally favored.
Of Course
The University of course now
realizes that social regulations
should be buried in the Stanford
graves, and that coeducational
projects will become as familiar
to the student as, well, the
Packer Committee.
The University of course re
alizes that were even a student
to suggest that social regula
tions should be heavily enforced,
that Stanford cannot move for
ward in its time of experimenta
tion without constraining and
oppressing the education from
interpersonal and coeducational
experience, he should be ignor
ed. "If not ignored, then faced
with a convincing variety of
arguments.
Fortunately the University in
its actions and its willingness
to experiment at the Grove and
with the Wilbur Experiment will
join the student in its focus on
genuine questions of education
and student life. Now it is mere
ly repetitious and boring to talk
about social regulations. Don't
you think?
