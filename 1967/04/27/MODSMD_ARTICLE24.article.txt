## Review Misses Play's Beauty 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It is usually not fruitful to
quarrel with a reviewer, but in
the case of Bruce Merry's re
cent review of The Beard a
slight domestic quarrel, so to
speak, seems in order.
A major difficulty faced by
the author of The Beard was
how to employ common four
letter words in American dis
course which are usually
thought of as vulgar and shock
ing in a way which would, final
ly, render their use musical,
playful, and even pleasing. A
more serious difficulty was to
dramatize the sexual relation
ship between two rough, earthy
American folk heroes, Harlow
and Billy the Kid, in a way
which would reveal between
them a fragile but lovely bond
of mutual respect, communica
tion, and concern for each other.
Mr. Merry's review of The
Beard does not overcome these
difficulties; his report of the
play never escapes the vulgari
ty, prurience, and flirtation with
obscenity, which it was the tri
umph of the play to transcend.
It was, perhaps, for this reason
that "no one walked out," and
that the audience as a whole
(and certainly the large group
that publicly discussed it after
wards at Mem What?) seemed
to react with a sense of rever
ence and beauty.

To be sure, The Beard is not
a great play. The degree of com
munication between Harlow and
Billy is not as extensive, com
plicated, or subtle as heterosex
ual relationships often are. One
would wish that human beings
could attain a much higher de
gree of communication and hon
esty in their sexual relationships
than Harlow and Billy manage
in the play: their principle
seems to have been to make
both love and war. Yet, given
the roughness, the illusions, and
the myth of male mastery ac
cepted by the protagonists (and
by countless others in American
society), one could not help be
ing touched by the communica
tion and mutual respect which
Billy and Harlow finally achieve.
Americans do not commonly
think of their own parents as
sexual partners, and a studied
silence regarding sexual inter
course is commonly maintained
in family movies and on family
television. Yet every American
household is the scene of sexual
intercourse and I, for one, am
glad that the American stage
can now treat of a human ac
tion so fundamental to our lives.
Stanford was honored by the
performance of The Beard, mod
est though that play is in its
aim and in its achievement, and
I think Mr. Merry did us all a

disservice by reporting the play
in the terms that he did.

• Hardened Himself
Editor, The Daily:
In his column in yesterday's
Daily, Barry Greenberg careful
ly condemns the "distortion of
the truth" caused by the over
simplification of complex is
sues. But it is only too typical
of his kind of thought that in
championing an unassailable
principle and indicting others
for its violation, he brazenly re
sorts to the very conduct he de
cries. Greenberg's article is
characterized by the same dis
torting and simplifying that he
ascribes to his political oppo
nents.
Greenberg explains that the
promoters of the petition to
deny The Experiment perma
nent University housing "argue
on the basis of two specific po
litical activities that The Experi
ment is simply a political or
ganization," which assertion, "as
anyone familiar with The Ex
periment knows, is a gross dis
tortion of the truth."
Suffice it to say that anyone
familiar with the "anti-Experi

ment" petition knows that its
proponents have never denied
that The Experiment functions
in part as a "valid" educational
endeavor, nor have they ever
maintained that The Experiment
is merely a political organiza
tion. To quote from the peti
tion: "We have no objection to
The Experiment insofar as it
involves itself with academic in
novation, but, by its own initia
tive, The Experiment has chosen
to spoil its credibility as an aca
demic institution by consistently
involving itself in direct po
litical action and by espousing
one basic ideological view
point . .
Barry Greenberg claims The
Experiment is not "committee"
to a particular ideology or set
of dogmatic political principles
or assumptions." This is ob
viously quite debatable. But few
could debate Mr. Greenberg's
glib inclusion of himself in tha.
group which tends to be caught
in "hardening of the categories.

• Army Of C.O.'s?
Editor, The Daily:
Surely you must have mis
quoted the draft objector who
stated in the April 25 Daily that
he favored an all-volunteer
Army, like that proposed bv
Sen. Mark Hatfield. His remark
implied that he didn't really care
that a war was In progress, a
long as the inevitable blood was
on somebody else's hands.
Sounds a bit suspect.
For the draft objectors in gen
eral, I have a suggestion. Th
campaign to abolish war doesn't
seem to be going too well thes#»
days. And the prospects of rally
ing popular support seem grim
—after all, consider all the peo
ple in California whose jobs de
pend on the Vietnam war.
Why not try working 112 r oru
within instead of from without?
The plan is simple: all draft oK
jectors enlist in the Army en
masse and request duty in Viet
nam. Stage two: When you all
get to the front lines, you sim
ply sit down and empty your
rifles, and wait for the peace
loving Viet Cong to reciprocate.
Are you still with me, gentle
men?
