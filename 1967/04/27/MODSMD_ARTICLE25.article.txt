## Bid Rush 'Farewell' 
### Bill Wertz 
Now that the Presidential
campaign has started, I offer a
suggestion to any group of can
didates that will listen.
It is time to take a clear, hard
look at Rush. What does it ac
complish?
Rush is designed to acquire
new members for fraternities
and eating clubs, without whom
these groups could not long
exist. But what a ridiculous way
to decide with whom you are
going to live!
It should be obvious that the
more you know about the alter
natives before you,, the better
you ari able to make a decision.
Yet Rush seems designed to
hinder any real knowledge.
Every year someone things of
a new restriction limiting the
contact between freshmen and
fraternities. The result:
No Rational Choice
Freshmen can't make a ra
tional decision about which fra
ternity to join, or indeed, wheth
er to join one at all, because
they don't really know what the
fraternities are like; fraternities
can't make a rational decision
about which freshmen to choose,
because they don't know what
the freshmen are really like.
How can you decide whether
or not you want to join a frater
nity when you can only go to
four open houses and a few
parties, and you know that
everything is being done to im
press you?
How can you decide which
fraternity to join when you have
about 16 hours to visit 20 of
them?
How can you choose a fresh
man to live with you when
you've just met 100 of them and
gotten as far as asking each
where he lives and what he is
majoring in?
Long Time Delusion
How can you reject a fresh
man who wants to live with you
when someone who has talked
to him for five minutes says,
"This guy is a real loser," and
a group of others is yelling
"Let's hurry up or we'll be here
all night?"
You can't, of course, and it is
hard to see how intelligent peo
ple have deluded themselves for
so long.
Let's abolish Rush altogether.
Let's establish a deadline for
freshmen to decide where
they're going to live and then
leave everybody alone.

Will the end of Rush mean
the end of fraternities? Of
course not. Fraternities need
new members, but a rush should
n't be necessary to get them.
If fraternities have any value,
that value should be apparent
without being thrust upon you
during Rush.
Remove Restrictions
Freshmen have unrestricted
access to dormitories and off
campus apartments. Let's give
them the same access to eating
clubs and fraternities, and let
them visit whenever they want
to and talk to anyone who will
talk to them. Let's let frater
nities invite freshmen to meals
and to parties whenever they
want to.
Will the absence of rushing

regulations mean that rich fra
ternities will be able to lure
freshmen away from other liv
ing alternatives with lavish
parties and other entertainment?
Any individual Stanford student
would be insulted by the impli
cation that he could be bought
in that manner. Why assume it
of freshmen?
Let's take away the artificial
pressure of Rush and assume
that 18-year-old Stanford stu
dents have the wisdom and bal
ance to make rational decisions,
given a chance to explore the al
ternatives.
Getting rid of Rush will give
them this chance, and both fra
ternities and freshmen, as well
as the Stanford community will
be benefitted.
