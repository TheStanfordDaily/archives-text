# The 						Experiment Seeks Greater Communication Among Members
## 
### WYNNE FURTH 
Does The Experiment need a hypo
thesis, and some sort of internal elect
ed structure to replace the current
"natural anarchy" in view of its grow
ing political activity?
The consensus at the general meet
ing held yesterday afternoon in The
Experiment building, the first of its
kind since October, was that the cur
rent ambiguity and informality are
desirable, but communication among
members needs improvement.
Coordinator Barry Greenberg sug
gested that the problem of finding a
building for The Experiment after its
May 30th eviction was not a matter
for discussion, but rather continued
negotiation and search, while noting
that the petition in support of con
tinuing The Experiment on campus
has been signed by 1300 people.
Posters Not Indicative
Discussion instead was on the po
litical activities of The Experiment,
which have increased while seminar
enrollment and cultural events have
remained relatively constant. The
key issue was the "We Accuse" post
ers posted on campus during Spring
Mobilization Week.
Greenberg said that the posters,
printed and distributed by a small
number of Experiment members with
Experiment funds, were "politically,
morally, and tactically questionable,"

and a reflection of the larger prob
lem of lack of communication in an
organization with a small number of
active members.
Greenberg and others denied that
The Experiment, as a "radical com
munity," can be political, but agreed
that the aim and mode of political
expression was difficult to determine.
It was suggested that in the future
major political acts be preceded by
general discussion.
Needs Improved Communication
A number of people said that im
proved communication, rather than
more structured organization, is need
ed. A weekly newsletter, available at
The Experiment building, to publicize
current and proposed activities, was
recommended, as was a "position
paper" detailing the past year's acti
vities and outlining the goals of the
"Experiment community."
Ira Arlook maintained that "struc
ture will deaden what we have," and
pointed out that "what's involved in
membership sets the limits of what
The Experiment can do. For some, it

is a very total deal( while for others
it is a supplementary, or at least sec
ondary commitment."
One member added that there are
those who as dues payers, buy the
services of the organization, rather
than taking part in the community.
