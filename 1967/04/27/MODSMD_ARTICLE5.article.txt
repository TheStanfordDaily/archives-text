# Scott, Jennings Retire From Prexy Race
## 
### 
Two more candidates for ASSU
president dropped out of the elec
tion yesterday — Johnie Scott, a
sophomore, and J. D. Jennings, a law
student.
In a letter to The Dally, Scott de
tailed his dissatisfaction with Stan
ford's "Community of Scholars,"
calling it "a joke if all that comes of
it is increased academic awareness."
He continued that to pursue the ends
he wants "demands a knowledge of
channels, since that is how America
operates, which is beyond my re
sources."
Jennings claimed "Constitutional
Anarchist forces" in the Law School
had submitted a petition nominating
him without his knowledge.
Meanwhile, freshman Richard Bo
gart claimed that his running mate,
Mark Schumacher withdrew their
nomination for vice president and
president without telling him. Bogart
at first said he intended to run alone
for vice president, but yesterday af
ternoon he was disqualified by Elec

tions Commissioner Bill Berry, wfco
said only two man tickets could run
for the top ASSU offices.
Berry also ruled that senior class
president candidates could enter
without a running mate and that
students will vote separately for sen
ior class president and vice president.
Jennings «■ i in a letter to The
Daily that ; "deeply grieved that
I must ' all those who saw in
me a a brighter tomorrow
and a \i„. Df an administration
which would realize the goal of social
justice. Unfortunately my efforts are
already committed to other endeavors
designed to raise men's sights to the
firament."
Scott said that he is withdrawing
from the contest in favor of no onp.
He added that if he had supported
any of the other candidates, "it would
have made small sense for me to run
in the beginning." Schumacher and
Bogart both withdrew in favor of Joe
Reich and Jeff Kane.
