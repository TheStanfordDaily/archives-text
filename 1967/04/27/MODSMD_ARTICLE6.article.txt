# ASSU Candidates Debate Experiment, ROTC
## 
### 
"Peter Lyman is the man to beat,"
claimed Pete Hansen last night as
four of the five candidates for ASSU
President addressed the Stanford
Young Republicans in Serra lounge.
Hansen, Joe Reich, Fritz Schaefer,
and Tom Shanahan each gave a short
talk and then the four answered
questions for over an hour. Peter Ly
man, the fifth candidate, did not ac
cept the invitation to speak.
Hansen further claimed that "if we
don't get out the moderate forces,
Lyman could well win a majority in
the primary." Shanahan, who earlier

in the evening had tangled with Ly
man in a question period at Roble,
criticized Lyman for "not addressing
himself to the kinds of issues we
should be electing a student body
president one." Shanahan said defin
ing philosophies of education should
not be the criteria for election.
Experiment Funds
The four centered much of their
discussion on LASSU's approapria
tion of funds to the Experiment.
Schaefer said he was opposed to giv
ing funds to the Experiment, due to
its political involvement.

Shanahan and Hansen supported
the integration of education and po
litical action as a legitimate aim and
would support funding of the Ex
periment if it could separate its di
rect political action and its seminars.
Both took exception to the recent
"We Accuse" posters which they
claimed were paid for with LASSU
funds. Reich said he was demonstrat
ing with the posters. However, he did
feel it presumptuous for the Experi
ment to use LASSU funds to pay for
the posters.
Board of Trustees
When asked to comment on student

access to the Board of Trustees,
Schaefer said the ASSU President
should have the right to present views
to the Board. Shanahan called for
some form of access to the Board but
said students already had access
through informal discussions with in
dividual members on and off campus.
Hansen and Reicl: called for stu
dent and faculty representation on
the Board. "They have a legal right
to run the University, but there is no
other evidence of competence," says
Reich. Hansen claims the board "has
tried to become too active in the ad
ministration of the University."
All the candidates except Reich
stated that ROTC has a place on the
college campus. Hansen and Shana
han, who is in army ROTC, said the
academic credit given the courses
should be reviewed and possibly
eliminated, unless the courses are
brought up to the academic standards
of the University.
Internal Tension?
Shanahan answered questions con
cerning the more liberal stance of
his running mate Henry Levinson.
He defended their ticket and said "we
do agree." Shanahan claims the dif
ference in their political circles faci
litate drawing many students into
student government next year.
Schaefer continued to push his pro
gram of ridding the University of the
Berkeley image. "I thing our Univer
sity has an awful lot more to offer
the world than Mario Savio, Bettina
Aptheker, and our own Dave Harris."

the Board. "They have a legal right
to run the University, but there is no
other evidence of competence," says
Reich. Hansen claims the board "has
tried to become too active in the ad
ministration of the University."
All the candidates except Reich
stated that ROTC has a place on the
college campus. Hansen and Shana
han, who is in army ROTC, said the
academic credit given the courses
should be reviewed and possibly
eliminated, unless the courses are
brought up to the academic standards
of the University.
Internal Tension?
Shanahan answered questions con
cerning the more liberal stance of
his running mate Henry Levinson.
He defended their ticket and said "we
do agree." Shanahan claims the dif
ference in their political circles faci
litate drawing many students into
student government next year.
Schaefer continued to push his pro
gram of ridding the University of the
Berkeley image. "I thing our Univer
sity has an awful lot more to offer
the world than Mario Savio, Bettina
Aptheker, and our own Dave Harris."
"Peter Lyman is the man to beat,"
claimed Pete Hansen last night as
four of the five candidates for ASSU
President addressed the Stanford
Young Republicans in Serra lounge.
Hansen, Joe Reich, Fritz Schaefer,
and Tom Shanahan each gave a short
talk and then the four answered
questions for over an hour. Peter Ly
man, the fifth candidate, did not ac
cept the invitation to speak.
Hansen further claimed that "if we
don't get out the moderate forces,
Lyman could well win a majority in
the primary." Shanahan, who earlier

in the evening had tangled with Ly
man in a question period at Roble,
criticized Lyman for "not addressing
himself to the kinds of issues we
should be electing a student body
president one." Shanahan said defin
ing philosophies of education should
not be the criteria for election.
Experiment Funds
The four centered much of their
discussion on LASSU's approapria
tion of funds to the Experiment.
Schaefer said he was opposed to giv
ing funds to the Experiment, due to
its political involvement.

Shanahan and Hansen supported
the integration of education and po
litical action as a legitimate aim and
would support funding of the Ex
periment if it could separate its di
rect political action and its seminars.
Both took exception to the recent
"We Accuse" posters which they
claimed were paid for with LASSU
funds. Reich said he was demonstrat
ing with the posters. However, he did
feel it presumptuous for the Experi
ment to use LASSU funds to pay for
the posters.
Board of Trustees
When asked to comment on student

access to the Board of Trustees,
Schaefer said the ASSU President
should have the right to present views
to the Board. Shanahan called for
some form of access to the Board but
said students already had access
through informal discussions with in
dividual members on and off campus.
Hansen and Reicl: called for stu
dent and faculty representation on
the Board. "They have a legal right
to run the University, but there is no
other evidence of competence," says
Reich. Hansen claims the board "has
tried to become too active in the ad
ministration of the University."
All the candidates except Reich
