# Sensory Immersion
## Zen Master To Deliver Meditation Address 
### BILL EVERS 
Edward Maupin, who has perhaps
the only Ph.D. in meditation, will be
in Tresidder's small lounge this eve
ning at 8:15.
Dr. Maupin is the originator of the
"symbo experiment," an experience
in the group dynamics of meditation
and an attempt to transcend the sep
arateness of language and people. It
takes a minimum of three hours, so
Dr. Maupin will be unable to do it
tonight.
The symbo experiment itself de

mands two basic assumptions from
the persons participating. The first is
that the members of the group recog
nize it as an organism which has not
yet found wholeness, has not come
together. This is akin to the idea of
6 or 8 parts of a schizophrenic mind
trying to come together.
From this point the problem is for
each member of the group to find out
"what is" with himself. The second
assumption is that each person is to
be accepted as he is. There is no need
to change.

Articles by Dr. Maupin on medi
tation and Zen Buddhism have ap
peared in Psychedelic Review and
Journal of Consulting Psychology. In
the Journal he says of Zen: "The be
ginning student spends a portion of
the day sitting motionless and en
gaging in concentration. The object
of concentration varies and may be
changed as the student progresses.
The aim of the practice is to suspend
the ordinary flow of thoughts without
falling into a stupor. Usually there is
an initial phase in which concentra-

tion is extremely difficult. With great
er success, relaxation and a kind of
pleasant 'self-immersion' follow. At
this point internal distractions, often
of an anxiety-arousing kind, come to
the fore. Eventually another phase
begins, in which concentration is ac
companied by a sense of calm still
ness, a sense of energy and vitality,
and a feeling of invulnerability.'
Dr. Maupin was for several years
an Assistant Professor of Medical
Psychology at UCLA's Neuropsychi
atric Institute. He is now at Eslaen
Institute in Big Sur.
