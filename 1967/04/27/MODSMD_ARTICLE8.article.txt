# Senior Prexy Candidates Voice Aims For Next Year
## 
### CICELY BATES 
Seven candidates for Senior Class President
have filed petitions for the May 3 and May 4
general elections. The presidential hopefuls
are Mark Fogelman, Richard Werschkul, Rob
ert Zander, Mel Knox, Martin Kuchnert,
Soleng Tom, and Terry Ross.
Fogelman advocates moving traditional
senior functions into private homes to elimin
ate the necessity of seniors having to show
their I.D.'s in order to join in the festivities.
He also questions the importance of keeping
the Senior Ball formal. If elected he would
initiate a referendum on the possibility of
making it semi-formal.
Fogelman advocates the start of a tutorial
program in which students could receive valid
Information concerning graduate schools.
Class Directory
A class directory is another promise that he
will try to fulfill. Furthermore for seniors with
a desire to help others, he wants to have the
class adopt several Vietnamese orphans.

Fogelman's running mate is Robin Wise
man.
Widening senior government channels is
the main task set forth by Werschkul. He ad
vocates more committees to make his plan
work. He also wants the senior class to take
a more active political role and serve as a
means for students to give opinions. Question
naires and opinion polls should become more
important to let LASSU and the whole school
know more about the thoughts of the senior
class.
Career Information
Werschkul furthermore believes that more
career information should be made available
and that placement services should work more
closely with the students. He would like to
make more outside speakers available to
career-seeking seniors.
Werschkul thinks traditional senior affairs
are a must to further contacts between seniors
and would like to augment them.
Lee Wimberly, now in Austria, is Wer

schkuls running mate.
Happier Happy Hours
"Ace" Knox, if elected pledges happier
happy hours which would include everything
from dirty movies to a three day acid-orgy
in the wind tunnel of the Linear Accelerator.
Abolition of the Heritage Fund with the
money going to the Diggers is Knox's second
crusade. Also in order, he feels, are military
rallies in White Memorial Plaza that would
promote his only "ism"—Americanism.
Stanford in Tangiers would be a great addi
tion to the university, believes Knox, as would
be a Lash Laroo Fan Club.
Knox has no running mate because he did
not know that he needed one and feels that
he is man enough to handle both jobs.
Senior Calendar
Immediate action is the main emphasis of
Kuchnert's campaign. The senior year should
be split up into quarters with the publication
of a senior calendar marking significant
events.

In the fall Kuchnert wants to have a grad
uate school forum lasting 2 to 3 days and a
job forum lasting the same length of time
for those who are not going on in their school
ing.
Fund-raising concerts in the fall and winter,
believes Kuchnert, should bring such groups
as the Supremes and the Mamas and the
Papas to Stanford. Spring would be an ideal
time for a wine tasting tour and school should
end with a Senior Week.
Terry Millington is Kuchnert's running
mate.
Strong Government
Terry Ross wants a strong senior govern
ment that is more active. He believes the tra
ditional events should be enlarged in order
to break down barriers between living groups.
Ross also feels that the seniors should receive
information from more graduate schools.
Carl Anduri is Ross's choice for Vice Presi
dent.

Resolving present social problems and for
mulating future plans are the two fields in
which Zander will take action.
Jazz Year
For a fund raising project Zander feels a
"Jazz Year" should be presented. Increased
senior happy hours should come into effect
to strengthen class unity and open more lines
of communication between seniors and their
class officers.
In preparation for the future, informal so
cializing through "Think and Drink" times
with seniors advisors and professors would
help those students who want further informa
tion about graduate schools.
One domestic problem that should be ex
amined is the function of the Senior Execu
tive Committee. Zander is running without a
running-mate because he wants to run on his
own merit.
Unavailable for comment was Soleng Tom
whose running-mate is Jere Horwitz.

Immediate action is the main emphasis of
Kuchnert's campaign. The senior year should
be split up into quarters with the publication
of a senior calendar marking significant
events.

In the fall Kuchnert wants to have a grad
uate school forum lasting 2 to 3 days and a
job forum lasting the same length of time
for those who are not going on in their school
ing.
Fund-raising concerts in the fall and winter,
believes Kuchnert, should bring such groups
as the Supremes and the Mamas and the
Papas to Stanford. Spring would be an ideal
time for a wine tasting tour and school should
end with a Senior Week.
Terry Millington is Kuchnert's running
mate.
Strong Government
Terry Ross wants a strong senior govern
ment that is more active. He believes the tra
ditional events should be enlarged in order
to break down barriers between living groups.
Ross also feels that the seniors should receive
information from more graduate schools.
Carl Anduri is Ross's choice for Vice Presi
dent.

Resolving present social problems and for
mulating future plans are the two fields in
which Zander will take action.
Jazz Year
For a fund raising project Zander feels a
"Jazz Year" should be presented. Increased
senior happy hours should come into effect
to strengthen class unity and open more lines
of communication between seniors and their
class officers.
In preparation for the future, informal so
cializing through "Think and Drink" times
with seniors advisors and professors would
help those students who want further informa
tion about graduate schools.
One domestic problem that should be ex
amined is the function of the Senior Execu
tive Committee. Zander is running without a
running-mate because he wants to run on his
own merit.
Unavailable for comment was Soleng Tom
whose running-mate is Jere Horwitz.
Seven candidates for Senior Class President
have filed petitions for the May 3 and May 4
general elections. The presidential hopefuls
are Mark Fogelman, Richard Werschkul, Rob
ert Zander, Mel Knox, Martin Kuchnert,
Soleng Tom, and Terry Ross.
Fogelman advocates moving traditional
senior functions into private homes to elimin
ate the necessity of seniors having to show
their I.D.'s in order to join in the festivities.
He also questions the importance of keeping
the Senior Ball formal. If elected he would
initiate a referendum on the possibility of
making it semi-formal.
Fogelman advocates the start of a tutorial
program in which students could receive valid
Information concerning graduate schools.
Class Directory
A class directory is another promise that he
will try to fulfill. Furthermore for seniors with
a desire to help others, he wants to have the
class adopt several Vietnamese orphans.

Fogelman's running mate is Robin Wise
man.
Widening senior government channels is
the main task set forth by Werschkul. He ad
vocates more committees to make his plan
work. He also wants the senior class to take
a more active political role and serve as a
means for students to give opinions. Question
naires and opinion polls should become more
important to let LASSU and the whole school
know more about the thoughts of the senior
class.
Career Information
Werschkul furthermore believes that more
career information should be made available
and that placement services should work more
closely with the students. He would like to
make more outside speakers available to
career-seeking seniors.
Werschkul thinks traditional senior affairs
are a must to further contacts between seniors
and would like to augment them.
Lee Wimberly, now in Austria, is Wer

schkuls running mate.
Happier Happy Hours
"Ace" Knox, if elected pledges happier
happy hours which would include everything
from dirty movies to a three day acid-orgy
in the wind tunnel of the Linear Accelerator.
Abolition of the Heritage Fund with the
money going to the Diggers is Knox's second
crusade. Also in order, he feels, are military
rallies in White Memorial Plaza that would
promote his only "ism"—Americanism.
Stanford in Tangiers would be a great addi
tion to the university, believes Knox, as would
be a Lash Laroo Fan Club.
Knox has no running mate because he did
not know that he needed one and feels that
he is man enough to handle both jobs.
