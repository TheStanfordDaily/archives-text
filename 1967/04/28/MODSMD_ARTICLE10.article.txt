Soleng Tom, candidate for Senior
Class President, believes that the
most important question facing the

beach party at the beginning of

To help seniors In the years ahead

able every senior to confidently select

the best possible school for himself,
Tom felt.
Also needed, he said, are more panel
discussions, symposiums by admis
sions officials from various graduate
schools, and a greater knowledge of
the various grants, aids, and fellow

greater participation in senior social
activities. To do this he would try
to better publicize and improve senior

back to the campus.
More senior unity can bo achieved
by more senior activities and senior
sponsored functions, he said.
