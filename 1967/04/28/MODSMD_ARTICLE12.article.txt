# China-Watchers To Speak On Sino-Soviet Relations
## 
### 
When Nikolai Fedorenko, So
viet Ambassador to the U.N. was
here last quarter he commented
that "the recent cultural revo
lution in China had absolutely
nothing to do with culture." The

revolution does, however, have
something to do with Sino-So
viet relations, and its impact on
those relations will be the topic
of the Institute of International
Relations' Spring Conference.
The conference is a one day
affair beginning tomorrow morn
ing at 9:30 in the Tresidder
Large Lounge. Addressing the
group will be Professors Michael
Oksenberg and Robert North
of the Political Science Depart
ment.
The keynote address of the
conference will be delivered by
Tom Robinson, a member of the
Think Tank at Rand Corpora
tion. Robinson is a graduate of
Carleton and is working on his
dissertation for Columbia while
working at Rand. He has lived
in Hong Kong and has taught at
Dartmouth.
Robinson's most notable ac
complishment to date is the co
authorship of an analysis of a
Lin Piao speech, "Long Live the
Victory of People's War". The
analysis was instrumental in
bringing the speech to the atten
tion of the State Department
and shows that China is reluc
tant to become involved in
"North Vietnam's war".
A reception will follow the
morning speeches at which time
the speakers will be available to
answer questions.
