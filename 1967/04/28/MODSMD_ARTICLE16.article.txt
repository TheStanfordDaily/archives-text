# Distinct Realms Of Concern Determine Right To Decide
## 
### ROBERT D. CLARK JOHN ROGERS 
The Stanford student, as a tui
tion-paying member of a schol
arly community, should have the
right to have a certain part in
making decisions pertinent to
the University.
"This part should not be out of
proportion: many decisions are
legitimately the concerns of stu
dents; some obviously are not.
But before demanding the privi
leges that could rightfully de
volve upon him, the Stanford
student should realize that the
administration is not an
opponent to be defeated in a
massive attempt at student
power.
Not Unsympathetic
It is, rather, an institution
that, however much it may fa
vor the growth of student re
sponsibility, must unavoidably
take many other factors into ac
count. President Sterling's ad
ministration can hardly be
termed unsympathetic to stu
dents. In addition to such long
range improvements as the ex
tensive building program, the
highly student-oriented overseas
campuses program, and the ac
quisition of a superb professor
ial staff, it has managed to resist
many of the pressures to become
an impersonal "IBM computer."
'"'One can make an appointment
with almost any administrator if
one has legitimate business. Ex
perience has shown them to be
quite reasonable. In addition,
the administration as a whole
has .been extremely receptive to
more personal changes in the
University climate. Pointed po
litical activity is now permitted
DH campus; it is obviously here
to stay. Liquor regulations have
been greatly relaxed. Sectarian
worship is now encouraged in
Memorial Church. Coed housing
experiments have recently re
ceived the attention that they
deserve.
Thus, in defining and request
ing a student role in decision
making, we must remember the
achievements and the forward
look of those who are now giv

ing leadership to this Univer
sity.
Specific Roles
There are certain specific roles
which the administration has
and should have in the decision
making process of the Univer
sity. These roles are determined
by the subject under considera
tion. The University serves two
functions: it aids students In
their seeking education, and it
serves the society at large more
directly through its research and
resources.
In those matters which per
tain directly to the students'
education and to student life,
students properly have a role to
share with the administration in
the decision-making process, ei
ther as advisors to the adminis
tration or as voting members of
joint committees.
The extent of the students'
role is to be determined accord
ing to function and through ne
gotiation and persuasion. In
such cases where students are
consultive or voting members of
decision-making bodies, the stu
dent representation should re
flect as closely as possible the
diverse views of the student
body and of the various volun
tary student organizations.
Joint Responsibility
The area of this proper joint
student-administration responsi
bility encompasses such matters
as curriculum changes and de
termination, social regulations,
and mundane administrative de
tails affecting the students—
such as parking and room and
board arrangements. However,
in matters concerning the com
munity contribution and gen
eral administration of the Uni
versity — which types of re
search grants are accepted, the
advisory activities of academic
departments, fund raising, con
struction, and the selection of
the Board of Trustees—the stu
dents have no proper role. When
they enter the University stu
dents contract to leave such de
cisions to the administration,
the professors concerned, and
the Trustees.

It must be remembered that
student - administration dissen
sion is not a good in of itself.
The administration has tried to
accommodate student desires,
where pertinent to areas of stu
dent interest, and has made
changes in the University for
the genuine benefit of students.
The administration, far from
being an ogre with unswerving
opposition to any change, has
only asked that students be rea
sonable in their demands.
Diversity
The University has allowed
the Experiment, as institution
opposed by a portion of the stu
dent body, to continue in exis
tence, though the Experiment
has attacked President Sterling
personally. This would suggest
patience and willingness to al
low diverse opinions to be ex
pressed on the part of the ad
ministration.
Perhaps it is time for students
to appreciate the administra
tion's position. For it is obvious
that in a primarily educational
atmosphere—that portion of the
University which is concerned
with students' education, as op
posed to the distinct community
service oriented portion — too
much emphasis on rights and
too much dissension among the
members of the University can
overshadow and destroy the
main purpose of the educational
sector. Furthermore, when stu
dents become engrossed in us
ing their position as students as
a base for criticizing aspects of
the University (such as Univer
sity-S.R.I. relations) in which
they have no legitimate interest,
they are exceeding their reason
able demands and are adding an
immense burden to student-ad
ministration relations.
In an atmosphere of distrust,
in a university filled with strife,
it becomes impossible to con
centrate upon education. Only
through a feeling of rapproche
ment between the students and
the administration can the true
educational purpose of this Uni
versity be fulfilled.
