"There should be less talk
about three constitueneies here
at Stanford . . . people have to
get over the idea of the faculty
and administration versus the
students. Our interests are the
same, only our vantages differ
which makes for good discus
sion," said Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Robert Sears.
In a Daily interview on the
role of the administration, Dean
Sears stressed that the term "ad
ministration" is misleading since
academic people are making

most of the academic decisions.
"The virtue of having academic
ians in the administration is that
it makes for greater harmony in
the University. An institution
should have decisions related to
academicians made by them," he
continued.
Academic Values
When asked how his role as a
scholar is expressed in his posi
tion as an administrator, Dean
Sears, who is also a psychology
professor, explained that his
values are "academic." "Aca
demic interests color my admin
istrative decisions rather than
social propriety, economy, or
convenience."
As an example of the kind of
decisions that should be made
by academic - administraters,
Dean Scars cited the selection
of personnel and faculty. His
office acts as part of a "checks
and balance" system which be
gins when a department submits
a file on a porspective professor.

Dean Soars explained that five
or six independent groups re
view every ease, and it can be
blocked on any level.
Insure Quality
"This is tho only way we can
insure quality on the faculty,"
he said. "When no review takes
place at a higher level, depart
ments tend to reproduce them
selves. Strong departments re
main strong, while the weaker
ones remain weak."
He added that although stu
dents cannot vote to hire or fire
a professor, they are consulted
about teacher quality either di
rectly or through their advisors.
Dean Sears explained that an
other of his duties is to serve
as a "watch dog" for the various
academic departments to make
certain that their interests do not
become too specialized. As de
tached observers, he and his staff
attempt "to protect and to stim
ulate" academic programs.
He said that six years ago
there were no art history
courses offered at Stanford. As
an adminstrator he has the pre
rogative to initiate and encour
age such programs as evidenced
by the presence of art history
courses in the current Art and
Architecture curriculum. His of
fice also recommended that the
computer science program be
separated from the Mathematics
Department as students began
to demand courses in that area.
These changes had to be ap
proved first by the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, next by
the Provost, and finally by Presi
dent Sterling.
Student Affairs
In reference to other student
oriented affairs, Sears said that
often student channels for com
munication are "clogged."
"Many times we do not know
whom to contact—an ASSU com
mittee, a LASSU group, or an ad
hoc subcommittee. From here it
is often quite confusing." He
added that the administrative
structure is changing with the
increased importance of seeking
advice and sometimes decisions
from people "who are equipped
and capable of making deci
sions."
Sears explained that the rec
ent involvement of students in
university matters other than
classes is a relatively new phe
nemon.
"I'm amazed that we never
thought of it before. The present
student generation has more
creativity and wit. It's not sur
prising that students are out

creating the faculty because the
students are where the shoe
pinches."
He felt that students are often
too impatient for change, "which
is all right for three-year-olds,
but in the total educational pro
cess sub-goals must be consid
ered along with overall goals.
"We respect student's experi
ence, but issues need thinking
through. We know it's easy for
enthusiasm to evaporate. The
strong feeling of students who
have passions that the President
and the vast hierarchy of admini
strators are a breaking force is
not true. Often we are just as
concerned, but our pace is slower
since we have our own priori
ties."
Board Of Trustees
The Board of Trustees, accord
ing to Dean Sears, "has to stand
from the outside to make de
tached judgments on long-term
academic plans" such as whether
or not to have a school of nurs
ing, dentistry, or architecture.'
Endowment funds should also be
the concern of the Board, Dean
Sears said, "although housing
policies are details which per
haps the Trustees shouldn't have
to handle.
"They should maintain the
reputation of the University.
Things like social regulations
are relevant in that line." He
added that students should have
a "major say on specific condi
tions like housing facilities and
time schedules."
Academics
Academic programs change
from generation to generation,
Sears continued, and the curricu
lum has shifted from total strati
fication to plans with no require
ments.
"We just don't know which ap
proach is the best. We need to
experiment . . . too often we're
afraid to change, and it becomes
a Supreme Court decision. We
have to get over the notion thai
the whole University has to opr
erate as one mass. There are
several channels to heaven." •
Dean Sears expressed the hope
that the amount of communion
tion about education methods
and purposes would increase:
students have opened up a clil
mate for rational discussion
which is a real achievement." !
Dean Sears concluded, "I act
as a telephone. My job is to bring
people together whether they are
students, faculty, alumni, or
trustees—to find a market for an
idea in order to bring the educa
tional realm together."

"There should be less talk
about three constitueneies here
at Stanford . . . people have to

students. Our interests are the

In reference to other student
oriented affairs, Sears said that
often student channels for com
munication are "clogged."
"Many times we do not know
whom to contact—an ASSU com
mittee, a LASSU group, or an ad
hoc subcommittee. From here it
is often quite confusing." He
added that the administrative
structure is changing with the
increased importance of seeking
advice and sometimes decisions
from people "who are equipped
and capable of making deci
sions."
Sears explained that the rec
ent involvement of students in
university matters other than
classes is a relatively new phe
nemon.
"I'm amazed that we never
thought of it before. The present
student generation has more
creativity and wit. It's not sur
prising that students are out

creating the faculty because the
students are where the shoe
pinches."
He felt that students are often
too impatient for change, "which
is all right for three-year-olds,
but in the total educational pro
cess sub-goals must be consid
ered along with overall goals.
"We respect student's experi
ence, but issues need thinking
through. We know it's easy for
enthusiasm to evaporate. The
strong feeling of students who
have passions that the President
and the vast hierarchy of admini
strators are a breaking force is
not true. Often we are just as
concerned, but our pace is slower
since we have our own priori
ties."
Board Of Trustees
The Board of Trustees, accord
ing to Dean Sears, "has to stand
from the outside to make de
tached judgments on long-term
academic plans" such as whether
or not to have a school of nurs
ing, dentistry, or architecture.'
Endowment funds should also be
the concern of the Board, Dean
Sears said, "although housing
policies are details which per
haps the Trustees shouldn't have
to handle.
"They should maintain the
reputation of the University.
Things like social regulations
are relevant in that line." He
added that students should have
a "major say on specific condi
tions like housing facilities and
time schedules."
Academics
Academic programs change
from generation to generation,
Sears continued, and the curricu
lum has shifted from total strati
fication to plans with no require
ments.
"We just don't know which ap
proach is the best. We need to
experiment . . . too often we're
afraid to change, and it becomes
a Supreme Court decision. We
have to get over the notion thai
the whole University has to opr
erate as one mass. There are
several channels to heaven." •
Dean Sears expressed the hope
that the amount of communion
tion about education methods
and purposes would increase:
students have opened up a clil
mate for rational discussion
which is a real achievement." !
Dean Sears concluded, "I act
as a telephone. My job is to bring
people together whether they are
students, faculty, alumni, or
trustees—to find a market for an
idea in order to bring the educa
tional realm together."

"There should be less talk
about three constitueneies here
at Stanford . . . people have to
get over the idea of the faculty
and administration versus the
students. Our interests are the
same, only our vantages differ
which makes for good discus
sion," said Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Robert Sears.
In a Daily interview on the
role of the administration, Dean
Sears stressed that the term "ad
ministration" is misleading since
academic people are making

most of the academic decisions.
"The virtue of having academic
ians in the administration is that
it makes for greater harmony in
the University. An institution
should have decisions related to
academicians made by them," he
continued.
Academic Values
When asked how his role as a
scholar is expressed in his posi
tion as an administrator, Dean
Sears, who is also a psychology
professor, explained that his
values are "academic." "Aca
demic interests color my admin
istrative decisions rather than
social propriety, economy, or
convenience."
As an example of the kind of
decisions that should be made
by academic - administraters,
Dean Scars cited the selection
of personnel and faculty. His
office acts as part of a "checks
and balance" system which be
gins when a department submits
a file on a porspective professor.

Dean Soars explained that five
or six independent groups re
view every ease, and it can be
blocked on any level.
Insure Quality
"This is tho only way we can
insure quality on the faculty,"
he said. "When no review takes
place at a higher level, depart
ments tend to reproduce them
selves. Strong departments re
main strong, while the weaker
ones remain weak."
He added that although stu
dents cannot vote to hire or fire
a professor, they are consulted
about teacher quality either di
rectly or through their advisors.
Dean Sears explained that an
other of his duties is to serve
as a "watch dog" for the various
academic departments to make
certain that their interests do not
become too specialized. As de
tached observers, he and his staff
attempt "to protect and to stim
ulate" academic programs.
He said that six years ago
there were no art history
courses offered at Stanford. As
an adminstrator he has the pre
rogative to initiate and encour
age such programs as evidenced
by the presence of art history
courses in the current Art and
Architecture curriculum. His of
fice also recommended that the
computer science program be
separated from the Mathematics
Department as students began
to demand courses in that area.
These changes had to be ap
proved first by the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, next by
the Provost, and finally by Presi

mate for rational discussion
which is a real achievement." !
Dean Sears concluded, "I act
as a telephone. My job is to bring
people together whether they are
students, faculty, alumni, or
trustees—to find a market for an
idea in order to bring the educa
tional realm together."

"There should be less talk
about three constitueneies here
at Stanford . . . people have to
get over the idea of the faculty
and administration versus the
students. Our interests are the
same, only our vantages differ
which makes for good discus
sion," said Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Robert Sears.
In a Daily interview on the
role of the administration, Dean
Sears stressed that the term "ad
ministration" is misleading since
academic people are making

most of the academic decisions.
"The virtue of having academic
ians in the administration is that
it makes for greater harmony in
the University. An institution
should have decisions related to
academicians made by them," he
continued.
Academic Values
When asked how his role as a
scholar is expressed in his posi
tion as an administrator, Dean
Sears, who is also a psychology
professor, explained that his
values are "academic." "Aca
demic interests color my admin
istrative decisions rather than
social propriety, economy, or
convenience."
As an example of the kind of
decisions that should be made
by academic - administraters,
Dean Scars cited the selection
of personnel and faculty. His
office acts as part of a "checks
and balance" system which be
gins when a department submits
a file on a porspective professor.

Dean Soars explained that five
or six independent groups re
view every ease, and it can be
blocked on any level.
Insure Quality
"This is tho only way we can
insure quality on the faculty,"
he said. "When no review takes
place at a higher level, depart
ments tend to reproduce them
selves. Strong departments re
main strong, while the weaker
ones remain weak."
He added that although stu
dents cannot vote to hire or fire
a professor, they are consulted
about teacher quality either di
rectly or through their advisors.
Dean Sears explained that an
other of his duties is to serve
as a "watch dog" for the various
academic departments to make
certain that their interests do not
become too specialized. As de
tached observers, he and his staff
attempt "to protect and to stim
ulate" academic programs.
He said that six years ago
there were no art history
courses offered at Stanford. As
an adminstrator he has the pre
rogative to initiate and encour
age such programs as evidenced
by the presence of art history
courses in the current Art and
Architecture curriculum. His of
fice also recommended that the
computer science program be
separated from the Mathematics
Department as students began
to demand courses in that area.
These changes had to be ap
proved first by the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, next by
the Provost, and finally by Presi
dent Sterling.
Student Affairs
In reference to other student
oriented affairs, Sears said that
often student channels for com
munication are "clogged."
"Many times we do not know
whom to contact—an ASSU com
mittee, a LASSU group, or an ad
hoc subcommittee. From here it
is often quite confusing." He
added that the administrative
structure is changing with the
increased importance of seeking
advice and sometimes decisions
from people "who are equipped
and capable of making deci
sions."
Sears explained that the rec
ent involvement of students in
university matters other than
classes is a relatively new phe
nemon.
"I'm amazed that we never
thought of it before. The present
student generation has more
creativity and wit. It's not sur
prising that students are out

creating the faculty because the
students are where the shoe
pinches."
He felt that students are often
too impatient for change, "which
is all right for three-year-olds,
but in the total educational pro
cess sub-goals must be consid
ered along with overall goals.
"We respect student's experi
ence, but issues need thinking
through. We know it's easy for
enthusiasm to evaporate. The
strong feeling of students who
have passions that the President
and the vast hierarchy of admini
strators are a breaking force is
not true. Often we are just as
concerned, but our pace is slower
since we have our own priori
ties."
Board Of Trustees
The Board of Trustees, accord
ing to Dean Sears, "has to stand
from the outside to make de
tached judgments on long-term
academic plans" such as whether
or not to have a school of nurs
ing, dentistry, or architecture.'
Endowment funds should also be
the concern of the Board, Dean
Sears said, "although housing
policies are details which per
haps the Trustees shouldn't have
to handle.
"They should maintain the
reputation of the University.
Things like social regulations
are relevant in that line." He
added that students should have
a "major say on specific condi
tions like housing facilities and
time schedules."
Academics
Academic programs change
from generation to generation,
Sears continued, and the curricu
lum has shifted from total strati
fication to plans with no require
ments.
"We just don't know which ap
proach is the best. We need to
experiment . . . too often we're
afraid to change, and it becomes
a Supreme Court decision. We
have to get over the notion thai
the whole University has to opr
erate as one mass. There are
several channels to heaven." •
Dean Sears expressed the hope
that the amount of communion
tion about education methods
and purposes would increase:
students have opened up a clil
mate for rational discussion
which is a real achievement." !
Dean Sears concluded, "I act
