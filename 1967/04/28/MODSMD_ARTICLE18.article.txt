# Pressure Essential
## A 						New Approach To The Bureaucracy 
### PAUL RUPERT 
There is inherent in anarchy
a great measure of personal
responsibility and a great po
tential for creative design of
one's life. But the American
university of the nineteenth cen
tury chose to introduce an ele
ment of stability into its com
munity of aloof scholars and
rambunctious students, calling
it administration and expecting
it to handle discipline, counsel
ling, and the clerical function.
What began as a natural and
admirable desire for order has
become compulsion and control.
The faculty, the repository of
power and decisions in many
areas, seems to have abdicated
its control over decisions which
are primarily academic, like the
nature of the Overseas Campus
es Program, the policy of the
Admissions Office, and the role
of athletics in the University.
Students who formerly held no
power are only beginning to
realize that with their four-year
investment they might expect
an education amenable to their
scrutiny, and in opposition to
this idea t.hey find an admini
stration intent on efficiency and
stumbling into greater control.

It is impossible, and perhaps
not totally desirable to return
to the custodial notion of ad
ministration. Bureaucracies,
once created, can be used. The
vital demand is that they be de
fined, given those powers in
those realms where they are
competent and concerned. In a
four-year struggle, initiated by
the students, the administration
has begun to withdraw from
the realm of personal life, where
they recognized the student's
right to create his conditions of
growth. Only now are demands
in the area of undergraduate
education being entertained on
a large scale.
Growth and Change
The growth and change that
has occurred proved several
things: pressure is essential to
effect constructive change, the
system is composed of men, and
structures easily become perma
nent and ends in themselves.
The following are a few notes on
how we might approach the ad
ministration in the future.
If you want a substantial
change, you must demand it.
Curiously, in the past this was
a strange notion. One was put

off with a comment like, "I'm
with you all the way, but we
can't expect change overnight."
Statements like this, replete
with a smile and a call to pa
tience, assume life of the sys
tem independent of its admini
strators. And student and per
haps faculty calls for attack
also assumed this mystical en
tity "administration" to be a
reality, backed up by the equal
ly intransigent "alumni" and
"parents".
Eager for Greatness
I would suggest that we con
sider a new way of looking at
criticism here. There is a John
son administration, waging war
after having begun an admir
able domestic program which
is now crumbling. And critics
speak of Lyndon Johnson as re
sponsible. Perhaps we would
find that such is the case at
Stanford. A given conditibn of
inadequacy in an administra
tives office might easily be rem
edied — or only be remedied —
by the elimination of the incom
petent administrator, although
"he did such an admirable job
building up the program" or
whatever. In a university as
eager for greatness as this, it

must either convert its intran
sigents quickly or replace them.
Re-integration Necessary *
But to continue the analogy,
while elimination might im
prove things temporarily, the
condition that allowed this prob
lem will allow others. The solu
tion would seem to lie in a re
integration of faculty and stu
dents into the vital realms oif
decision-making. Some consider
ations for the immediate future
might be the move toward aji
"open covenants openly arrived
at" policy throughout the ad
ministration, a review of admis
sions policy, a review of thj?
overseas campuses. . . . bi>t
wait, you say. The Packer ConJ
mittee will handle all that. Let
me suggest, in closing, that the
administration had done some
excellent things in the last few
years. But pressure was neces
sary and people were respon
sible. The Packer Committee
will evolve into a bureaucracy
to be prodded and supplemented
by students outside the commit
tee itself. It will deserve, as the
most significant concession to
change this year, the closest
scrutiny.
