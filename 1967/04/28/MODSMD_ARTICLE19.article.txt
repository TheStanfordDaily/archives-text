# Cuthbertson: Servants Like Me And The Janitor?
## 
### KENNETH CUTHBERTSON Vice President For Finance 
I have been fighting a losing battle to get
the word "administration", banned from the
campus.
I believe its use (that is to say, its mis
use) seriously impedes the performance of
.the University's basic functions — learning
- and teaching.
Like most everything else in today's uni
versity — and here we're concerned with
Stanford — what goes as "administration" can
stand a lot of improvement. But I think we'll
make more progress if we sort out the objects
.of our attack.
Fnyit of all, I resist the idea that learning
and i Reaching should be "administered" in a
university.
Perhaps I should support some definition of
"administration" limited to planning for, iden
tifying, encouraging, coordinating and super
vising the people most .directly involved in
learning and teaching.
* In 1 this vein I believe that the nearest thing
to "administration" is the activity of academic
Department Heads, Dean of Schools, the Pro
vost and the President — all, quite important
ly, -members of the faculty. But here I would
prefer the word "leadership"; and I would

place enormous value on the role of such
leadership.
The need for excellence in such positions
and the opportunities which evolve from sen
sitive and alert performance seem to me to be
critical in the mid-Twentieth Century life of
an American university.
I accuse Stanford's academic leadership of
being without peer in recent years. They are
responsible for bringing this University to the
edge of whatever you want to call it — a rise
in quality simply unapproached by any other
top rank university. And they are impatient
to get on with changes for improvement.
Tiie danger of using "administration" to
describe this academic leadership is the ap
parent temptation to broaden the membership
to include servants like me and the janitor —
or the janitor's boss or the student counselor.
I disagree with Paul Goodman on many
propositions, but I'm with him when he gets
bugged by the misemphasis on the "care
taker" element in university "administration".
This is not to say that a servant's role in
the University is without dignity or high
meaning. Quite the contrary, I have found it
stimulating, and I have encouraged capable
men and women to participate iti it.
But it is not, al any level, "administering"

the University's main business; and the ser
vant who thinks otherwise is a real hazard.
We servants can get our kicks out of pro
viding the means and services which allow
faculty and students to learn and teach un
der optimal circumstances.
We may even administer large service or
ganizations toward those ends — so long
as we recognize that such service administra
tion is not University "administration".
It's too bad that faculty don't have the
time and particular skills to perform all the
service roles as well as their basic functions.
If they did, we could be more confident that
the services would meet the academic needs.
Given the apparent requirement to divide
such labors, faculties have tended to delegate
the service responsibilities. The servant type
is called upon to understand and sympathize
with what the faculty (and academic leader
ship) need and to perform accordingly. It's a
challenging occupation.
The trouble is it gets called "administra
tion", and then even the faculty tend to for
get that historically they really delegated
those functions.
I honestly believe that the misuse of the
word itself contributes seriously to situations
— and there are too many in which a frus
trated faculty claims the "administration"

(translate "servants") are thwarting learning
or teaching.
In Stanford's history, a perfectly good word,
"staff", has been used to describe the service
group. I wish we could get this back into
common use.
In my losing effort to scuttle the term
"administration", I would have expected sup
port from students.
Hut the battle has gone fastest against inc
as students have increased their influence in
recent years in their effort to participate in
improving Stanford.
Perhaps some are still affected by their
high school idea of "administration", al
though I'm disappointed if Stanford doesn't
seem that different. Then, I suspect, there
is a certain convenience in the imprecise
criticism of the "administration".
1 realize that students seldom have time to
find out who they're criticizing; but we'd be
a better University if they could try a bit
harder to nail the culprit and avoid the gen
eral i/at ion.
For instance, if I recommend a large tui
tion increase or encourage too many alumni
gilt solicitations, and you object, don't say,
"That stupid administration!", say "That stu
pid Cuthbertson!" Among other things, you
may get more attention at least an argu

ment from which wo all might benefit.
One of the most serious consequences of
the "administration" syndrome is the temp
tation to think in terms of three major con
stituencies in the University community: fac
ulty, students, "administration".
This not only tends to separate the faculty
from their own member-leaders, but it tosses
staff servants into a position which is awk
ward for them and more so for the Univer
sity.
If we would resist the convenience of lump
ing unalikes into an "administration", we
could think about whether it's academic lead
ership or special staff skills which are requir
ed for a given problem faced by faculty and
students.
My position is not new. I see it in the his
tory of the better American institutions of
higher education; and I was introduced to it
by President Sterling in my earliest days on
his staff.
There may need to be "administration" at
some of the large publicly supported univer
sities (the celebrated Byrne report on U.C.
belabors the word); government influence
may require them to accept the term and
deal with it some other way.
But couldn't we just abandon the word at

Given the apparent requirement to divide

The trouble is it gets called "administra

I honestly believe that the misuse of the
word itself contributes seriously to situations

In Stanford's history, a perfectly good word,
"staff", has been used to describe the service

1 realize that students seldom have time to
find out who they're criticizing; but we'd be
a better University if they could try a bit
harder to nail the culprit and avoid the gen

For instance, if I recommend a large tui

"That stupid administration!", say "That stu

may get more attention at least an argu

One of the most serious consequences of
the "administration" syndrome is the temp

I have been fighting a losing battle to get
the word "administration", banned from the
campus.
I believe its use (that is to say, its mis
use) seriously impedes the performance of
.the University's basic functions — learning
- and teaching.
Like most everything else in today's uni
versity — and here we're concerned with
Stanford — what goes as "administration" can
stand a lot of improvement. But I think we'll
make more progress if we sort out the objects
.of our attack.
Fnyit of all, I resist the idea that learning
and i Reaching should be "administered" in a
university.
Perhaps I should support some definition of
"administration" limited to planning for, iden
tifying, encouraging, coordinating and super
vising the people most .directly involved in
learning and teaching.
* In 1 this vein I believe that the nearest thing
to "administration" is the activity of academic
Department Heads, Dean of Schools, the Pro
vost and the President — all, quite important
ly, -members of the faculty. But here I would
prefer the word "leadership"; and I would

place enormous value on the role of such
leadership.
The need for excellence in such positions
and the opportunities which evolve from sen
sitive and alert performance seem to me to be
critical in the mid-Twentieth Century life of
an American university.
I accuse Stanford's academic leadership of
being without peer in recent years. They are
responsible for bringing this University to the
edge of whatever you want to call it — a rise
in quality simply unapproached by any other
top rank university. And they are impatient
to get on with changes for improvement.
Tiie danger of using "administration" to
describe this academic leadership is the ap
parent temptation to broaden the membership
to include servants like me and the janitor —
or the janitor's boss or the student counselor.
I disagree with Paul Goodman on many
propositions, but I'm with him when he gets
bugged by the misemphasis on the "care
taker" element in university "administration".
This is not to say that a servant's role in
the University is without dignity or high
meaning. Quite the contrary, I have found it
stimulating, and I have encouraged capable
men and women to participate iti it.
But it is not, al any level, "administering"

the University's main business; and the ser

We servants can get our kicks out of pro
viding the means and services which allow
faculty and students to learn and teach un
der optimal circumstances.
We may even administer large service or
ganizations toward those ends — so long
as we recognize that such service administra
tion is not University "administration".
It's too bad that faculty don't have the
time and particular skills to perform all the
service roles as well as their basic functions.
If they did, we could be more confident that

I have been fighting a losing battle to get
the word "administration", banned from the
campus.
I believe its use (that is to say, its mis
use) seriously impedes the performance of
.the University's basic functions — learning
- and teaching.
Like most everything else in today's uni
versity — and here we're concerned with
Stanford — what goes as "administration" can
stand a lot of improvement. But I think we'll
make more progress if we sort out the objects
.of our attack.
Fnyit of all, I resist the idea that learning
and i Reaching should be "administered" in a
university.
Perhaps I should support some definition of
"administration" limited to planning for, iden
tifying, encouraging, coordinating and super
vising the people most .directly involved in
learning and teaching.
* In 1 this vein I believe that the nearest thing
to "administration" is the activity of academic
Department Heads, Dean of Schools, the Pro
vost and the President — all, quite important
ly, -members of the faculty. But here I would
prefer the word "leadership"; and I would

place enormous value on the role of such
leadership.
The need for excellence in such positions
and the opportunities which evolve from sen
sitive and alert performance seem to me to be
critical in the mid-Twentieth Century life of
an American university.
I accuse Stanford's academic leadership of
being without peer in recent years. They are
responsible for bringing this University to the
edge of whatever you want to call it — a rise
in quality simply unapproached by any other
top rank university. And they are impatient
to get on with changes for improvement.
Tiie danger of using "administration" to
describe this academic leadership is the ap
parent temptation to broaden the membership
to include servants like me and the janitor —
or the janitor's boss or the student counselor.
I disagree with Paul Goodman on many
propositions, but I'm with him when he gets
bugged by the misemphasis on the "care
taker" element in university "administration".
This is not to say that a servant's role in
the University is without dignity or high
meaning. Quite the contrary, I have found it
stimulating, and I have encouraged capable
men and women to participate iti it.
But it is not, al any level, "administering"

the University's main business; and the ser
vant who thinks otherwise is a real hazard.
We servants can get our kicks out of pro
viding the means and services which allow
faculty and students to learn and teach un
der optimal circumstances.
We may even administer large service or
ganizations toward those ends — so long
as we recognize that such service administra
tion is not University "administration".
It's too bad that faculty don't have the
time and particular skills to perform all the
service roles as well as their basic functions.
If they did, we could be more confident that
the services would meet the academic needs.
Given the apparent requirement to divide
such labors, faculties have tended to delegate
the service responsibilities. The servant type
is called upon to understand and sympathize
with what the faculty (and academic leader
ship) need and to perform accordingly. It's a
challenging occupation.
The trouble is it gets called "administra
tion", and then even the faculty tend to for
get that historically they really delegated
those functions.
I honestly believe that the misuse of the
word itself contributes seriously to situations
— and there are too many in which a frus
trated faculty claims the "administration"

(translate "servants") are thwarting learning
or teaching.
In Stanford's history, a perfectly good word,
"staff", has been used to describe the service
group. I wish we could get this back into
common use.
In my losing effort to scuttle the term
"administration", I would have expected sup
port from students.
Hut the battle has gone fastest against inc
as students have increased their influence in
recent years in their effort to participate in
improving Stanford.
Perhaps some are still affected by their
high school idea of "administration", al
though I'm disappointed if Stanford doesn't
seem that different. Then, I suspect, there
is a certain convenience in the imprecise
criticism of the "administration".
1 realize that students seldom have time to
find out who they're criticizing; but we'd be
a better University if they could try a bit
harder to nail the culprit and avoid the gen
eral i/at ion.
For instance, if I recommend a large tui
tion increase or encourage too many alumni
gilt solicitations, and you object, don't say,
"That stupid administration!", say "That stu
pid Cuthbertson!" Among other things, you
may get more attention at least an argu

ment from which wo all might benefit.
One of the most serious consequences of
the "administration" syndrome is the temp
tation to think in terms of three major con
stituencies in the University community: fac
ulty, students, "administration".
This not only tends to separate the faculty
from their own member-leaders, but it tosses
staff servants into a position which is awk
ward for them and more so for the Univer
sity.
If we would resist the convenience of lump
ing unalikes into an "administration", we
could think about whether it's academic lead
ership or special staff skills which are requir
ed for a given problem faced by faculty and
students.
My position is not new. I see it in the his
tory of the better American institutions of
higher education; and I was introduced to it
by President Sterling in my earliest days on
his staff.
There may need to be "administration" at
some of the large publicly supported univer
sities (the celebrated Byrne report on U.C.
belabors the word); government influence
may require them to accept the term and
deal with it some other way.
