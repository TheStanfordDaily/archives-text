# Med School Returns Upward Bound Grant
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The battle between Stanford and
East Palo Alto over Upward
Bound, a War on Poverty program,
has ended in an unconditional sur
render by Stanford.
The University announced yes
terday that it will send back the
$59,273 grant received last week
to operate Upward Bound this sum
mer.
The announcement came after
several weeks of haggling over the
program and a demonstration at
the Medical School last Friday by
East Palo Alto residents. The Med
ical School had been slated to run
the program for Stanford.
Dr. Leßoy Pesch, who handled
the negotiation between Stanford
and the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity, explained his reasons for
the surprise announcement in a
letter to Mrs. Everlyn Wallace,
chairman of the Community Action
Council of East Palo Alto:
"The University has no desire to
operate a program against the
wishes of the community. Although

we are willing to meet the major
ity of your demands as outlined
in the list of nine supplements to
the program, the formation of a
Board of Directors for policy de
cisions and the request that faculty
members donate their salaries to
the program are in violation of
the Upward Bound guidelines and
unacceptable to the University."
East Palo Alto leaders see the
situation differently.
According to Mrs. Gertrude
Wilks, "Most of the tilings for our
deliverance are in violation of the
Upward Bound guidelines. We
thought that, if Stanford really
wanted to help us, they would be
willing to violate the guidelines."
Mrs. Wilks called the present
guidelines inadequate, claiming
they "do not help poor people."
Mrs. Syrtiller Kabat, one of the
leaders in the protest, said that
Stanford's action shows that the
University is not willing to run an
Upward Bound program in the
same way other universities are
running the program.
If the Medical School had con

tinued with plans for Upward
Bound this summer, Mrs. Kabat
and other East Palo Alto residents
had promised to picket the pro
gram everyday. Their basic com
plaint was that Stanford apparent
ly did not want their opinions on
how to run Upward Bound.
Over 200 universities sponsored
Upward Bound last summer. The
program is designed to take bright
(high school students who have
poor grades and introduce them to
education at the university level.
The only stipulation is that the
student's parents must earn less
than $4000 per year.
Stanford participated in the pro
gram for the first time last year.
Approximately 40 students lived In
two fraternity houses during Sum
mer Quarter. The group that ran
the program last summer voted
early in Winter Quarter not to
liave a program this year due to a
decrease in funds from the Office
of Economic Opportunity. After
that vote, the Medical School ap
plied for —and received —the grant
to operate Upward Bound.

The University announced yes
terday that it will send back the
$59,273 grant received last week
to operate Upward Bound this sum
mer.
The announcement came after
several weeks of haggling over the
program and a demonstration at
the Medical School last Friday by
East Palo Alto residents. The Med
ical School had been slated to run
the program for Stanford.
Dr. Leßoy Pesch, who handled
the negotiation between Stanford
and the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity, explained his reasons for
the surprise announcement in a
letter to Mrs. Everlyn Wallace,
chairman of the Community Action
Council of East Palo Alto:
"The University has no desire to
operate a program against the
wishes of the community. Although

we are willing to meet the major
ity of your demands as outlined
in the list of nine supplements to
the program, the formation of a
Board of Directors for policy de
cisions and the request that faculty
members donate their salaries to
the program are in violation of
the Upward Bound guidelines and
unacceptable to the University."
East Palo Alto leaders see the
situation differently.
According to Mrs. Gertrude
Wilks, "Most of the tilings for our
deliverance are in violation of the
Upward Bound guidelines. We
thought that, if Stanford really
wanted to help us, they would be
willing to violate the guidelines."
Mrs. Wilks called the present
guidelines inadequate, claiming
they "do not help poor people."
Mrs. Syrtiller Kabat, one of the
leaders in the protest, said that
Stanford's action shows that the
University is not willing to run an
Upward Bound program in the
same way other universities are
running the program.
If the Medical School had con

tinued with plans for Upward
Bound this summer, Mrs. Kabat
and other East Palo Alto residents
had promised to picket the pro
gram everyday. Their basic com
plaint was that Stanford apparent
ly did not want their opinions on
how to run Upward Bound.
Over 200 universities sponsored
Upward Bound last summer. The
program is designed to take bright
(high school students who have
poor grades and introduce them to
education at the university level.
The only stipulation is that the
student's parents must earn less
than $4000 per year.
Stanford participated in the pro
gram for the first time last year.
Approximately 40 students lived In
two fraternity houses during Sum
mer Quarter. The group that ran
the program last summer voted
early in Winter Quarter not to
liave a program this year due to a
decrease in funds from the Office
of Economic Opportunity. After
that vote, the Medical School ap
plied for —and received —the grant
to operate Upward Bound.
The battle between Stanford and
East Palo Alto over Upward
Bound, a War on Poverty program,
has ended in an unconditional sur
render by Stanford.
