# Kerr Outlines Views On Students

### CLARK KERR 
Editor's Note: The following is
excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,
which was given at a conference
on "Students and Politics" at
San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.

style may illuminate rather

the morality of a broader seg

it will continue to be in a posi

excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,

San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.

stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.
Editor's Note: The following is
excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,
which was given at a conference
on "Students and Politics" at
San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose

than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may

However this may turn out,

it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than

This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.
Editor's Note: The following is
excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,
which was given at a conference
on "Students and Politics" at
San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.

as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.
Editor's Note: The following is
excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,
which was given at a conference
on "Students and Politics" at
San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.

This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of

come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This

is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.
Editor's Note: The following is
excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,
which was given at a conference
on "Students and Politics" at
San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country

sity student are not open to con

ther do not work at all or for

dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron

mies.

is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.
Editor's Note: The following is
excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,
which was given at a conference
on "Students and Politics" at
San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.

is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external

as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.

United States is not a country

will equally disappoint the hopes

impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.
Thus it is necessary to get the
attention of the press and TV.
Violation of rules and the law
is one quick way of doing this.
It is a lever that can be pulled
to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:
The new activists can look, with
in the campus, for support from
the few Bohemians and often
from the Peace Corps and aca
demic styles as well; and outside
the campus, from the Old and
New Left, the New Theologists,
and the remaining minorities.
The essential theme, however,
is one of students by themselves

largely isolated from external
groups. They ask for little help,
as the slogan "don't trust any
one over 30" implies.
The new approach has worked
on some issues and in some sit
uations, but not on all issues
and in all situations.
The basic fact is that the
United States is not a country
given to revolts and that univer
sity student are not open to con
stant revolts. Little revolts ei
ther do not work at all or for
very long. The issue-by-issue
protest movement of the 1960'5,
as contrasted with the ideologi
cal political activism of the
1930'5, is more dramatic and
troublesome in the short-run but
less permanent in the long-run.
Confrontation politics, on bal
ance, it now appears, may face
an early decline. Its use by stu
dents, in the absence of new de
velopments, may gradually fade
back to more normal levels. This
will equally disappoint the hopes
of advocates of student confron
tation and the fears of the ene
mies.
Confrontation Tactics
This is not to suggest that
there will be no more confron
tation tactics, but rather that
they will set less of the tone of
campus life in the years just
ahead. Confrontation will be
come a tactic in the arsenal
rather than the tactic. This
form of protest which followed
upon apathy will in turn be fol
lowed by some new mood and
style.
The dust raised by confronta
tion politics has often obscured
to the public the urgent fact
that the student generation of
today has some very real con
cerns and some helpful sugges
tions. Its means have too often
stood in the way of its ends. It
is now time, it seems to me, that
its substance be brought for
ward in its own right; that re
liance come to be placed more
on persuasion in the longer run
than on confrontation in the
shorter run. The very flexibility
of students will aid this trans
formation. Some of the same
people seeking the same goals
will embrace new approaches.
The new student has a role to
play in the new age in the Unit
ed States. This role awaits fur
ther definition by another gen
eration of student leaders whose
style may illuminate rather
than obscure the concerns and
the morality of a broader seg
ment of modern American
youth; whose approach may
help to lead, rather than fail to
coerce, their fellow citizens.
However this may turn out,
there will be a new student gen
eration and it will again be dif
ferent. It will be different, but
it will continue to be in a posi
tion to make its presence felt,
one way or another, more than
in earlier periods of our national
history. This is one of the new
realities that neither the campus
nor society can escape.
Editor's Note: The following is
excerpted from an address by
Clark Kerr, former president of
the University of California,
which was given at a conference
on "Students and Politics" at
San Juan, Puerto Rico, March
27-31, 1967.

•, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico
—A spectre is haunting
_ America —the spectre of stu
dents. For the first time in the
history of the United States,
university students have become
a source of interest for all the
nation; a source of concern for
much of the nation; and a
source of fear for some of the
nation. This is a phenomenon
to the decade of the
1960'5.
The immensity of the change
is spectacularly highlighted by
the contrast with the decade of
the 1950'5. The complaint then
"t was about the silent or apathetic
generation, the generation of
pre-organization men. The only
prior decade which had given
warning of the shape of things
* to come was the 1930'5. But then
students were adjuncts to the
efforts of trade unionists, or of
socialists and communists of the
Old Left, or of isolationists,
" America Firsters or pacifists.
They were auxiliaries. They did
; not stand in their own right as
a potential force in history.
In the 1960'5, a segment of
university students developed
their own style, their own con
tent, their own leadership in an
;■» effort to exert an impact on the
whole society. Instead of "stu
dent chapters" of off-campus
movements, the center of activi
* ty was on the campus itself.
This is new.
Mind of Youth
Youth reflects its society, but
often in an exaggerated fashion.
.. It magnifies and to some extent
distorts the current characteris
tics of its society. It may, also,
at times be more sensitive to
new developments, and thus the
new developments may first be
seen dramatically through the
" actions of youth. This power to
<■. magnify and this power to re
. spond quickly makes the study
of youth an especially rewarding
one, for through youth some
aspects of the nature of a so
ciety can be understood more
fully and more quickly; but one
' must be wary of the distortions
also. To lose contact with the
mind of youth, however, is to
lose contact with a particularly
revealing aspect of reality. As
>. goes youth, so may go the na
tion—only more slowly and less
completely.
Youth can be troublesome to
the status quo when a nation is
in a "time of troubles." A na
tion is in trouble in a period of
change, and particularly violent
change. The only time that
youth is revolutionary is in a
revolutionary situation and pe
riod. Youth may be inherently
»' restless but it is not inherently
revolutionary. It has a revolu
s tionary inclination only when
' revolution looms.
In the United States, in the
past few years, students have
participated in central concerns
of national life, such as the Civil
Rights movement and the debate
over American involvement in
the war in Vietnam, more dra
matically than ever before in
American history.
1 It is this recent development
* of American students at the
center, rather than on the peri
phery, of social issues that has
aroused the interest, the con
cern and the fear. There is a
p* feeling in the air that a new
' force may have entered into so
cial history; that youth may
play a more effective political
role for good or for ill than ever
before.
In the United States, some of
the factors which have current
, ly led to heightened student par
ticipation in political life are
these:
'" • Mass higher education: Fif-
I ty per cent of college age stu
' dents now enter college. It was

more nearly five per cent a half
century ago. Students are now
drawn from many, even all, seg
ments of the population, not
just the middle class and the
aristocracy.
• Concentration In the mass
university: The large college
and the large university have
become a standard habitat for
many of these students. The en
vironment is often quite imper
sonal. There is little sense of a
united community of scholars
and students and administrators.
The impact of greater size has
been increased by the recent ne
glect of the undergraduate in
favor of graduate students, re
search, and external service.
• The permissive environ
ment: The family has become
more permissive and so has the
church. The college no longer
stands so much in loco parentis.
The law gives wider latitude for
freedom of action. All in all,
there is a greater degree of au
tonomy, a lesser scope for au
thority. The student stands more
on his own and relies more on
his peer group.
• The culture of the students:
By now there are enough stu
dents associated together in
large enough groups and for
long enough periods of time and
with enough freedom so that an
independent student culture can
develop with its own dress, style
of behaviour, code of ethics. It
can have a particularly strong
hold on a large campus which
provides little contact with fac
ulty, administration and par
ents. Such a student culture re
inforces itself and gives a sense
of protection against external
threats. It may attract to itself
the related culture of the non
student and draw in some fac
ulty adherents. It is like an is
land culture—an island often in
the sun, partly dependent only,
partly rebellious toward, the
usually benevolent imperial
power that supports it.
• The explosive issues: The
1960's have seen some explosive
issues torment the United States
—particularly the Civil Rights
issue internally and the Vietnam
war externally. Internal justice
and external peace are both in
herently compelling issues for
idealistic youth. Coming togeth
er they have abetted each other.
Beyond these two issues lie oth
ers of great concern—control of
the bomb, adjustment to the
computer, accommodation to the
mass corporation and govern
ment agency, and much else.
• The new tactics: The sit-in,
the teach-in, the mass meeting
or the march covered by the
press and TV have given some
students new weapons, in addi
tion to the older petition and
picket line $nd strike, to call at
tention of the public at large to
their views. They can gain poten
cy through the headlines and
TV screens. They can communi
cate with each other quickly
across the nation about their
concerns. They can travel readi
ly. They can have a loose net
work of friendships and con
tacts. As a consequence, they
can concentrate their talentr
and their attention at selected
pressure points quite readily.
The tone of a campus, even of
the national student body, can
be set by a minority. In the
1920's it was set by the collegi
ate group—the athletes, the fra
ternity men, the Big Men on
Campus. These students concen
trated on activities, on social
life, on occasional pranks.
It is remarkable how so few
can set the tone for so many.
The central fact is that most
students remain the same from
generation to generation. They
remain quite recognizable. But
in each generation a few thrust
themselves forward, or are
thrust forward by the situation
—in the stadium, in the class
room, before the microphone—
and come to stand as changing
symbols for the largely un
changing multitude.
Some student tones cause
more trouble for more people

than others. The collegiate tone
occasionally troubled the Dean
of Students; the vocational and
academic tone of the 40's the
College and the Dean of the
Graduate School; the political
activist tone of the 60's, the
President and the Regents.
From scandals to grades and re
volt, the tone of each generation
has affected the temper and the
tenure of a different layer of
campus administration.
Student Minority
The life of an institution and
the public reaction to it are
greatly affected by the tone of
its dominant student minority.
The nature of this minority is
quite volatile—now one thing,
now another. At the mdment,
the nature is political.
The student political move
ment of the 1960's is, in the to
tality of its means and ends,
unique in American history. No
single element of its approach
is entirely new but the combina
tion of these elements is new.
To speak of a "movement" at
all is to over-state the situation,
for the very nature of the ac
tivity makes it dispersed and di
verse. There are changing lo
calities of action, vehicles for ex
pression, tactics to pursue; and
no developed ideology. It is a
movement that can be seen and
has been seen by many different
people in many different ways.
"Confrontation politics" is the
essence of the new student
movement — confrontation with
the power structure on main
street, or the campus, in Wash
ington. This is the particular
form that political action has
taken. Civil Rights tactics are
the great source of inspiration.
The tactic is to pick an issue
and confront the power struc
ture with it as dramatically as
possible. There are a series of
acts and events, with a certain
style to them and moving in the
same general direction.
There are two elements inter
twined in this new political ac
tivism. The first is composed of
the issue-by-issue protestors; the
second by adherents to one or
another of the organized groups
on the Left. It is the first ele
ment which is unique and has
set the decade of the 1960's aside
as different from the past.
The elements of confrontation
politics which have attracted my
attention as being of particular
importance are these:
• A concern for power: There
is an obsession with power. The
refrain again and again is the
acquisition of power. It seems
to be assumed that, with power,
evil can be eradicated; that,
without it, nothing can be done.
"Student power" can bring
pressure on a university certain
ly, on a society possibly. It re
quires no reliance on a reluctant
faculty, a quiescent labor move
ment, a non-existent peasant
class. It also requires no fixed
ideology. Ideologies divide as

well as unite. They divided stu
dents in the 1930'5.
• The university as a base for
power. The campus is the chosen
focal point for activity. It is the
place to arouse interest, recruit
members, raise money, organize
action, and from which to
launch attacks on chosen tar
gets.
• Distaste for the "establish
ment." There is almost total re
jection of the organizations that
administer the status quo. The
status quo is viewed as domi
nated by the "military-industrial
complex." The university is seen
as a handmaiden to this com
plex, doing research for it and
training its servants. Much of
the intellectual establishment is
viewed as bought and paid for.
• Orientation to specific Is
sues: Ideology is suspect. Also,
given the variety of points of
view among participants, it
would be completely divisive.
There is no more chewing on
the beard of Karl Marx, al
though there is a certain blind
ness toward the left-wing au
thoritarianism of Cuba and Chi
na, even though authority in
other and less harsh forms is
violently opposed. If there could
be said to be any inherent cen
tral ideology, it would be syn
dicalism with its emphasis on
means. And syndicalism was
never much of an ideology.
• Participatory democracy.
There is a distaste for all bu
reaucracies, including their own.
The ideal is the Town Meeting,
or the Quaker committee meet
ing.
• Tactics for the short-run:
The methods of action are all
aimed at quick results or quick
impact, such as the sit-in, the
picket line, strike, march, vigil,
teach-in or other forms of mass
demonstration.
• The importance of style:
The new reformation starts by
nailing bold theses to the Ca
thedral door—with flash bulbs
and cameras ready to record the
scene. Demands are made sud
denly, dramatically, publicly. In
stead of working within organi
zations and through channels
and by consultation, the appeal
is directly to the mass public.

is one quick way of doing this.

to get instant attention. Adver
tising techniques come to the
campus in the service of proph
ecy not profit. The student ac
tivist is the PR expert.
• Allies and allied enemies:

demic styles as well; and outside
