# Indians In Baseball Showdown
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Last weekend's showdown
baseball series with UCLA and
USC turned out to be a stand
off. The Bruin game was rained
out and the Tribe split a double
header with the Trojans.
So it all boils down to this
weekend. Stanford must beat
USC Friday and the Bruins both
times in their doubleheader Sat
urday.
A loss in any of these games
would be a serious setback to
any hopes of a league champ
ionship and a prestigious NCAA
championship.
UCLA Has Advantage
A loss to UCLA (6-0), would
be especially bad. Stanford (3-1)
would then have to hope that
someone else would bump off
the Bruins a couple of times.
Darkhorse Oregon with a 4-1
record would be more than will
ing to slip into first place if
Stanford, USC, and UCLA drag
each other down.

Oregon doesn't have to play
Stanford since the Stanford -
Oregon doubleheader was rained
out the first weekend of the sea
son. UCLA was lucky the same
way and this is why Stanford
must win.
Friday's game begins at 3:00
p.m., and Saturday's games be
gin at noon. All games are in
Sunken Diamond.
Reflection if Opposition?
By a quirk of the polls USC is
ranked number one nationally,
yet is third in the league. UCLA
is in the number three spot na
tionally, but is number one in
the league. Stanford is number
two in both places.
Sandy Vance will be going for
his second straight win over the
Trojans Friday. Last Saturday,
Vance put USC down, 4-1.
Except for home runs by Mike
Schomaker and Bob Boone,
Tribe hitters were anything but
awesome. A large dose of sun

shine may have cured that.
Coach Dutch Fehring has had
the team practice batting for
long hours this week in prepara
tion for the clever USC pitchers
and the fireballing Bruin chuck
ers.
Tough Job
Daro Quiring and Don Rose
will have no easy task Saturday

as they are slated to throw for
Stanford. The Bruins are a hit
ting team.
Left fielder Steve Klausen is
leading the league with a .667
average, and the team as a
whole is hitting an incredible
.337. Their eight home runs,
more than twice as many as
any other team, and their 38

rbi's put them in a class by
themselves.
The Bruins had a slow start,
but everyone who has played
them in the last month is a be
liever now. There is one small
kink in the Bruin armor, how
ever. They haven't played any
one of the caliber of Stanford
or USC.
Stanford pitchers Quiring and
Rose are smart and can keep
the ball low, forcing UCLA to
hit the ball on the ground. If
the Tribe defense is up to par,
the Bruins will have to take a
big dip in their slugging repu
tation.
Aspirin Tablets
Big Rich Kester of UCLA will
be on the mound for one of the
games against the Tribe. Kester
reportedly, likes to throw aspirin
tablets at the batters, but he
has a tendency to be wild. Stan

ford handles fireballers pretty
well, even if he isn't wild.
Frank Duffy, Mike Scho
maker, Mark Marquess, Dick
Swan, Bob Boone, Hon Shotts,
and Bill Holt will be in the Stan
ford line up for sure. The only
question is whether hard hit
ting Jeff Rohlfing or dependable
Marty Erck will start.

Frank Duffy, Mike Scho
maker, Mark Marquess, Dick
Swan, Bob Boone, Hon Shotts,
and Bill Holt will be in the Stan
ford line up for sure. The only
question is whether hard hit
ting Jeff Rohlfing or dependable
Marty Erck will start.
Last weekend's showdown
baseball series with UCLA and
USC turned out to be a stand
off. The Bruin game was rained
out and the Tribe split a double
header with the Trojans.
So it all boils down to this
weekend. Stanford must beat
USC Friday and the Bruins both
times in their doubleheader Sat
urday.
A loss in any of these games
would be a serious setback to
any hopes of a league champ
ionship and a prestigious NCAA
championship.
UCLA Has Advantage
A loss to UCLA (6-0), would
be especially bad. Stanford (3-1)
would then have to hope that
someone else would bump off
the Bruins a couple of times.
Darkhorse Oregon with a 4-1
record would be more than will
ing to slip into first place if
Stanford, USC, and UCLA drag
each other down.

Oregon doesn't have to play
Stanford since the Stanford -
Oregon doubleheader was rained
out the first weekend of the sea
son. UCLA was lucky the same
way and this is why Stanford
must win.
Friday's game begins at 3:00
p.m., and Saturday's games be
gin at noon. All games are in
Sunken Diamond.
Reflection if Opposition?
By a quirk of the polls USC is
ranked number one nationally,
yet is third in the league. UCLA
is in the number three spot na
tionally, but is number one in
the league. Stanford is number
two in both places.
Sandy Vance will be going for
his second straight win over the
Trojans Friday. Last Saturday,
Vance put USC down, 4-1.
Except for home runs by Mike
Schomaker and Bob Boone,
Tribe hitters were anything but
awesome. A large dose of sun

shine may have cured that.
Coach Dutch Fehring has had
the team practice batting for
long hours this week in prepara
tion for the clever USC pitchers
and the fireballing Bruin chuck
ers.
Tough Job
Daro Quiring and Don Rose
will have no easy task Saturday

as they are slated to throw for
Stanford. The Bruins are a hit
ting team.
Left fielder Steve Klausen is
leading the league with a .667
average, and the team as a
whole is hitting an incredible
.337. Their eight home runs,
more than twice as many as
any other team, and their 38

rbi's put them in a class by
themselves.
The Bruins had a slow start,
but everyone who has played
them in the last month is a be
liever now. There is one small
kink in the Bruin armor, how
ever. They haven't played any
one of the caliber of Stanford
or USC.
Stanford pitchers Quiring and
Rose are smart and can keep
the ball low, forcing UCLA to
hit the ball on the ground. If
the Tribe defense is up to par,
the Bruins will have to take a
big dip in their slugging repu
tation.
Aspirin Tablets
Big Rich Kester of UCLA will
be on the mound for one of the
games against the Tribe. Kester
reportedly, likes to throw aspirin
tablets at the batters, but he
has a tendency to be wild. Stan

ford handles fireballers pretty
well, even if he isn't wild.
