# Cards Seek First Victory
## Trackmen Challenge Washington 
### JIM MALLERY 
Stanford's track team goes
dfter its first win of the season
as it takes on the University of
Washington Huskies tomorrow
in Seattle. Several meet records
are up for grabs as the athletes
scramble for points in what
promises to be a very close con
test.
One dope sheet based on pre
vious performances shows Stan
ford the favorite 73-72, and a
bad or very good performance
for either side could mean the
-neet.
Iron man Bud Walsh will
have his hands full with the
Huskie's fugitive from the grid
iron, Dave Williams.
Long Jump Hopes
In the long jump Williams has
a best of 24' and may find
limself wallowing in third place
behind both Walsh and Craig
Vaughan, who have jumps of
25' 2Yz" and 24' 11%" respec
tively. The meet record of 24'
W seems to be in definite jeo
pardy.
In the 440 intermediate hur
dles Walsh is the underdog. He
has a time of 54.0, compared to
William's 51.9, which is fourth
best in the conference.
Walsh will be involved in an
other duel, this time against
Bill Roe in the high hurdles.

Bud has the upper hand with a
time of 14.1, third best in the
conference, but Roe is number
four with 14.2.
Cox Returns
Stanford will get an added
lift with the presence of a fully
recovered Roger Cox and Jim
Ward. Cox anchored the 440 re
lay to its best time of the sea
son last week, but had to drop
from the 220 when his leg tight
ened up.
Ward won the 440 against SC
in 47.7, but also experienced
some difficulty running. Both
men should bo ready to carry
a full load this weekend.
The meet record in the mile,
of 4:11.8 is in danger of falling.
Washington's Dave Roberts has
a 4.10 to his credit this season,
and Card Alan Sanford contin
ues to improve, last week run
ning 4:10.2.
Husky sprinter Bernard Bab
tiste also threatens the 100 yard
dash record of 9.7. He has a best
of 9.6 and last week came back
from an injury to run 9.7.
Jordan Optimistic
Coach Jordan feels that this
is the first meet of the season
that Stanford has entered with
a chance of winning, but he add
ed: "We'll have to dig, scratch
and claw for every point if we
are to win."
