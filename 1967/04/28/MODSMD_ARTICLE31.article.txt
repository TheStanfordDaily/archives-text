# Amazing Aquatic Antics Highlight Hip Hydro follies
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
As most of the frustrated
members of the sailing club well
know, the hiss of Flying Ju
niors knifing through the waters
of Lake Lag has been replaced
by the swish of slalom skis, the
occasional sploosh of a botched
"wake 360" and a constant chat
ter emanating from the teeth
of slightly blue water skiers.
Yes, it's Hydrofollies time
again, or to be exact, this Sun
day at 2 p.m. is Hydrofollies
time again.
Every Aspect
The show will feature about
every possible aspect of water
skiing except jumping. (This is
due mainly to the fact that there
is no jump on Lake Lag).
Stanford skiers will demon
strate their prowess in slalom,
trick riding, barefoot, shoe skis,
a water ballet (girls, of course),
a pyramid, a mixed doubles act,

and anything else they can think
up before Sunday.
There will also be a few added
attractions such as a pair of
human skis, assorted clowns, a
daredevil act by Randy Fergu
son (whose skill is such that he
risks his life every time he puts
on a pair of skis) and the spec
tacular kite-flying exploits of
Andres Botero.
Other participants (who
should be glorified for just get
ting out in water that cold) are:
Aubie Bartold, Rick Hansen, Kit
Mason, Ray Rooker, Jerry Berg,
Randy Bartlett, and Dave No
land.
Lending a touch of femininity
to the occasion will be Jean
Stanislaus, Kay Griffen, Heidi
Girton, Suzi Schultin, Sue Flei
tchner, and Cindy Elliot.
The beautiful Dorsett tow
boat, gas, and ski equipment
were donated by Shony's Ma
