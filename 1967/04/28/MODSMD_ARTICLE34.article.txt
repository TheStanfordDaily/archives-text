# National Affiliation

Stanford's chapter of Kappa Sigma frater

Despite the suggestion that it now drop it?
national affiliation, the stronger forces in the
house seem set on riding out the suspension
and remaining within the national. One won
ders why.
What is the advantage of being a national
fraternity? Does it offer something the local
doesn't?
Most effects of national affiliation appear to
be detrimental. Why should a group of Stan
ford men living together want an authority
2500 miles away dictating how it is to live?
National rules governing house activities and
selection of new members deny that each
group is unique and needs to. define its own
living situation. Racial prejudice is a most bla
tant case of national intervention. The rules
deny that a particular house changes from year
to year and may find new traditions, new ac
tivities, and more appropriate methods of
choosing members.
Housing innovation is limited when house
rules are applied externally. Which national
fraternities at Stanford could consider a draw
system, coeducational membership, or even
elimination of their pledge program? National
fraternities say they will never change. Instead
of allowing a house to evolve as its members
change, they mold new members to their im
age.
Arguments in favor of national fraternities
include financial stability, scholarship aid, spe

cial financial help, and leadership training
(whatever that means). The national frater
nities did give financial aid for construction
of the new cluster houses. However, this money
was drawn from funds directly paid by local
chapter members or wealthy alumni who iden
tify more with their fraternity than with Stan
ford.
The rare scholarship aid given by the na
tional fraternity is commendable, but the
amount is negligible compared to the funds
given by the University each year. Again, the
money could be channeled through the Uni
versity much more effectively. Nationals also
provide funds for certain special projects. Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon, for example, has a matching
fund program to build libraries in its local
chapter, although many, including our own
local SAE chapter, don't take advantage of
this.
Despite the arguments against national af
filiation, some would argue that the national
fraternity is a legitimate housing alternative
which students are free to choose. Rather, it
seems that the majority of members join a par
ticular fraternity merely because it is a fra
ternity, or because daddy was in it. Most know
nothing about the nature and rigidity of the na
tional fraternity's rules.
We commend Alpha Tau Omicron, Beta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and most recently Sigma Chi
Omega for dropping their national affiliation.
We urge Kappa Sigma now to do the same.
And we ask the remaining national fraternities
at Stanford also to consider this question.

What is the advantage of being a national
fraternity? Does it offer something the local
doesn't?
Most effects of national affiliation appear to
be detrimental. Why should a group of Stan
ford men living together want an authority
2500 miles away dictating how it is to live?
National rules governing house activities and
selection of new members deny that each
group is unique and needs to. define its own
living situation. Racial prejudice is a most bla
tant case of national intervention. The rules
deny that a particular house changes from year
to year and may find new traditions, new ac
tivities, and more appropriate methods of
choosing members.
Housing innovation is limited when house
rules are applied externally. Which national
fraternities at Stanford could consider a draw
system, coeducational membership, or even
elimination of their pledge program? National
fraternities say they will never change. Instead
of allowing a house to evolve as its members
change, they mold new members to their im
age.
Arguments in favor of national fraternities
include financial stability, scholarship aid, spe

cial financial help, and leadership training
(whatever that means). The national frater
nities did give financial aid for construction
of the new cluster houses. However, this money
was drawn from funds directly paid by local
chapter members or wealthy alumni who iden
tify more with their fraternity than with Stan
ford.
The rare scholarship aid given by the na
tional fraternity is commendable, but the
amount is negligible compared to the funds
given by the University each year. Again, the
money could be channeled through the Uni
versity much more effectively. Nationals also
provide funds for certain special projects. Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon, for example, has a matching
fund program to build libraries in its local
chapter, although many, including our own
local SAE chapter, don't take advantage of
this.
Despite the arguments against national af
filiation, some would argue that the national
fraternity is a legitimate housing alternative
which students are free to choose. Rather, it
seems that the majority of members join a par
ticular fraternity merely because it is a fra
ternity, or because daddy was in it. Most know
nothing about the nature and rigidity of the na
tional fraternity's rules.
We commend Alpha Tau Omicron, Beta Chi,
Lambda Nu, and most recently Sigma Chi
Omega for dropping their national affiliation.
We urge Kappa Sigma now to do the same.
And we ask the remaining national fraternities
at Stanford also to consider this question.
