## Why 'Debate' A Moral Crisis? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The "responsible debate" rally
of last Monday: this is unbear
able — to hear grown men at a
university, in the midst of a
deep moral crisis, talking like
boys in a debating club.
To hear them talk "reason
ably" about balance of power
and other political abstractions
while a whole country is being
put to death by our power, a
military machine as heavily
armed and as ferocious as any
the world has known. This week
we found out that the bomb-load
dropped on North Vietnam in
the last month was heavier than
that used on Germany in the
peak month of World War II
bombing.
Recently our own authorities
announced that 50,000 civilians
are being killed in S. Vietnam
each year; five times that figure
would probably be more accu
rate; and according to our mili
tary, it will get worse, much
worse. (They "regret" this, they
tell us, and they pay $36 in
demnity for each death.)
Gassed and Shredded
And while we are being "re
sponsible" and carrying on this
gentlemanly debate, large num
bers of human beings will be
burned alive (no other country
makes or uses napalm, we
alone). They will see their crops
destroyed ,they will be gassed,
shredded by fragmentation
bombs, they will watch their
miserable handful of factories
(all basic, they have no lux
uries) blasted.
What the Germans did at
Guernica, Rotterdam and War
saw we will be doing, only

more subtly, more insidiously.
Johnson's war game has failed;
his resort now is to pure terror.
Absolute power does not simply
corrupt, it perverts.
Let's debate then, let's go on
talking here at Stanford in all
our blandness of ease and com
fort; the Vietnamese people can
wait until we have reasonably
figured it all out and are sure
that our own security, honor
and "face" are not endangered.
They have waited — and died
in their millions — for 20 years
(while successive white neo
colonialists and puppeteers have
sought to maintain ultimate con
trol over them. Let them wait
while we debate, while we de
cide that what look like crimes
against humanity really are
crimes against humanity.
And while we are debating, a
handful of men (my emphasis)
in the U S. Senate will be strug
gling to keep an emasculated
Senate alive in the face of un
limited, uncontrolled Presidenti
al power. Professor Otis, at the
rally, objecting to "noisy and
intolerant allegations" by the
war protestors, said that "If we
don't start communicating with
each other, we will never be
able to debate with the U.S. gov
ernment."
Enough Debate
But one does not debate with
a quasi-dictator who has ignored
the pleas, the advice, and yes,
the debate of almost the whole
of the literate, thoughtful com
munity in this country: from
The World Council of Churches,
from at least 20 Senators in
cluding his own Senate majority
leader, from Professor Reich

auer, his former ambassador to
Japan and a great Asia scholar,
from J. K. Galbraith, his former
ambassador to India, from Geo
rge Kennan, once ambassador
to Russia and one of our most
respected experts on foreign
policy, from massive segments
of the intellectual and artistic
community — and on and on —
who have told Johnson that
this war is immoral, stupid, un
necessary, futile.
If anyone could once have de
bated the war with this dema
gogue and liar, this greatest of
political manipulators, it was
the Senate. But Johnson took
care of that possibility when he
skillfully used the suspicious
(and now forgotten) Tonkin
Gulf episode (in which no one
on our side was touched and no
ship damaged, if indeed there
was any episode at all) to rail
road a Resolution through a
panicked Senate, which gave
him a blank check to do what
ever he thought necessary in
Asia.
Now General Westmoreland
tells us, in effect, that dissenters
are traitors. One of the things
we should have learned from
this war is that there is a clear
and present danger of domina
tion of our lives and our poli
tics by the military abetted by
a militaristic President. Even
the Germans learned that les
son (or did they?).
We are a dishonored people.
The richest, most brutally over
powered nation in the history of
the world, we have watched the
murder and terrorization of a
colored peasant people who
wanted no more than a change

from feudalism and an end to
domination by white men.
At bottom we have considered
only our comfort, our conven
ience, our safety — because we
are a frightened people, fright
ened and cowardly, who "de
bate" without kindness, charity,
or compassion, who forget that
these are human beings, our
fellows, our brothers, whom we
destroy.

bers of human beings will be
burned alive (no other country
makes or uses napalm, we
alone). They will see their crops
destroyed ,they will be gassed,
shredded by fragmentation
bombs, they will watch their
miserable handful of factories
(all basic, they have no lux
uries) blasted.
What the Germans did at
Guernica, Rotterdam and War
saw we will be doing, only

more subtly, more insidiously.
Johnson's war game has failed;
his resort now is to pure terror.
Absolute power does not simply
corrupt, it perverts.
Let's debate then, let's go on
talking here at Stanford in all
our blandness of ease and com
fort; the Vietnamese people can
wait until we have reasonably
figured it all out and are sure
that our own security, honor
and "face" are not endangered.
They have waited — and died
in their millions — for 20 years
(while successive white neo
colonialists and puppeteers have
sought to maintain ultimate con
trol over them. Let them wait
while we debate, while we de
cide that what look like crimes
against humanity really are
crimes against humanity.
And while we are debating, a
handful of men (my emphasis)
in the U S. Senate will be strug
gling to keep an emasculated
Senate alive in the face of un
limited, uncontrolled Presidenti
al power. Professor Otis, at the
rally, objecting to "noisy and
intolerant allegations" by the
war protestors, said that "If we
don't start communicating with
each other, we will never be
able to debate with the U.S. gov
ernment."
Enough Debate
But one does not debate with
a quasi-dictator who has ignored
the pleas, the advice, and yes,
the debate of almost the whole
of the literate, thoughtful com
munity in this country: from
The World Council of Churches,
from at least 20 Senators in
cluding his own Senate majority
leader, from Professor Reich

auer, his former ambassador to
Japan and a great Asia scholar,
from J. K. Galbraith, his former
ambassador to India, from Geo
rge Kennan, once ambassador
to Russia and one of our most
respected experts on foreign
policy, from massive segments
of the intellectual and artistic
community — and on and on —
who have told Johnson that
this war is immoral, stupid, un
necessary, futile.
If anyone could once have de
bated the war with this dema
gogue and liar, this greatest of
political manipulators, it was
the Senate. But Johnson took
care of that possibility when he
skillfully used the suspicious
(and now forgotten) Tonkin
Gulf episode (in which no one
on our side was touched and no
ship damaged, if indeed there
was any episode at all) to rail
road a Resolution through a
panicked Senate, which gave
him a blank check to do what
ever he thought necessary in
Asia.
Now General Westmoreland
tells us, in effect, that dissenters
are traitors. One of the things
we should have learned from
this war is that there is a clear
and present danger of domina
tion of our lives and our poli
tics by the military abetted by
a militaristic President. Even
the Germans learned that les
son (or did they?).
We are a dishonored people.
The richest, most brutally over
powered nation in the history of
the world, we have watched the
murder and terrorization of a
colored peasant people who
wanted no more than a change

from feudalism and an end to
domination by white men.
At bottom we have considered
only our comfort, our conven
ience, our safety — because we
are a frightened people, fright
ened and cowardly, who "de
bate" without kindness, charity,
or compassion, who forget that
these are human beings, our
fellows, our brothers, whom we
destroy.

The "responsible debate" rally
of last Monday: this is unbear
able — to hear grown men at a
university, in the midst of a
deep moral crisis, talking like
boys in a debating club.
To hear them talk "reason
ably" about balance of power
and other political abstractions
while a whole country is being
put to death by our power, a
military machine as heavily
armed and as ferocious as any
the world has known. This week
we found out that the bomb-load
dropped on North Vietnam in
the last month was heavier than
that used on Germany in the
peak month of World War II
bombing.
Recently our own authorities
announced that 50,000 civilians
are being killed in S. Vietnam
each year; five times that figure
would probably be more accu
rate; and according to our mili
tary, it will get worse, much
worse. (They "regret" this, they
tell us, and they pay $36 in
demnity for each death.)
Gassed and Shredded

And while we are debating, a
handful of men (my emphasis)
in the U S. Senate will be strug
gling to keep an emasculated
Senate alive in the face of un
limited, uncontrolled Presidenti
al power. Professor Otis, at the
rally, objecting to "noisy and
intolerant allegations" by the
war protestors, said that "If we
don't start communicating with
each other, we will never be
able to debate with the U.S. gov
ernment."
Enough Debate
But one does not debate with
a quasi-dictator who has ignored
the pleas, the advice, and yes,
the debate of almost the whole
of the literate, thoughtful com
munity in this country: from
The World Council of Churches,
from at least 20 Senators in
cluding his own Senate majority
leader, from Professor Reich

auer, his former ambassador to
Japan and a great Asia scholar,
from J. K. Galbraith, his former
ambassador to India, from Geo
rge Kennan, once ambassador
to Russia and one of our most
respected experts on foreign
policy, from massive segments
of the intellectual and artistic
community — and on and on —
who have told Johnson that
this war is immoral, stupid, un
necessary, futile.
If anyone could once have de
bated the war with this dema
gogue and liar, this greatest of
political manipulators, it was
the Senate. But Johnson took
care of that possibility when he
skillfully used the suspicious
(and now forgotten) Tonkin
Gulf episode (in which no one
on our side was touched and no
ship damaged, if indeed there
was any episode at all) to rail
road a Resolution through a
panicked Senate, which gave
him a blank check to do what
ever he thought necessary in
Asia.
Now General Westmoreland
tells us, in effect, that dissenters
are traitors. One of the things
we should have learned from
this war is that there is a clear
and present danger of domina
tion of our lives and our poli
tics by the military abetted by
a militaristic President. Even
the Germans learned that les
son (or did they?).
We are a dishonored people.
The richest, most brutally over
powered nation in the history of
the world, we have watched the
murder and terrorization of a
colored peasant people who
wanted no more than a change

from feudalism and an end to
domination by white men.
At bottom we have considered
only our comfort, our conven
ience, our safety — because we
are a frightened people, fright
ened and cowardly, who "de
bate" without kindness, charity,
or compassion, who forget that
these are human beings, our
fellows, our brothers, whom we
destroy.

The "responsible debate" rally
of last Monday: this is unbear
able — to hear grown men at a
university, in the midst of a
deep moral crisis, talking like
boys in a debating club.
To hear them talk "reason
ably" about balance of power
and other political abstractions
while a whole country is being
put to death by our power, a
military machine as heavily
armed and as ferocious as any
the world has known. This week
we found out that the bomb-load
dropped on North Vietnam in
the last month was heavier than
that used on Germany in the
peak month of World War II
bombing.
Recently our own authorities
announced that 50,000 civilians
are being killed in S. Vietnam
each year; five times that figure
would probably be more accu
rate; and according to our mili
tary, it will get worse, much
worse. (They "regret" this, they
tell us, and they pay $36 in
demnity for each death.)
Gassed and Shredded
And while we are being "re
sponsible" and carrying on this
gentlemanly debate, large num
bers of human beings will be
burned alive (no other country
makes or uses napalm, we
alone). They will see their crops
destroyed ,they will be gassed,
shredded by fragmentation
bombs, they will watch their
miserable handful of factories
(all basic, they have no lux
uries) blasted.
What the Germans did at
Guernica, Rotterdam and War
saw we will be doing, only

more subtly, more insidiously.
Johnson's war game has failed;
his resort now is to pure terror.
Absolute power does not simply
corrupt, it perverts.
Let's debate then, let's go on
talking here at Stanford in all
our blandness of ease and com
fort; the Vietnamese people can
wait until we have reasonably
figured it all out and are sure
that our own security, honor
and "face" are not endangered.
They have waited — and died
in their millions — for 20 years
(while successive white neo
colonialists and puppeteers have
sought to maintain ultimate con
trol over them. Let them wait
while we debate, while we de
cide that what look like crimes
against humanity really are
crimes against humanity.
