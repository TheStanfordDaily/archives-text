## Educational Reform In A World Context 
### Tim Haight 
Did you ever wonder how we
got to talking about all these
issues of educational reform—
from pass-fail grading to OFF?
Two main streams of thought
influenced certain students and
faculty to get this University on
the road to change.
The first of these, and the one
most prevalent in the thinking
of the non-student members of
the community, was the attitude
that every institution will dis
cover certain things that have
gone wrong, that will need
change. Hence, efforts are made
to make dormitories livable,
courses more relevant to stu
dents who are ignoring them
(Science requirements), regula
tions change when enforcement
becomes impossible.
The second is the feeling that
our society is in such trouble that
steps must be taken to infuse
new values and skills into the
next generation, or even into this
generation, if possible. These
people hold some exalted view
of the University, or at least ask,
"If not here, in a place dedicated
to the best in Western Civiliza
tion, then where?"
Fusion Of Forces
Often the two trains of thought
become mixed. This happened to
Dave Harris' administration.
Dave found that while people
"wouldn't always buy the Uni
versity's role in social revolution,
they would buy OFF! Hence,
much of the concrete action of
the year was undertaken by
those people who would have
been just as comfortable work
ing under Bob Klein (such as Jan
Jacobi) or Carl Schmidt. (Fresh
men note: these were the other
leading candidates last year.)
The Packer committee is
another example of the fusion of
these two forces. Both welcomed
this effort as an attempt to bring
the University up to some level
of consciousness about its role in
the world.
Whether this will happen is
now in doubt. We begin to get
the feeling that the Packer com
mittee will bend to student pres
sure a little in instituting some

educational experiments, but
that in the end we will simply
have screwed some shiny new
bolts on the same old machine.
Nit-Picking
The ASSU Presidential elec
tion seems to be heading the
same way. We are nit-picking, re
hashing suggestions that really
will happen anyway, or (in Fritz
Schaefer's case) trying to sell
an Orange County picture of
Stanford to people who live here.
At this writing, the crucial is
sue seems to be whether or not
people like "We Accuse" posters.
And while all this is going on
the world is going to hell in a
handbasket. We are bombing the
MIG bases, perhaps forcing
North Vietnam to relocate the
jets in Red China. Then the next
logical escalation would be the
violation of Chinese air space
and the bombing of Chinese soil.
Russia has been communicat
ing with China to reduce the
Sino-Soviet split in the name of
Vietnam, and recently showed
new coldness to us in refusing
to help the American Red Cross
help our captured pilots.
World War in
Yesterday, when I sat down
with friends in the Union and
seriously said, "This is the year
of World War Three," everybody
agreed. If we were to title the
activities of American universi
ties in this time of idiocy, we
would say "Alas, babble on."
We do not have time to mess
around with non-essentials. It
will do us no good to fix the air
conditioning if the world is on
fire. If we are going to talk about
educational reform it must be
in the context of the tremendous
responsibility facing all of us
right now and continuing into all
the years that come.
Pass-fail grading, OFF!, new
dorms, or better General Studies
requirements will do us no good
unless the entire University com
munity—students, faculty, and
even administration—begins to
realize that it has got to put out
to divert the world from an
almost inexorable course into the
abyss.
For Status Quo
It is the saddest of commen
taries that in these times stu
dents lack motivation, faculties
are concerned with their pres
tige, and administrations are
worried about making things
run smoothly and satisfactorily
to satisfy the money-power in
the status quo. We have more im
portant things to do.
In this election, then, in the
Packer Committee, in our own
choices of what matters in this
confused but frighteningly clear
age, we must talk about reform,
educational or personal, in terms
of the incredible consequences
that the absence of that reform
could cause.
Perhaps we could even para
phrase, "therefore ask not whose
picture is on the 'We Accuse'
poster; it's you.'

In this election, then, in the
Packer Committee, in our own
choices of what matters in this
confused but frighteningly clear
age, we must talk about reform,
educational or personal, in terms
of the incredible consequences
that the absence of that reform
could cause.
Perhaps we could even para
phrase, "therefore ask not whose
picture is on the 'We Accuse'
poster; it's you.'
Did you ever wonder how we
got to talking about all these
issues of educational reform—
from pass-fail grading to OFF?
Two main streams of thought
influenced certain students and
faculty to get this University on
the road to change.
The first of these, and the one
most prevalent in the thinking
of the non-student members of
the community, was the attitude
that every institution will dis
cover certain things that have
gone wrong, that will need
change. Hence, efforts are made
to make dormitories livable,
courses more relevant to stu
dents who are ignoring them
(Science requirements), regula
tions change when enforcement
becomes impossible.
The second is the feeling that
our society is in such trouble that
steps must be taken to infuse
new values and skills into the
next generation, or even into this
generation, if possible. These
people hold some exalted view
of the University, or at least ask,
"If not here, in a place dedicated
to the best in Western Civiliza
tion, then where?"
Fusion Of Forces
Often the two trains of thought
become mixed. This happened to
Dave Harris' administration.
Dave found that while people
"wouldn't always buy the Uni
versity's role in social revolution,
they would buy OFF! Hence,
much of the concrete action of
the year was undertaken by
those people who would have
been just as comfortable work
ing under Bob Klein (such as Jan
Jacobi) or Carl Schmidt. (Fresh
men note: these were the other
leading candidates last year.)
The Packer committee is
another example of the fusion of
these two forces. Both welcomed
this effort as an attempt to bring
the University up to some level
of consciousness about its role in
the world.
Whether this will happen is
now in doubt. We begin to get
the feeling that the Packer com
mittee will bend to student pres
sure a little in instituting some

educational experiments, but
that in the end we will simply
have screwed some shiny new
bolts on the same old machine.
Nit-Picking
The ASSU Presidential elec
tion seems to be heading the
same way. We are nit-picking, re
hashing suggestions that really
will happen anyway, or (in Fritz
Schaefer's case) trying to sell
an Orange County picture of
Stanford to people who live here.
At this writing, the crucial is
sue seems to be whether or not
people like "We Accuse" posters.
And while all this is going on
the world is going to hell in a
handbasket. We are bombing the
MIG bases, perhaps forcing
North Vietnam to relocate the
jets in Red China. Then the next
logical escalation would be the
violation of Chinese air space
and the bombing of Chinese soil.
Russia has been communicat
ing with China to reduce the
Sino-Soviet split in the name of
Vietnam, and recently showed
new coldness to us in refusing
to help the American Red Cross
help our captured pilots.
World War in
Yesterday, when I sat down
with friends in the Union and
seriously said, "This is the year
of World War Three," everybody
agreed. If we were to title the
activities of American universi
ties in this time of idiocy, we
would say "Alas, babble on."
We do not have time to mess
around with non-essentials. It
will do us no good to fix the air
conditioning if the world is on
fire. If we are going to talk about
educational reform it must be
in the context of the tremendous
responsibility facing all of us
right now and continuing into all
the years that come.
Pass-fail grading, OFF!, new
dorms, or better General Studies
requirements will do us no good
unless the entire University com
munity—students, faculty, and
even administration—begins to
realize that it has got to put out
to divert the world from an
almost inexorable course into the
abyss.
For Status Quo
It is the saddest of commen
taries that in these times stu
dents lack motivation, faculties
are concerned with their pres
tige, and administrations are
worried about making things
run smoothly and satisfactorily
to satisfy the money-power in
the status quo. We have more im
portant things to do.

to divert the world from an
almost inexorable course into the
abyss.
For Status Quo
It is the saddest of commen
taries that in these times stu
dents lack motivation, faculties
are concerned with their pres
tige, and administrations are
worried about making things
run smoothly and satisfactorily
to satisfy the money-power in
the status quo. We have more im
portant things to do.
In this election, then, in the
Packer Committee, in our own
choices of what matters in this
confused but frighteningly clear
age, we must talk about reform,
educational or personal, in terms
of the incredible consequences
that the absence of that reform
could cause.
Perhaps we could even para
phrase, "therefore ask not whose
picture is on the 'We Accuse'
poster; it's you.'
Did you ever wonder how we
got to talking about all these
issues of educational reform—
from pass-fail grading to OFF?
Two main streams of thought
influenced certain students and
faculty to get this University on
the road to change.
The first of these, and the one
most prevalent in the thinking
of the non-student members of
the community, was the attitude
that every institution will dis
cover certain things that have
gone wrong, that will need
change. Hence, efforts are made
to make dormitories livable,
courses more relevant to stu
dents who are ignoring them
(Science requirements), regula
tions change when enforcement
becomes impossible.
The second is the feeling that
our society is in such trouble that
steps must be taken to infuse
new values and skills into the
next generation, or even into this
generation, if possible. These
people hold some exalted view
of the University, or at least ask,
"If not here, in a place dedicated
to the best in Western Civiliza
tion, then where?"
Fusion Of Forces
Often the two trains of thought
become mixed. This happened to
Dave Harris' administration.
Dave found that while people
"wouldn't always buy the Uni
versity's role in social revolution,
they would buy OFF! Hence,
much of the concrete action of
the year was undertaken by
those people who would have
been just as comfortable work
ing under Bob Klein (such as Jan
Jacobi) or Carl Schmidt. (Fresh
men note: these were the other
leading candidates last year.)
The Packer committee is
another example of the fusion of
these two forces. Both welcomed
this effort as an attempt to bring
the University up to some level
of consciousness about its role in
the world.
Whether this will happen is
now in doubt. We begin to get
the feeling that the Packer com
mittee will bend to student pres
sure a little in instituting some

educational experiments, but
that in the end we will simply
have screwed some shiny new
bolts on the same old machine.
Nit-Picking
The ASSU Presidential elec
tion seems to be heading the
same way. We are nit-picking, re
hashing suggestions that really
will happen anyway, or (in Fritz
Schaefer's case) trying to sell
an Orange County picture of
Stanford to people who live here.
At this writing, the crucial is
sue seems to be whether or not
people like "We Accuse" posters.
And while all this is going on
the world is going to hell in a
handbasket. We are bombing the
MIG bases, perhaps forcing
North Vietnam to relocate the
jets in Red China. Then the next
logical escalation would be the
violation of Chinese air space
and the bombing of Chinese soil.
Russia has been communicat
ing with China to reduce the
Sino-Soviet split in the name of
Vietnam, and recently showed
new coldness to us in refusing
to help the American Red Cross
help our captured pilots.
World War in
Yesterday, when I sat down
with friends in the Union and
seriously said, "This is the year
of World War Three," everybody
agreed. If we were to title the
activities of American universi
ties in this time of idiocy, we
would say "Alas, babble on."
We do not have time to mess
around with non-essentials. It
will do us no good to fix the air
conditioning if the world is on
fire. If we are going to talk about
educational reform it must be
in the context of the tremendous
responsibility facing all of us
right now and continuing into all
the years that come.
Pass-fail grading, OFF!, new
dorms, or better General Studies
requirements will do us no good
unless the entire University com
munity—students, faculty, and
even administration—begins to
realize that it has got to put out
to divert the world from an
almost inexorable course into the
abyss.
