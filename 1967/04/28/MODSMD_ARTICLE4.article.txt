# Charge Religious Bias
## CO's Judged On Consistency Of Views 
### ROBERT BRODY (Second of Two Parts) 
The lengthy procedure which the
conscientious objector usually must
follow has discouraged many a po
tential C.0., yet the increasing num
bers receiving C.O. status demon
strate that it is surmountable. This
article will deal with the C.O. pro
cedure and the type of individual who
is willing to face it.
The first step for the civilian is
Form 150, the C.O. application. It is

clearly biased in favor of the C.O.
of long standing whose beliefs about
war are primarily religious.
Mrs. Donaldine Ellington of the
San Mateo local draft board indicates
that, although the board regards
most applicants as sincere, the longer
an individual waits to file as a C.0.,
the more the board is likely to ques
tion the "consistency and depth" of
his beliefs.
Usually the local draft board re
jects the application in order to inter-

view the applicant. It is up to the ap
plicant, however, to request the right
of appearance.
In some interviews members of lo
cal boards have asked such questions
as "Why are you a coward?" If a
board member appears belligerent,
the applicant may appeal an unfavor
able decision to court.
However, even if the court rules in
his favor, the C.O. remains under the
jurisdiction of the same local board.
Because such adverse court decisions

provoke the state draft board, the lo
cal board will usually be kinder in
their decision the second time around.
While only 5 percent of applicants
receive the desired status on the ba
sis of their applications, 20 to 25
percent obtain it following an ap
pearance.
Negative Result of Appeals
If the C.O. is denied the desired
status by the local board, he can ap
peal to the state board. The state
board usually turns him down. It
does so to obtain more information
about him when he appeals to the
President. This final stage of ap
peals involves an F. 8.1, investigation
and an appearance before a Justice
Department hearing officer.
The unevaluated results go to the
Justice Department, which then makes
a recommendation to the state board.
C.O. counselor Paul Seaver stated his
impression that recent recommenda
tions have usually been negative,
even in cases of favorable reports
from the F. 8.1, and the federal hear
ing officer.
Early Application Filing Necessary
Mrs. Norma Crockett of the Stan
ford Counseling and Testing Center
believes that the lengthy application
procedure discourages the person who
merely seeks escape from his military
obligation. As a counselor she is con
cerned with "making the individual
understand himself and the logical
consequences of his position" before
he applies.
Probably the most unfair aspect of
the system is the plight of the man
who does not decide until after in
duction that he is a C.O. Although one
may theoretically obtain a discharge
by filing a special form with the ap
propriate board for his service, the
board usually rejects him because, in
its opinion, he has not shown suffi
cient grounds for a change in status.
The result is frequently a court
martial, a dishonorable discharge, and
a sentence of 3 or 4 years in jail, al
though some sentences run as high as
20 years.
Change of Policy
A memorandum from the Central
Committee for Conscientious Objec
tors (CCCO) in Philadelphia stated:
"At the present time about 4 percent

of these applicants (for discharge or
transfer to noncombatant status) are
approved; two years ago about 80
percent were approved. The change in
policy has occurred at National Selec
tive Service Headquarters which rec
ommends on all CO. applications
made under the armed forces regu
lations . . .
"There is no visible connection be
tween religious training and belief;
and the disposition of his application."
In protesting the "virtual absence
of due process in the military", the
memorandum points out that "a sol
dier - C.O. never appears before any
board or individual enpowered to rec
ognize his conscientious objection."
New Religious C.O.
Whereas in World War II only 1
out of 1000 registrants applied and
received C.O. status, the estimate is
1 out of 400 for 1966. Lane Barton,
Episcopal chaplain on campus, com
mented that the C.O. dilemma is "the
most insistent and frequent problem
that arises in the pastoral ministry
on campus today."
From what groups do these new
C.O.'s come? While the C.O. of sev
eral years ago came from one of the
"peace churches" — Quakers, Menno
nites, Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses
— today's C.O. has had little, if any
orthodox religious background.
Because of this he has greater dif
ficulty in presenting his beliefs about
war in traditional religious terms
than did his predecessors. One cur
ious exception among the ranks of
the new C.O.'s is the Catholic. The
second Vatican Council has provided
a new status for the C.O. within the
Church and has offered a justifica
tion for this position.
Is the new C.O. a part of the New
Left? Not necessarily. As Stuart Mc-
Lean, UCCM pastor remarked, "Re
straint and order are necessary in
our society. The New Left does not
adequately appreciate them. Most
C.O.'s I've been in contact with un
derstand the situation more realisti
cally."
Left or not, religious or not, right
or not, the C.O. presents a challenge
to our society's moral and political
systems that does not seem likely to
disappear for quite a while.

"At the present time about 4 percent

of these applicants (for discharge or
transfer to noncombatant status) are
approved; two years ago about 80
percent were approved. The change in

"There is no visible connection be

In protesting the "virtual absence
of due process in the military", the
memorandum points out that "a sol

board or individual enpowered to rec

New Religious C.O.
Whereas in World War II only 1
out of 1000 registrants applied and
received C.O. status, the estimate is
1 out of 400 for 1966. Lane Barton,
Episcopal chaplain on campus, com
mented that the C.O. dilemma is "the
most insistent and frequent problem
that arises in the pastoral ministry
on campus today."
From what groups do these new
C.O.'s come? While the C.O. of sev
eral years ago came from one of the
"peace churches" — Quakers, Menno
nites, Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses
— today's C.O. has had little, if any
orthodox religious background.
Because of this he has greater dif
ficulty in presenting his beliefs about
war in traditional religious terms
than did his predecessors. One cur
ious exception among the ranks of
the new C.O.'s is the Catholic. The
second Vatican Council has provided
a new status for the C.O. within the
Church and has offered a justifica
tion for this position.
Is the new C.O. a part of the New
Left? Not necessarily. As Stuart Mc-
Lean, UCCM pastor remarked, "Re
straint and order are necessary in
our society. The New Left does not
adequately appreciate them. Most
C.O.'s I've been in contact with un
derstand the situation more realisti
cally."
Left or not, religious or not, right
or not, the C.O. presents a challenge
to our society's moral and political
systems that does not seem likely to
disappear for quite a while.
The lengthy procedure which the
conscientious objector usually must
follow has discouraged many a po
tential C.0., yet the increasing num
bers receiving C.O. status demon
strate that it is surmountable. This
article will deal with the C.O. pro
cedure and the type of individual who
is willing to face it.
The first step for the civilian is
Form 150, the C.O. application. It is

clearly biased in favor of the C.O.
of long standing whose beliefs about
war are primarily religious.
Mrs. Donaldine Ellington of the
San Mateo local draft board indicates
that, although the board regards
most applicants as sincere, the longer
an individual waits to file as a C.0.,
the more the board is likely to ques
tion the "consistency and depth" of
his beliefs.
Usually the local draft board re
jects the application in order to inter-

view the applicant. It is up to the ap
plicant, however, to request the right
of appearance.
In some interviews members of lo
cal boards have asked such questions
as "Why are you a coward?" If a
board member appears belligerent,
the applicant may appeal an unfavor
able decision to court.
However, even if the court rules in
his favor, the C.O. remains under the
jurisdiction of the same local board.
Because such adverse court decisions

provoke the state draft board, the lo
cal board will usually be kinder in
their decision the second time around.
While only 5 percent of applicants
receive the desired status on the ba
sis of their applications, 20 to 25
percent obtain it following an ap
pearance.
Negative Result of Appeals
If the C.O. is denied the desired
status by the local board, he can ap
peal to the state board. The state
board usually turns him down. It
does so to obtain more information
about him when he appeals to the
President. This final stage of ap
peals involves an F. 8.1, investigation
and an appearance before a Justice
Department hearing officer.
The unevaluated results go to the
Justice Department, which then makes
a recommendation to the state board.
C.O. counselor Paul Seaver stated his
impression that recent recommenda
tions have usually been negative,
even in cases of favorable reports
from the F. 8.1, and the federal hear
ing officer.
Early Application Filing Necessary
Mrs. Norma Crockett of the Stan
ford Counseling and Testing Center
believes that the lengthy application
procedure discourages the person who
merely seeks escape from his military
obligation. As a counselor she is con
cerned with "making the individual
understand himself and the logical
consequences of his position" before
he applies.
Probably the most unfair aspect of
the system is the plight of the man
who does not decide until after in
duction that he is a C.O. Although one
may theoretically obtain a discharge
by filing a special form with the ap
propriate board for his service, the
board usually rejects him because, in
its opinion, he has not shown suffi
cient grounds for a change in status.
The result is frequently a court
martial, a dishonorable discharge, and
a sentence of 3 or 4 years in jail, al
though some sentences run as high as
20 years.

board member appears belligerent,
the applicant may appeal an unfavor
able decision to court.
However, even if the court rules in
his favor, the C.O. remains under the
jurisdiction of the same local board.
Because such adverse court decisions

provoke the state draft board, the lo
cal board will usually be kinder in
their decision the second time around.
While only 5 percent of applicants
receive the desired status on the ba
sis of their applications, 20 to 25
percent obtain it following an ap
pearance.
Negative Result of Appeals
If the C.O. is denied the desired
status by the local board, he can ap
peal to the state board. The state
board usually turns him down. It
does so to obtain more information
about him when he appeals to the
President. This final stage of ap
peals involves an F. 8.1, investigation
and an appearance before a Justice
Department hearing officer.
The unevaluated results go to the
Justice Department, which then makes
a recommendation to the state board.
C.O. counselor Paul Seaver stated his
impression that recent recommenda
tions have usually been negative,
even in cases of favorable reports
from the F. 8.1, and the federal hear
ing officer.
Early Application Filing Necessary
Mrs. Norma Crockett of the Stan
ford Counseling and Testing Center
believes that the lengthy application
procedure discourages the person who
merely seeks escape from his military
obligation. As a counselor she is con
cerned with "making the individual
understand himself and the logical
consequences of his position" before
he applies.
Probably the most unfair aspect of
the system is the plight of the man
who does not decide until after in
duction that he is a C.O. Although one
may theoretically obtain a discharge
by filing a special form with the ap
propriate board for his service, the
board usually rejects him because, in
its opinion, he has not shown suffi
cient grounds for a change in status.
The result is frequently a court
martial, a dishonorable discharge, and
a sentence of 3 or 4 years in jail, al
though some sentences run as high as
20 years.
Change of Policy
A memorandum from the Central
Committee for Conscientious Objec
tors (CCCO) in Philadelphia stated:
"At the present time about 4 percent

of these applicants (for discharge or
transfer to noncombatant status) are
approved; two years ago about 80
percent were approved. The change in
policy has occurred at National Selec
tive Service Headquarters which rec
ommends on all CO. applications
made under the armed forces regu
lations . . .
"There is no visible connection be
tween religious training and belief;
and the disposition of his application."
In protesting the "virtual absence
of due process in the military", the
memorandum points out that "a sol
dier - C.O. never appears before any
board or individual enpowered to rec
ognize his conscientious objection."
New Religious C.O.
Whereas in World War II only 1
out of 1000 registrants applied and
received C.O. status, the estimate is
1 out of 400 for 1966. Lane Barton,
Episcopal chaplain on campus, com
mented that the C.O. dilemma is "the
most insistent and frequent problem
that arises in the pastoral ministry
on campus today."
From what groups do these new
C.O.'s come? While the C.O. of sev
eral years ago came from one of the
"peace churches" — Quakers, Menno
nites, Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses
— today's C.O. has had little, if any
orthodox religious background.
Because of this he has greater dif
ficulty in presenting his beliefs about
war in traditional religious terms
than did his predecessors. One cur
ious exception among the ranks of
the new C.O.'s is the Catholic. The
second Vatican Council has provided
a new status for the C.O. within the
Church and has offered a justifica
tion for this position.
Is the new C.O. a part of the New
Left? Not necessarily. As Stuart Mc-
Lean, UCCM pastor remarked, "Re
straint and order are necessary in
our society. The New Left does not
adequately appreciate them. Most
C.O.'s I've been in contact with un
derstand the situation more realisti
cally."
Left or not, religious or not, right
or not, the C.O. presents a challenge
to our society's moral and political
systems that does not seem likely to
disappear for quite a while.
The lengthy procedure which the
conscientious objector usually must
follow has discouraged many a po
tential C.0., yet the increasing num
bers receiving C.O. status demon
strate that it is surmountable. This
article will deal with the C.O. pro
cedure and the type of individual who
is willing to face it.
The first step for the civilian is
Form 150, the C.O. application. It is

clearly biased in favor of the C.O.
of long standing whose beliefs about
war are primarily religious.
Mrs. Donaldine Ellington of the
San Mateo local draft board indicates
that, although the board regards
most applicants as sincere, the longer
an individual waits to file as a C.0.,
the more the board is likely to ques
tion the "consistency and depth" of
his beliefs.
Usually the local draft board re
jects the application in order to inter-

view the applicant. It is up to the ap
plicant, however, to request the right
of appearance.
In some interviews members of lo
cal boards have asked such questions
as "Why are you a coward?" If a
board member appears belligerent,
the applicant may appeal an unfavor
