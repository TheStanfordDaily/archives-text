# Legislature Finalizes Class Rank Proposal
## 
### 
Passing final wordings on two refer
endums to be presented on Election
Day constituted most of the action
at LASSU last night. An appropria
tion was also granted the Stanford
Opera Guild for three performances
this spring.
The bulk of discussion centered on
the wording to be adopted on the
referendum regarding the supplying
of class rank and grades to draft
boards by the University.
It was slated by both ASSU Presi
dent Mike Collins and Speaker Tom
Forstenzer that the adoption by the
University of a policy abolishing rank
in-class would free it from the neces
sity of reporting student progress on
a comparative scale.
Collins hoped also that student sup
port of such a referendum might
draw faculty support. Thus, he felt,
the Board of Trustees might look
favorably on such a policy-change.
The final wording was passed, alonfj
with a stipulation that males alone
would vote on this referendum.
LASSU also approved final word

ing of the Honor Code referendum.
The referendum, as it now stands,
questions both the necessity of retain
ing the Honor Code and the nature
of third-party responsibility in en
forcing such a code.
The other major issue before
LASSU was the appropriating of $200
to the Stanford Opera Guild to aid
the students in presentation of a Puc
cini opera this spring. Since represen
tatives of the Guild view it as a per
manent feature of Stanford cultural
life, the Legislature approved the ap
propriation unanmiously.
Other matters presented, but not
acted upon, included Forstenzer's pro
posal to Dean Joel Smith and the
Steering Committee concerning a new
legislative-judicial system designed to
overcome objections to co-educational
living experiments in Wilbur, Stern,
and perhaps Lagunita.
Action was postponed, as well, on
the issue of whether Stanford should
remain in the National Student As
sociation. Both matters are to be for
mally discussed when more infor
mation has been obtained.
