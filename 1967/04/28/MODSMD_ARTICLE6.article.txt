# Hydrofollies To Feature Kite-Flyer
## 
### 
Will the weatherman will wonder
lul weekend weather?
That question flitted fitfully across
he minds of many fans of Stanford's
spring spectacular — Hydrofollies.
The official start of Con Home
Week, the gala water show on Lake
Lagunita will kick off this Sunday,
April 30, at 2 p.m. Featured will be
a variety of water sports, including
competition between living groups in
anoe racing and water skiing.
In addition to the traditional resi
dential rivalries, there will be a num-

ber of "exhibition events," among
them a female water ballet and "mix
ed doubles" water skiing contests.
As an extra added attraction, South
American water skiing champion An
dres Botero will perform in a "human
kite-flying stunt". In this event, Andy
will skim the surface gripping a huge
kite flying above him. As the boat
tows him faster, he will be pulled
aloft, to fly around the lake looking
like a prehistoric flying monster with
a broken landing gear.
In addition, he will give an exhibi-

tion of slalom skiing, attempt to skim
the lake barefoot, and donate him
self to a spectacular 5-man pyramid
on skis.
Rumor has it that the venerable
Phi Kap ark — the Aquawazoo — will
make an appearance, contigent on the
acquisition of a set of bilge pumps
for propulsion.
Concession stands will provide food
and drinks, as well as balloons and
assorted trinkets. Monies acquired
will go to the Con Home fund.
Firms contributing equipment to

the hydrofollies include, Menlo Cy
clery, Glover Marine, Shreve's, Los
Altos Marina, Heinecke's Shell and
Shony's Boatland.
All next week a contest will be con
ducted at Engineering Corner for Con
Home King and Queen, winners to be
crowned at a Searsville Shifazz on
Friday.
Also next week on White Plaza con
cession booths run by residences will
offer carwashes, pickles, cotton candy,
and Whatnot. In addition, there will
be a "slave sale' of campus coeds who
will perform housework in men's
residences. For all those mystified by
the whole business, a Charlie Brown
Psychiatry Booth will offer council.
The women's residence earning the
most money by on-campus sales will
have three professors hash dinner on
May 14.
For the record, the profs will be
volunteers.

anoe racing and water skiing.
In addition to the traditional resi
dential rivalries, there will be a num-

ber of "exhibition events," among
them a female water ballet and "mix
ed doubles" water skiing contests.
As an extra added attraction, South
American water skiing champion An
dres Botero will perform in a "human
kite-flying stunt". In this event, Andy
will skim the surface gripping a huge
kite flying above him. As the boat
tows him faster, he will be pulled
aloft, to fly around the lake looking
like a prehistoric flying monster with
a broken landing gear.
In addition, he will give an exhibi-

tion of slalom skiing, attempt to skim
the lake barefoot, and donate him
self to a spectacular 5-man pyramid
on skis.
Rumor has it that the venerable
Phi Kap ark — the Aquawazoo — will
make an appearance, contigent on the
acquisition of a set of bilge pumps
for propulsion.
Concession stands will provide food
and drinks, as well as balloons and
assorted trinkets. Monies acquired
will go to the Con Home fund.
Firms contributing equipment to

the hydrofollies include, Menlo Cy
clery, Glover Marine, Shreve's, Los
Altos Marina, Heinecke's Shell and
Shony's Boatland.
All next week a contest will be con
ducted at Engineering Corner for Con
Home King and Queen, winners to be
crowned at a Searsville Shifazz on
Friday.
Also next week on White Plaza con
cession booths run by residences will
offer carwashes, pickles, cotton candy,
and Whatnot. In addition, there will
be a "slave sale' of campus coeds who
will perform housework in men's
residences. For all those mystified by
the whole business, a Charlie Brown
Psychiatry Booth will offer council.
The women's residence earning the
most money by on-campus sales will
have three professors hash dinner on
May 14.
For the record, the profs will be
volunteers.
