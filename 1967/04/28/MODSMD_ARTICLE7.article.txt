# 'Dear Liar' On Campus Sunday
## 
### 
ACT's production of Dear Liar will
be presented Sunday night at 8 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel. It stars Michael O'Sul
livan in the role of George Bernard
Shaw and Barbara Colby as Mrs. Pat
Campbell. The play was devised and
written by Jerome Kilty. This per
formance is being sponsored by the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories ac
tivities committee. Tickets are on
sale at Tresidder box office.
The critics have been unanimous in
their praise of ACT's production of
Dear Liar, entirely a 2-man show.
Kilty's versatility in such settings will
also be on display soon in San Jose
State College's Ides of March, a play
which Kilty has constructed out of
Thornton Wilder's famous novel
about Republican Rome.
