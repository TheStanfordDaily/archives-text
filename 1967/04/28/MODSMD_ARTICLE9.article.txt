# Defense Contracts
## Arbuckle Supports SRI Ties 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Stanford University and the Stan
ford Research Institute do maintain
"loose connections," yet the recent al
legations that individual administra
tors of SRI are actively engaged in
support of the war "do not follow,"
according to Ernest C. Arbuckle,
chairman of the SRI Board of Di
" ectors.
Arbuckle, who is also Dear of the
Graduate School of Business, spoke
in reply to the recent articles in Re
sistance, a publication of the Experi
ment, the "We Accuse" posters, and
the protest march on SRI.
"It's ridiculous to draw conclusions
'hat there is some kind of vast con
spiracy — this is a non sequitur," he

stated. Arbuckle said that it is "na
tural" that people who serve on the
SRI Board of Directors should also
be executives in other corporations.
"These are the kind of people who
do things" he said, describing a
"hard core" of business leaders across
the country.
Stanford Involvement
"The Resistance" allegations say
that because SRI has contracts with
the Defense Department and may be
involved in producing products for
war use, Stanford University is in
volved and should not be," Arbuckle
said, "but this is not necessarily the
case." He added that he was "not
sure" that the University should not
support the defense effort.

.Replying to the Resistance "war
monger" accusations, Arbuckle said
that "it's not necessary to think that
just because you're associated with
Stanford you have to condemn re
search efforts which have to do with
our national defense efforts." Ar
buckle said that he supports U.S. for
eign policy.
"The institution (SRI) is the place
where it is appropriate to have classi
fied contracts . . . the University is
not," he said, referring to last spring's
student protest against classified con
tract research work done by the Uni
versity. At present the University
still retains contracts with classified
access to research information.
Arbuckle added that SRI has con
tracts with the CIA, but their exist
ence is public knowledge. "There is
nothing clandestine about it,"he said.
Business Consultants
He said that professors from the
engineering and chemistry depart
ments and from the business school
work with SRI "as consultants." He
added that this is not a "forced rela
tionship," but the "loose connections"
are maintained because of the mutual
benefits derived by both institutions.
SRI will continue to do government
research, but not all of this will be
research for the Defense Department.
According to Arbuckle, SRI will also
make contracts with such government
agencies as tho Department of Health,
Education and Welfare and the newly
formed Department of Transporta
tion.
Arbuckle said four criteria are
Judged in obtaining research con
tracts:
• Is it in the public interest and
for the national security?
• Does SRI have the special com
petence necessary for the research?
• Will the project make a contri
bution to the development of SRI?
• Is the project financially viable?
He indicated that the "close rela
tionship" between Stanford Univer
sity and SRI would continue.

"It's ridiculous to draw conclusions
'hat there is some kind of vast con
spiracy — this is a non sequitur," he

stated. Arbuckle said that it is "na
tural" that people who serve on the
SRI Board of Directors should also
be executives in other corporations.
"These are the kind of people who
do things" he said, describing a
"hard core" of business leaders across
the country.
Stanford Involvement
"The Resistance" allegations say
that because SRI has contracts with
the Defense Department and may be
involved in producing products for
war use, Stanford University is in
volved and should not be," Arbuckle
said, "but this is not necessarily the
case." He added that he was "not
sure" that the University should not
support the defense effort.

.Replying to the Resistance "war
monger" accusations, Arbuckle said
that "it's not necessary to think that
just because you're associated with
Stanford you have to condemn re
search efforts which have to do with
our national defense efforts." Ar
buckle said that he supports U.S. for
eign policy.
"The institution (SRI) is the place
where it is appropriate to have classi
fied contracts . . . the University is
not," he said, referring to last spring's
student protest against classified con
tract research work done by the Uni
versity. At present the University
still retains contracts with classified
access to research information.
Arbuckle added that SRI has con
tracts with the CIA, but their exist
ence is public knowledge. "There is
nothing clandestine about it,"he said.
Business Consultants
He said that professors from the
engineering and chemistry depart
ments and from the business school
work with SRI "as consultants." He
added that this is not a "forced rela
tionship," but the "loose connections"
are maintained because of the mutual
benefits derived by both institutions.
SRI will continue to do government
research, but not all of this will be
research for the Defense Department.
According to Arbuckle, SRI will also
make contracts with such government
agencies as tho Department of Health,
Education and Welfare and the newly
formed Department of Transporta
tion.
Arbuckle said four criteria are
Judged in obtaining research con
tracts:
• Is it in the public interest and
for the national security?
• Does SRI have the special com
petence necessary for the research?
• Will the project make a contri
bution to the development of SRI?
• Is the project financially viable?
He indicated that the "close rela
tionship" between Stanford Univer
sity and SRI would continue.
Stanford University and the Stan
ford Research Institute do maintain
"loose connections," yet the recent al
legations that individual administra
tors of SRI are actively engaged in
support of the war "do not follow,"
according to Ernest C. Arbuckle,
chairman of the SRI Board of Di
" ectors.
Arbuckle, who is also Dear of the
Graduate School of Business, spoke
in reply to the recent articles in Re
sistance, a publication of the Experi
ment, the "We Accuse" posters, and
the protest march on SRI.
