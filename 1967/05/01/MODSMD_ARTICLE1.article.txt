## Hydrofollies On Lake Lag Feature Skiing, Boating 
### JIM KILGORE 
Water skiing stunts, boat races and
the return of the Aquawazoo churned
the waters of Lake Lagunita into a
frenzy yesterday.
Old and young alike swarmed about
the Lag boathouse to catch an after
noon of sunshine, humor and excite
ment at the spring Hydrofollies, Stan
ford's spectacular water festival.
The master performer of the show
was water skiing champ Andres Bo
tero who was assisted by a strong
man team of ace skiers and dollies of
daring and talent.

The water sports started with the
"Cross Under" act performed by Aub
Bartold and Rick Hansen. Both skiers
passed under the tow ropes of the
other, weaving and ducking as they
went.
On the more glamorous side water
queens Cindy Eliot, Susy Schultun,
Jean Stanislaw, Sue Feichmeir and
Lee Kimball presented a water ballet
act. Before the act was over, two
of the dollies, identity unknown, dis
appeared into the icy depths of Lake
Lag.
Mixed Doubles
The show continued though with
the "mixed doubles" event. Skiers
Ray Rooker and Andres Botero with
dollies Kay Griffen and Heidi Girton
in arms took off from the boathouse
dock.
The "Pyramid act" followed, with
Ray Rooker, Dave Noland and Randy
Bartlett supporting Heidi Girton and
Kay Griffen atop their shoulders as
they sped around the lake.
In the "Clown Act" three unidenti
fied characters, two of them extra
stacked and wearing grey wigs,
floundered across the water like a
trio of chimpanzees.
Later daredevil skiers Randy Fer
guson and Ray Rooker sped through
a flaming hook and lived to tell
about it.
The climax of the Hydrofollies was
Botero's "Flying Kite" act. Hands
gripped to the frame of a huge red
kite he was whisked, skis and all,
from the water. The sounds of "Bat
man" emanated from the boathouse
loudspeakers as Andres passed over
the shoreline waving his skis at the
crowd gathered below.
The Phi Kap Aquawazoo at this
time was slowly approaching the spec
tators. Propelled by water pumped
through two fire hoses, the barge
sprayed the innocent spectators and
the not-so-innocent war party waiting
in canoes for the counter-attack.
The Follies ended in general war

fare with only a few survivors to
enter the canoe races.
Each year the Follies set in motion
a week of fund raising activities in
support of the Stanford Convalescent
Home.
Starting Monday, White Plaza will
be transformed into a week-long fair
ground. A maze of booths and tables
will offer the passer-by the chance
to grab a sweet snack of cotton candy,
or perhaps a balloon.
All Stanford males will have a
chance to price their tastes at the
buy - your - date dance at Lathrop
House; and on Friday all are invited
to tip and enjoy life at the Sears
ville Shifazz.

Though this star of yesterday's Hydrofollies appears to be sitting: on the waves
of Lake Lag, he is really aquaplaning on a disc at the conclusion of his
"chair and disc act".
