# Professors' Meeting Reports Increase In Faculty Salaries
## 
### 
(CPS) — Faculty salaries
have risen at a rate exceeding
6.5 percent for the second year
in a row, Professor William J.
Baumol told the annual conven
tion of the American Associa
tion of University Professors
(AAUP) today.
The Princeton professor, chair
man of the AAUP's Committee
Z on the Economic Status of the
Profession, noted that while this
year's 6.8 percent increase in
compensation represented a
good overall performance, it was
below the preceding year's 7.3
percent growth figure.
The increased percentages rep
resent both salaries and fringe
benefits.
Baumol said the growth rate,
because of slower advances in
earlier years, was not sufficient
to achieve a 1957 proposal by
President Eisenhower's Commit
tee on Education Beyond the
High School —the doubling of
salaries over the 1959-69 decade.
And despite the national in

creases, Baumol said, there are
still cases of extremely low fac
ulty compensation. Two colleges
reporting to the AAUP survey,
both fully accredited, said the
faculty salaries offered aver
aged between $4,175 and $5,034
per year.
Despite their leadership in
standards of compensation, there
were growing indications that
the nation's private universities
are running into serious finan
cial troubles. "
AAUP figures showed that the

rate of increase in average com
pensation at private universities,
12 percent over a two-year-pe
riod, was lower than that of any
other comparable category.
Public universities were re
ported increasing salaries at a
biennial rate of 15 per cent, and
church-related liberal arts col
leges at 18 percent.
At these rates, Baumol said,
within two decades the private
universities would have the most
poorly paid faculties in the
country.
