Directing "Thurber Carnival"
is Bob Morgan, a candidate for
the Master of Arts Degree in the
Speech and Drama Department.
A revue composed of sketches,
fables, and adaptations of the
most popular of Thurber's blithe
commentaries, "Carnival" en
joyed both public and critical ac
claim in a recent Broadway run.

rire Bill Celdsch, Viki Davis,
Gretchen Grant, Richard Grant,
Johy Grayzell, Rich Opolack, and
Wendy Weiner.
Characterization In "Hell"
Otis Bigelow's trilogy of
"AM," "PM," and"The Morning
After" make up "A Cold Day in
Hell." "AM" presents character
situations staged entirely on a
bed. Janni Brenn and Roger
Thacker are cast in the sketch.
Kathy Marriott, playing a
"Scarsdale Matron" soliloquizes
at a Schraft's fountain in "PM."
"The Morning After" means
.something unique to each of the
four characters played by Jim
Young, Dell Martin, Michael
Denny, and Rich Berthold. They
imagine a jungle, a seashore, a
hostile place in their efforts to
find a new reality.
Playwright Bigelow is cur
rently stage manager of the hit
Broadway production of
"Sherry!"
"A Cold Day in Hell" was orig
inally produced and written for
the 1966 Dartmouth Summer
Festival. Director of the Ram's
Head production, William Gerry,
was an apprentice to the festival
company and played in "The
Morning After."
Staffed In Mem Church
Ram's Head Productions, in
conjunction with the Stanford
Memorial Church, will present
Christopher Fry's A Sleep of
Prisoners on May 19, 20, 26 and
27. A religious drama set in an
imaginary war and whose locale
is a church-made prison camp,
the production will be per
formed in the sanctuary of the
Memorial Church.
The cast includes Robert

Sevra, who is also directing the
production, Alan Mokler, Chuck
Alston and Rick Krueger. Sevra
and Mokler both had lead roles
in this year's Gaieties and in
Ram's Head's Winter Produc
tion of The Boy Friend.
"Basically," says Sevra, "the
play is as suitable for the legiti
mate stage as for an actual
church setting, for it is first of
all a drama. Fry is most con
cerned with his characters, and
through a series of dreams, in
which each man's character is
seen through the eyes of the
other men, he allows a thorough

and unique exploration of the
personalities of the four men."
According to Sevra, "the un
orthodox use of the church
which the staging demands and
the uninhibited actions of the
characters have caused some
controversy about the play. It is
not the type of production one
would normally expect to see
done in the sanctuary."
Tickets will be available free
of charge at Tresidder Box of
fice, the Memorial Church Ves
try, and at the door on the
nights of production. Curtain is
at 8:30.
