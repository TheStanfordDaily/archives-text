# Students To Face Censure Over Illinois Du Bois Club
## 
### 
(CPS) — The University of Il
linois Student Senate may be
subject to disciplinary action fol
lowing an April 19 meeting of
the W. E. B. Dußois Club in the
Senate's offices.
Dean of Students Stanton Hil
lett said extension of the space
to the Club represented a vio
lation of university rules, and
said he might refer the matter
to a faculty conduct committee
after receiving a full report on
the violation.
Preceding the meeting, Stu
dent Senate president Bob Outis
and three Senate vice-presidents
voted to risk disciplinary action
in allowing the Dußois Club to
use the Senate facilities.
Millett had threatened earlier
to lock the Senate out of its of
fices or deprive the government
group of funds if it went ahead
with the action. The university's
Board of Trustees voted last
month to deny recognition to the
Dußois Club. The action was
based on the citation of the na
tional Dußois Clubs as a Com
munist Party front by the Jus
tice Department.
The University of Illinois
chapter claims it has association
with the national organization.
Outis said about 200 people
attended the meeting, although
there were only ten Dußois
Club members present.
He said it appeared that any
disciplinary action taken "would
be against the Student Senate

as a whole, not against indivi
duals." But he expressed doubts
that any actions would be taken.
At a Board of Trustees meet
ing April 19, a conference on
the Clabaugh Act, the speaker
ban law which applies only to
the University of Illinois, was
announced.
Trustees said the conference
will include students, faculty,
administrators, and members of
the state legislature.
A Faculty Senate committee
has also been established to
study relations between student
groups and the university.
Outis said the conference on
the Clabaugh Act was a "delay
ing tactic." He said that by the
time the conference took a po
sition, the state legislature
would no longer be in session
and there would be no opportu
nity to change the law.
He commented that "it's not
just state laws like the Cla
baugh Act" that are the issue,
"but also the discretionary
power of the university admini
stration to turn down a group
because they 'are not in the
best interest of the university.' "
The Dußois meeting in Sen
ate facilities was a victory, Out
is said. "People were surprised
we went ahead in the face of
Millett's threats," he stated.
Outis said he thought "stu
dents have gained some faith
in student government" as a re
sult of the Senate's actions.

the Clabaugh Act was a "delay
ing tactic." He said that by the
time the conference took a po
sition, the state legislature
would no longer be in session
and there would be no opportu
nity to change the law.
He commented that "it's not
just state laws like the Cla
baugh Act" that are the issue,
"but also the discretionary
power of the university admini
stration to turn down a group
because they 'are not in the
best interest of the university.' "
The Dußois meeting in Sen
ate facilities was a victory, Out
is said. "People were surprised
we went ahead in the face of
Millett's threats," he stated.
Outis said he thought "stu
dents have gained some faith
in student government" as a re
sult of the Senate's actions.
(CPS) — The University of Il
linois Student Senate may be
subject to disciplinary action fol
lowing an April 19 meeting of
the W. E. B. Dußois Club in the
Senate's offices.
Dean of Students Stanton Hil
lett said extension of the space
to the Club represented a vio
lation of university rules, and
said he might refer the matter
to a faculty conduct committee
after receiving a full report on
the violation.
Preceding the meeting, Stu
dent Senate president Bob Outis
and three Senate vice-presidents
voted to risk disciplinary action
in allowing the Dußois Club to
use the Senate facilities.
Millett had threatened earlier
to lock the Senate out of its of
fices or deprive the government
group of funds if it went ahead
with the action. The university's
Board of Trustees voted last
month to deny recognition to the
Dußois Club. The action was
based on the citation of the na
tional Dußois Clubs as a Com
munist Party front by the Jus
tice Department.
The University of Illinois
chapter claims it has association
with the national organization.
Outis said about 200 people
attended the meeting, although
there were only ten Dußois
Club members present.
He said it appeared that any
disciplinary action taken "would
be against the Student Senate

as a whole, not against indivi
duals." But he expressed doubts
that any actions would be taken.
At a Board of Trustees meet
ing April 19, a conference on
the Clabaugh Act, the speaker
ban law which applies only to
the University of Illinois, was
announced.
Trustees said the conference
will include students, faculty,
administrators, and members of
the state legislature.
A Faculty Senate committee
has also been established to
study relations between student
groups and the university.
