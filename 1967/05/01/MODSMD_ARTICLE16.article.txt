# Tuition Credit Bill Gets Senate Approval
## 
### 
The United States Senate has
recently approved a proposed
plan to provide a federal income
tax credit of up to $325 for tui
tion, books, and other fees paid
by students in colleges, univer
sities, and other institutions
above the high school level. A
final enactment of this plan
will depend on the decisions
made by a combined Senate -
House of Representatives con
ference committee.
The tax credit plan was pro
posed Friday, April 14, by Sen
ator Abraham Ribicoff (D-
Conn.) as an amendment to a
bill passed by the House of Rep
resentatives which would re
store the investment tax credit
to the businessmen.
Under the amendment offered
by Senator Ribicoff and accepted
by the Senate, the tuition and
fee credit is 75 per cent of the
first $2000 paid, 25 per cent of
the next $300 and 10 per cent
of the next $1000. Thus the cie
dit is deducted from the income
tax owed to the government.
This credit would be avail
able to any person who pays
the tuition. It would insure sav
ings to working students and
wives as well as to parents and
other relatives. Parents with
more than one child in college
or graduate school could obtain
separate credit for each child.
"Over two-thirds of the bene
fits of this amendment would
go to families earning less than
$10,000 a year," Ribicoff said. A
formula reduces the amount of
credit available to high bracket
taxpayers.
It is thought by Capital ob
servers that an important part
in the final decision on the tui
tion tax credit plan will depend
on Congressman Wilbur D. Mills
(D-Ark.), Chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee.
Thus far he has taken no public

stand on the measure which long
has been opposed by the na
tional Administration.
