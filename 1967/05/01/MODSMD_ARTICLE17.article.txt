# Institute Gets HEW Grant
## 
### 
A $400,285 grant from the U.S.
Department of Health, Educa
tion, and Welfare will enable
Stanford's Food Research Insti
tute to expand into new quarters
and establish a larger library.
The grant, announced last
week, is part of a $20.8 million
federal project to finance the
construction and expansion of
graduate facilities in 24 U.S. uni
versities. Federal grants may
not exceed one-third of the cost
of each facility planned for aca
demic use, but total value of the
projects is estimated to be near
ly $100 million.
According to Dr. William O.
Jones, Director of the Institute,
the grant will be used to move
the graduate school into the
west wing of Encina Hall after
the administration offices now
there have moved to the old stu
dent union. Among plans for
the new center is the establish
ment of a central Food Research
Library.
The Food Research Institute
specializes in the analysis of
world economic problems of
food production and distribu
tion. The institute confers both
Masters and Ph.D. degrees. 12
to 15 economists are employed
by the school, which serves a
class of approximately 25 stu
dents. Particular emphasis has
recently been placed on th'*
study of African food prob 1
The objective of the govern
ment program is to increase the
supply of highly qualified per
sons needed in industry, govern
ment, teaching and research.
The program is administered by
the U.S. Office of Education,
Bureau of Higher Education.
