# An Outsider Looks In
## A 						Moving Sports Banquet 
### Nick Selby 
I was an outsider looking in
Friday night. I attended the ban
quet for the national champion
swimming team, our own swim
ming team from Stanford, at
Rickey's in Palo Alto.
I debated going to the ban
quet, despite the fact that the
invittation came from Chuck
Taylor, the Athletics Director,
because I felt uneasy about en
joying, or moving in on, the
glory I was not a part of and
did not have any hand in mak
ing.
In fact, I saw only part of one
swimming meet during the sea
sonâ€”it was one of the early
and unimportant ones. I did not
see either the U.C.L.A. or U.S.C.
meets, the AAWU meet, or the
nationals, all of which I had an
opportunity to see.
I really felt no identification
with the swimmers.
Reason For Going, Writing
I decided to go to the banquet
because I felt I couldn't refuse
the invitation and expected a
good dinner and some laughs.
I had both a good dinner and

some laughs. Bob 'Bad Mouth'
Murphy, one of Stanford's ath
letic public relations men, was a
master of ceremonies of sorts,
and he had me laughing freely
and naturally.
If that was all that impressed
me at the dinner, however, I
would not be writing this col
umn. What impressed me, what
finally overcame me, was the re
lationship between the swim
mers themselves, and the swim
mers and the coach.
Examples Of Respect
Take Jim Laney's letter to the
team as an example. Laney, the
captain of the team, was unable
to attend because he was in Ger
many on a literature fellowship.
Inspite of his jokes about the
German frauleins, the letter
struck a deep chord, that of his
respect for his teammates and
their accomplishment.
Next Jim Guughran, the
coach, made a special award to
Wells Shoemaker, the manager.
Gaughran said Shoemaker was
so well liked and respected he
could easily have been elected
captain if he had had swimming
ability.
Shoemaker became the first
manager in Stanford's history to
receive a letterman's blanket.
He did so because of real con
cern of the team and the coach
for him.
Siebert Chokes Up
Finally, the team elected a
captain. There was no big furor

over the sudden election. The
choice of Bob Momsen came na
turally for a very close team.
When Pete Siebert, a rather
strong looking man, an unshake
able type, spoke to give the
team's present to Gaughran, it
was too much. "I had every
thing I was going to say all
planned at the table," he said,
"but now I just can't say it. I'm
all choked up." His face and
eyes reddened holding back the
tears.
A Prediction, A Lesson
I predict that tho actual vic
tory at the NCAA's will fade in
significance with the years.
There will be new champions,
new splits, new times, new rec
ords. But the feeling of the vic
tory, the spirit of mutual ac
complishment, of respect for
each other and love for the
coach, will not fade.
There is a lesson here for all
of Stanford's athletes. While
striving for a goal, remember
that the goal must never pre
clude the spirit of striving, the
closeness that can come from
striving together, respecting
each other and the coach in vic
tory (the NCAA's), tie (the USC
meet) and defeat (the AAWU's).
It is most pertinent here for
the baseball team, which ap
pears, not to throw a jinx on it,
headed for a national title. The
title will mean nothing for the
individuals if the people who
win with them, the people
around them, don't mean any
thing to them.
