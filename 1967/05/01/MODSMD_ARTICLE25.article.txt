# Tribe Nine Seizes Pac-8 Lead
## Indian Heroes 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's big weekend in
baseball turned out to be 99
per cent successful. A jittery
first inning gave USC three runs
Friday and although the Tribe
i itplayed the Trojans for 13
innings after that, the best they
o »uld do was tie, 3-3.
The league leading Bruins
tangled with an aroused band
of Indians Saturday and watch
ed their vaunted attack evapo
rate as Stanford swept a double
\ ,'eader, 8-3 and 9-2, to take over
first place in the Pacific 8.
The two wins and tie put the

Tribe one giant step closer to
Omaha and the college world
series. No matter what USC and
UCLA do from here on in, if
Stanford wins their last seven
league games, the championship
is theirs. The games are against
Cal, Washington, and Washing
ton State.
Number One?
Although the national rank
ings probably won't change
(USC number one, and Stanford
number two), any one who was
there looks at is the other way
around — Stanford as number
one.

The winds were all the more
impressive because pitching ace
Sandy Vance had a sore arm and
only pitched one inning against
PCLA.
The first eight pitches of the
ball game gave USC runners on
first and second via walks.
Catcher Steve Sogge bloopcd a
single to left scoring a run, then
a fielder's choice let in another
run. A passed ball handed USC
their third and last run of the
game.
Pitcher Don Rose calmed
down and held USC in check
until he went out for a pinch
hitter in the fifth. Rod Poteete
took over and he completely
mastered USC allowing them
only a scratch single in the
seventh.
Deep Talent
Stanford showed how deep it
is in talent when Frank Klinger
went to the mount to replace
Poteete who left for a pinch
hitter in the ninth. Klinger put
down the Trojans until the game
ended after 14 innings.
An error and consecutive
singles by Mark Marquess, Mike
Schomaker, and Bob Boone
scored two runs for Stanford in
the sixth.
Still behind 2-3 going into the
bottom of the ninth, the Indians
scored the tying run on a two
out line drive single to center

by Frank Duffy which scored
Schomaker.
Stanford looked like they were
going to end it in the thirteenth
when Marquess, who got aboard
via an error, went to third on
Boone's one out single. But
Boone got trapped in a run
down and Marquess finished out
the inning standing on third.
Not Enough
UCLA took a 30 lead off of
Daro Quiring on a two singles,
walk, and a double in the third
inning of the first game Satur
day.
A triple by Marquess to cen
ter and a ground out by Scho
maker scored a Stanford run
in the fourth. Then in the sixth
the Indians scored four times
on two walks, an error, and a
three run homer over the 375
foot mark in left center by Ron
Shotts.
Now leading 5-3 the Tribe
added a couple of more runs on
a walk and doubles by Marquess
and Schomaker.
Poteete who pitched flawless
ball for the last two innings
singled in Stanford's eighth run.
Big First Inning
The Tribe decided not to waste
any time in the second game,
and they scored eight big runs
in the first inning.
Schomaker's single scored a
run, a wild pitch scored a run,

and Bill Holt's bases loaded
doiible scored three more before
the Bruins knew what had hit
them.
When they finally caught their
breath, Marquess hit the ball
sharply by the shortstop for
two more runs, and Schomaker

singled for the second time,
knocking in the eighth run.
Vance tried to pitch, but he
was replaced by Harvey Shank
in the first inning. With a nine
run cushion, Shank was never
in any trouble, and he went the
rest of the way.

swing similar to the one that sent a UCLA pitch over the 375
I x>t sign in deep left center. Shott's homer pushed the Tribe into
a 5-3 lead to overtake the Bruins in the first game Saturday after
noon. Besides creating the lead, the shot gave the Tribe a very
real physchological impetus for more scoring. The Tribe sluggers
took the first game 8-3, the second 9-2.

piteher (center, smiling) strides off the field at the conclusion of
the first game against UCLA Saturday. Poteete used his lithe
frame and fluid motion to absolutely baffle both the USC and
UCLA hitters, giving up no runs in 5% innings. To the left is first
baseman Mark Marquess, number 42 is assistant coach Bill Al
house, and shortstop Frank Duffy is on the right.
