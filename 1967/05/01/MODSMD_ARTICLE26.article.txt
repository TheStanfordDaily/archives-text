# Rhubarbs Color Cards-USC Tie
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
A first in Stanford sports oc
c irred Friday when the Indians
and the Trojans met for the
Battle of the Baseball Titans.
r i he first: Stanford scored a
moral givtory and didn't lose the
ball game.
After 14 innings of the ultra
exciting ball, USC salvaged a
va from apparent defeat. With
two outs in the bottom of the
Mth Mike Ammirato walked.
Bill Holt was at the plate and
with Ammirato at second on
a steal and dueces wild â€” two
outs, two balls, two strikes, Holt
lifted his hands and leaned back
1 .Dm a high inside fast ball.
The catcher fired the ball into
Mt field attempting to get Am
mirato who was stealing.
Ammirato scored amid the
jubliation of his teammates only
to find out upon crossing the
p. l ate that the pitch had been
veiled a strike and the game
was over.
The umpire said he called the

pitch a strike immediately but
no one heard him including the
catcher. Holt said, "The ball
was under my hands." Steve
Sogge, the catcher, said, "It was
on the inside corner, but I doubt
the batter could see it; it was
so dark."
The darknes was the cause
of a rhubarb that almost got sev
eral Stanford players ejected
from the game. After USC had
batted in the top of the 14th
the plate ump called the game.
The Stanford bench, incensed
that they did not get what
they considered their fair turn
to bat, charged poor Mr. Robert
son. After the initial yelling and
screaming subsided, Stanford
Coach Dutch Fehring pointed
out that, "It isn't any darker
now than when you let the in
ning start."
And surprise of surprises, the
ump changed his mind. USC
Coach Rod Dedeaux protested
for five minutes but to no avail.
