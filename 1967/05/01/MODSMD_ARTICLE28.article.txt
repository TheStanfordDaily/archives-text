# The 						Third Person
## 
### 
Every student entering Stanford signs a
pledge promising to uphold the Honor Code.
He agrees not to give or receive "unpermitted
aid" in his academic work and also guarantees
to exercise third-person responsibility by tak
ing action when he becomes aware of a vio
lation.
Third-person responsibility is not defined
precisely and has always been the subject of
confusion among students who question the
extent of their commitment. Partly because of
this confusion, students have not taken this
responsibility seriously in recent years.
Wednesday's ballot will include a referendum
on the Honor Code. The first question will ask
whether it should be retained at all and the
second will propose tliree alternative approach
es to third-person responsibility.
Without any question the Honor Code should
be kept. Despite its shortcomings, it promotes
values essential to an academic community in
allowing for a system based on honesty, rather
than on the assumption that students will cheat
if they are given the opportunity. It also contri
butes to a de-emphasis of the rewards and
punishments orientation.
The presence of this question on the ballot
should inspire students to reaffirm their com
mitment to the Honor Code and should make
them consider the extent of their responsibility.
The alternative of forcing students to report

all violations is unrealistic. The threat of equal
guilt for someone who fails to report an offend
er will not inspire respect for the responsibilities
inherent in the Honor Code. In a small com
munity, particularly a university, persons can
not be made to treat their peers with the de
tachment of a policeman.
Abolition of third-person responsibility would
endanger the entire honor system. It could
force the administration to establish a rigid
police system as at Harvard, where proctors
are paid to supervise examinations.
The alternative of not reporting a violator
unless direct pressures have been ineffective
best reconciles each student's responsibility
with its practical implementation. It urges stu
dents to rely on direct confrontation or social
pressure to prevent violations of the Honor
Code and allows for the solution of problems
by individual contact, rather than through im
personal judicial mechanisms. It places no un
reasonable burden on the third party, but still
provides for effective enforcement of the Honor
Code.
Wednesday's referendum has no legal value;
it will not change the Honor Code, nor will it
force anyone to abide by the alternative most
popular with the voters. But it will encourage
a reassessment of student attitudes toward the
Honor Code and, specifically, toward third
person responsibility.
