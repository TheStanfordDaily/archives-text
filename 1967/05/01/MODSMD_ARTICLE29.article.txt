## Black Says Questioned Students Remain Anonymous 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I should like to apologize to
the unnamed graduate student
who wrote you on Monday about
the numbered questionnaire he
received from us.
The questionnaire in question
should not have been numbered
and \ve have destroyed the rec
ord of code numbers. We would
also be quite happy to have
those receiving the question
naire obliterate its code number
before returning it.
When samples are selected to
represent accurately a total pop
ulation, it is sometimes neces
sary to number each question
naire so that those failing to
respond can be followed up;
otherwise am unknown bias may
be introduced into the research.
In this particular study such
precautions were not required.
We are merely seeking informa

tion about graduate programs
and the satisfactions and frus
trations of graduate students
which may be helpful to under
graduates trying to make deci
sions about future study.
I might add, however, that
even when we do identify ques
tionnaires or tests by name or
number, the responses of any in
dividual are never disclosed to
any one without his written con
sent.

Editor, The Daily :
In his column in Wednesday's
Daily, Barry Greenberg says, re
ferring to Young Republicans in
general, "Given the critics' own
ideological and political orienta

tion, such distortion is of course
to be expected, for it is in the
very nature of such orientation
—which is basically a conserva
tive and reactionary one—to dis
tort and simplify, to reduce
what is actually much more con
crete and complex than the ideo
logical categories to the categor
ies themselves."
I think it is quite clear that
in making this statement, Mr.
Greenberg is guilty of the same
intellectual crime of which he
accuses Young Republicans. I
really do not think Mr. Green
berg's statement is worthy of
his intelligence.
Mr. Greenberg describes the
Experiment as "... an attempt
to synthesize political, educa
tional, and cultural activities
into a community of concerned
and committed individuals; com
mitted, however, not to a par

ticular ideology or set of dog
matic political principles and as
sumptions, as our conservative
critics would have you believe,
but to an honest an open search
for possible alternative ways of
living, both with ourselves and
with others."
If I understand Mr. Green
berg correctly, both in the above
quoted column, and in his ar
ticle in the most recent issue
of Resistance (the article was
entitled "The Quest for Certain
ty"), the alternatives which the
Experiment is considering are
alternatives outside the exist
ing social order; i.e. the Experi
ment is only considering the pos
sibilities for radical so c i a 1
change, for a new order.
Thus, there is in fact an as
sumption of a political nature in
the Experiment's program, an
assumption which alienates the
vast majority of Stanford stu
dents who have already elected
to effect any necessary changes
within the existing order. The
Experiment does not consider
alternatives within the existing
order. The assumption that there
must be radical social change is
the propagation of one political
viewpoint.
For this reason, the Experi
ment does not deserve perma
nent University housing.

Editor, The Daily:
Of course I do not wish to be
come engaged in a debate with
a student regarding a most peri
pheral affair, but I feel that Mr.
Bernstein's letter requires some
response, for it indicates the
perversion of the educational
professor who hides behind and
utilizes a student. I have lectured
at more than 100 law school.",
universities and colleges in the
last three years. Only at Stan
ford — after Prof. Kaplan enter
ed the scene — was the appear
ance of Wesley Liebeler a con
dition for my being allowed to
lecture.
Mr. Bernstein states in his
letter that Prof. Kaplan told
him that Liebeler was the only
person in California fully fami
liar with the facts. Liebeler was
a junior, second-echelon lawyer
for the Warren Commission who
had been given the most unim
portant assignment of any of
the junior lawyers. Joseph Ball,
a senior Warren Commission
counsel assigned to an important

area, is and was in California
and just as close to Stanford as
was Liebeler.
Mr. Bernstein made one ac
curate statement. He said that
the invitation to appear was ex
tended to me by Jan Studebaker
of the University News Service.
Should The Daily interview Mrs.
Studebaker, the students and fa
culty at Stanford will no doubt
secure a picture of student and
faculty maneuvering that can
hardly be conducive to a
healthy academic climate.
I had thought that the last
word on this subject had been
said when Mr. Bernstein apolo
gized to me profusely after my
lecture at Stanford last year,
stating that he had been so dif
ficult because he "had been un
der under pressure." The pres
sure has evidently resumed.

Editor, The Daily:
Benjamin Franklin once
wrote: "Persons of good sense,
I have since observed, seldom
fall in disputation, except law
yers, university men, and men
of all sorts that have been bred
at Edinburgh."
Edinburgh is not represented,
as far as I know, in the Bern
stein - Kaplan - Lane - Liebler
melee about which Art Bern
stein wrote in The Dally on
April 25. However, with the ple
thora of the other two cate
gories amongst the four men
just named . . . and the evident
indications of disputation . . .
it seems times have not changed
Mr. Franklin's observation.
I will leave disputation to the
lawyers and the university men,
and speak of some observations
of my own:
1) The disputation "game"
fills me with ennui.
2) The matters with which
author-lawyer Mark Lane and
law professor and author John
Kaplan concern themselves I
find of serious and large im
portance.
3) The view we have of events
does depend on where we sit and
how we see.
Mr. Bernstein expressed his
view in Tuesday's Daiiy of the
events of last October when ar
rangements were being worked
out for the appearance of Mark
Lane at Stanford. Mr. Bernstein
sat in ie Law Forum office at
the Law School.
I sat in the News and Publi

cations office in Encina during
the October days of which he
speaks. I too, kept a few notes
. . . developed some feelings . . .
formed positive and negative
opinions.
The view I have of those days
is quite different from Mr. Bern
stein's. His, and my, ability to
see I leave with you.
This brings me to two ques
tions: Is either view, and the dif
ference between them, really
the point? Is the disputation
game a way to full disclosure of
what really is ... or an obstacle
in the path?
I would like, also, to add a
suggestion that I plan on tak
ing myself: That those interest
ed fare forth to both programs
— each with our positive and
negative feelings and opinions
— open to any reality that is
presented as we struggle to con
viction and virtue in this far
reaching matter.

Editor, The Daily:
As The Experiment seems des
tined to become one of the foot
balls of this spring's fun and
games on The Farm — euphe
mistically known as "campaign
ing for ASSU President" — I
would like to clarify one impor
tant matter.
This year The Experiment
has received $1000 from LASSU,
$500 in the fall and $500 in the
spring. Of the first $500, not a
single penny was spent on po
litical activity, for the simple
reason that, in the fall, The Ex
periment was not involved in
any. As for the second $500,
LASSU in granting the appropri
ation stipulated that ASSU Pres
ident Mike Collins, who controls
appropriations of this sort, is to
make sure that the money is
not spent on political activity
such as the "We Accuse" post
ers.
Thus, Mike and I have de
cided to use the $500 to cover
one half of my spring quarter
salary. Given this fact, I would
like to suggest to the ASSU
presidential candidates that if
they wish to debate the question
of student government's finan
cial assistance to The Experi
ment, the issue should not be
the financing of specific political
activities — which we will con

tinue to do out of our own mem
bership fees — but whether or
not student body funds ought to
be used to help support The Ex
periment's coordinator and as
sistant coordinator, who bea.
much of the responsibility for
the kinds of activities — educa
tional and cultural as well as
political — in which The Experi
ment has been involved.

• Bad Show
Editor, The Daily:
As individuals who enjoy
watching good movies, we are
greatly concerned by the de
plorable conditions involved iu
the presentation of films at
Tresidder. While the Union's f< •
cilities for other activities are
generally excellent, films are
shown under circumstances
which blur the picture and
garble the sound track.
The variety of activities spon
sored by Tresidder Union attest,
undeniably, to the Union's afflu
ence. Hence, we can only con
clude that the film program has
suffered as the result of mis
guided priorities.
We have called this matter \ j
the attention of Mr. Berry, the
director of the Union, and we
hope that others will Join us i
demanding of him an agree
ment to improve the conditions
that now exist.

I should like to apologize to
the unnamed graduate student
who wrote you on Monday about
the numbered questionnaire he
received from us.
The questionnaire in question
should not have been numbered
and \ve have destroyed the rec
ord of code numbers. We would
also be quite happy to have
those receiving the question
naire obliterate its code number
before returning it.
When samples are selected to
represent accurately a total pop
ulation, it is sometimes neces
sary to number each question
naire so that those failing to
respond can be followed up;
otherwise am unknown bias may
be introduced into the research.
In this particular study such
precautions were not required.
We are merely seeking informa

tion about graduate programs
and the satisfactions and frus
trations of graduate students
which may be helpful to under
graduates trying to make deci
sions about future study.
I might add, however, that
even when we do identify ques
tionnaires or tests by name or
number, the responses of any in
dividual are never disclosed to
any one without his written con
sent.

Editor, The Daily :
In his column in Wednesday's
Daily, Barry Greenberg says, re
ferring to Young Republicans in
general, "Given the critics' own
ideological and political orienta

tion, such distortion is of course
to be expected, for it is in the
very nature of such orientation
—which is basically a conserva
tive and reactionary one—to dis
tort and simplify, to reduce
what is actually much more con
crete and complex than the ideo
logical categories to the categor
ies themselves."
I think it is quite clear that
in making this statement, Mr.
Greenberg is guilty of the same
intellectual crime of which he
accuses Young Republicans. I
really do not think Mr. Green
berg's statement is worthy of
his intelligence.
Mr. Greenberg describes the
Experiment as "... an attempt
to synthesize political, educa
tional, and cultural activities
into a community of concerned
and committed individuals; com
mitted, however, not to a par

ticular ideology or set of dog
matic political principles and as
sumptions, as our conservative
critics would have you believe,
but to an honest an open search
for possible alternative ways of
living, both with ourselves and
with others."
If I understand Mr. Green
berg correctly, both in the above
quoted column, and in his ar
ticle in the most recent issue
of Resistance (the article was
entitled "The Quest for Certain
ty"), the alternatives which the
Experiment is considering are
alternatives outside the exist
ing social order; i.e. the Experi
ment is only considering the pos
sibilities for radical so c i a 1
change, for a new order.
Thus, there is in fact an as
sumption of a political nature in
the Experiment's program, an
assumption which alienates the
vast majority of Stanford stu
dents who have already elected
to effect any necessary changes
within the existing order. The
Experiment does not consider
alternatives within the existing
order. The assumption that there
must be radical social change is
the propagation of one political
viewpoint.
For this reason, the Experi
ment does not deserve perma
nent University housing.

Editor, The Daily:
Of course I do not wish to be
come engaged in a debate with
a student regarding a most peri
pheral affair, but I feel that Mr.
Bernstein's letter requires some
response, for it indicates the
perversion of the educational
professor who hides behind and
utilizes a student. I have lectured
at more than 100 law school.",
universities and colleges in the
last three years. Only at Stan
ford — after Prof. Kaplan enter
ed the scene — was the appear
ance of Wesley Liebeler a con
dition for my being allowed to
lecture.
Mr. Bernstein states in his
letter that Prof. Kaplan told
him that Liebeler was the only
person in California fully fami
liar with the facts. Liebeler was
a junior, second-echelon lawyer
for the Warren Commission who
had been given the most unim
portant assignment of any of
the junior lawyers. Joseph Ball,
a senior Warren Commission
counsel assigned to an important

area, is and was in California
and just as close to Stanford as
was Liebeler.
Mr. Bernstein made one ac
curate statement. He said that
the invitation to appear was ex
tended to me by Jan Studebaker
of the University News Service.
Should The Daily interview Mrs.
Studebaker, the students and fa
culty at Stanford will no doubt
secure a picture of student and
faculty maneuvering that can
hardly be conducive to a
healthy academic climate.
I had thought that the last
word on this subject had been
said when Mr. Bernstein apolo
gized to me profusely after my
lecture at Stanford last year,
stating that he had been so dif
ficult because he "had been un
der under pressure." The pres
sure has evidently resumed.

Editor, The Daily:
Benjamin Franklin once
wrote: "Persons of good sense,
I have since observed, seldom
fall in disputation, except law
yers, university men, and men
of all sorts that have been bred
at Edinburgh."
Edinburgh is not represented,
as far as I know, in the Bern
stein - Kaplan - Lane - Liebler
melee about which Art Bern
stein wrote in The Dally on
April 25. However, with the ple
thora of the other two cate
gories amongst the four men
just named . . . and the evident
indications of disputation . . .
it seems times have not changed
Mr. Franklin's observation.
I will leave disputation to the
lawyers and the university men,
and speak of some observations
of my own:
1) The disputation "game"
fills me with ennui.
2) The matters with which
author-lawyer Mark Lane and
law professor and author John
Kaplan concern themselves I
find of serious and large im
portance.
3) The view we have of events
does depend on where we sit and
how we see.
Mr. Bernstein expressed his
view in Tuesday's Daiiy of the
events of last October when ar
rangements were being worked
out for the appearance of Mark
Lane at Stanford. Mr. Bernstein
sat in ie Law Forum office at
the Law School.
I sat in the News and Publi

cations office in Encina during
the October days of which he
speaks. I too, kept a few notes
. . . developed some feelings . . .
formed positive and negative
opinions.
The view I have of those days
is quite different from Mr. Bern
stein's. His, and my, ability to
see I leave with you.
This brings me to two ques
tions: Is either view, and the dif
ference between them, really
the point? Is the disputation
game a way to full disclosure of
what really is ... or an obstacle
in the path?
I would like, also, to add a
suggestion that I plan on tak
ing myself: That those interest
ed fare forth to both programs
— each with our positive and
negative feelings and opinions
— open to any reality that is
presented as we struggle to con
viction and virtue in this far
reaching matter.

Editor, The Daily:
As The Experiment seems des
tined to become one of the foot
balls of this spring's fun and
games on The Farm — euphe
mistically known as "campaign
ing for ASSU President" — I
would like to clarify one impor
tant matter.
This year The Experiment
has received $1000 from LASSU,
$500 in the fall and $500 in the
spring. Of the first $500, not a
single penny was spent on po
litical activity, for the simple
reason that, in the fall, The Ex
periment was not involved in
any. As for the second $500,
LASSU in granting the appropri
ation stipulated that ASSU Pres
ident Mike Collins, who controls
appropriations of this sort, is to
make sure that the money is
not spent on political activity
such as the "We Accuse" post
ers.
Thus, Mike and I have de
cided to use the $500 to cover
one half of my spring quarter
salary. Given this fact, I would
like to suggest to the ASSU
presidential candidates that if
they wish to debate the question
of student government's finan
cial assistance to The Experi
ment, the issue should not be
the financing of specific political
activities — which we will con

tinue to do out of our own mem
bership fees — but whether or
not student body funds ought to
be used to help support The Ex
periment's coordinator and as
sistant coordinator, who bea.
much of the responsibility for
the kinds of activities — educa
tional and cultural as well as
political — in which The Experi
ment has been involved.

Editor, The Daily:
As individuals who enjoy
watching good movies, we are
greatly concerned by the de
plorable conditions involved iu
the presentation of films at
Tresidder. While the Union's f< •
cilities for other activities are
generally excellent, films are
shown under circumstances
which blur the picture and
garble the sound track.
The variety of activities spon
sored by Tresidder Union attest,
undeniably, to the Union's afflu

clude that the film program has
suffered as the result of mis

As individuals who enjoy
watching good movies, we are
greatly concerned by the de
plorable conditions involved iu
the presentation of films at
Tresidder. While the Union's f< •
cilities for other activities are
generally excellent, films are
shown under circumstances
which blur the picture and
garble the sound track.
The variety of activities spon
sored by Tresidder Union attest,
undeniably, to the Union's afflu
ence. Hence, we can only con
clude that the film program has
suffered as the result of mis
guided priorities.
We have called this matter \ j
the attention of Mr. Berry, the

ment to improve the conditions

I should like to apologize to
the unnamed graduate student
who wrote you on Monday about
the numbered questionnaire he
received from us.
The questionnaire in question
should not have been numbered
and \ve have destroyed the rec
ord of code numbers. We would
also be quite happy to have
those receiving the question
naire obliterate its code number
before returning it.
When samples are selected to
represent accurately a total pop
ulation, it is sometimes neces
sary to number each question
naire so that those failing to
respond can be followed up;
otherwise am unknown bias may
be introduced into the research.
In this particular study such
precautions were not required.
We are merely seeking informa

tion about graduate programs
and the satisfactions and frus
trations of graduate students
which may be helpful to under
graduates trying to make deci
sions about future study.
I might add, however, that
even when we do identify ques
tionnaires or tests by name or
number, the responses of any in
dividual are never disclosed to
any one without his written con

Editor, The Daily :
In his column in Wednesday's
Daily, Barry Greenberg says, re
ferring to Young Republicans in
general, "Given the critics' own
ideological and political orienta

tion, such distortion is of course
to be expected, for it is in the
very nature of such orientation
—which is basically a conserva
tive and reactionary one—to dis
tort and simplify, to reduce
what is actually much more con
crete and complex than the ideo
logical categories to the categor
ies themselves."
I think it is quite clear that
in making this statement, Mr.
Greenberg is guilty of the same
intellectual crime of which he
accuses Young Republicans. I
really do not think Mr. Green
berg's statement is worthy of
his intelligence.
Mr. Greenberg describes the
Experiment as "... an attempt
to synthesize political, educa
tional, and cultural activities
into a community of concerned
and committed individuals; com
mitted, however, not to a par

ticular ideology or set of dog
matic political principles and as
sumptions, as our conservative
critics would have you believe,
but to an honest an open search
for possible alternative ways of
living, both with ourselves and
with others."
If I understand Mr. Green
berg correctly, both in the above
quoted column, and in his ar
ticle in the most recent issue
of Resistance (the article was
entitled "The Quest for Certain
ty"), the alternatives which the
Experiment is considering are
alternatives outside the exist
ing social order; i.e. the Experi
ment is only considering the pos
sibilities for radical so c i a 1
change, for a new order.
Thus, there is in fact an as
sumption of a political nature in
the Experiment's program, an
assumption which alienates the
vast majority of Stanford stu
dents who have already elected
to effect any necessary changes
within the existing order. The
Experiment does not consider
alternatives within the existing
order. The assumption that there
must be radical social change is
the propagation of one political
viewpoint.
For this reason, the Experi
ment does not deserve perma
nent University housing.

Editor, The Daily:
Of course I do not wish to be
come engaged in a debate with
a student regarding a most peri
pheral affair, but I feel that Mr.
Bernstein's letter requires some
response, for it indicates the
perversion of the educational
professor who hides behind and
utilizes a student. I have lectured
at more than 100 law school.",
universities and colleges in the
last three years. Only at Stan
ford — after Prof. Kaplan enter
ed the scene — was the appear
ance of Wesley Liebeler a con
dition for my being allowed to
lecture.
Mr. Bernstein states in his
letter that Prof. Kaplan told
him that Liebeler was the only
person in California fully fami
liar with the facts. Liebeler was
a junior, second-echelon lawyer
for the Warren Commission who
had been given the most unim
portant assignment of any of
the junior lawyers. Joseph Ball,
a senior Warren Commission
counsel assigned to an important

area, is and was in California
and just as close to Stanford as
was Liebeler.
Mr. Bernstein made one ac
curate statement. He said that
the invitation to appear was ex
tended to me by Jan Studebaker
of the University News Service.
Should The Daily interview Mrs.
Studebaker, the students and fa
culty at Stanford will no doubt
secure a picture of student and
faculty maneuvering that can
hardly be conducive to a
healthy academic climate.
I had thought that the last
word on this subject had been
said when Mr. Bernstein apolo
gized to me profusely after my
lecture at Stanford last year,
stating that he had been so dif
ficult because he "had been un
der under pressure." The pres
sure has evidently resumed.

Editor, The Daily:
Benjamin Franklin once
wrote: "Persons of good sense,
I have since observed, seldom
fall in disputation, except law
yers, university men, and men
of all sorts that have been bred
at Edinburgh."
Edinburgh is not represented,
as far as I know, in the Bern
stein - Kaplan - Lane - Liebler
melee about which Art Bern
stein wrote in The Dally on
April 25. However, with the ple
thora of the other two cate
gories amongst the four men
just named . . . and the evident
indications of disputation . . .
it seems times have not changed
Mr. Franklin's observation.
I will leave disputation to the
lawyers and the university men,
and speak of some observations
of my own:
1) The disputation "game"
fills me with ennui.
2) The matters with which
author-lawyer Mark Lane and
law professor and author John
Kaplan concern themselves I
find of serious and large im
portance.
3) The view we have of events
does depend on where we sit and
how we see.
Mr. Bernstein expressed his
view in Tuesday's Daiiy of the
events of last October when ar
rangements were being worked
out for the appearance of Mark
Lane at Stanford. Mr. Bernstein
sat in ie Law Forum office at
the Law School.
I sat in the News and Publi

cations office in Encina during
the October days of which he
speaks. I too, kept a few notes
. . . developed some feelings . . .
formed positive and negative
opinions.
The view I have of those days
is quite different from Mr. Bern
stein's. His, and my, ability to
see I leave with you.
This brings me to two ques
tions: Is either view, and the dif
ference between them, really
the point? Is the disputation
game a way to full disclosure of
what really is ... or an obstacle
in the path?
I would like, also, to add a
suggestion that I plan on tak
ing myself: That those interest
ed fare forth to both programs
— each with our positive and
negative feelings and opinions
— open to any reality that is
presented as we struggle to con
viction and virtue in this far

Editor, The Daily:
As The Experiment seems des
tined to become one of the foot
balls of this spring's fun and
games on The Farm — euphe
mistically known as "campaign
ing for ASSU President" — I
would like to clarify one impor
tant matter.
This year The Experiment
has received $1000 from LASSU,
$500 in the fall and $500 in the
spring. Of the first $500, not a
single penny was spent on po
litical activity, for the simple
reason that, in the fall, The Ex
periment was not involved in
any. As for the second $500,
LASSU in granting the appropri
ation stipulated that ASSU Pres
ident Mike Collins, who controls
appropriations of this sort, is to
make sure that the money is
not spent on political activity
such as the "We Accuse" post
ers.
Thus, Mike and I have de
cided to use the $500 to cover
one half of my spring quarter
salary. Given this fact, I would
like to suggest to the ASSU
presidential candidates that if
they wish to debate the question
of student government's finan
cial assistance to The Experi
ment, the issue should not be
the financing of specific political
activities — which we will con

tinue to do out of our own mem
bership fees — but whether or
not student body funds ought to
be used to help support The Ex
periment's coordinator and as

ation stipulated that ASSU Pres

appropriations of this sort, is to
make sure that the money is
not spent on political activity
such as the "We Accuse" post

Thus, Mike and I have de
cided to use the $500 to cover
one half of my spring quarter
salary. Given this fact, I would
like to suggest to the ASSU
presidential candidates that if
they wish to debate the question
of student government's finan
cial assistance to The Experi
ment, the issue should not be
the financing of specific political
activities — which we will con

tinue to do out of our own mem

not student body funds ought to
be used to help support The Ex

sistant coordinator, who bea.
much of the responsibility for
the kinds of activities — educa

political — in which The Experi

As individuals who enjoy

greatly concerned by the de

the presentation of films at

The variety of activities spon

I should like to apologize to
the unnamed graduate student

the numbered questionnaire he
received from us.
The questionnaire in question
should not have been numbered
and \ve have destroyed the rec
ord of code numbers. We would
also be quite happy to have
those receiving the question
naire obliterate its code number
before returning it.
When samples are selected to
represent accurately a total pop
ulation, it is sometimes neces
sary to number each question
naire so that those failing to
respond can be followed up;
otherwise am unknown bias may
be introduced into the research.
In this particular study such
precautions were not required.
We are merely seeking informa

and the satisfactions and frus
trations of graduate students
which may be helpful to under
graduates trying to make deci
sions about future study.
I might add, however, that
even when we do identify ques

Editor, The Daily :
In his column in Wednesday's
Daily, Barry Greenberg says, re
ferring to Young Republicans in
general, "Given the critics' own
ideological and political orienta

tion, such distortion is of course
to be expected, for it is in the
very nature of such orientation
—which is basically a conserva
tive and reactionary one—to dis
tort and simplify, to reduce
what is actually much more con
crete and complex than the ideo
logical categories to the categor
ies themselves."
I think it is quite clear that
in making this statement, Mr.
Greenberg is guilty of the same
intellectual crime of which he
accuses Young Republicans. I
really do not think Mr. Green
berg's statement is worthy of
his intelligence.
Mr. Greenberg describes the
Experiment as "... an attempt
to synthesize political, educa
tional, and cultural activities
into a community of concerned
and committed individuals; com
mitted, however, not to a par

ticular ideology or set of dog
matic political principles and as
sumptions, as our conservative
critics would have you believe,
but to an honest an open search
for possible alternative ways of
living, both with ourselves and
with others."
If I understand Mr. Green
berg correctly, both in the above
quoted column, and in his ar
ticle in the most recent issue
of Resistance (the article was
entitled "The Quest for Certain
ty"), the alternatives which the
Experiment is considering are
alternatives outside the exist
ing social order; i.e. the Experi
ment is only considering the pos
sibilities for radical so c i a 1
change, for a new order.
Thus, there is in fact an as
sumption of a political nature in
the Experiment's program, an
assumption which alienates the
vast majority of Stanford stu
dents who have already elected
to effect any necessary changes
within the existing order. The
Experiment does not consider
alternatives within the existing
order. The assumption that there
must be radical social change is
the propagation of one political
viewpoint.
For this reason, the Experi
ment does not deserve perma
nent University housing.

Editor, The Daily:
Of course I do not wish to be
come engaged in a debate with
a student regarding a most peri
pheral affair, but I feel that Mr.
Bernstein's letter requires some
response, for it indicates the
perversion of the educational
professor who hides behind and
utilizes a student. I have lectured
at more than 100 law school.",
universities and colleges in the
last three years. Only at Stan
ford — after Prof. Kaplan enter
ed the scene — was the appear
ance of Wesley Liebeler a con
dition for my being allowed to
lecture.
Mr. Bernstein states in his
letter that Prof. Kaplan told
him that Liebeler was the only
person in California fully fami
liar with the facts. Liebeler was
a junior, second-echelon lawyer
for the Warren Commission who
had been given the most unim
portant assignment of any of
the junior lawyers. Joseph Ball,
a senior Warren Commission
counsel assigned to an important

area, is and was in California
and just as close to Stanford as
was Liebeler.
Mr. Bernstein made one ac
curate statement. He said that
the invitation to appear was ex
tended to me by Jan Studebaker
of the University News Service.
Should The Daily interview Mrs.
Studebaker, the students and fa
culty at Stanford will no doubt
secure a picture of student and
faculty maneuvering that can
hardly be conducive to a
healthy academic climate.
I had thought that the last
word on this subject had been
said when Mr. Bernstein apolo
gized to me profusely after my
lecture at Stanford last year,
stating that he had been so dif
ficult because he "had been un
der under pressure." The pres
sure has evidently resumed.

Benjamin Franklin once
wrote: "Persons of good sense,
I have since observed, seldom
fall in disputation, except law
yers, university men, and men
of all sorts that have been bred
at Edinburgh."
Edinburgh is not represented,
as far as I know, in the Bern
stein - Kaplan - Lane - Liebler
melee about which Art Bern
stein wrote in The Dally on
April 25. However, with the ple
thora of the other two cate
gories amongst the four men
just named . . . and the evident
indications of disputation . . .
it seems times have not changed
Mr. Franklin's observation.
I will leave disputation to the
lawyers and the university men,
and speak of some observations
of my own:
1) The disputation "game"
fills me with ennui.
2) The matters with which
author-lawyer Mark Lane and
law professor and author John
Kaplan concern themselves I
find of serious and large im
portance.
3) The view we have of events
does depend on where we sit and
how we see.
Mr. Bernstein expressed his
view in Tuesday's Daiiy of the
events of last October when ar
rangements were being worked
out for the appearance of Mark
Lane at Stanford. Mr. Bernstein
sat in ie Law Forum office at
the Law School.
I sat in the News and Publi

cations office in Encina during
the October days of which he
speaks. I too, kept a few notes
. . . developed some feelings . . .
formed positive and negative
opinions.
The view I have of those days
is quite different from Mr. Bern
stein's. His, and my, ability to
see I leave with you.
This brings me to two ques
tions: Is either view, and the dif
ference between them, really
the point? Is the disputation
game a way to full disclosure of
what really is ... or an obstacle
in the path?
I would like, also, to add a
suggestion that I plan on tak
ing myself: That those interest
ed fare forth to both programs
— each with our positive and
negative feelings and opinions
— open to any reality that is
presented as we struggle to con
viction and virtue in this far

This year The Experiment
has received $1000 from LASSU,
$500 in the fall and $500 in the
spring. Of the first $500, not a
single penny was spent on po
litical activity, for the simple

any. As for the second $500,

As The Experiment seems des
tined to become one of the foot
balls of this spring's fun and
games on The Farm — euphe
mistically known as "campaign
ing for ASSU President" — I
would like to clarify one impor
tant matter.
This year The Experiment
has received $1000 from LASSU,
$500 in the fall and $500 in the
spring. Of the first $500, not a
single penny was spent on po
litical activity, for the simple
reason that, in the fall, The Ex
periment was not involved in
any. As for the second $500,
LASSU in granting the appropri
ation stipulated that ASSU Pres
ident Mike Collins, who controls
appropriations of this sort, is to
make sure that the money is
not spent on political activity
such as the "We Accuse" post
ers.
Thus, Mike and I have de
cided to use the $500 to cover
one half of my spring quarter
salary. Given this fact, I would
like to suggest to the ASSU
presidential candidates that if
they wish to debate the question
of student government's finan
cial assistance to The Experi
ment, the issue should not be
the financing of specific political
activities — which we will con

tinue to do out of our own mem
bership fees — but whether or
not student body funds ought to
be used to help support The Ex
periment's coordinator and as
sistant coordinator, who bea.
much of the responsibility for
the kinds of activities — educa
tional and cultural as well as
political — in which The Experi
ment has been involved.

As individuals who enjoy
watching good movies, we are
greatly concerned by the de
plorable conditions involved iu
the presentation of films at
Tresidder. While the Union's f< •
cilities for other activities are
generally excellent, films are
shown under circumstances
which blur the picture and
garble the sound track.
The variety of activities spon
sored by Tresidder Union attest,
undeniably, to the Union's afflu
ence. Hence, we can only con
clude that the film program has
suffered as the result of mis
guided priorities.
We have called this matter \ j
the attention of Mr. Berry, the
director of the Union, and we
hope that others will Join us i
demanding of him an agree
ment to improve the conditions
that now exist.

I should like to apologize to
the unnamed graduate student
who wrote you on Monday about
the numbered questionnaire he
received from us.
The questionnaire in question
should not have been numbered
and \ve have destroyed the rec
ord of code numbers. We would
also be quite happy to have
those receiving the question
naire obliterate its code number
before returning it.
When samples are selected to
represent accurately a total pop
ulation, it is sometimes neces
sary to number each question
naire so that those failing to
respond can be followed up;
otherwise am unknown bias may
be introduced into the research.
In this particular study such
precautions were not required.
We are merely seeking informa

tion about graduate programs
and the satisfactions and frus
trations of graduate students
which may be helpful to under
graduates trying to make deci
sions about future study.
I might add, however, that
even when we do identify ques
tionnaires or tests by name or
number, the responses of any in
dividual are never disclosed to
any one without his written con
sent.

Editor, The Daily :
In his column in Wednesday's
Daily, Barry Greenberg says, re
ferring to Young Republicans in
general, "Given the critics' own
ideological and political orienta

tion, such distortion is of course
to be expected, for it is in the
very nature of such orientation
—which is basically a conserva
tive and reactionary one—to dis
tort and simplify, to reduce
what is actually much more con
crete and complex than the ideo
logical categories to the categor
ies themselves."
I think it is quite clear that
in making this statement, Mr.
Greenberg is guilty of the same
intellectual crime of which he
accuses Young Republicans. I
really do not think Mr. Green
berg's statement is worthy of
his intelligence.
Mr. Greenberg describes the
Experiment as "... an attempt
to synthesize political, educa
tional, and cultural activities
into a community of concerned
and committed individuals; com
mitted, however, not to a par

ticular ideology or set of dog
matic political principles and as
sumptions, as our conservative
critics would have you believe,
but to an honest an open search
for possible alternative ways of
living, both with ourselves and
with others."
If I understand Mr. Green
berg correctly, both in the above
quoted column, and in his ar
ticle in the most recent issue
of Resistance (the article was
entitled "The Quest for Certain
ty"), the alternatives which the
Experiment is considering are
alternatives outside the exist
ing social order; i.e. the Experi
ment is only considering the pos
sibilities for radical so c i a 1
change, for a new order.
Thus, there is in fact an as
sumption of a political nature in
the Experiment's program, an
assumption which alienates the
vast majority of Stanford stu
dents who have already elected
to effect any necessary changes
within the existing order. The
Experiment does not consider
alternatives within the existing
order. The assumption that there
must be radical social change is
the propagation of one political
viewpoint.
For this reason, the Experi
ment does not deserve perma
nent University housing.

• Maneuvering?
Editor, The Daily:
Of course I do not wish to be
come engaged in a debate with
a student regarding a most peri
pheral affair, but I feel that Mr.
Bernstein's letter requires some
response, for it indicates the
perversion of the educational
professor who hides behind and
utilizes a student. I have lectured
at more than 100 law school.",
universities and colleges in the
last three years. Only at Stan
ford — after Prof. Kaplan enter
ed the scene — was the appear
ance of Wesley Liebeler a con
dition for my being allowed to
lecture.
Mr. Bernstein states in his
letter that Prof. Kaplan told
him that Liebeler was the only
person in California fully fami
liar with the facts. Liebeler was
a junior, second-echelon lawyer
for the Warren Commission who
had been given the most unim
portant assignment of any of
the junior lawyers. Joseph Ball,
a senior Warren Commission
counsel assigned to an important

area, is and was in California
and just as close to Stanford as
was Liebeler.
Mr. Bernstein made one ac
curate statement. He said that
the invitation to appear was ex
tended to me by Jan Studebaker
of the University News Service.
Should The Daily interview Mrs.
Studebaker, the students and fa
culty at Stanford will no doubt
secure a picture of student and
faculty maneuvering that can
hardly be conducive to a
healthy academic climate.
I had thought that the last
word on this subject had been
said when Mr. Bernstein apolo
gized to me profusely after my
lecture at Stanford last year,
stating that he had been so dif
ficult because he "had been un
der under pressure." The pres
sure has evidently resumed.

Editor, The Daily:
Benjamin Franklin once
wrote: "Persons of good sense,
I have since observed, seldom
fall in disputation, except law
yers, university men, and men
of all sorts that have been bred
at Edinburgh."
Edinburgh is not represented,
as far as I know, in the Bern
stein - Kaplan - Lane - Liebler
melee about which Art Bern
stein wrote in The Dally on
April 25. However, with the ple
thora of the other two cate
gories amongst the four men
just named . . . and the evident
indications of disputation . . .
it seems times have not changed
Mr. Franklin's observation.
I will leave disputation to the
lawyers and the university men,
and speak of some observations
of my own:
1) The disputation "game"
fills me with ennui.
2) The matters with which
author-lawyer Mark Lane and
law professor and author John
Kaplan concern themselves I
find of serious and large im
portance.
3) The view we have of events
does depend on where we sit and
how we see.
Mr. Bernstein expressed his
view in Tuesday's Daiiy of the
events of last October when ar
rangements were being worked
out for the appearance of Mark
Lane at Stanford. Mr. Bernstein
sat in ie Law Forum office at
the Law School.
I sat in the News and Publi

cations office in Encina during
the October days of which he
speaks. I too, kept a few notes
. . . developed some feelings . . .
formed positive and negative
opinions.
The view I have of those days
is quite different from Mr. Bern
stein's. His, and my, ability to
see I leave with you.
This brings me to two ques
tions: Is either view, and the dif
ference between them, really
the point? Is the disputation
game a way to full disclosure of
what really is ... or an obstacle
in the path?
I would like, also, to add a
suggestion that I plan on tak
ing myself: That those interest
ed fare forth to both programs
— each with our positive and
negative feelings and opinions
— open to any reality that is
presented as we struggle to con
viction and virtue in this far
reaching matter.
