# Stanford Joins In Model UN
## 
### ROGER LaBRUCHERIE 
Fourteen Stanford students last
week represented the United States
at the 17th Annual Model United Na
tions of the Far West, hosted by
Lewis and Clark College in Portland,
Oregon.
In an interview with The Daily,
Jere Horwitz, leader of the Stanford
lelegation, explained that the United
States is traditionally represented by
the school which hosted the previous
year's session.
Horwitz explained that the Model
UN deals with various issues which
are or might soon be before the
United Nations. Each nation is repre
sented by a school which attempts
to pursue the policy which that na
tion has historically followed on var
,ous issues. Various schools differ,
however, over the extent to which
a delegation should be restricted by
the letter of a country's policy. Stan
ford has typically felt that the dele
gates should have a considerable de
gree of creativity.
The delegates met in committee
and, later, in the General Assembly
and in the Security Council.
The United States caused the great

est stir in the Security Council, re
vealing an agreement which had been
reached between South Vietnam (Uni
versity of Utah), the National Libera
tion Front, and North Vietnam (UC
Berkeley). The agreement was pro
posed and passed as a resolution call
ing for a bombing halt, ceasefire, and
the convening of a conference along
the lines of the Geneva Conference
of 1954.
The Stanford delegation received
behind-the-scenes criticism for this
move on the grounds that it deviated
from U.S. policy, but the delegation
felt that because the ceasefire and
halt were contingent upon the agree
ment to a conference, the action was
compatible with the U.S. position on
Vietnam.
General Assembly Discussion
The General Assembly dealt with
several matters, among them:
• The question of seating Commu
nist China, which took the form of a
resolution calling for a study com
mission: the resolution failed to re
ceive the two-thirds vote required, in
spite of the backing of the United
States delegation;
• A resolution calling for the cessa

tion of all relations with South Africa
and a condemnation of her apartheid
policy, approved, with the United
States abstaining;
• Nuclear non-proliferation and dis
armament, both of which failed to
receive significant action.
The high point of the session came
with the announcement of a mock
emergency situation centering around
a Sino-Soviet border clash and an at
tack by North Korea across the 38th
parallel. These issues were dealt
with in an emergency session of the
Security Council, which ruled out
immediate military action by the
United Nations.
Halt in Military Spending
A resolution by the Economic and
Social Council called for a halt to the
expansion of military expenditures
by the various nations, and for reduc
tions in expenditures beginning in
1969.
Horwitz, Ambassador of the United
States delegation, went on to say that
he felt the value of the Model United
Nations arose not only from lparning
about the policies of the various mem
ber nations, but also from a realiza
tion of the frustrations which na

tions face in an organization such as
the UN.
In addition to Horwitz, the delegates
were: Marianne Bours, Hugh Breck
enridge, Jim Ching, Dennis Felds,
Rob Fuller, Hal King, Gail Kitaji, Bill
Maas, Russ Richeda, Bill Royer, Jerry
Siegal, and Sharon Yates. The delega
tion was advised by Stu Novick, the
Secretary-General of last year's ses
sion.
Delegates Chosen By Interview
The delegates in the past have been
selected from the Stanford United
Nations (SUN). The failure of LASSU
to approve funds for SUN made it
necessary to select delegates by inter
view, because SUN was not active
this year.
Horwitz explained that the lIR
hoped to revive the Stanford group
next year ,and that next year's dele
gation would be selected from that
organization.
The Model United Nations of the
Far West was formed in 1951 by the
members of the Stanford Internation
al Board. Stanford has hosted three
sessions. Speakers at the various ses
sions have included Ralph Bunche,
the late Eleanor Roosevelt, Chot Hunt
ley, and Senator Wayne Morse.
