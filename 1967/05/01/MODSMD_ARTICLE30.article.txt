# This Stanford
## Has LASSU Betrayed Us To The 'Political Weirdos'? 
### Clay L. Miller 
When, with the smug thought
that I was striking a blow for
creative education at Stanford,
I signed the petition for a per
manent roof over the Experi
ment's collective head, it was
absolutely my first even re
motely liberal or open-minded
gesture since shortly before the
Christmas of nineteen hundred
sixty-two, and, accordingly, I
had a pretty good hunch I'd end
up regretting it. Sure enough,
now that The Experiment has
the old bookstore building at its
disposal more or less "in per
petuity" as they say, I've begun
to notice the queasy pangs of
doubt that come as the early
symptoms of realizing that one
has been successfully lured
from high principle and best
judgment and one's pure pur
pose defiled by salacious purvey
ors of unconscionable menda
city. In a word, the suspicion is
getting around among his
friends that Miller was played
for a kluck and Miller tends to
agree.

What happened was that dur
ing their participation in the
Spring Mobilization for Peace,
most of the members of The Ex
periment revealed themselves as
pick-pockets intellectually and
second story burglars academic
ally. Particularly in the "We
Accuse" affair, they conducted
themselves with all the educated
political dexterity, articulation
and aplomb of an up-country
Alabama lynch mob, and became
accordingly credible champions
of education and critical dissent
at Stanford.
It doesn't really drive me all
that berserk that the University
yielded to pressure from a gag
gle of addlepated â€¢ suckers,
among them myself, and gave
The Experiment a sturdy, multi
room shack-up wherein to plan,
undisturbed and in utter com
fort and security, whatever new
succession of political infamies
and dull- minded humiliation
against us all they may have in
mind for an encore. I signed that
petition, after all.

What does appall and enrage
me to the point of behavior in
volving long nights spent mur
derously plucking at chickens
beside great pots of bubbling tar
is that, in the face of The Experi
ment's new and expressly politi
cal nature, what amounts to lit
tle more than a political dung
heap of Berkeley barn sweep
ings continues to have its activi
ties richly subsidized out of the
student body general fund. This
particular outrage, without ques
tion the most Cavalier betrayal
of the students by the elected
representatives in the long and
entirely maculate record of the
Stanford student legislature,
translates into a situation where
by some pestilential freak-pack
of witless political weirdos has
been granted, by my student
government, explicit license and
franchise to shake me down
every registration day for a
tithe to underwrite purely politi
cal agitation and propaganda
most of which I regard as frank
ly treasonous, and I'm damned
if I'll stand for it.
