## ASSU Elections: Daring Idealist Needed 
### Bob Fishman 
What, if anything, is at stake
in the election for ASSU Presi
dent?
The candidates promise to
save us from the New Left, the
Packer Committee, the Admin
istration, the Board of Trustees
and various other evils.
These sentiments, though
often admirable, remind me of
the proverbial dogcatcher who
ran on a platform of World
Peace Through World Law.
Despite the scope of the can
didates' proposals, the office
they aspire to has never been
further from the real center of
decision-making.
The Study
Next year, all important de
cisions concerning the future of
the University will be made by
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES), especially its power
ful steering committee, the so
called Packer Committee. The
ASSU President has no official
connection with this body. He
can appear, hat in hand, before
the Steering Committee to make
suggestions, but so can any
other student. I suppose, how
ever, that he will have an easier
time making an appointment.
In this situation, the tradi
tional tactics of both "activist"
and "cooperating" student body
presidents are irrelevant to the
principal task: influencing SES.
Cooperation implies some sort
of equality of power, a condition
that clearly does not exist. What
have the cooperators to offer
but a Pepsodent smile and the
proposals that everyone has
heard—and ignored— before?
SES welcomes student advice, in
part because such advice is so
easy to ignore. One hundred
Pepsodent smiles will not help
the cooperator's proposals when
they encounter opposition.
Traditional forms of activism,
however, are just as futile. Pass
ing a resolution in LASSU is not
the best way to persuade SES
to change General Studies. And
placing more students on fac
ulty committees has become
meaningless since these august
bodies started passing the buck
to SES.
Ceremonials
If the post of ASSU President
is to be anything more than
ceremonial, the man we elect
must go beyond the traditional
conceptions of his office. To in
fluence SES he must become a
researcher, an organizer and a
lobbyist.
The administration and the
faculty have committees and re
search assistants to prepare

their proposals. The ASSU
President will ne->d similar as
sistance for in-depth presenta
tions of his ideas.
And, more importantly, he
will have to win the attention
and support of the student body
for his individual proposals
when they come up for decision.
His real campaigning must be
gin on the day of his election.
So, when the ASSU President
comes before the Steering Com
mittee, he will be presenting
fully-researched proposals which
have the united support of the
student body behind them. One

may be sure that such pro
posals will carry weight, despite
strong opposition. Even radical
proposals would be hard to ig
nore.
Student Innovators
I believe it is crucial that de
mands receive the most power
ful presentation possible. Of the
various groups on campus, the
students have most closely iden
tified themselves with the excit
ing and significant innovations
in higher education. The faculty
has one eye on its research and
the Dean's Office has to worry
about the alumni; both these

groups, therefore, are cautious.
What Stanford needs most,
however, is not cautious tinker
ing but daring innovation. Per
haps, if we are daring enough,
we might catch up with the
present. Only the students, with
their embarrassingly idealistic
demands, wholeheartedly sup
port this sort of innovation.
Their uncompromising energy
can make Stanford great.
Will we elect a man who can
make student idealism a force
to be reckoned with in SES?
That, I believe, is the issue at
stake in the ASSU election.
