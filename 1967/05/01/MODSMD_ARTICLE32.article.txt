# Candidates Deplore Rumors
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
When a man falsely accuses
another, he degrades himself.
Rumors about at least one of
the candidates have run ram
pant for a week. Accusations
about the origin and propaga
tion of these rumors have as
sumed the form of further ru
mors. To claim in a student
campaign that the intentional or
irresponsible fabrication and
transmission of rumor is some
thing less than false accusation,
is itself irresponsible.
The fact of the matter is that
we must not and will not toler
ate viciousness and gross negli
gence among students; to ac
cept these things is to deny the
ends and means of education.
We must and do repudiate all
rumors related to the entire
campaign; we reject the sup
port of anyone who spreads such
rumors; we deeply regret our
own and our campaigners' pos
sible involvement; and we de
mand that the campaign be
purged of personal assaults. Let
us return to a contest of can
didates and issues — in short, a
real campaign.
If anyone believes there is
substance to any of the current
rumors, let him step forward
with a signed accusation. We
will test its validity in a court of
law.

Editor, The Daily:
Like the other candidates, we
feel that rumors and unfounded
accusations should not be a part
of the ASSU campaign, but we
propose that the best way to
stop rumors is for each candi
date to make known his political
and educational affiliations, past
and present. If candidates do
not state their backgrounds
clearly, others will do it for
them based on incomplete infor
mation. The best way to stop

rumors is not to condemn rumor
mongers but to precede them
with statements of fact. Rumors
about the candidates'
lives are clearly irrelevant, but
we feel that the Stanford com
munity is entitled to know about
the political involvement of the
candidates. We suggest that all
the candidates clarify their own
positions as we have tried to do
in our platform.

not reach Fritz Schaefer or
Gene Cubbison to ask them to
sign the letter.)

Editor, The Daily:
Like the other candidates, we
feel that rumors and unfounded
accusations should not be a part
of the ASSU campaign, but we
propose that the best way to
stop rumors is for each candi
date to make known his political
and educational affiliations, past
and present. If candidates do
not state their backgrounds
clearly, others will do it for
them based on incomplete infor
mation. The best way to stop

rumors is not to condemn rumor
mongers but to precede them
with statements of fact. Rumors
about the candidates'
lives are clearly irrelevant, but
we feel that the Stanford com
munity is entitled to know about
the political involvement of the
candidates. We suggest that all
the candidates clarify their own
positions as we have tried to do
in our platform.
