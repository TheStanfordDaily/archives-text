# Lane Accuses Daily Of Bias For Kaplan
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Mark Lane has charged The Daily
with misrepresenting his position on
tomorrow's confrontation with Law
Professor John Kaplan.
Lane and Kaplan are scheduled to
cross-examine each other at 2:15 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Lane's
book, Rush to Judgment, which was
critical of the Warren Commission
Report. Kaplan attacked critics of
the report in his article "The Assis
sins," published in The American
Scholar magazine.
Lane said he never had any inten
tion of not meeting Kaplan on Kap
lan's terms, contrary to a front-page
article in The Daily Friday. He also
criticized The Daily for not publish
ing the fact that he had agreed to the
mock-trial format, until after The
Daily had printed a letter which, Lane
said, gave the impression that he was
unwilling to debate.
Lane further charged that The
Daily, by asking the Law Forum to
find a judge for the mock trial, had
relinquished its responsibilities under
Kaplan's conditions and jeopardized
the fairness of the "trial". He called
the students in the Law Forum "asso
ciates" of Kaplan. Both Kaplan and
the Law Forum vigorously deny that
Kaplan had any hand in choosing a
judge.
Feinberg to Preside
The first judge the students asked
to take part in the "trial" said he pre
ferred not to, since he knew Kaplan.
He gave the names of three other
possibilities in the Stanford area. One
of these, Sidney Feinberg of the Palo
Alto Municipal Court, has agreed to
preside over the proceedings.
Feinberg said he knows neither
Lane nor Kaplan personally, though
he has heard Kaplan speak before the
Santa Clara County Bar Association
and happened to have read Kaplan's
article. Kaplan said he does not even
know what Feinberg looks like.
In addition, Lane complained that
The Daily had not immediately
printed his reply to the letter printed
last week criticizing him. (The reply
appears today on page 6.)
Lane further stated that The Daily
article in which his challenge to Kap
lan originally appeared contained only
a small part of his statement. Lane
was replying to criticisms in Kaplan's
article. Reporter Steve Gruber said

later that his article (on Kaplan's
piece) was limited as to space and
that Lane's statement was too long
to be included in full.
Misrepresentation
Last Friday's article, according to
Lane, misrepresented his position by
implying that he would not accept all
of Kaplan's conditions. He also said
that before last Wednesday, he did
not know that Kaplan wanted to name
the grounds for his mock suit.
Former Daily Managing Editor
Chris Harte denied this, saying that
he read all of Kaplan's rules to Lane
over the telephone twice the previous
week. He added that he and Lane
discussed the rules point by point and
that Lane reluctantly agreed to accept
them. Lane was unavailable last week
when The Daily attempted to settle
this contradiction. He denied yester
day that Harte had read him Kaplan's
specific rules.

Although Lane has definitely
agreed to "sue" Kaplan for calling
his book "a tissue of deliberate dis
tortion," as the hypothesis goes, he
argues that tomorrow's confrontation
is not really a debate. Strictly speak
ing, in a debate each side would pre
sent an argument, followed by rebut
tals and counter-rebuttals as long as
the moderator allows.
Limited Discussion
He said Kaplan's rules will limit the
discussion to a narrow area— namely,
Rush to Judgment itself—a fact which
Kaplan freely admits. And he said,
depending on the judge's interpreta
tion, the rules might exclude question
ing on Kaplan's article. Kaplan In
sists that Lane agreed to follow any
rules he (Kaplan) put forth.
The Daily agreed at the beginning
of the current controversy to act as a
neutral third party to bring Lane and
Kaplan together.

the students in the Law Forum "asso
ciates" of Kaplan. Both Kaplan and
the Law Forum vigorously deny that
Kaplan had any hand in choosing a
judge.
Feinberg to Preside
The first judge the students asked
to take part in the "trial" said he pre
ferred not to, since he knew Kaplan.
He gave the names of three other
possibilities in the Stanford area. One
of these, Sidney Feinberg of the Palo
Alto Municipal Court, has agreed to
preside over the proceedings.
Feinberg said he knows neither
Lane nor Kaplan personally, though
he has heard Kaplan speak before the
Santa Clara County Bar Association
and happened to have read Kaplan's
article. Kaplan said he does not even
know what Feinberg looks like.
In addition, Lane complained that
The Daily had not immediately
printed his reply to the letter printed
last week criticizing him. (The reply
appears today on page 6.)
Lane further stated that The Daily
article in which his challenge to Kap
lan originally appeared contained only
a small part of his statement. Lane
was replying to criticisms in Kaplan's
article. Reporter Steve Gruber said

later that his article (on Kaplan's
piece) was limited as to space and
that Lane's statement was too long
to be included in full.
Misrepresentation
Last Friday's article, according to
Lane, misrepresented his position by
implying that he would not accept all
of Kaplan's conditions. He also said
that before last Wednesday, he did
not know that Kaplan wanted to name
the grounds for his mock suit.
Former Daily Managing Editor
Chris Harte denied this, saying that
he read all of Kaplan's rules to Lane
over the telephone twice the previous
week. He added that he and Lane
discussed the rules point by point and
that Lane reluctantly agreed to accept
them. Lane was unavailable last week
when The Daily attempted to settle
this contradiction. He denied yester
day that Harte had read him Kaplan's
specific rules.

Although Lane has definitely
agreed to "sue" Kaplan for calling
his book "a tissue of deliberate dis
tortion," as the hypothesis goes, he
argues that tomorrow's confrontation
is not really a debate. Strictly speak
ing, in a debate each side would pre
sent an argument, followed by rebut
tals and counter-rebuttals as long as
the moderator allows.
Limited Discussion
He said Kaplan's rules will limit the
discussion to a narrow area— namely,
Rush to Judgment itself—a fact which
Kaplan freely admits. And he said,
depending on the judge's interpreta
tion, the rules might exclude question
ing on Kaplan's article. Kaplan In
sists that Lane agreed to follow any
rules he (Kaplan) put forth.
The Daily agreed at the beginning
of the current controversy to act as a
neutral third party to bring Lane and
Kaplan together.
Mark Lane has charged The Daily
with misrepresenting his position on
tomorrow's confrontation with Law
Professor John Kaplan.
Lane and Kaplan are scheduled to
cross-examine each other at 2:15 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Lane's
book, Rush to Judgment, which was
critical of the Warren Commission
Report. Kaplan attacked critics of
the report in his article "The Assis
sins," published in The American
Scholar magazine.
Lane said he never had any inten
tion of not meeting Kaplan on Kap
lan's terms, contrary to a front-page
article in The Daily Friday. He also
criticized The Daily for not publish
ing the fact that he had agreed to the
mock-trial format, until after The
Daily had printed a letter which, Lane
said, gave the impression that he was
unwilling to debate.
Lane further charged that The
Daily, by asking the Law Forum to
find a judge for the mock trial, had
relinquished its responsibilities under
Kaplan's conditions and jeopardized
the fairness of the "trial". He called
the students in the Law Forum "asso
ciates" of Kaplan. Both Kaplan and
the Law Forum vigorously deny that
Kaplan had any hand in choosing a
judge.
