# Girls Living Off Asked To Return
## 
### 
A number of women living off cam
pus have been asked to return to their
University residences.
According to one student who is
officially a resident of Hoskins but
lives off campus, Hoskins Director
Margaret Burk has, at the request of
the Dean of Students' office, individ
ually approached women known to
be living off campus and asked them
to return. No disciplinary action has
been threatened and no deadline has
been set.
Neither Miss Burk nor Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith would comment.

Sally Mahoney said she knew of no
move to get women back on campus,
although she pointed out that the
Dean's office has been aware of the
problem for some time.
Similar action is said to have been
taken with Lagunita women living
off campus, although Lagunita Di
rector Joann Gay denied knowledge

of such a move. Martha Madden,
director of Florence Moore, would not
comment on whether off-campus
women in that residence had been
contacted.
Upperclass women are allowed an
unlimited number of overnights and
can theoretically sign out for every
night of the quarter, thus creating a
legal conflict. Apparently the conflict
will be solved by asking women to be
in residence at least three nights per
week.
Mounting Pressure
The Dean's office has been subject
to mounting pressure regarding its
failure to enforce social regulations.
But according to one Hoskins senior,
the reason being given for asking
women to move back on campus is
that "it is not in the spirit of a resi
dence university" to move out com
pletely.
No women have so far been known
to refuse compliance with the request
that they move back to their resi
dences.
