# Summer Festival
## Joffrey Company To Perform 
### 
New York's City Center Joffrey
Ballet Company will lead off the 1967
Stanford Summer Festival of the
Arts.
The highlight of the programs,
scheduled for June 27 to July 2, will
be the first production by an Ameri
can company of Kurt Jooss's ballet
"The Green Table."
Jooss's ballet is an expressionist de
nunciation of war. Its scenes trace
the relentless path of nations from
diplomatic breakdawn to war and fi
nally to the conference table. In the
end only the diplomats are left alive.
The ballet created a sensation when
it was first produced in Europe in
1932, and in 1933 it was banned in
Germany, where the Jooss Ballet was
centered.
Also in the Joffrey repertory are

"Cakewalk," "Viva Vivaldi," "Opus
65," "Scotch Symphony," "Donizetti
Variations," "Nightwings," "Olym
pics,," "Sea Shadow," "Pas D e s
Deeses," "Rooks," and "Incubus." The
ballets run the full gamut of subject
matter from restless youth in "Opus
65" to sexual nightmare in "Incubus"
and "Nightwings" to a minstrel show
in "Cakewalk."
These ballets will display the vir
tuoso talents of five American choreo
graphers. They are George Balan
chine, considered one of the greatest
American dance masters, Ruthanna
Boris, Anna Sokolov, Gerald Arpino,
and Robert Joffrey himself.
The company was founded in 1952
by Robert Joffrey. Its first U.S. tour
was made in 1956, and since that time
performances have been held in over
500 cities in the U.S., Europe, and

Asia. A ten-week tour of Russia in
1963 and a command performance for
President Kennedy accented the
troupe's history.
A lighter aspect of the arts repre
sented by the Summer Festival will
be the American theater as depicted
in the cartoons of A 1 Hirschfield. Fifty
of Hirschfield's drawings will be on
display in Tresidder, July 18 through
August 13.

Since 1925 Hirschfield has made the
personalities and productions of New
York theater a subject for caricature.
His drawings have become standard
illustrations for Broadway shows.
All of Hirschfield's cartoons have a
common element — his daughter's
name Nina. Many Hirschfield fans
have made a pasttime of searching
out the well-concealed name in the
cartoons.

65," "Scotch Symphony," "Donizetti
Variations," "Nightwings," "Olym
pics,," "Sea Shadow," "Pas D e s
Deeses," "Rooks," and "Incubus." The
ballets run the full gamut of subject
matter from restless youth in "Opus
65" to sexual nightmare in "Incubus"
and "Nightwings" to a minstrel show
in "Cakewalk."
These ballets will display the vir
tuoso talents of five American choreo
graphers. They are George Balan
chine, considered one of the greatest
American dance masters, Ruthanna
Boris, Anna Sokolov, Gerald Arpino,
and Robert Joffrey himself.
The company was founded in 1952
by Robert Joffrey. Its first U.S. tour
was made in 1956, and since that time
performances have been held in over
500 cities in the U.S., Europe, and

Asia. A ten-week tour of Russia in
1963 and a command performance for
President Kennedy accented the
troupe's history.
A lighter aspect of the arts repre
sented by the Summer Festival will
be the American theater as depicted
in the cartoons of A 1 Hirschfield. Fifty
of Hirschfield's drawings will be on
display in Tresidder, July 18 through
August 13.

Since 1925 Hirschfield has made the
personalities and productions of New
York theater a subject for caricature.
His drawings have become standard
illustrations for Broadway shows.
All of Hirschfield's cartoons have a
common element — his daughter's
name Nina. Many Hirschfield fans
have made a pasttime of searching
out the well-concealed name in the
cartoons.
New York's City Center Joffrey
Ballet Company will lead off the 1967
Stanford Summer Festival of the
Arts.
The highlight of the programs,
scheduled for June 27 to July 2, will
be the first production by an Ameri
can company of Kurt Jooss's ballet
"The Green Table."
Jooss's ballet is an expressionist de
nunciation of war. Its scenes trace
the relentless path of nations from
diplomatic breakdawn to war and fi
nally to the conference table. In the
end only the diplomats are left alive.
The ballet created a sensation when
it was first produced in Europe in
1932, and in 1933 it was banned in
Germany, where the Jooss Ballet was
centered.
Also in the Joffrey repertory are

"Cakewalk," "Viva Vivaldi," "Opus
65," "Scotch Symphony," "Donizetti
Variations," "Nightwings," "Olym
pics,," "Sea Shadow," "Pas D e s
Deeses," "Rooks," and "Incubus." The
ballets run the full gamut of subject
matter from restless youth in "Opus
65" to sexual nightmare in "Incubus"
and "Nightwings" to a minstrel show
