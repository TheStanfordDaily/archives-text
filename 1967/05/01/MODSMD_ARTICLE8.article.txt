# Women Draw For OFF, Campus Living Groups
## 
### 
Senior women planning to live
off campus and freshmen wom
en will draw for residences this
Thursday. The draw for up
perclass women planning to re
main on campus has been post
poned because of the possibility
of coeducational housing experi
ments.
The definition of a senior by
the AWS Housing Committee
will stand. A senior will be con
sidered a woman who at the
end of Spring quarter has com
pleted nine quarters at Stan
ford or who has acquired 130
units.
Should experimental housing
programs be implemented, the
dates, especially the May 26 con
firmation date, will remain flex
ible. However, two draw dates
stand firm.
Draw Dates
The first of these draw dates
is Thursday, May 4, which is
for seniors who wish to draw
into Hoskins, and freshmen
women. Seniors drawing into
Hoskins will continue to draw
in pairs. Even if Hoskins is a
second alternative to OFF, these
senior women will participate
in this draw.
The second standing draw
date will be Thursday, May 18,
when a drawing will be held if
the OFF applications exceed 100.
The AWS Housing Committee
has limited the number of wom
en who may draw together at
this time to four.
The week of May 1 through
May 5 vacancy cards will be
collected from graduating se
niors, women going overseas for
Summer-Fall, and women plan
ning not to register Fall Quar
ter.
