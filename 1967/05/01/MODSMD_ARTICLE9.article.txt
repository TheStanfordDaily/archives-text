# Manning Explains Law's Relevance
## 
### 
Because "law to command ad
herence from people must be
relevant . . . and integrated into
their lives," the rapid changes
in modern life are forcing like
changes in the legal process of
the United States, claims Law
School Dean Bayless Manning.
Speaking on "Law and Social
Change" at a meeting of the
Palo Alto Bar Association, Man
ning expressed the relationships
he sees between legal process
and a world that "just won't
stand still." One cannot change
society "without shaking up the
legal process that goes with it,"
he said.
As an example of the influ
ence of society upon law, Man
ning posed the question of the
relationship between recent ad
vances in medicine and the legal
definition of death. Medical ad
vances, he said, mean that some
people are suspended in a "gray
area" between life and death,
and sometimes someone has to
decide to "pull the plug." "I have
no doubt that somebody will be
brought up for homocide one of
these days," he added.
Medical advances in the de

velopment of contraceptives are,
he said, partly responsible for
the current "abortion flap."
Manning also claims that an
"international overlay" has come
upon modern law work because
"improved methods of transpor
tation have in effect brought na
tions closer."
Citing the ability of law to
"move' 'and adjust to changes in
society over the past 175 years,
he expressed his confidence that
our legal system could meet the
pressures being placed on it.
"One must stand back in awe
and applaud the extraordinary
extent it has made adjustments
when it had to," he said.
