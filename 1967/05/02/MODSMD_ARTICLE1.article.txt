# Candidates Question Education At Stanford
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
In loco parentis, the importance of
a philosophy of education, and the
desirability of cooperation with the
administration were among the is
sues discussed yesterday at a noon
rally by the five ASSU presidential
candidates.
One specific call to action was is
sued by candidate Peter Lyman con
cerning the proposed Wilbur Experi
ment. Lyman told the assembled stu
dents that although most people as
sumed that the proposal would be
passed, "this is not certain, and in fact
may not even be likely."
Lyman cited specific difficulties in
which administrators were relating
social regulations to the Wilbur ex
periment as a reason why the experi
ment might not be passed. He empha
sized the necessity for immediate stu
dent action, saying that this was
an issue of the election, but of edu
cation.
Student Action Needed
"We cannot let them turn this
down," he said. "We must have the
Wilbur Experiment. We have to make
sure it goes through, and we have to
act now. When we are dealing with
our own education, with the way we

live, no one has the right to make
these decisions for us. But we can't
go on asking permission to live the
way we want. We're going to have to
start living that way."
Other candidates also spoke on
housing. Fritz Schaefer said that he
had not heard of the possibility of the
Wilbur Experiment not being passed,
and that every person had the right
to live as he wished, whether in the
Grove Project, fraternities, Stern, cr
off campus.
Distrust of Students
Another issue discussed was in loco
parentis and the role of students vis-a
vis the administration. Candidate Joe
Reich said that a community of stu
dents could not coexist with the con
cept of in loco parentis. He defined
this as a "distrust of students to act
responsibly" and said that it resulted
in a control of the student govern
ment by the administration.
Speaking to the same point, Lyman
began his speech by reading the Fun
damental Standard. "This is what is
supposed to govern the actions of stu
dents," he said, "but the University
is really run by a combination of the
Fundamental Standard and a univer
sity structure that makes rules for us.

"The concept of in loco parentis is
directly opposed to the Fundamental
Standard. If we are expected to en
force rules, we must also be given the
right to make them." He suggested
that students must begin by unilat
erally enforcing the Fundamental
Standard.
Heart of the Issue
Cooperation with the administration
in order to change the rules may be
effective, he said, but "this is not the
heart of the issue. We have to start
acting by what we believe in. If we
want education, we must create it our
selves."
Candidates differed in their ideas
of student - administration relation
ships. Joe Reich maintained that the
purpose of student government was
to represent the students, and that
anyone who worked with the admini
stration was working against the stu
dents.
Specifically referring to the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES) Reich
said that "if you agree with (Vice Pro
vost Herbert) Packer's Roman num
erals one two and three, and his philo
sophy of education, he'll let you de
cide where to put the pencil sharpen
er."

"Whether we like it or not," stated
Tom Shanahan, "the Packer Commit
tee is going to be making the sugges
tions next year which will change
Stanford." The main problem facing
students he said, was the opening up
of channels of communication with
SES so that students can become a
part of the faculty-administration de
cision-making structure.
Asked how he planned to open up
access to the SES, Shanahan said all
the students would have to do was
request the release of such informa
tion.
Shanahan also proposed that Stan
ford take advantage of the help of
the National Student Association.
Representation
The candidates also commented on
the problem of student representation
by the student government. Pete Han
sen said that "more important than a
philosophy of education is a concept
of administration. The ASSU presi
dent has two choices: he can be a
philosopher, or he can be a representa
tive. I don't believe the ASSU presi
dent should serve his philosophy of
education. He must be representative
of the student body."

"Representation is important," he
said, "because in order to make
changes in the University we have to
convince the faculty and the admini
stration that what we want to do is
right."
Fritz Schaefer agreed with Hansen
that LASSU was not representative,
and proposed a new 60-member legis
lature in which every 200 students
would have a representative and the
graduate division constituencies would
be broken down into more workable
units.
Hostilities
After commending the Harris ad
ministration for its role in making
people think, Shanahan added that
"now there is increasing hostility
among students, between students and
faculty, and especially between stu
dents and the administration. We have
to find some way to acknowledge all
points of view. We cannot try to shape
the University according to a philo
sophy of education."
Reich, referring to Lyman's con
cept of the "community of scholars,"
said that this demands cooperation be
tween students and faculty, but that

this does not and cannot exist. He
called instead for a "community of
students."
Lyman replied to this that "we
shouldn't underestimate the faculty"
and that in many cases the faculty
and students could cooperate in im
portant matters. Where we cannot,
he said, innovation must come from
the students, as in the case of the
ASSU Housing Commission report.
Up To His Own Standards
"If you want to read an idealistic
description of Stanford." he said, "you
should read the Stanford Bulletin.
We need to do two things: act unilat
erally to bring education to where the
students are, and make Stanford live
up to its own description of what a
university is supposed to be."
Schaefer deplored the influence of
what he called "Professor New Left"
in the university. Such professors, he
said, made it difficult to express con
trary opinions on campus. He pointed
to the Humphrey incident as one in
which "someone dared to go against
Professor New Left, and look what
happened to him." Now, he said, "no
body to the right of Ramparts can
speak at Stanford."
