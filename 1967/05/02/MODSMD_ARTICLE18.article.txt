# Similar Pool, Diamond Results To Haunt USC?
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
, The Stanford baseball team's
weekend escapades bear a start
ing and perhaps prophetic simi
larity to a weekend splashorama
two months ago when USC and
JCLA ran head on into the
Stanford swimming team.
USC and Stanford were rank
<kll-2 in both sports, with UCLA
rajted among the nation's top
'ive.
USC escaped both encounters
frith ties — 52-52 in the Encina
swimming pool and 3-3 on the
Sunken Diamond. USC held on
to it's number one ranking
|>oth times, but left room for
serious speculation in both cases.
, ° No Way For UCLA
; The touted Bruins fared less
well. Given a fair chance of
peating Stanford's swimming
team, UCLA swallowed un
healthy amounts of Farm pond
water. The Bruins won only 1 of
If events and went home chew
.ng on an 81-23 humiliation.

UCLA got fifth in the NCAA's.
UCLA's baseball team, the sur
prise of the league and ranked
third nationwide, was purported
ly able to power the Cards into
the dust. The power came from
the wrong dugout, as the In
dians ran through the entire
Bruin pitching staff en route
to 8-3 and 9-2 Stanford victories.
Stanford outscored UCLA 17-5
in the double header — almost
exactly the same ratio as the
swimmers' 81-23 whitewash.

The juiciest part of the com
parison has yet to materialize.
Stanford swimmers came from
behind to bag the NCAA trophy.
Swimmers, as a rule, do bet
ter with a water polo cap than
a catcher's mitt, and very few
shortstops can manage a repect
able 200 individual medley.
Both, however, are starting to
pull guts out of a bag that Stan
ford is opening wide. To our
neighbors in the sunny south
land, it may well develop into a
Pandora's box.
