## 
### JOHN HOTSON 
The Stanford varsity crews
defeated USC, Long Beach, and
Loyola but were upset by a
powerful UCLA crew in what
must be called a disappointing
weekend.
Stanford coach Will Condon
commented after the loss, 'We
were simply not prepared physi
cally and mentally to handle a
crew as big and strong as
UCLA. We did not row well and
they simply out drove us."
The Bruins grabbed an early
lead in the race and easily held
on to it to win by two lengths
over the Indians. The Indians
simply could not muster the
strength they have previously
shown.
Coxswain John Reider stated,
"The race showed us that we
have a lot of work to do before
the Western Sprints, where we
not only get another chance at
UCLA but meet the always
strong University of Washing
ton."
The Western Sprints, the cli
max of the season on the west
coast, will be held in three weeks
in Los Angeles with fourteen
schools participating.
One bright note of the week
end was the Stanford frosh who
easily handled the UCLA
rookies.

A 1 Miller, frosh crew coach,
stated, "I was quite pleased with
the performance of my men.
They went out to beat UCLA
and did just that."
