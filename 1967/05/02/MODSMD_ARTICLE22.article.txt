# Letters To The Editor
## Is Upward Bound Dead? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Upward Bound is now dead at
Stanford. The University has
answered the Office of Econo
mic Opportunity's offer of $59,-
273 with a polite "thanks, but
no thanks."
Several thoughts still nag,
though. What of the 46 students
from East Palo Alto who would
have attended the program? I
admit (perhaps in the present
atmosphere, "confess" would be
more apt) to the liberal bias
that inability to change the
world by noon tomorrow should
not prevent us from taking
whatever small steps can be
taken today. Indeed, I would go
further.
Assume that the following
propositions are correct: The
Poverty Program is a fraud;
Stanford is rich, white, and
hypocritical; and Ravenswood
High School is hopeless. Assume
that all of these are true, and
should not substantial weight
still be given to the possibility
that 46 youngsters will be en
abled by Upward Bound to do
something with their lives that
they would otherwise not be
able to do? Call it tokenism, if
you will. Call it patronizing, if
that be true. But in all honesty,
call it, too, an important social
value that as many people as
possible, now, be enabled to use
their lives more effectively.
Possibility For Future
I have been told that the op
portunity extended to those 46
simply ameliorates the situa
tion in East Palo Alto, making
it more difficult to produce radi
cal and meaningful change, and
hence, making the situation
worse rather than better. In that
kind of calculus, I am told, the
price of the program to the com
munity is higher than any pos
sible benefits to the 46.
Perhaps. But everything I
know about history, politics, and
the resolution of complex social
problems warns we that that is
a very dangerous kind of calcu
lation to make because it rests
on a faulty notion about strat
egy which says that if a situa
tion gets bad enough, people
will eventually be forced to take
drastic action to make it better.
A more accurate assessment
of the strategy would be that
when things get bad enough
they fall apart, and no man is
wise enough to predict the way
in which they will be put to
gether again. If that assessment
is correct, then we must face
up to the very real possibility
that a bad bargain, indeed, has
been made over the lives of 46
youngsters.
Well, where do we go from
here? For the moment, the ans
wer seems to be nowhere. In
the words of the President of
the South San Mateo County
NAACP (a minor classic in un
intended irony), "Once Stanford
was helping us. Now it seems
to be a hindrance. We say, 'Get
out of our community.' " His ad
vice evidently will be taken. Let
us hope that the future will,
as a consequence, be better than
the past. For myself, I have my
doubts.

• Up Again, Down
Again
In the news story on the Uni
versity's rejection of the Upward
Bound grant (Daily, April 28)
it is stated that the staff involv
ed in the program last summer
"voted not to have a program
this year due to a decrease in
funds from the Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity." The fact is
that the grant was not to be re
duced, but was to be the same

for 1967-68 as it had been for the
current year.
Because the staff had hoped
to add at least 20 new students
to the program, when it became
clear that insufficient funds to
do so were available, the ma
jority voted against continuing.
They did so because they be
lieved that going on without a
substantial increase in the num
ber of students would not be
worth the effort. Furthermore,
with rising costs, the entire
staff saw that the same amount
of money would not make pos
sible as effective a program as
last year's even for the original
number of students.

• Two More Deplore
Editor, The Daily:
With regard to the letter in

• Semantics?
Editor, The Daily:
Re Barry Greenberg's letter in
The Daily (May 1) in which he
claims that student funds are
not being used to finance the Ex
periment's political activities, in
asmuch as the $500 LASSU ap
propriation has been allotted to
cover half of his spring quarter
salary. Let us not play semantic
games, Mr. Greenberg. Funds
are funds. The Experiment has
a total income for the quarter,
and a total outgo. It is absurd
to say that a specific source of
income finances exclusively a
certain type of expenditure; once
the income is in the till, its
source is irrelevant to the fact
that it contributes to the Experi
ment's total spendable cash.
No one can honestly claim
that LASSU's appropriation will
go entirely for political activi
ties, but nonetheless it will con
tribute to the Experiment's abi
lity to finance such activities,
and in particular it will help to
cover a deficit in the Experi
ment's budget which is due in
large measure to them.

• Why Rumors?
Editor, The Daily:
In their recent letter, two of
the candidates in the ASSU cam
paign argue that each candidate
should make known his political
affiliations, past and present.
Doing so, presumably, will stop
rumors.
What kind of nonsense is
this? Rumors begin and circu
late because their peddlers ex
pect to benefit by them,
whether or not the facts are
available. The fault lies not in
inadequate information — an in
evitability — but in willful dis
tortion.
A more fundamental point is
at stake here. Of what relevance
to a Stanford election is a can
didate's affiliations in the poli
tics of society at large? Surely
a person's party identification
and his opinions about Vietnam,
civil rights, tax-free churches or
what have you are irrelevant to
the purposes for which the
ASSU election is being held.
We should be electing candidates
for Stanford, not for or against
a party or a cause.
No doubt supporters of the
several candidates have relevant
reasons for their preference. I

am happy to join the many who
have decided in favor of Peter
Lyman, not because I always
agree with him on global issues
(I don't) but because I feel he
can do the best job for all of
us here on campus.

• Not a Wilburness
Editor, The Daily:
On several occasions during
the past few weeks I have been
astounded by some of the re
marks made by The Daily in
editorials. For instance, the fol
lowing statement was made in
an April 10 discourse: "Very
little educational interaction
takes place in the context of the
dormitory or fraternity house."
Later in the article it was said
that "in many cases, Wilbur
Hall being the most notorious
though not the only example,
the physical facilities them
selves are a near insurmount
able obstacle."
Being a Freshman residing in
the "most notorious example,"
I challenge the validity of these
statements. I have no doubt that
the editor who made the above
remarks returned to Wilbur this
year to investigate the situation
before he wrote out his final
report on the living conditions,
but I wonder if he didn't stop
outside the office, deciding that
since it looked the same from
there, then . . .
Regarding the educational in
teraction that does or does not
take place in dorms or fraterni
ties, I suggest that The Daily
send someone inside again to
talk to a couple of residents in
each place (that is, if he is not
afraid of the image he has cre
ated of the fraternity man).
I would think that statements
in The Daily similar to those I
have mentioned would incite
more student response than is
presently the case. Unfortun
ately, they do not. It is sad but
true that even though I have not
completed even one year at
Stanford, I am already tired of
hearing some students speak for
the majority when in reality the
majority does not say anything
at all.

• Not a Wilburness
Editor, The Daily:
On several occasions during
the past few weeks I have been
astounded by some of the re
marks made by The Daily in
editorials. For instance, the fol
lowing statement was made in
an April 10 discourse: "Very
little educational interaction
takes place in the context of the
dormitory or fraternity house."
Later in the article it was said
that "in many cases, Wilbur
Hall being the most notorious
though not the only example,
the physical facilities them
selves are a near insurmount
able obstacle."
Being a Freshman residing in
the "most notorious example,"
I challenge the validity of these
statements. I have no doubt that
the editor who made the above
remarks returned to Wilbur this
year to investigate the situation
before he wrote out his final
report on the living conditions,
but I wonder if he didn't stop
outside the office, deciding that
since it looked the same from
there, then . . .
Regarding the educational in
teraction that does or does not
take place in dorms or fraterni
ties, I suggest that The Daily
send someone inside again to
talk to a couple of residents in
each place (that is, if he is not
afraid of the image he has cre
ated of the fraternity man).
I would think that statements
in The Daily similar to those I
have mentioned would incite
more student response than is
presently the case. Unfortun
ately, they do not. It is sad but
true that even though I have not
completed even one year at
Stanford, I am already tired of
hearing some students speak for
the majority when in reality the
majority does not say anything
at all.
RICHARD L. LEES
Freshman
Editor, The Daily:
Upward Bound is now dead at
Stanford. The University has
answered the Office of Econo
mic Opportunity's offer of $59,-
273 with a polite "thanks, but
no thanks."
Several thoughts still nag,
though. What of the 46 students
from East Palo Alto who would
have attended the program? I
admit (perhaps in the present
atmosphere, "confess" would be
more apt) to the liberal bias
that inability to change the
world by noon tomorrow should
not prevent us from taking
whatever small steps can be
taken today. Indeed, I would go
further.
Assume that the following
propositions are correct: The
Poverty Program is a fraud;
Stanford is rich, white, and
hypocritical; and Ravenswood
High School is hopeless. Assume
that all of these are true, and
should not substantial weight
still be given to the possibility
that 46 youngsters will be en
abled by Upward Bound to do
something with their lives that
they would otherwise not be
able to do? Call it tokenism, if
you will. Call it patronizing, if
that be true. But in all honesty,
call it, too, an important social
value that as many people as
possible, now, be enabled to use
their lives more effectively.
Possibility For Future
I have been told that the op
portunity extended to those 46
simply ameliorates the situa
tion in East Palo Alto, making
it more difficult to produce radi
cal and meaningful change, and
hence, making the situation
worse rather than better. In that
kind of calculus, I am told, the
price of the program to the com
munity is higher than any pos
sible benefits to the 46.
Perhaps. But everything I
know about history, politics, and
the resolution of complex social
problems warns we that that is
a very dangerous kind of calcu
lation to make because it rests
on a faulty notion about strat
egy which says that if a situa
tion gets bad enough, people
will eventually be forced to take
drastic action to make it better.
A more accurate assessment
of the strategy would be that
when things get bad enough
they fall apart, and no man is
wise enough to predict the way
in which they will be put to
gether again. If that assessment
is correct, then we must face
up to the very real possibility
that a bad bargain, indeed, has
been made over the lives of 46
youngsters.
Well, where do we go from
here? For the moment, the ans
wer seems to be nowhere. In
the words of the President of
the South San Mateo County
NAACP (a minor classic in un
intended irony), "Once Stanford
was helping us. Now it seems
to be a hindrance. We say, 'Get
out of our community.' " His ad
vice evidently will be taken. Let
us hope that the future will,
as a consequence, be better than
the past. For myself, I have my
doubts.

Again
In the news story on the Uni

Bound grant (Daily, April 28)
it is stated that the staff involv
ed in the program last summer
"voted not to have a program
this year due to a decrease in
funds from the Office of Eco

that the grant was not to be re
duced, but was to be the same

for 1967-68 as it had been for the
current year.
Because the staff had hoped
to add at least 20 new students
to the program, when it became
clear that insufficient funds to
do so were available, the ma
jority voted against continuing.
They did so because they be
lieved that going on without a
substantial increase in the num
ber of students would not be
worth the effort. Furthermore,
with rising costs, the entire
staff saw that the same amount
of money would not make pos

able to do? Call it tokenism, if
you will. Call it patronizing, if
that be true. But in all honesty,
call it, too, an important social
value that as many people as
possible, now, be enabled to use
their lives more effectively.
Possibility For Future
I have been told that the op
portunity extended to those 46
simply ameliorates the situa
tion in East Palo Alto, making
it more difficult to produce radi
cal and meaningful change, and
hence, making the situation
worse rather than better. In that
kind of calculus, I am told, the
price of the program to the com
munity is higher than any pos
sible benefits to the 46.
Perhaps. But everything I
know about history, politics, and
the resolution of complex social
problems warns we that that is
a very dangerous kind of calcu
lation to make because it rests
on a faulty notion about strat
egy which says that if a situa
tion gets bad enough, people
will eventually be forced to take
drastic action to make it better.
A more accurate assessment
of the strategy would be that
when things get bad enough
they fall apart, and no man is
wise enough to predict the way
in which they will be put to
gether again. If that assessment
is correct, then we must face
up to the very real possibility
that a bad bargain, indeed, has
been made over the lives of 46
youngsters.
Well, where do we go from
here? For the moment, the ans
wer seems to be nowhere. In
the words of the President of
the South San Mateo County
NAACP (a minor classic in un
intended irony), "Once Stanford
was helping us. Now it seems
to be a hindrance. We say, 'Get
out of our community.' " His ad
vice evidently will be taken. Let
us hope that the future will,
as a consequence, be better than
the past. For myself, I have my
doubts.

• Up Again, Down
Again
In the news story on the Uni

Bound grant (Daily, April 28)
it is stated that the staff involv
ed in the program last summer
"voted not to have a program
this year due to a decrease in
funds from the Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity." The fact is
that the grant was not to be re
duced, but was to be the same

for 1967-68 as it had been for the
current year.
Because the staff had hoped
to add at least 20 new students
to the program, when it became
clear that insufficient funds to
do so were available, the ma
jority voted against continuing.
They did so because they be
lieved that going on without a
substantial increase in the num
ber of students would not be
worth the effort. Furthermore,
with rising costs, the entire
staff saw that the same amount
of money would not make pos

last year's even for the original

Editor, The Daily:
Re Barry Greenberg's letter in

claims that student funds are
not being used to finance the Ex

asmuch as the $500 LASSU ap

No one can honestly claim

• Not a Wilburness
Editor, The Daily:
On several occasions during
the past few weeks I have been
astounded by some of the re
marks made by The Daily in
editorials. For instance, the fol
lowing statement was made in
an April 10 discourse: "Very
little educational interaction
takes place in the context of the
dormitory or fraternity house."
Later in the article it was said
that "in many cases, Wilbur
Hall being the most notorious
though not the only example,
the physical facilities them
selves are a near insurmount
able obstacle."
Being a Freshman residing in
the "most notorious example,"
I challenge the validity of these
statements. I have no doubt that
the editor who made the above
remarks returned to Wilbur this
year to investigate the situation
before he wrote out his final
report on the living conditions,
but I wonder if he didn't stop
outside the office, deciding that
since it looked the same from
there, then . . .
Regarding the educational in
teraction that does or does not
take place in dorms or fraterni
ties, I suggest that The Daily
send someone inside again to
talk to a couple of residents in
each place (that is, if he is not
afraid of the image he has cre
ated of the fraternity man).
I would think that statements
in The Daily similar to those I
have mentioned would incite
more student response than is
presently the case. Unfortun
ately, they do not. It is sad but
true that even though I have not
completed even one year at
Stanford, I am already tired of
hearing some students speak for
the majority when in reality the
majority does not say anything
at all.

Upward Bound is now dead at

Several thoughts still nag,

admit (perhaps in the present

not prevent us from taking
whatever small steps can be

• Not a Wilburness
Editor, The Daily:
On several occasions during
the past few weeks I have been
astounded by some of the re
marks made by The Daily in
editorials. For instance, the fol
lowing statement was made in
an April 10 discourse: "Very
little educational interaction
takes place in the context of the
dormitory or fraternity house."
Later in the article it was said
that "in many cases, Wilbur
Hall being the most notorious
though not the only example,
the physical facilities them
selves are a near insurmount
able obstacle."
Being a Freshman residing in
the "most notorious example,"
I challenge the validity of these
statements. I have no doubt that
the editor who made the above
remarks returned to Wilbur this
year to investigate the situation
before he wrote out his final
report on the living conditions,
but I wonder if he didn't stop
outside the office, deciding that
since it looked the same from
there, then . . .
Regarding the educational in
teraction that does or does not
take place in dorms or fraterni
ties, I suggest that The Daily
send someone inside again to
talk to a couple of residents in
each place (that is, if he is not
afraid of the image he has cre
ated of the fraternity man).
I would think that statements
in The Daily similar to those I
have mentioned would incite
more student response than is
presently the case. Unfortun
ately, they do not. It is sad but
true that even though I have not
completed even one year at
Stanford, I am already tired of
hearing some students speak for
the majority when in reality the
majority does not say anything
at all.
RICHARD L. LEES
Freshman
Editor, The Daily:
Upward Bound is now dead at
Stanford. The University has
answered the Office of Econo
mic Opportunity's offer of $59,-
273 with a polite "thanks, but
no thanks."
Several thoughts still nag,
though. What of the 46 students
from East Palo Alto who would
have attended the program? I
admit (perhaps in the present
atmosphere, "confess" would be
more apt) to the liberal bias
that inability to change the
world by noon tomorrow should
not prevent us from taking
whatever small steps can be
taken today. Indeed, I would go
further.
Assume that the following
propositions are correct: The
Poverty Program is a fraud;
Stanford is rich, white, and
hypocritical; and Ravenswood
High School is hopeless. Assume
that all of these are true, and
should not substantial weight
still be given to the possibility
that 46 youngsters will be en
abled by Upward Bound to do
something with their lives that
they would otherwise not be
able to do? Call it tokenism, if
you will. Call it patronizing, if
that be true. But in all honesty,
call it, too, an important social
value that as many people as
possible, now, be enabled to use
their lives more effectively.
Possibility For Future
I have been told that the op
portunity extended to those 46
simply ameliorates the situa
tion in East Palo Alto, making
it more difficult to produce radi
cal and meaningful change, and
hence, making the situation
worse rather than better. In that
kind of calculus, I am told, the
price of the program to the com
munity is higher than any pos
sible benefits to the 46.
Perhaps. But everything I
know about history, politics, and
the resolution of complex social
problems warns we that that is
a very dangerous kind of calcu
lation to make because it rests
on a faulty notion about strat
egy which says that if a situa
tion gets bad enough, people
will eventually be forced to take
drastic action to make it better.
A more accurate assessment
of the strategy would be that
when things get bad enough
they fall apart, and no man is
wise enough to predict the way
in which they will be put to
gether again. If that assessment
is correct, then we must face
up to the very real possibility
that a bad bargain, indeed, has
been made over the lives of 46
youngsters.
Well, where do we go from
here? For the moment, the ans
wer seems to be nowhere. In
the words of the President of
the South San Mateo County
NAACP (a minor classic in un
intended irony), "Once Stanford
was helping us. Now it seems
to be a hindrance. We say, 'Get
out of our community.' " His ad
vice evidently will be taken. Let
us hope that the future will,
as a consequence, be better than
the past. For myself, I have my
doubts.

• Up Again, Down
Again
In the news story on the Uni

Bound grant (Daily, April 28)
it is stated that the staff involv
ed in the program last summer
"voted not to have a program
this year due to a decrease in
funds from the Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity." The fact is
that the grant was not to be re
duced, but was to be the same

for 1967-68 as it had been for the
current year.
Because the staff had hoped
to add at least 20 new students
to the program, when it became
clear that insufficient funds to
do so were available, the ma
jority voted against continuing.
They did so because they be
lieved that going on without a
substantial increase in the num
ber of students would not be
worth the effort. Furthermore,
with rising costs, the entire
staff saw that the same amount
of money would not make pos
sible as effective a program as
last year's even for the original
number of students.

Editor, The Daily:
Re Barry Greenberg's letter in
The Daily (May 1) in which he
claims that student funds are
not being used to finance the Ex
periment's political activities, in
asmuch as the $500 LASSU ap
propriation has been allotted to
cover half of his spring quarter
salary. Let us not play semantic
games, Mr. Greenberg. Funds
are funds. The Experiment has
a total income for the quarter,
and a total outgo. It is absurd
to say that a specific source of
income finances exclusively a
certain type of expenditure; once
the income is in the till, its
source is irrelevant to the fact
that it contributes to the Experi
ment's total spendable cash.
No one can honestly claim
that LASSU's appropriation will
go entirely for political activi
ties, but nonetheless it will con
tribute to the Experiment's abi
lity to finance such activities,
and in particular it will help to
cover a deficit in the Experi
