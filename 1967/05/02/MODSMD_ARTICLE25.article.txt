## Dr. Nouveau Gauche: Join Us 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Yesterday I was fortunate
enough to interview a visiting
lecturer, Dr. Nouveau Gauche.
He is American, but lives for the
most part on the left bank in
Paris. His speciality is the para
noid style of cosmic and natural
law, and so naturally enough I
limited my questions to those
topics.
Q. Dr. Gauche, what exactly
do you mean when you write
that "the American feels the uni
verse is out to get him . . . ?"
A. The food is lousy here.
Q. Yes, I see. When you spoke
last year in New Jersey, you
mentioned that "God is not dead,
he is just running scared."
A. It is a simple fact that
very little admissions work is
done in New York State, and
minority religions simply do not
feel compelling motives to ap
ply-
Q. Do you really believe the
Moon is on a collision course
with the sun?
A. No telling what horrors
SRI scientists will invent next.
Q. I have heard you quoted
as saying "the universe is ex
crement which dumps excre
ment upon itself apathetically
A. Well, if you pay maids $250
a month to clean up students'
rooms, make sure they are all
of minority races; you can't ex
pect too much.
Q. When you call the solar
system basically "communistic,"
what are you trying to invoke
anyhow?
Shades of SES
A. The only decision students
share around here is whether
they will have coffee, tea or milk
at dinner.
Q. When you agree with Ein
stein that science is relative, but
the wonder of the world is not,
are you being totally fair?
A. This University has de
based tradition into blind habit.
Q. Your new book, "Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity at the
Atomic Level," seems especially
important. What, might you say,
is its basic point?
A. That molecules, not social
regulations, are where it's at,
baby.
Q. You call yourself "an ani
mal who loves men." Why?
A. General Studies courses do
not fulfill the aims of the gen
eral studies idea.
Q. Do you think Newton's
three laws of conservation have
implications for social behavior?
A. I am a scientist, not an ad
ministrator.
Irrational Man?
A. Paranoia means irrational
in Greek. As a scientist, how
can you believe that the Uni
verse is irrational?
A. Because God created Man,
and Man created the University.
Simple casuistry, my friend.
Q. In light of that, do you
think the University should
work backwards as well?
A. I refuse to equate the is
with the ought.
Q. What exactly are you will
ing to equate?
A. The ability of students to
get educated with the possession
of dignity, intelligence, and rea
soning: the right to conduct
their own lives, in short. One im
plies the other, and conversely;
a simple biconditional you see.
Q. In your current course, En
tropy the Principle of Life, you
exhort students to go to sleep,
and if that fails, to wake up. Art

there any other possibilities,
anyhow?
A. To continue in the present
sleepwalk.
Q. Yes, well it is getting rath
er late.
A. It may be too late.
Q. Do you have any closing
remarks?
A. Yes, I do. Very simply, we
demand that the University dem

onstrate the professed commit
ment to its ideal. We have sign
ed, in spirit if faculty, in fact
if student, the Fundamental
Standard and we accept fully its
obligations. As well, we demand
that University Philosophy and
policy start to become one and
the same, that the rhetoric of
the Information Bulletin and the
letters inviting faculty be ful

filled. Our mutual dedication to
the coeducational, residential
university ideal will begin with
the Wilbur experiment and con
tinue and continue, and con
tinue, or none of our children
will ever think of coming here.
Only as a community so dedi
cated can we create the real resi
dential and educational univer
sity. We are ready. Join us.

is its basic point?
A. That molecules, not social
regulations, are where it's at,
baby.
Q. You call yourself "an ani
mal who loves men." Why?
A. General Studies courses do
not fulfill the aims of the gen
eral studies idea.
Q. Do you think Newton's
three laws of conservation have
implications for social behavior?
A. I am a scientist, not an ad
ministrator.
Irrational Man?
A. Paranoia means irrational
in Greek. As a scientist, how
can you believe that the Uni
verse is irrational?
A. Because God created Man,
and Man created the University.
Simple casuistry, my friend.
Q. In light of that, do you
think the University should
work backwards as well?
A. I refuse to equate the is
with the ought.
Q. What exactly are you will
ing to equate?
A. The ability of students to
get educated with the possession
of dignity, intelligence, and rea
soning: the right to conduct
their own lives, in short. One im
plies the other, and conversely;
a simple biconditional you see.
Q. In your current course, En
tropy the Principle of Life, you
exhort students to go to sleep,
and if that fails, to wake up. Art

there any other possibilities,
anyhow?
A. To continue in the present
sleepwalk.
Q. Yes, well it is getting rath
er late.
A. It may be too late.
Q. Do you have any closing
remarks?
A. Yes, I do. Very simply, we
demand that the University dem

onstrate the professed commit
ment to its ideal. We have sign
ed, in spirit if faculty, in fact
if student, the Fundamental
Standard and we accept fully its
obligations. As well, we demand
that University Philosophy and
policy start to become one and
the same, that the rhetoric of
the Information Bulletin and the
letters inviting faculty be ful

filled. Our mutual dedication to
the coeducational, residential
university ideal will begin with
the Wilbur experiment and con
tinue and continue, and con
tinue, or none of our children
will ever think of coming here.
Only as a community so dedi
cated can we create the real resi
dential and educational univer
sity. We are ready. Join us.
Yesterday I was fortunate
enough to interview a visiting
lecturer, Dr. Nouveau Gauche.
He is American, but lives for the
most part on the left bank in
Paris. His speciality is the para
noid style of cosmic and natural
law, and so naturally enough I
limited my questions to those
topics.
Q. Dr. Gauche, what exactly
do you mean when you write
that "the American feels the uni
verse is out to get him . . . ?"
A. The food is lousy here.
Q. Yes, I see. When you spoke
last year in New Jersey, you
mentioned that "God is not dead,
he is just running scared."
A. It is a simple fact that
very little admissions work is
done in New York State, and
minority religions simply do not
feel compelling motives to ap
ply-
Q. Do you really believe the
Moon is on a collision course
with the sun?
A. No telling what horrors
SRI scientists will invent next.
Q. I have heard you quoted
as saying "the universe is ex
crement which dumps excre
ment upon itself apathetically
A. Well, if you pay maids $250
a month to clean up students'
rooms, make sure they are all
of minority races; you can't ex
pect too much.
Q. When you call the solar
system basically "communistic,"
what are you trying to invoke
anyhow?
Shades of SES
A. The only decision students
share around here is whether
they will have coffee, tea or milk
at dinner.
Q. When you agree with Ein
stein that science is relative, but
the wonder of the world is not,
are you being totally fair?
A. This University has de
based tradition into blind habit.
Q. Your new book, "Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity at the
Atomic Level," seems especially
important. What, might you say,
is its basic point?
A. That molecules, not social
regulations, are where it's at,
baby.
