## Lyman's Platform: Community Government In The University 
### Carl Schmidt 
Things are looking up. The
Lyman-Massarenti platform pre
sents some clear and intelligent
reflection on education, which is
or should be the principle con
cern of the university. The "plat
form" consists of a series of
white papers which are not par
ticularly readable (hardly sur
prising considering the candi
dates' background in sociology;
pardon the writer's prejudice
against the style adopted by
that discipline) but excellent
ideas are often disguised in the
muddiest of prose.
The candidates indicate an
awareness of overall goals and
a grasp of political method. The
discussion of grading in the
white paper on education illus
trates the point: "While we ab
hor the present system, we feel
that changes in the essential
quality of education will inevit
ably create a community of
learning where grades will be
come useless and be abolished."
There is an important insight
here which is indispensible to
any governmental reform. Struc
tural change reflects, rather than
causes, change in attitude. It is
extremely unlikely that an effort
to abolish grading would meet
with much success until a cli
mate was created in which
grades were useless and irrele
vant.
Community Government
The central concern of the
Lyman campaign is with com
munity government. It is a great
pity that in Lyman's public
speaking and to a certain ex
tent in his platform this notion
has not attained the scope and
power that it should have. It
often seems no more than a set
of platitudes about "town meet
ings" or the like. Not so. A
careful reading of the white
paper on the ASSU reveals a
realistic alternative to the pres
ent mish-mash.
Unfortunately the same per
ceptions have not gone into this
proposal as are illustrated by
the comments on grading (Chor
us, sadly, "Nothing is perfect").
There is no reason why Ly
man's proposals should not be
implemented; they are for the
most part, sound and provoca
tive. But when we ask "Can it
be done?" the answer is prob
ably not. There would be too
much opposition within the uni
versity structure.
But all is not lost. The Lyman
proposals rest upon the very
sound proposition that the stu
dents and faculty acting together
can and should mold the univer
sity into a genuine community
of scholars. The problem is how
to consolidate and where to ap
ply this power. Both students
and faculty have experienced
frustration in their sporadic at
tempts at academic and educa
tional reform. They have, in
fact, a common cause which can
unite and channel their efforts.
For, By and Of the Scholars
The creation of a government
for the community of scholars
should first take place among
the scholars. I say this not out
of an idealistic fancy or any de
sire to exclude the "administra
tion" from such community, but
because I am sincerely interest
ed in community government
succeeding.
A direct attack upon the pres
ent university structure is far

less dangerous to it than one
which merely acknowledges its
irrelevance and sets about cor
recting the situation in a con
structive manner.
Community government
should begin by acting in those
areas in which the administra
tion is unable to deal. A formal
cooperation of students and fac
ulty should address itself to the
problems of education. Within
the area of academic reform
there is nothing to oppose the
united efforts of faculty and stu
dents. They need not make pro
posals; they have only to imple
ment reforms. By demonstrating
its effectiveness in this area,
community government natural
ly extends its influence to the
other corollary aspects of the
university.
Use of the Structure
This is not to say that the "ad
ministration" (I am conscious of
Mr. Cuthbertson's criticism of
the use of that term) should not
participate in a community gov
ernment. There are many within

its structure who would respond
to such an enterprise. Bur any
attempt to involve the structure:
of the administration in a com
munity government could only
lead to frustration and defeat.
The bureaucratic jealousies and
politics involved in such a
change are overwhelming. In
any case those valuable fune
tions which the administration
performs (and there are many)
will survive, others will fade.
Thn point of all this is that
what Lyman and Massarenti
propose is not so difficult or far
off as it may seem. It demands
concentration of effort in the
field of education, the close coop
eration of students and faculty,
and ihe active support of a large
number of students.

change are overwhelming. In
any case those valuable fune
tions which the administration
performs (and there are many)
will survive, others will fade.
Thn point of all this is that
what Lyman and Massarenti
propose is not so difficult or far
off as it may seem. It demands
concentration of effort in the
field of education, the close coop
eration of students and faculty,
and ihe active support of a large
number of students.
Things are looking up. The
Lyman-Massarenti platform pre
sents some clear and intelligent
reflection on education, which is
or should be the principle con
cern of the university. The "plat
form" consists of a series of
white papers which are not par
ticularly readable (hardly sur
prising considering the candi
dates' background in sociology;
pardon the writer's prejudice
against the style adopted by
that discipline) but excellent
ideas are often disguised in the
muddiest of prose.
The candidates indicate an
awareness of overall goals and
a grasp of political method. The
discussion of grading in the
white paper on education illus
trates the point: "While we ab
hor the present system, we feel
that changes in the essential
quality of education will inevit
ably create a community of
learning where grades will be
come useless and be abolished."
There is an important insight
here which is indispensible to
any governmental reform. Struc
tural change reflects, rather than
causes, change in attitude. It is
extremely unlikely that an effort
to abolish grading would meet
with much success until a cli
mate was created in which
grades were useless and irrele
vant.
Community Government
The central concern of the
Lyman campaign is with com
munity government. It is a great
pity that in Lyman's public
speaking and to a certain ex
tent in his platform this notion
has not attained the scope and
power that it should have. It
often seems no more than a set
of platitudes about "town meet
ings" or the like. Not so. A
careful reading of the white
paper on the ASSU reveals a
realistic alternative to the pres
ent mish-mash.
Unfortunately the same per
ceptions have not gone into this
proposal as are illustrated by
the comments on grading (Chor
us, sadly, "Nothing is perfect").
There is no reason why Ly
man's proposals should not be
implemented; they are for the
most part, sound and provoca
tive. But when we ask "Can it
be done?" the answer is prob
ably not. There would be too
much opposition within the uni
versity structure.
But all is not lost. The Lyman
proposals rest upon the very
sound proposition that the stu
dents and faculty acting together
can and should mold the univer
sity into a genuine community
of scholars. The problem is how
to consolidate and where to ap
ply this power. Both students
and faculty have experienced
frustration in their sporadic at
tempts at academic and educa
tional reform. They have, in
fact, a common cause which can
unite and channel their efforts.
For, By and Of the Scholars
The creation of a government
for the community of scholars
should first take place among
the scholars. I say this not out
of an idealistic fancy or any de
sire to exclude the "administra
tion" from such community, but
because I am sincerely interest
ed in community government
succeeding.
A direct attack upon the pres
ent university structure is far

less dangerous to it than one
which merely acknowledges its
irrelevance and sets about cor
recting the situation in a con
structive manner.
Community government
should begin by acting in those
areas in which the administra
tion is unable to deal. A formal
cooperation of students and fac
ulty should address itself to the
problems of education. Within
the area of academic reform
there is nothing to oppose the
united efforts of faculty and stu
dents. They need not make pro
posals; they have only to imple
ment reforms. By demonstrating
its effectiveness in this area,
community government natural
ly extends its influence to the
other corollary aspects of the
university.
Use of the Structure
This is not to say that the "ad
ministration" (I am conscious of
Mr. Cuthbertson's criticism of
the use of that term) should not
participate in a community gov
ernment. There are many within

its structure who would respond
to such an enterprise. Bur any
attempt to involve the structure:
of the administration in a com
munity government could only
lead to frustration and defeat.
The bureaucratic jealousies and
politics involved in such a
change are overwhelming. In
any case those valuable fune
tions which the administration
performs (and there are many)
will survive, others will fade.

ministration" (I am conscious of
Mr. Cuthbertson's criticism of
the use of that term) should not
participate in a community gov
ernment. There are many within

its structure who would respond
to such an enterprise. Bur any
attempt to involve the structure:
of the administration in a com
munity government could only
lead to frustration and defeat.
The bureaucratic jealousies and
politics involved in such a
change are overwhelming. In
any case those valuable fune
tions which the administration
performs (and there are many)
will survive, others will fade.
Thn point of all this is that
what Lyman and Massarenti
propose is not so difficult or far
off as it may seem. It demands
concentration of effort in the
field of education, the close coop
eration of students and faculty,
and ihe active support of a large
number of students.
