# Rumors Discredited
## Candidate Tells Past 
### 
Cesare Massarenti, candidate for
ASSU vice president, yesterday denied
rumors that he has Communist con
nections or has been involved in "ter
rorist activities."
"I have never been a member of
any political party anywhere and can
prove that I have never done any of
these things," he said.
The source of these rumors could
not be determined. All ten candidates
for ASSU office have written letters
to Th«' Daily condemning those re
sponsible for initiating the rumors.
Massarenti, a student at the Uni
versity of Milan from 1959 to 1964,
was involved in the creation of a stu
dent organization independent of na
tional political parties and trade

unions. He received a degree in Eco
nomics in 1964 and came to Stanford
in September 1965 to do graduate
work in Sociology.
In October 1961, he was an official
delegate of the University of Milan
to the student march in Paris urging
independence for Algeria. He never
went to Algeria or participated in the
FLN.
Massarenti said he knew who was
responsible for the rumors, but de
clined to state their names. "I do not
want to cause any more trouble for
anyone," he explained.
He suggested, however, that "if it
appears anyone will be damaged
from the Board of Trustees to the
lowest freshman — then I may have
to tro to court."
