# Lane Cites Evidence Discounting Report From Warren Commission
## 
### 
Speaking to a small but intent aud
ience in the large Tresidder lounge
last night, Rush to Judgment author
Mark Lane sought to prove that the
Warren Commission's "evidence and
conclusions are totally unrelated."
In a preview of today's mock trial
with law professor John Kaplan,
Lane's first remark was that Kaplan
is "either a poor researcher or he is
a liar." He added, "I invite Mr. Kap
lan to sue me."

Quoting Mr. Kaplan as saying that
not a "tenth of his (Lane's) assertions
(in Rush to Judgment) are soundly
based," he said that his publisher had
hired two law firms to investigate
those assertions before publication and
that a leading British law firm had
done the same; and all three agreed
that the assertions were sound.
Lists Facts
Where the Warren Commission says
that "there is no credible evidence that
the bullets (that killed President Ken
nedy) came from other than the sixth
floor of the book depository," Lane
lists six facts that indicate the reverse,
the principal one being amateur
movies that show Kennedy's head ex
ploding in the wrong direction.
Lane also argues that the Commis
sion did not even ask relevant wit
nesses about an alleged puff of smoke,
supposedly coming from a rifle, in
front and to the right of the Kennedy
car.
Kaplan has said that rifles do not
even emit a puff of smoke, but Lane
cites an unpublished letter written by
an FBI agent showing that the murder
weapon does indeed emit a puff of
smoke.
One Puff
According to Lane, Kaplan says that
there could not possibly have been the
amount of smoke that Lane suggests

because the only rifle that emits smoke
is an ancient type. But Lane says he
only indicated one puff seen by seven
witnesses, none of whom testified be
fore the Warren Commission.
Again citing Kaplan, Lane agrees
that Ruby "wasn't the type you'd
choose for a conspiracy," because he
"wasn't rational." Lane smiled at that
and dropped the subject.
The most damning evidence in
Lane's eyes, however, was the testi
mony of a fellow passenger in Ken
nedy's car, Ray Kellerman. The War
ren Commission says that the first
bullet entered the back of Kennedy's
neck (in contradiction to medical testi
mony, he claims). But Kellerman says
he heard the shot foUowod bv Ken
nedy's saying, "My God, I'm hit. My
God, I'm hit." Lane fee's that Kennedy
could not have said that without an
Adam's apple, and that "this alone
proves the Warren Commission report
fraudulent."
Medical Evidence
Lane then turned to medical evi
dence in support of any conclusion.
But, he said, "Physician's autopsy
notes were burned.'
In addition, he said the X-rays are
"locked up in the National Archives;
no member of the Warren Commission
saw them."

Lane presented evidence that the
shots, at least some of them, came
from in front of Kennedy, and that
military physician notes and the testi
mony of Jacqueline Kennedy about
where the bullets seem to have come
from, have been deleted from the rec
ord.
Concluding on bullet contradictions,
Lane stated that it was "difficult to
sustain one assassin when five bullets
were fired in six seconds from two di
rections."
The Weapon
Concerning the weapon used for the
assissination, Lane says that a police
affidavit said it was a German Mauser
727 mm. Twenty-four hours later ac
cording to Lane, the weapon had
changed size and nationality to become
an Italian Manlicher-Carcane Bmm.
Again quoting Kaplan as writing,
"It may seem paradoxical but the
strongest evidence that Oswald was
capable of the shots is the massive
evidence that he did." Lane says that
Oswald was a poor shot, as indicated
by his one time sergeant, and that even
under highly altered conditions three
of the National Rifle Association's best
marksmen could not hit the head or
neck of a dummy even with eighteen
shots.

727 mm. Twenty-four hours later ac
cording to Lane, the weapon had
changed size and nationality to become
an Italian Manlicher-Carcane Bmm.
Again quoting Kaplan as writing,
"It may seem paradoxical but the
strongest evidence that Oswald was
capable of the shots is the massive
evidence that he did." Lane says that
Oswald was a poor shot, as indicated
by his one time sergeant, and that even
under highly altered conditions three
of the National Rifle Association's best
marksmen could not hit the head or
neck of a dummy even with eighteen
shots.
Speaking to a small but intent aud
ience in the large Tresidder lounge
last night, Rush to Judgment author
Mark Lane sought to prove that the
Warren Commission's "evidence and
conclusions are totally unrelated."
In a preview of today's mock trial
with law professor John Kaplan,
Lane's first remark was that Kaplan
is "either a poor researcher or he is
a liar." He added, "I invite Mr. Kap
lan to sue me."

Quoting Mr. Kaplan as saying that
not a "tenth of his (Lane's) assertions
(in Rush to Judgment) are soundly
based," he said that his publisher had
hired two law firms to investigate
those assertions before publication and
that a leading British law firm had
done the same; and all three agreed
that the assertions were sound.
Lists Facts
Where the Warren Commission says
that "there is no credible evidence that
the bullets (that killed President Ken
nedy) came from other than the sixth
floor of the book depository," Lane
lists six facts that indicate the reverse,
the principal one being amateur
movies that show Kennedy's head ex
ploding in the wrong direction.
Lane also argues that the Commis
sion did not even ask relevant wit
nesses about an alleged puff of smoke,
supposedly coming from a rifle, in
front and to the right of the Kennedy
car.
Kaplan has said that rifles do not
even emit a puff of smoke, but Lane
cites an unpublished letter written by
an FBI agent showing that the murder
weapon does indeed emit a puff of
smoke.
One Puff
According to Lane, Kaplan says that
there could not possibly have been the
amount of smoke that Lane suggests

because the only rifle that emits smoke
is an ancient type. But Lane says he
only indicated one puff seen by seven
witnesses, none of whom testified be
fore the Warren Commission.
Again citing Kaplan, Lane agrees
that Ruby "wasn't the type you'd
choose for a conspiracy," because he
"wasn't rational." Lane smiled at that
and dropped the subject.
The most damning evidence in
Lane's eyes, however, was the testi
mony of a fellow passenger in Ken
nedy's car, Ray Kellerman. The War
ren Commission says that the first
bullet entered the back of Kennedy's
neck (in contradiction to medical testi
mony, he claims). But Kellerman says
he heard the shot foUowod bv Ken
nedy's saying, "My God, I'm hit. My
God, I'm hit." Lane fee's that Kennedy
could not have said that without an
Adam's apple, and that "this alone
proves the Warren Commission report
fraudulent."
Medical Evidence
Lane then turned to medical evi
dence in support of any conclusion.
But, he said, "Physician's autopsy
notes were burned.'
In addition, he said the X-rays are
"locked up in the National Archives;
no member of the Warren Commission
saw them."

Lane presented evidence that the
shots, at least some of them, came
from in front of Kennedy, and that
military physician notes and the testi
mony of Jacqueline Kennedy about
where the bullets seem to have come
from, have been deleted from the rec
ord.
Concluding on bullet contradictions,
Lane stated that it was "difficult to
sustain one assassin when five bullets
were fired in six seconds from two di
rections."
The Weapon
Concerning the weapon used for the
assissination, Lane says that a police
affidavit said it was a German Mauser
727 mm. Twenty-four hours later ac
cording to Lane, the weapon had
changed size and nationality to become
an Italian Manlicher-Carcane Bmm.
Again quoting Kaplan as writing,
"It may seem paradoxical but the
