# Lane, Kaplan To Clash In Debate
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Mark Lane and Professor John Kap
lan of the Law School will meet this
afternoon to argue the truthfulness

of Lane's book, liush to Judgment.
The confrontation is scheduled for
2:15 in Dinkelspiel.
Lane proposed a debate two weeks
ago on Kaplan's terms. Kaplan pro
posed a cross-examination format in
which each would question the other
for 45 minutes. The debate would
take the form of a civil trial under
California state law, with Lane suing
Kaplan.
Lane reluctantly agreed to these
terms, pointing out that the "trial" is
not really a debate and will limit the
questioning to too narrow an area.
Kaplan's Criticism
The confrontation came about as
the result of a Daily article about the
publication of Kaplan's article "The
Assassins" in The American Scholar.
Kaplan's article was critical of the
books which attacked the Warren
Commission Report. He was especial
ly critical of Lane's.
Since Lane lives in the Stanford
area, he was asked for a statement
on Kaplan's article. In the statement,
he challenged Kaplan to debate him,
saying Kaplan could "bring his own
rules and his own moderator."
Judge To Moderate
The moderator at today's mock trial
will be Judge Sidney Feinberg of the
Palo Alto Municipal Court. The Stan
ford Law Forum, at the request of
The Daily, searched last week for a
judge to preside today. Judge Fein
berg knows neither Kaplan nor Lane
personally, though he has heard Kap
lan speak before the Santa Clara
County Bar Association and read his
article when it first appeared.
Lane objected to the fact that the
Law Forum looked for the judge. He
said it was The Daily's responsibility
and cited his ciealings with the Law
Forum last fall when it asked him to
appear in a debate with Wesley Lieb
eler. Liebeler is a law professor at
UCLA and worked with the Warren
Commission. Lane's objection, how
ever, is not a barrier to today's mock
trial.
These are the rules which Kaplan

proposed and Lane accepted:
The format will be that of a civil
trial under California law in which
Mr. Lane has sued for libel on the
ground that Professor Kaplan stated
that "Rush to Judgment" is a tissue
of deliberate distortions and, that Pro
fessor Kaplan, assuming the burden
of proof, has pleaded truth.
The participants will be Mr. Mark
Lane and Professor John Kaplan each
of whom will be questioned by the

other for 45 minutes as if on cross
examination. Professor Kaplan, bear
ing the burden of proof, will cross
examine first.
There will be ten minutes allowed
each party for an opening statement
with order to be determined by The
Daily. There will be ten minutes al
lowed each party for a closing state
ment with order to tie determined by
The Daily. The above limitations
will be strictly enforced.

Lane reluctantly agreed to these
terms, pointing out that the "trial" is
not really a debate and will limit the
questioning to too narrow an area.
Kaplan's Criticism
The confrontation came about as
the result of a Daily article about the
publication of Kaplan's article "The
Assassins" in The American Scholar.
Kaplan's article was critical of the
books which attacked the Warren
Commission Report. He was especial
ly critical of Lane's.
Since Lane lives in the Stanford
area, he was asked for a statement
on Kaplan's article. In the statement,
he challenged Kaplan to debate him,
saying Kaplan could "bring his own
rules and his own moderator."
Judge To Moderate
The moderator at today's mock trial
will be Judge Sidney Feinberg of the
Palo Alto Municipal Court. The Stan
ford Law Forum, at the request of
The Daily, searched last week for a
judge to preside today. Judge Fein
berg knows neither Kaplan nor Lane
personally, though he has heard Kap
lan speak before the Santa Clara
County Bar Association and read his
article when it first appeared.
Lane objected to the fact that the
Law Forum looked for the judge. He
said it was The Daily's responsibility
and cited his ciealings with the Law
Forum last fall when it asked him to
appear in a debate with Wesley Lieb
eler. Liebeler is a law professor at
UCLA and worked with the Warren
Commission. Lane's objection, how
ever, is not a barrier to today's mock
trial.
These are the rules which Kaplan

proposed and Lane accepted:
The format will be that of a civil
trial under California law in which
Mr. Lane has sued for libel on the
ground that Professor Kaplan stated
that "Rush to Judgment" is a tissue
of deliberate distortions and, that Pro
fessor Kaplan, assuming the burden
of proof, has pleaded truth.
The participants will be Mr. Mark
Lane and Professor John Kaplan each
of whom will be questioned by the

other for 45 minutes as if on cross
examination. Professor Kaplan, bear
ing the burden of proof, will cross
examine first.
There will be ten minutes allowed
each party for an opening statement
with order to be determined by The
Daily. There will be ten minutes al
lowed each party for a closing state
ment with order to tie determined by
The Daily. The above limitations
will be strictly enforced.
Mark Lane and Professor John Kap
lan of the Law School will meet this
afternoon to argue the truthfulness

of Lane's book, liush to Judgment.
The confrontation is scheduled for
2:15 in Dinkelspiel.
Lane proposed a debate two weeks
ago on Kaplan's terms. Kaplan pro
posed a cross-examination format in
which each would question the other
for 45 minutes. The debate would
take the form of a civil trial under
California state law, with Lane suing
Kaplan.
Lane reluctantly agreed to these
terms, pointing out that the "trial" is
