# ROTC Student Prefers Peace
## 
### JOHN O'BRIEN 
(CPS) — A University of Ken
tucky senior may be the first
ROTC student in the nation to
lose his commission because of
his activities in opposition to the
war in Vietnam.
Don Pratt, a campus leader
and avid opponent of the war,
will not receive a scheduled com
mission as a second lieutenant
in the Army, a source close to
Pratt revealed, due to "an agree
ment between Don and ROTC
officials."
Pratt said he would like to
join the Peace Corps.
It was learned that Pratt
agreed not to press the matter
of an ROTC commission when
confronted by ROTC officials
about his anti-war activities.
When contacted about the al
leged agreement, Pratt said, "I
don't want to embarrass the
ROTC personnel on campus in
any way. Col. Parker (a profes

sor of military science) was
very fair and just about it
I just feel that young men can
best fight for their country in
the Peace Corps."
Pratt stated that he is not a
conscientious objector. He de
clined further comment on the
commission agreement.
A spokesman in the Penta
gon's Policy and Programs
ROTC division in Washington
said that such an agreement is
unique in the history of process
ing and denying commissions.
"This type of situation has
not come to our attention be
fore," the Pentagon spokesman
said. "The usual reason for can
cellation of a commission is in
aptitude which may involve lack
of leadership or some other com
parable problem."
Official Review
The spokesman said that a
"board of officers" on the col
lege campus must recommend

the cancellation to make it of
ficial. All recommendations of
this type are reviewed by the
Department of the Army in
Washington.
ROTC students on other cam
puses have affiliated with groups
opposing the Vietnam war, but
they usually have ceascd their
anti-war activities when warned
by military officials.
A Pentagon report released
earlier this year stated that as
sociation with dissident groups
could endanger a student's
chances of getting a commission
upon graduation.
At the University of Washing
ton in Seattle, some cadets were
collecting information on anti
war groups until asked to cease
the activity by the senior ROTC
instructor, Pentagon officials
stated.
The source close to Pratt said
that at no time did Col. Parker
threaten to withdraw Pratt's

commission if the student did
not cease participation in peace
\igils in Lexington.
Stated the source, who de
clined to be named, "It was pure
ly an agreement between the
two. The only issue involved
here is the military's suppres
sion of free speech and opposi
tion and Col. Parker can only
take orders from the Pentagon
on that."
Col. Parker reportedly told
Pratt that the President (of the
U.S.) is the commander-in-chief
and the military supports him
in not publicly protesting the
policies he sets forth.

ROTC students on other cam
puses have affiliated with groups
opposing the Vietnam war, but
they usually have ceascd their
anti-war activities when warned
by military officials.
A Pentagon report released
earlier this year stated that as
sociation with dissident groups
could endanger a student's
chances of getting a commission
upon graduation.
At the University of Washing
ton in Seattle, some cadets were
collecting information on anti
war groups until asked to cease
the activity by the senior ROTC
instructor, Pentagon officials
stated.
The source close to Pratt said
that at no time did Col. Parker
threaten to withdraw Pratt's

commission if the student did
not cease participation in peace
\igils in Lexington.
Stated the source, who de
clined to be named, "It was pure
ly an agreement between the
two. The only issue involved
here is the military's suppres
sion of free speech and opposi
tion and Col. Parker can only
take orders from the Pentagon
on that."
Col. Parker reportedly told
Pratt that the President (of the
U.S.) is the commander-in-chief
and the military supports him
in not publicly protesting the
policies he sets forth.

(CPS) — A University of Ken
tucky senior may be the first
ROTC student in the nation to
lose his commission because of
his activities in opposition to the
war in Vietnam.
Don Pratt, a campus leader
and avid opponent of the war,
will not receive a scheduled com
mission as a second lieutenant
in the Army, a source close to
Pratt revealed, due to "an agree
ment between Don and ROTC
officials."
Pratt said he would like to
join the Peace Corps.
It was learned that Pratt
agreed not to press the matter
of an ROTC commission when
confronted by ROTC officials
about his anti-war activities.
When contacted about the al
leged agreement, Pratt said, "I
don't want to embarrass the
ROTC personnel on campus in
any way. Col. Parker (a profes

sor of military science) was
very fair and just about it
I just feel that young men can
best fight for their country in
the Peace Corps."
Pratt stated that he is not a
conscientious objector. He de
clined further comment on the
commission agreement.
A spokesman in the Penta
gon's Policy and Programs
ROTC division in Washington
said that such an agreement is
unique in the history of process
ing and denying commissions.
"This type of situation has
not come to our attention be
fore," the Pentagon spokesman
said. "The usual reason for can
cellation of a commission is in
aptitude which may involve lack
of leadership or some other com
parable problem."
