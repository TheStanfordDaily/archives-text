-..PROTEST VIETNAM
ESCALATIONS ersonally & directly
You can send a telegram to the President, your senator(s) or congressman at the special
rate of only 88 cents. Telegrams have been estimated to be extremely more effective than any
other means of communicating your opinion to the government.
The 88 cent rate includes a fifteen word message, plus your signature and return address.
The message is unimportant; what is important is the number of such telegrams the President
receives immediately. A typical message might be, "I wish to register my strong protest against
the recent escalations in Vietnam." It would be better to make up your own statement.
TO SEND:
1. Call Western Union at 323-9421, or after hours call the operator and ask for
"Western Union".
2. Tell them you want to send a "Public Opinion Message" to the President, or whom
ever. They know the appropriate address.
3. Give them your message, signature, and home address.
4. Give them your home phone number. The charge will appear on your next phone
bill. (If you have no phone, they will bill you.)
