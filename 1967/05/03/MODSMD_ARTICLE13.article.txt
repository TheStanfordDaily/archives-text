# Reich Favors Community Of Students, Not Scholars
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Joe Reich and Jeff Kane, can
didates for ASSU President and
Vice President, seek a "commu
nity of students" as opposed to
the concept of a "community of
scholars."
Kane explained, "There is a
basic flaw in the idea that all
professors are anxious to join
forces with students. Many
teach only one class per quarter
and spend most of their time
doing research. The Faculty
Club and faculty rest rooms are
other examples of the faculty's
desire to remain separate."
Puppet Government
The candidates feel that the
present student government is
a "puppet government with tok
en power based on in loco paren
tis." They stressed that at the
present time students are serv
ing the administration and not
students.
"We don't want to work for
the administration. We want to
work with it," Kane said.
If elected Reich and Kane in
tend to transform the student
association into a "lobbying or
ganization or a consumers' union
for greater student discounts."
They would reform LASSU by
reducing its size to approxi
mately fifteen members who
would be elected at large or
from broad constituencies, and
faculty members would be al
lowed to serve on this legisla
ture if elected by students. Kane
emphasized that LASSU should
be a truly representative body.
Another of the Reich-Kane
goals is the redirection of stu
dent funds. They feel that sev
eral allocations such as $6,000

for the Speech Association can
be used to benefit a greater
number of students. They said
that support from all segments
of the student body is vital and
hope "to treat all people as in
dividuals so as not to alienate
any part of the students."
Preserve Unity
Reich said that one of Dave
Harris' mistakes was to his de
cision to criticize fraternities.
"We destroy the effectiveness of
student government when we
start pointing out large blocs of
students and saying, 'You're
bad.' "
Reich added that students who
complain about fraternities
should realize that the basic
fault lies with the administra
tion's failure to provide varied
living opportunities on campus.
Other Proposals
Reich and Kane hope to super
vise the publication of a com
prehensive and well-researched
course evaluation booklet that
would provide guidance for stu
dents and exert pressure on
professors to improve poor cour
ses. They favor the Wilbur Ex
periment and feel it is an im
portant step toward providing di
verse residential facilities. They
would also like open rush to be
permitted at other times during
the academic year.
The coffee house and the Ex
periment should be given per
manent locations, according to
Reich and Kane. Additional pro
posals they hope to implement
include a California Student As
sociation for student discounts
to accomplish what the National
Student Association should be
doing and covering Hoover
Tower with ivy.

periment should be given per
manent locations, according to
Reich and Kane. Additional pro
posals they hope to implement
include a California Student As
sociation for student discounts
to accomplish what the National
Student Association should be
doing and covering Hoover
Tower with ivy.

Joe Reich and Jeff Kane, can
didates for ASSU President and
Vice President, seek a "commu
nity of students" as opposed to
the concept of a "community of
scholars."
Kane explained, "There is a
basic flaw in the idea that all
professors are anxious to join
forces with students. Many
teach only one class per quarter
and spend most of their time
doing research. The Faculty
Club and faculty rest rooms are
other examples of the faculty's
desire to remain separate."
Puppet Government
The candidates feel that the
present student government is
a "puppet government with tok
en power based on in loco paren
tis." They stressed that at the
present time students are serv
ing the administration and not
students.
"We don't want to work for
the administration. We want to
work with it," Kane said.
If elected Reich and Kane in
tend to transform the student
association into a "lobbying or
ganization or a consumers' union
for greater student discounts."
They would reform LASSU by
reducing its size to approxi
mately fifteen members who
would be elected at large or
from broad constituencies, and
faculty members would be al
lowed to serve on this legisla
ture if elected by students. Kane
emphasized that LASSU should
be a truly representative body.
Another of the Reich-Kane
goals is the redirection of stu
dent funds. They feel that sev
eral allocations such as $6,000

for the Speech Association can
be used to benefit a greater
number of students. They said
that support from all segments
of the student body is vital and
hope "to treat all people as in
dividuals so as not to alienate
any part of the students."
Preserve Unity
Reich said that one of Dave
Harris' mistakes was to his de
cision to criticize fraternities.
"We destroy the effectiveness of
student government when we
start pointing out large blocs of
students and saying, 'You're
bad.' "
Reich added that students who
complain about fraternities
should realize that the basic
fault lies with the administra
tion's failure to provide varied
living opportunities on campus.
Other Proposals
Reich and Kane hope to super
vise the publication of a com
prehensive and well-researched
course evaluation booklet that
would provide guidance for stu
dents and exert pressure on
professors to improve poor cour
ses. They favor the Wilbur Ex
periment and feel it is an im
portant step toward providing di
verse residential facilities. They
would also like open rush to be
permitted at other times during
the academic year.
The coffee house and the Ex
periment should be given per
manent locations, according to
Reich and Kane. Additional pro
posals they hope to implement
include a California Student As
sociation for student discounts
