# STANFORD UNIVERSITY
## SPRING ELECTION—1967 Lyman: Recognize Interests 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Peter Lyman and Cesare Mas
sarenti believe that Stanford's
future as an educational com
munity lies in the cooperation of
students and faculty in forming
a community of scholars. Effec
tive change in the University
can only be accomplished when
students and faculty recognize
their interests and act accord
ing to their ideals.
They propose radical changes
in the educational structure to
allow students and faculty to
assume the responsibility for
"creating conditions which will
allow, not obstruct, our educa
tion."
"The most important thing is
that students, working to realize
the ideal of the University and
acting according to their prin
ciples, be able to structure their
education from among a va
riety of options," says Lyman.
The ideal of a residence univer
sity should be implemented in
this way: "We shall encourage
and fully support the unilateral
decisions of living groups to
transform themselves. We do

not seek the creation of a 'per
fect residence' to be copied by
all others. We demand only that
the diversity of choice become
a greater number of real alter
natives. Let the residents of
each living group, in full respon
sibility, deal with their residence
as they will."
Responsibility For Action
The principles which should
determine all policy are those of
the Fundamental Standard: per
sonal responsibility and hon
esty on the part of all members
of the community. From the
responsibility to one's own edu
cation comes the responsibility
to demand the opportunities for
better learning; and not only to
demand them, but to work ac
tively for the creation of those
opportunities.
"Very simply," they say, "we
demand that the University dem
onstrate the professed commit
ment to its ideal. We have sign
ed the Fundamental Standard
and we accept fully its obliga
tions. As well, we demand that
University 'philosophy' and pol
icy become one."

Educational Proposals
Concerning SES, Lyman and
Massarenti propose public hear
ings on important issues; giv
ing the SES the power to sub
poena any witnesses, including
trustees; and the use of a refer
endum of students and faculty
to ratify SES proposals.
In giving students more re
sponsibility for the structure of
their education, they propose a
revision of General Studies, the
establishment of a Department
of Interdisciplinary Studies of
fering self-designed majors, and
the creation of a student-finan
ced, student-elected Stanford
Chair for Teaching.
"The real University consists
of those actively involved in
education, the students and fac
ulty," they say.

Peter Lyman and Cesare Mas
sarenti believe that Stanford's
future as an educational com
munity lies in the cooperation of
students and faculty in forming
a community of scholars. Effec
tive change in the University
can only be accomplished when
students and faculty recognize
their interests and act accord
ing to their ideals.
They propose radical changes
in the educational structure to
allow students and faculty to
assume the responsibility for
"creating conditions which will
allow, not obstruct, our educa
tion."
"The most important thing is
that students, working to realize
the ideal of the University and
acting according to their prin
ciples, be able to structure their
education from among a va
riety of options," says Lyman.
The ideal of a residence univer
sity should be implemented in
this way: "We shall encourage
and fully support the unilateral
decisions of living groups to
transform themselves. We do

not seek the creation of a 'per
fect residence' to be copied by
all others. We demand only that
the diversity of choice become
a greater number of real alter
natives. Let the residents of
each living group, in full respon
sibility, deal with their residence
as they will."
Responsibility For Action
The principles which should
determine all policy are those of
the Fundamental Standard: per
sonal responsibility and hon
esty on the part of all members
of the community. From the
responsibility to one's own edu
cation comes the responsibility
to demand the opportunities for
better learning; and not only to
demand them, but to work ac
tively for the creation of those
opportunities.
"Very simply," they say, "we
demand that the University dem
onstrate the professed commit
ment to its ideal. We have sign
ed the Fundamental Standard
and we accept fully its obliga
tions. As well, we demand that
University 'philosophy' and pol
icy become one."
