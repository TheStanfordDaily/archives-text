# Representation Key-Hansen
## 
### MAGGIE MeCOMAS 
Pete Hansen and F or res t
Church advocate a student gov
ernment with a broader base of
representation whose officers
would maintain strong contact
with the whole student body.
A first-year student in the
Graduate School of Business,
Hansen views the University as
serving two functions: first, its
role in aiding the development
of the individual and providing
a liberal education and secondly,
its function in giving students
professional training.
Both candidates will be living
on-campus next year. They feel
that this will keep them from be
ing "out of contact" with their
constituency.
Disrespectful 'Left'
Hansen feels that students
have recently been alienated by
"strong ideologies" of student
leaders, "it's a sad thing that
the radical left says that people
in the University must com
municate and have an inter
change of ideas, while, at the
same time, they have been the
most guilty of disrespect for

other people's viewpoints," said
Hansen.
Their platform includes a re
vision of the grading system
which would abolish recorded
grades for freshman year.
Church, a freshman, said that
the present deferred grading sys
tem is a "step in the right direc
tion," but that it has worked
badly because "the whole sys
tem is not geared that way."
Hansen criticized the present
pass-fail system because "it
doesn't give the necessary feed
back" to indicate how students
are progressing in their courses.
He calls for an abolishment of
all recorded grades and the free
dom for professors and instruc
tor to choose the method of
grading best suitable to give the
students an indication of their
progress.
Home For Experiment
The Hansen-Church platform
proposes a permanent home for
The Experiment. Hansen em
phasized however that the edu
cational and political activities
of The Experiment should be
segregated. "The Experiment
has made a mistake by alienat

ing people because of their polit
ical views," he said. He sug
gested that the persons directing
The Experiment not withdraw
from political activity, but that
they assure that their political
activity doesn't limit the types
of persons participating in the
seminars.
The candidates suggest more
cooperation with the administra
tion, made possible through stu
dent government officers who
represent the majority of the
student body.
Hansen emphasized that the
administration and faculty are
more permanent members of
the University community than
the students, and that it is up
to the student government to
convince the administration of
the long-range benefits of pro
posed changes. "The trustees
shouldn't be involved in actual
administration of the Univers
ity, since they have no direct
knowledge of events," he said.
Their role should be to hire com
petent administrators to make
administrative decisions rather
than making them themselves."

change of ideas, while, at the
same time, they have been the
most guilty of disrespect for

other people's viewpoints," said
Hansen.
Their platform includes a re
vision of the grading system
which would abolish recorded
grades for freshman year.
Church, a freshman, said that
the present deferred grading sys
tem is a "step in the right direc
tion," but that it has worked
badly because "the whole sys
tem is not geared that way."
Hansen criticized the present
pass-fail system because "it
doesn't give the necessary feed
back" to indicate how students
are progressing in their courses.
He calls for an abolishment of
all recorded grades and the free
dom for professors and instruc
tor to choose the method of
grading best suitable to give the
students an indication of their
progress.
Home For Experiment
The Hansen-Church platform
proposes a permanent home for
The Experiment. Hansen em
phasized however that the edu
cational and political activities
of The Experiment should be
segregated. "The Experiment
has made a mistake by alienat

ing people because of their polit
ical views," he said. He sug
gested that the persons directing
The Experiment not withdraw
from political activity, but that
they assure that their political
activity doesn't limit the types
of persons participating in the
seminars.
The candidates suggest more
cooperation with the administra
tion, made possible through stu
dent government officers who
represent the majority of the
student body.
Hansen emphasized that the
administration and faculty are
more permanent members of
the University community than
the students, and that it is up
to the student government to
convince the administration of
the long-range benefits of pro
posed changes. "The trustees
shouldn't be involved in actual
administration of the Univers
ity, since they have no direct
knowledge of events," he said.
Their role should be to hire com
petent administrators to make
administrative decisions rather
than making them themselves."
Pete Hansen and F or res t
Church advocate a student gov
ernment with a broader base of
representation whose officers
would maintain strong contact
with the whole student body.
A first-year student in the
Graduate School of Business,
Hansen views the University as
serving two functions: first, its
role in aiding the development
of the individual and providing
a liberal education and secondly,
its function in giving students
professional training.
Both candidates will be living
on-campus next year. They feel
that this will keep them from be
ing "out of contact" with their
constituency.
Disrespectful 'Left'
Hansen feels that students
have recently been alienated by
"strong ideologies" of student
leaders, "it's a sad thing that
the radical left says that people
in the University must com
municate and have an inter
change of ideas, while, at the
same time, they have been the
most guilty of disrespect for

other people's viewpoints," said
Hansen.
