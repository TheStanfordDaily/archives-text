# Shanahan: Raising The Issues
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
"We don't want this election
to be an acceptance or a rejec
tion of David Harris because he
was a raiser of issues and we
want to see issues continue to
be raised," stated Tom Shana
han, candidate for ASSU Presi
dent.
Shanahan continued, "Its a
mistake to run student body
elections on the basis of 'right
versus left.' We are addressing'
ourselves to the tension betw
radicals and conservativ
tension between the world the
university and the outside."
Shanahan and his running
mate, Henry Levinson, explain
ed that they represent different
national political stands, but
that they agree on what has to
be done at Stanford.
Overcome Images
"We don't want to make the
tension that will always exist, an
obstacle to smart minds," Lev
inson said. "If we can be more
successful at getting around
the image problem that exists
at Stanford â€” the frat man ver
sus the young liberal. If gov
ernment reflects that, you have
trouble. Our friendship will pro
vide a way to work together
around those problems."

When asked about his philo
sophy of education, Shanahan
replied that there is a tendency
to define education according
to one's personal values. "If
Stanford is to be truly respon
sive to smart and motivated peo
ple, then the University should
embrace the largest possible
system and should in no way
eliminate skill acquisition as
part of the educational process."
Levinson added that finding
nc s identity "in terms of the
role one will eventually play in
society" is an inherent part of
education. "The greatest crime
in our educational system is ac
tively worrying about other peo
ple's identity crises," Levinson
concluded.
Increase Communication
Shanahan stressed that he
would move for the expansion
of student-faculty committees in
all academic departments. He
feels that LASSU and the Aca
demic Council should be unified.
He and Levinson would begin

implementing their ideas this
summer by open applications
for specific jobs such as study
ing room and board bills, and
admission policies.
"It seems obvious that we
haven't taken advantage of the
financial and legal freedom we
have to work without the Uni
versity. Student government
could hire a guest professor, ini
tiate intensive study programs,
and increase student discounts,"
Shanahan said.
No Paranoia
"Many of Harris's ideas could
be carried out by someone who
conforms more to the alumni's
image. But because he chose to
be controversial, he couldn't get
beyond the paranoid reaction to
his appearance. Off campus is
sues may harm on-campus con
cerns . . . We won't compromise
our effectiveness here."
Shanahan summarized, "We
must move student government
into the decision-making proc
ess, and I'm far from convinced
that LASSU is the best way."
