# Schaefer Aims Attack At Berkeley Image, 'New Left'
## 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
The main goal of Fritz Schaef
er and his running mate Gene
Cubbison in their campaign for
ASSU presidency is to remove
from the University the stigma
of the New Left and the Berke
ley image.
They also desire to provide
each student with both a diver
sity of choice in living groups
and more services.
Representative Government
To remove the left wing from
the dominant position in student
government, Schaefer feels that
major reforms in LASSU are
necessary. Believing that repre
sentative student government is
essential to this end, Schaefer
has submitted two bills to Legi
slature, one provides for a ra
tio of one representative for
every 200 students, the other re
organizes the graduate student
constituencies.
At present LASSU is run by
a small minority of Stanford stu
dents, thus making the govern
ment unrepresentative of the en
tire student body, feels Schaefer.
Philosophy of Education
To Schaefer, the University
should provide a climate for the
individual in which he can de
velop his intellect to the fullest,
rather than trying to push his
development to the left as is
presently being done.
To achieve this free climate,
Schaefer feels students must
protest by voting for something
other than a left-wing oriented
student government. Schaefer
believes that the university is a
place to prepare for a part in
society.
Thus, to distinguish between
true learning and training is im
possible, Schaefer points out, for
an education, by its very nature,
is a training for life in society.

It is also, he says, imperative for
the students to work with the
administration.
Schaefer is against the imme
diate confrontation, the instant
protest; "If we first find out
what we want — by represent
ative government — then take it
to the administration, I have
confidence that we will receive
favorable action," Schaefer
notes.
More Choice In Housing
Diversity is the key to Schaef
er's housing program. It is neces
sary to have a variety of hous
ing because of the variety of
needs of the student body.
He feels that experimental
coed living, as exemplified by
the Grove House, is a positive
step by the university, however
we must not eliminate other
forms of living, such as frater
nities or independent living, in
the process.
Student Service
At present Schaefer finds that
student services are nonexist
ant. Trivial complaints like junk
mail and more student discounts
in the area are definitely within
the scope of student govern
ment.
Schaefer said that he would
try to bring this within the
realm of government here at
Stanford.
A Choice For Stanford
Schaefer feels that his candi
dacy offers an opportunity for
Stanford students to institute a
representative student govern
ment. A government that works
for the benefit of the students,
rather than for some cause or
small minority group, a govern
ment that offers a free climate
for the intellectual growth of
the individual.
