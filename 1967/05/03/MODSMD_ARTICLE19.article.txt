## Tour de Wilbur? Golfers Lose 4th; Fall To Spartans 
### BOB FINGER 
The Indian golf team dropped
its fourth match of the season,
16M>-10 1 2, to San Jose State last
Saturday on the Stanford Golf
'ourse.
•■iford had lost to San Jose
by an identical score on
its opponents home course
two weeks before, but was un
able to win more than two out
of six individual matches or do
better than tie one best ball
match.
Low for the Tribe were Greg
Pitzer, Lov Martin and Dick Har
ris, all with 78's. Sandy Adel
man and Bob Bouchier fired 79's.
Though the course was wet
and windy, conditions were not
as bad as those for the USC
meet last week, nor bad enough
to warrent the worst Tribe show
ing of the season. Medalist hon
ors for ttye meet was won with
a 77, though a Sari Jose State
freshman carded a 76 with a
triple bogey.
Point-wise Harris and Bou
chier took two out of three,
Martin V6, and the others took
one a piece.
The freshman golfers easily
defeated the San Jose State
freshman last Saturday on the
Stanford Golf Course, 19V2-7M:,
as only one opponent broke 85.
Terry Mcßride and Jose Par
sons both fired 77's. The frosh
now hold an 8-2 season record.
