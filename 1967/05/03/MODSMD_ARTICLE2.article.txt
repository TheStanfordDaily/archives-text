## The 						Paranoid Style In ASSU Politics 
### 
The ASSU presidential campaign has been a great disappoint
ment.
Despite the legitimate efforts of some to discuss significant issues,
others in the University felt it more important to expend
their energy in vicious attacks on candidates and other individuals
who have varying connections with today's contest. Those respon
sible for the attacks have accomplished nothing positive; they have
hurt a number of people and one can only wonder why. Certainly,
they did not succeed in promoting anyone's campaign or in pre
senting facts essential to the issues.
Yesterday's anonymous leaflets were not an isolated incident;
instead they were the culmination of a campaign in which an un
fortunate combination of paranoia and irresponsibility led people
to perform actions whose significance they did not consider and
whose consequences they do not understand. Other examples this
week, most notably that of spreading unfounded rumors about the
political affiliations of one candidate, have been equally vicious and
indicative of the disease that has characterized this campaign.
One of the purposes of any campaign, in addition to offering can
didates for election, is to promote the discussion of issues and ideas.
But this has hardly been done in this contest, although the diver
sity among candidates was great enough to provide a veritable
supermarket of ideas.
At no time in recent years has there been more potential for
effective student involvement in the affairs of the University. The
Study of Education will make reforms which can greatly affect
Stanford's future. Some candidates have realized this and, although
their viewpoints have been different, they have had in common
an intense interest in the student's role next year. Why then, at
such a critical time, must the issues of this election be so completely
obscured that only personal attacks can be counted on to sway
votes?
The answer is that an unhealthy element is emerging in this
University. Whereas those who are apathetic and do not care for
the future of this institution used to keep silent, they have now be
come outspoken. They have become resentful and fearful of those
whose interest and commitment have won them positions of respect
and influence. In short, they are suffering from a dangerous form
of political paranoia.
Stanford, supposedly an intellectual community, should be able
to conduct an electoral contest on a higher level than one might
expect elsewhere. The importance of today's election cannot be
overemphasized. We hope all students will carefully read the inter
views and platform statements in today's Daily and elect candi
dates on their own merits rather than on the basis of irresponsible
personal attacks.
