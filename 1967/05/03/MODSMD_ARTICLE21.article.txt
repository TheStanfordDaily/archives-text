# The
						'In-Crowd'... Fact Or Figment?
## 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Tuesday morning I was sur
prised to find a number of hand
bills posted around Wilbur that
attacked Peter Lyman on the
basis of his connection with the
"Grove - Beta Chi machine."
These handbills, signed only
"Students for Free Elections,"
also attempted to implicate The
Daily in a sort of conspiracy
to "subvert" the presidential
election. They describe a group,
which they term the "in-crowd"
(The Daily, Grove House, and
Beta Chi), as a "small, power
hungry faction." Cited as ex
amples of this subversive con
spiracy are the large number of
Beta Chi members connected
with the Grove House and The
Daily, editor Henry Muller's
Beta Chi membership, and Peter
Lyman's tutorship in the Grove
Project.
Surely these "students for free
elections" (who, in addition to
being against Lyman, must sup
port someone) ought to realize
that membership in Beta Chi and
Grove House is a manifestation
of, and not necessarily a cause
for, concern about education.
People who believe in the need
for change and for the imple
mentation of an educational phil
osophy at Stanford are attracted
by Beta Chi and Grove Project
because these two living groups
are probably the most education
oriented ones on campus, and
come closest to their ideal. These
students are actively concerned
about the university; the fact
that they are anxious to express
their views through campus po
litical involvement and Daily
columns should surprise no one.
Rather than frantically search
ing for a conspiracy behind
their involvement, perhaps these
students should examine the
philosophy of education that
drives Peter Lyman and other
"in-crowd" members to work
actively for a better university.

So what if the ASSU is run by
an in-crowd?

• Come Out Of Hiding
Editor, The Daily:
This letter, written in anger
and frustration, is in response to
an unsigned handbill claiming
Peter Lyman is the center of
a "small power-hungry faction"
purportedly composed of the

Daily, Grove House, and Beta
Chi fraternity.
I am not a member of the
"In-Group", not a member of
Beta Chi, not a member of
Grove project, nor on the Daily
staff. But I have acquaintances
in all of these groups, except
the first, which does not exist.
I do, however, know Peter Ly
man rather well, having lived
with him last year. I also know
those who are working with him
in this campaign. They are not
a "clique" in any sense of the
word, and Peter is not the cen
ter of a "power-hungry faction".
Peter Lyman is, in fact, the cen
ter of no faction, no conspiracy,
no "In-Crowd". Anyone who
knows him would either deny
these accusations immediately
or laugh at their absurdity.
I'm tired of laughing. Attack
ing a candidate by avoiding the
issues and fabricating a plot
that does not exist is the product
of a sick mentality. Slandering
a candidate personally is a des
perate and despicable move. Ac
cusing anyone without revealing
your own identity is the act of
a coward.
Peter Lyman is one of the few
true individuals on the campus,
and in a society that encourages
the psychology of sheep. Those
who do not know this could not
know him, could not have
listened to him. I urge whoever
wrote this paranoid pastichc of
"facts" and allegation, if he, she,
or they have any honor, to let
the campus know who they are.

• Here They Are
Editor, The Daily:
Last night a recently formed
organization, Students for Free
Elections (SFE), posted material
critical of Mr. Peter Lyman,
candidate for ASSU president. It
was posted in a number of resi
dences, including Branner, Wil
bur, Stern, and Lagunita.
This material was immedi
ately, methodically, removed
from all of the above-named resi
dences. In particular, a Mr. Paul
Rupert, was apprehended in
Stern in the act of so doing. Mr.
Rupert has been active in Mr.
Lyman's campaign. In KZSU's
election forum, for example, he
was sent to speak in Lyman's
stead. A complaint was made,
and Rupert and others returned
some of the material.
Mr. Mitchell of SFE contacted
"Chick" Fritz (sic) in Grove
who is working in the campaign.

Mr. Fritz told him that he "could
assume that no more material
would be torn down." Nonethe
less various sections of Wilbur
were stripped of material after
the call.
Such behavior is a more fla
grant example of the reasons
why the group attacked Mr. Ly
man in the first place.
SFE is not endorsed by any
candidate, nor does it endorse
any.

• Don't Forget Mel!
Editor, The Daily:
Speaking out in complete
agreement with the facts on the
most recent Stanford white
paper, "The In-Crowd," I would
like to say that the conclusions
are so misleading that any mem
ber of Beta Chi, The Daily, or
The Grove can only laugh at the
whole thing. A few facts that
the writers of "The In-Crowd"
forgot were that Mel Knox, a
power-hungry member of Beta
Chi, is running for Senior Class
President, that professors and
administrators often visit Beta
Chi and The Grove and encour
age the power-grabbing which is
taking root there, and that
Younger, a Beta Chi disguised
as a dog, is one of the leading
candidates for Con Home King.
It is almost amusing to me when
I consider that my living group
has just spanned the entire in
volvement spectrum in a few
short weeks. We have risen from
our characteristic level of apathy
to a power clique. I really think
the authors of "The In-Crowd"
should hire a Pinkerton agent.
A private investigator might un
cover even more; Beta Chi, The
Daily, and The Grove probably
also have secret ties with the
CIA and the Communist Party.

• Come Now!
Editor, The Daily:
I feel that I must at last come
out of my anti-political shell to
protest the recent appearance
of a sheet entitled "The In-
Crowd," put out by a group call
ing themselves "Students for
Free Elections," at various
places around campus (such as
the Cedro head, which was prac
tically wallpapered with them).
This piece is the biggest pile
of bullroar I have ever seen. It
postulates the existence of a
massive conspiracy, led by the
Daily, the Grove House, and
Beta Chi, to betray the interests
of the "true" Stanford students
and "hopes to perpetuate its
power clique through the elec
tion of Peter Lyman to ASSU
President."
It proceeds to "prove" that
several prominent campus per
sonalities (read "subversives")
are related to two or more of
these groups and that they are
all parts of a political machine
which operates through a Daily
conspiracy of silence to the dis
advantage of the other "true
candidates." It decries the "ego
ism of a small, power-hungry
faction," and calls for the elec
tion of "legitimate student rep
resentatives.") "Must the elec
tion be subverted?" it asks.
"Will the dominance of The Daily
prevent other, true candidates
from being heard?" (Will Bat
man save us next week?) My
God! And the sponsors of this
unreasoned attack hide behind
the name "Students for Free
Elections"— refuse to identify
themselves further. I cannot be
lieve that any other candidate
is behind these actions, but I
hope that such misguided sup

porters will be censured. What
shocks me the most, however,
is 'iif- realization <Vit as a Beta
Chi pledge, I am a member of
this power elite. As anyone who
knows me can testily, I am
about the least political, least
power-hungry person in exist
ence.
To quote a well-esteemed
friend, who will remain immor
tal and annonymous: "Talk loud
er, gentlemen. Your voices are
echoing in your rectums. Re
move thy heads."

• KZSU Clarifies
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to express my great
distress over a poster being cir

culated in my name concerning
the current ASSU elections. Dur
ing a recent interview with Mr.
Shanahan on KZSU I did ask
Mr. Shanahan about his position
on OFF. I feel that Mr. Shana
han replied honestly and with
candor. However. I did not give
anyone permission to use my
name in connection with any
poster campaign directed
against Mr. Shanahan's position
on OFF. I would suggest that if
students wish to learn of Tom
Shanahan's position on OFF,
that they ask Mr. Shanahan
himself and not any second
party.
