# ASSU Candidates Present Platforms
## 
### CHARLES BELL 
• Hansen-Church
We believe, as most of the
candidates do, that student in
volvement is central to creating
a University community and an
atmosphere conducive to per
sonal discovery through the ex
change of diverse viewpoints,
but we differ on what is the
best means of achieving these
ends. We do not agree with the
concept of student power. There
is no inherent power in ASSU.
If student power is supposed
to mean student force, we reject
the idea as not being the most
effective way of accomplishing
our goals. First, we doubt that
most Stanford students are will
ing to mobilize against the ad
ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary
gain that might be achieved by
rebelling students would be off
set by destroying lines of com
munication necessary for stu
dents to constructively negotiate
with the faculty and the admini
stration.
We substitute instead the con
cept of student influence, and it
must be a powerful and effec
tive influence. We do not see the
administration and students as
adversaries. We expect them to
be typically diverse elements of
the community who must be
willing to deal with each other
if any "community" is going to
be established and positive
changes made.
Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing
student influence is to have an
ASSU that is representative of
the students, not just a single
faction. Students are not going
to come to the ASSU President
to get involved, especially if he
represents a narrow philosophy
that excludes many of them. The
President will have to go to
them. He will have to attend
IFC, ICC, IHC, Wilbur council,
and graduate association meet
ings. He must encourage stu
dents to participate in solving
their own problems by co-ordi
nating and channeling their ef
forts.
By polarizing the student
government, radicals versus con
servatives, eventually we are
going to see the system, with
all the benefits it can provide in
creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat
ing a community of scholars
that includes faculty and stu
dents, but destroying what little
"community" of students we
now have. A community of stu
dents will depend on a rational
discussion between different
groups of students, based on
a respect for each other's opin
ions and purposes for being at
the University. There is no pos
sibility for rational discussion if
either side begins with the be
lief that they are absolutely
right and the time for debate
is past.
No one philosophy of educa
tion will be acceptable to all
students, and we feel tlr' a
united student philosophy i
a necessary ingredient v.j ac
complishing any positive change
at Stanford. We would submit
that many of the changes that
are being considered such as
coed housing and grading re
form do not necessarily have to
be limited to one philosophy of
education, thereby crystalizing
opposition becausc it is too nar
rowly defined.
To be legitimate, student gov
ernment must be representative.
It must speak for you, not to
you.

• Lyman-Mnasarenti
Present University education
is the capstone of a well-defined
process of socialization, training,
and inculcation in which indivi
duals learn to fill pre-determined
roles and make correct behavior
responses. In understanding edu
cation to be training, the Uni
versity is preparing the student
neither to live a creative life nor
to fulfill his responsibilities as
a citizen. Not only is it futile to
train students for roles which
may not exist in the future, but
it is debasing to reduce the defi
nition of the student to his so
cial function, e.g., engineer or
historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
fully understands his potential
and his freedom to choose a
role. Education, as it is now de
fined, threatens the student in
precisely those areas in which a
true education would develop
him: how to apply his intelli
gence to the world; how to re-

late honestly to others; how to
fulfill his needs to be creative;
how to live a sane life in a
rapidly changing society.
We can no longer afford to
ignore our interests. The follow
ing sketch of a community gov
ernment is a realistic alterna
tive to the disintegrated present.
The students and faculty will
each elect twenty-five represen
tatives to a community senate.
It would preside over a merger
of student, faculty and admini
strative investigative and initiat
ing committees. The senate will
find its support in the town
meeting, a convention of all stu
dents, graduate and undergradu
ate, scientific and artistic, satis
fied and dissatisfied. In these
large meetings students will rep
resent themselves to themselves
and to their fellows on the fac
ulty. Issues of importance to
the entire University must be
resolved by the community;
Stanford cannot afford nor
should it afford the mockery
of representative forms when it
can enjoy the luxury and fitness
of participatory democracy.
With the resolution and direct
ness available to the senate the
responsibility and comprehen
siveness of town meetings, the
students of Stanford will be firm
without being hostile, respon
sible without being dulled, con
cerned but not careless. The for
cefulness implicit in fair de
mands will emerge, and the Uni
versity will move for the better
ment of us all.
We do not seek the creation
of a "perfect residence" to be
copied by all others. We demand
only that the diversity of choice
become a greater number of real
alternatives, not the present
variations on a cell-block theme.
Let the residents of each living
group, in full responsibility, deal
with their residence as they will.
Thus, fraternities will be able to
exploit their full potential as
small, well-housed, autonomous
groups; a Stern house and a
house in Lagunita may wish to
exchange floors; and we can
attempt a co-op. In short, we
shall assess our needs and fill
them imaginatively.

• Reich-Kane
We seek a community of stu
dents. The concept of a "com
munity of scholars" is appealing
but unrealistic. Undergraduates
simply do not have the wide
spread faculty support and re
spect which would be necessary.
We must build a strong com
munity of students before we
can build a community of schol
ars.
The present student associa
tion, as defined in the ASSU
Constitution, is based on the con
cept of in loco parentis. The
Board of Trustees has granted
the students certain "privileges
and responsibilities." Student
government is structured like a
company union. It is a puppet
government, a government with
no real power.
We maintain that students
have certain rights. To assert
these rights, the ASSU must be
made a lobbying organization, a
bargaining power, a consumer's
union.
Restructure LASSU
We advocate a basic restruc
turing of LASSU. At present,

The Daily asked each of the five ASSU presidential candidates
to submit a platform statement written by himself or a supporter.

the student legislature has more
members than the United States
Senate. A new legislature, com
posed of about fifteen members,
would be both more representa
tive and more effective. Also,
faculty members should be per
mitted to serve if elected by stu
dents.
Students must recognize when
they are being used by the Ad
ministration. There is a differ
ence between working with and
working for the Administration.
We seek support from all seg
ments of the student body. Spe
cifically, it is wrong to condemn
fraterities as a group. Students
should be treated as individuals,
and each fraternity should be
treated as an individual living
group. Also, we feel graduate
students can make significant
contributions to the student as
sociation.
Alumni Contact
We seek closer contact with
the alumni. At present, their
only formal contact with the
University is through the Ad
ministration. They should be in
formed of student views by a
student-written newsletter. Stu
dnnt speakers should attend
alumni dinners.
We need a good course evalu
ation booklet. Last year, with a
budget of $114,500.00, the legis
lature appropriated only $850.00
for a Scratch Sheet. You get
what you pay for, if you're
lucky. Course evaluation de
serves more money.
We need a union which will
get students discounts in local
stores, at ski resorts, etc. We
favor a permanent location for
the Experiment. Students want
a coffee house. We suggest it
be located atop Hoover Tower
and the Tower be covered with
ivy.
This campaign has raised
many issues which divide stu
dents, but certain goals are com
mon to all. This election is not
an end, but rather a beginning.
It is a time for all students to
assume an active role in student
affairs. We must unite behind
the new President if we are to
realize those goals we all share.

• SrU son
Fritz Schaefer and Gene Cub
bison are working to involve all
11,000 Stanford students in the
of <student government.
Their platform is:
Reform Of The Student
legislature
Fritz Schaefer, as a minority
voice in LASSU, has introduced
two bills to make the Legislature
representative. The first changes
the numbers of seats in LASSU
to 60 by providing for one repre
sentative for every 200 students.
This would give real importance
to LASSU seats and bring in
opinions from all sectors of the
university. The second bill
breaks down the graduate stu
dent constituencies into smaller,
workable units, one such being
the graduate Electrical Engi
neers, having 3 representatives
under the new system.
Educational Improvement
Schaefer and Cubbison feel
that the purpose of the univer
sity is to provide a climate in
which the individual student can
develop his academic interests
in those directions which he so
chooses.
They propose a permanent, ac
tive ASSU committee to investi
gate the quality of teaching at
Stanford. The purposes of this
committee would be 1) to pro
vide student feedback to instruc
tors and professors and 2) to
bring to reality the long express
ed student opinion that teaching
ability should be a definite fac
tor in decisions on academic
promotion.
Pass-fail meets a very real
need in providing a student with
an opportunity to broaden the
scope of his education by tak
ing a course in an area in which,
because of his background, he
feels unable to compete. Schaef
er and Cubbison favor the allo
cation of 15 units of general
studies requirements to each
student on a pass-fail basis.
Residences
The key to a successful hous
ing arrangement at Stanford is
to provide each student with a
choice from a diversity of attrac
tive possibilities. Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the elimination
of any of the present living
groups at Stanford. They wel
come the coed dorms as another
attractive possibility for Stan
ford students. They feel that in
dependents and freshmen should
be given the opportunity to have
the type of housing which sets
off the new fraternity clusters.
The need for liveable on-cam
pus housing for graduate stu
dents must be considered.
Schaefer and Cubbison propose
the more or less immediate con
struction of a number of small
graduate student houses for
single grad students. This would
also enable Escondido Village
to house more married students.
Experiment, Athletics, ROTO
Since, in practice, the Experi
ment now serves primarily as
a vehicle for one-sided political
indoctrination, Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the use of stu
dent funds by the Experiment.
They also oppose giving a per
manent home to the Experiment,
the Young Republicans, or any
other political group.
The chief problem with inter
collegiate athletics at Stanford is
that not enough enthusiastic
fans show up lor the football
games.
ROTC meets the needs of a
considerable number of stu
dents and should not be subject
ed to the unwarranted abuse
that it is presently receiving.

• Sharmhan-Levinjson

Yes, it's ASSU election time
again, that symbolic event of
Spring when hypocrisy is re
vealed in its most blatant forms,
when opportunism rises freely
to the surface and when endless
catechisms are intoned over the
absurdity of it all; some agitat
ors even go so far as to question
"why" the unwanted bastard,
ASSU, fathered and foisted upon
us by a shameless Administra
tion, should be allowed to exist.
And who should appear out of
the blue, according to exclusive
Daily coverage, but the sensi
tive and aware Candidate, eager
to point the way to the Real
University and perhaps at the
real university. When He speaks,
"spontaneous" crowds gather at
his feet and applaud. Other
"candidates" address themselves
to His positions . . . and He shall
be known by His White Papers.
Surely He is not to be denied!
But this Phenomenon is by no
means unique. Indeed, His ideas
as well as those of the other
candidates are rehashings of the
Presidential campaigns of the
past few years, with certain
relevant modifications on the
Wilbur Experiment, the Packer
Committee and OFF!
Platforms Similar
If differences between the
platforms are illusory, and I be
lieve they are, then much more
meaningful distinctions can be
made between the candidates.
Because student government
should exist to facilitate, not
merely to advocate, goals set
forth in platforms at election
time, the student body must in
sure that the President it
chooses will present a coherent
plan for dealing effectively with
rocklike administrative struc
tures, with diffident and apathet
ic students and with hesitant, if
willing, faculty members.
Experienced
There are two candidates run
ning for ASSU President and
ASSU Vice-President who have
articulated a viable, positive
plan for furthering student in
terests and student-initiated pro
posals. Their backgrounds re
veal broad-ranging experience in
dealing with students, faculty
and administrators in effecting
valuable programs and ideas at
Stanford. Unlike other candi
dates, they have been involved
with the opinion-making pro
cesses both within and outside
of student government since
their arrival at Stanford.
Unlike other candidates, they
are committed to involve those
with whom they differ at elec
tion time to participate in for
mulating, advocating and enact
ing our ideas next year; it is
important that all students with
an interest in and a commitment
to the achievement of tangible
goals, be they fundamentally
radical, moderate or conserva
tive, be involved. They are com
mitted to mobilizing and direct
ing your opinions and your ac
tions. They are receptive to your
ideas; they are not inflexibly
committed to a single sociologi
cal concept of effecting change,
nor will they remain silent and
merely react to delaying'tactics
or purposeful obscurantism by
administration and faculty.
They hope to lead you, with
your fullest consent and partici
pation, to a university which has
more fully reconciled its actual
existence with its ideal condi
tion. Tom Shanahan and Henry
Levinson deserve your support.

ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary
gain that might be achieved by
rebelling students would be off
set by destroying lines of com
munication necessary for stu
dents to constructively negotiate
with the faculty and the admini
stration.
We substitute instead the con
cept of student influence, and it
must be a powerful and effec
tive influence. We do not see the
administration and students as
adversaries. We expect them to
be typically diverse elements of
the community who must be
willing to deal with each other
if any "community" is going to
be established and positive
changes made.
Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing
student influence is to have an
ASSU that is representative of
the students, not just a single
faction. Students are not going
to come to the ASSU President
to get involved, especially if he
represents a narrow philosophy
that excludes many of them. The
President will have to go to
them. He will have to attend
IFC, ICC, IHC, Wilbur council,
and graduate association meet
ings. He must encourage stu
dents to participate in solving
their own problems by co-ordi
nating and channeling their ef
forts.
By polarizing the student
government, radicals versus con
servatives, eventually we are
going to see the system, with
all the benefits it can provide in
creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat
ing a community of scholars
that includes faculty and stu
dents, but destroying what little
"community" of students we
now have. A community of stu
dents will depend on a rational
discussion between different
groups of students, based on
a respect for each other's opin
ions and purposes for being at
the University. There is no pos
sibility for rational discussion if
either side begins with the be
lief that they are absolutely
right and the time for debate
is past.
No one philosophy of educa
tion will be acceptable to all
students, and we feel tlr' a
united student philosophy i
a necessary ingredient v.j ac
complishing any positive change
at Stanford. We would submit
that many of the changes that
are being considered such as
coed housing and grading re
form do not necessarily have to
be limited to one philosophy of
education, thereby crystalizing
opposition becausc it is too nar
rowly defined.
To be legitimate, student gov
ernment must be representative.
It must speak for you, not to
you.

• Lyman-Mnasarenti
Present University education
is the capstone of a well-defined
process of socialization, training,
and inculcation in which indivi
duals learn to fill pre-determined
roles and make correct behavior
responses. In understanding edu
cation to be training, the Uni
versity is preparing the student
neither to live a creative life nor
to fulfill his responsibilities as
a citizen. Not only is it futile to
train students for roles which
may not exist in the future, but
it is debasing to reduce the defi
nition of the student to his so
cial function, e.g., engineer or
historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
fully understands his potential
and his freedom to choose a
role. Education, as it is now de
fined, threatens the student in
precisely those areas in which a
true education would develop
him: how to apply his intelli
gence to the world; how to re-

late honestly to others; how to
fulfill his needs to be creative;
how to live a sane life in a
rapidly changing society.
We can no longer afford to
ignore our interests. The follow
ing sketch of a community gov
ernment is a realistic alterna
tive to the disintegrated present.
The students and faculty will
each elect twenty-five represen
tatives to a community senate.
It would preside over a merger
of student, faculty and admini
strative investigative and initiat
ing committees. The senate will
find its support in the town
meeting, a convention of all stu
dents, graduate and undergradu
ate, scientific and artistic, satis
fied and dissatisfied. In these
large meetings students will rep
resent themselves to themselves
and to their fellows on the fac
ulty. Issues of importance to
the entire University must be
resolved by the community;
Stanford cannot afford nor
should it afford the mockery
of representative forms when it
can enjoy the luxury and fitness
of participatory democracy.
With the resolution and direct
ness available to the senate the
responsibility and comprehen
siveness of town meetings, the
students of Stanford will be firm
without being hostile, respon
sible without being dulled, con
cerned but not careless. The for
cefulness implicit in fair de
mands will emerge, and the Uni
versity will move for the better
ment of us all.
We do not seek the creation
of a "perfect residence" to be
copied by all others. We demand
only that the diversity of choice
become a greater number of real
alternatives, not the present
variations on a cell-block theme.
Let the residents of each living
group, in full responsibility, deal
with their residence as they will.
Thus, fraternities will be able to
exploit their full potential as
small, well-housed, autonomous
groups; a Stern house and a
house in Lagunita may wish to
exchange floors; and we can
attempt a co-op. In short, we
shall assess our needs and fill
them imaginatively.

• Reich-Kane
We seek a community of stu
dents. The concept of a "com
munity of scholars" is appealing
but unrealistic. Undergraduates
simply do not have the wide
spread faculty support and re
spect which would be necessary.
We must build a strong com
munity of students before we
can build a community of schol
ars.
The present student associa
tion, as defined in the ASSU
Constitution, is based on the con
cept of in loco parentis. The
Board of Trustees has granted
the students certain "privileges
and responsibilities." Student
government is structured like a
company union. It is a puppet
government, a government with
no real power.
We maintain that students
have certain rights. To assert
these rights, the ASSU must be
made a lobbying organization, a
bargaining power, a consumer's
union.
Restructure LASSU
We advocate a basic restruc
turing of LASSU. At present,

The Daily asked each of the five ASSU presidential candidates
to submit a platform statement written by himself or a supporter.

the student legislature has more
members than the United States
Senate. A new legislature, com
posed of about fifteen members,
would be both more representa
tive and more effective. Also,
faculty members should be per
mitted to serve if elected by stu
dents.
Students must recognize when
they are being used by the Ad
ministration. There is a differ
ence between working with and
working for the Administration.
We seek support from all seg
ments of the student body. Spe
cifically, it is wrong to condemn
fraterities as a group. Students
should be treated as individuals,
and each fraternity should be
treated as an individual living
group. Also, we feel graduate
students can make significant
contributions to the student as
sociation.
Alumni Contact
We seek closer contact with
the alumni. At present, their
only formal contact with the
University is through the Ad
ministration. They should be in
formed of student views by a
student-written newsletter. Stu
dnnt speakers should attend
alumni dinners.
We need a good course evalu
ation booklet. Last year, with a
budget of $114,500.00, the legis
lature appropriated only $850.00
for a Scratch Sheet. You get
what you pay for, if you're
lucky. Course evaluation de
serves more money.
We need a union which will
get students discounts in local
stores, at ski resorts, etc. We
favor a permanent location for
the Experiment. Students want
a coffee house. We suggest it
be located atop Hoover Tower
and the Tower be covered with
ivy.
This campaign has raised
many issues which divide stu
dents, but certain goals are com
mon to all. This election is not
an end, but rather a beginning.
It is a time for all students to
assume an active role in student
affairs. We must unite behind
the new President if we are to
realize those goals we all share.

• SrU son
Fritz Schaefer and Gene Cub
bison are working to involve all
11,000 Stanford students in the
of <student government.
Their platform is:
Reform Of The Student
legislature
Fritz Schaefer, as a minority
voice in LASSU, has introduced
two bills to make the Legislature
representative. The first changes
the numbers of seats in LASSU
to 60 by providing for one repre
sentative for every 200 students.
This would give real importance
to LASSU seats and bring in
opinions from all sectors of the
university. The second bill
breaks down the graduate stu
dent constituencies into smaller,
workable units, one such being
the graduate Electrical Engi
neers, having 3 representatives
under the new system.
Educational Improvement
Schaefer and Cubbison feel
that the purpose of the univer
sity is to provide a climate in
which the individual student can
develop his academic interests
in those directions which he so
chooses.
They propose a permanent, ac
tive ASSU committee to investi
gate the quality of teaching at
Stanford. The purposes of this
committee would be 1) to pro
vide student feedback to instruc
tors and professors and 2) to
bring to reality the long express
ed student opinion that teaching
ability should be a definite fac
tor in decisions on academic
promotion.
Pass-fail meets a very real
need in providing a student with
an opportunity to broaden the
scope of his education by tak
ing a course in an area in which,
because of his background, he
feels unable to compete. Schaef
er and Cubbison favor the allo
cation of 15 units of general
studies requirements to each
student on a pass-fail basis.
Residences
The key to a successful hous
ing arrangement at Stanford is
to provide each student with a
choice from a diversity of attrac
tive possibilities. Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the elimination
of any of the present living
groups at Stanford. They wel
come the coed dorms as another
attractive possibility for Stan
ford students. They feel that in
dependents and freshmen should
be given the opportunity to have
the type of housing which sets
off the new fraternity clusters.
The need for liveable on-cam
pus housing for graduate stu
dents must be considered.
Schaefer and Cubbison propose
the more or less immediate con
struction of a number of small
graduate student houses for
single grad students. This would
also enable Escondido Village
to house more married students.
Experiment, Athletics, ROTO
Since, in practice, the Experi
ment now serves primarily as
a vehicle for one-sided political
indoctrination, Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the use of stu
dent funds by the Experiment.
They also oppose giving a per
manent home to the Experiment,
the Young Republicans, or any
other political group.
The chief problem with inter
collegiate athletics at Stanford is
that not enough enthusiastic
fans show up lor the football
games.
ROTC meets the needs of a
considerable number of stu
dents and should not be subject
ed to the unwarranted abuse
that it is presently receiving.

• Sharmhan-Levinjson

Yes, it's ASSU election time
again, that symbolic event of
Spring when hypocrisy is re
vealed in its most blatant forms,
when opportunism rises freely
to the surface and when endless
catechisms are intoned over the
absurdity of it all; some agitat
ors even go so far as to question
"why" the unwanted bastard,
ASSU, fathered and foisted upon
us by a shameless Administra
tion, should be allowed to exist.
And who should appear out of
the blue, according to exclusive
Daily coverage, but the sensi
tive and aware Candidate, eager
to point the way to the Real
University and perhaps at the
real university. When He speaks,
"spontaneous" crowds gather at
his feet and applaud. Other
"candidates" address themselves
to His positions . . . and He shall
be known by His White Papers.
Surely He is not to be denied!
But this Phenomenon is by no
means unique. Indeed, His ideas
as well as those of the other
candidates are rehashings of the
Presidential campaigns of the
past few years, with certain
relevant modifications on the
Wilbur Experiment, the Packer
Committee and OFF!
Platforms Similar
If differences between the
platforms are illusory, and I be
lieve they are, then much more
meaningful distinctions can be
made between the candidates.
Because student government
should exist to facilitate, not
merely to advocate, goals set
forth in platforms at election
time, the student body must in
sure that the President it
chooses will present a coherent
plan for dealing effectively with
rocklike administrative struc
tures, with diffident and apathet
ic students and with hesitant, if
willing, faculty members.
Experienced
There are two candidates run
ning for ASSU President and
ASSU Vice-President who have
articulated a viable, positive
plan for furthering student in
terests and student-initiated pro
posals. Their backgrounds re
veal broad-ranging experience in
dealing with students, faculty
and administrators in effecting
valuable programs and ideas at
Stanford. Unlike other candi
dates, they have been involved
with the opinion-making pro
cesses both within and outside
of student government since
their arrival at Stanford.
Unlike other candidates, they
are committed to involve those
with whom they differ at elec
tion time to participate in for
mulating, advocating and enact
ing our ideas next year; it is
important that all students with
an interest in and a commitment
to the achievement of tangible
goals, be they fundamentally
radical, moderate or conserva
tive, be involved. They are com
mitted to mobilizing and direct
ing your opinions and your ac
tions. They are receptive to your
ideas; they are not inflexibly
committed to a single sociologi
cal concept of effecting change,
nor will they remain silent and
merely react to delaying'tactics
or purposeful obscurantism by
administration and faculty.
They hope to lead you, with
your fullest consent and partici
pation, to a university which has
more fully reconciled its actual
existence with its ideal condi
tion. Tom Shanahan and Henry
Levinson deserve your support.
• Hansen-Church
We believe, as most of the
candidates do, that student in
volvement is central to creating
a University community and an
atmosphere conducive to per
sonal discovery through the ex
change of diverse viewpoints,
but we differ on what is the
best means of achieving these
ends. We do not agree with the
concept of student power. There
is no inherent power in ASSU.
If student power is supposed
to mean student force, we reject
the idea as not being the most
effective way of accomplishing
our goals. First, we doubt that
most Stanford students are will
ing to mobilize against the ad
ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary

Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing
student influence is to have an
ASSU that is representative of
the students, not just a single
faction. Students are not going
to come to the ASSU President
to get involved, especially if he
represents a narrow philosophy
that excludes many of them. The
President will have to go to
them. He will have to attend
IFC, ICC, IHC, Wilbur council,
and graduate association meet
ings. He must encourage stu
dents to participate in solving
their own problems by co-ordi
nating and channeling their ef
forts.
By polarizing the student
government, radicals versus con
servatives, eventually we are
going to see the system, with
all the benefits it can provide in
creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat
ing a community of scholars
that includes faculty and stu
dents, but destroying what little
"community" of students we
now have. A community of stu
dents will depend on a rational
discussion between different
groups of students, based on
a respect for each other's opin
ions and purposes for being at
the University. There is no pos
sibility for rational discussion if
either side begins with the be
lief that they are absolutely
right and the time for debate
is past.
No one philosophy of educa
tion will be acceptable to all
students, and we feel tlr' a
united student philosophy i
a necessary ingredient v.j ac
complishing any positive change
at Stanford. We would submit
that many of the changes that
are being considered such as
coed housing and grading re
form do not necessarily have to
be limited to one philosophy of
education, thereby crystalizing
opposition becausc it is too nar
rowly defined.
To be legitimate, student gov
ernment must be representative.
It must speak for you, not to
you.

• Lyman-Mnasarenti
Present University education
is the capstone of a well-defined
process of socialization, training,
and inculcation in which indivi
duals learn to fill pre-determined
roles and make correct behavior
responses. In understanding edu
cation to be training, the Uni
versity is preparing the student
neither to live a creative life nor
to fulfill his responsibilities as
a citizen. Not only is it futile to
train students for roles which
may not exist in the future, but
it is debasing to reduce the defi
nition of the student to his so
cial function, e.g., engineer or
historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
fully understands his potential
and his freedom to choose a
role. Education, as it is now de
fined, threatens the student in
precisely those areas in which a
true education would develop
him: how to apply his intelli
gence to the world; how to re-

late honestly to others; how to
fulfill his needs to be creative;
how to live a sane life in a
rapidly changing society.
We can no longer afford to
ignore our interests. The follow
ing sketch of a community gov
ernment is a realistic alterna
tive to the disintegrated present.
The students and faculty will
each elect twenty-five represen
tatives to a community senate.
It would preside over a merger
of student, faculty and admini
strative investigative and initiat
ing committees. The senate will
find its support in the town
meeting, a convention of all stu
dents, graduate and undergradu
ate, scientific and artistic, satis
fied and dissatisfied. In these
large meetings students will rep
resent themselves to themselves
and to their fellows on the fac
ulty. Issues of importance to
the entire University must be
resolved by the community;
Stanford cannot afford nor
should it afford the mockery
of representative forms when it
can enjoy the luxury and fitness
of participatory democracy.
With the resolution and direct
ness available to the senate the
responsibility and comprehen
siveness of town meetings, the
students of Stanford will be firm
without being hostile, respon
sible without being dulled, con
cerned but not careless. The for
cefulness implicit in fair de
mands will emerge, and the Uni
versity will move for the better
ment of us all.
We do not seek the creation
of a "perfect residence" to be
copied by all others. We demand
only that the diversity of choice
become a greater number of real
alternatives, not the present
variations on a cell-block theme.
Let the residents of each living
group, in full responsibility, deal
with their residence as they will.
Thus, fraternities will be able to
exploit their full potential as
small, well-housed, autonomous
groups; a Stern house and a
house in Lagunita may wish to
exchange floors; and we can
attempt a co-op. In short, we
shall assess our needs and fill
them imaginatively.

• Reich-Kane
We seek a community of stu
dents. The concept of a "com
munity of scholars" is appealing
but unrealistic. Undergraduates
simply do not have the wide
spread faculty support and re
spect which would be necessary.
We must build a strong com
munity of students before we
can build a community of schol
ars.
The present student associa
tion, as defined in the ASSU
Constitution, is based on the con
cept of in loco parentis. The
Board of Trustees has granted
the students certain "privileges
and responsibilities." Student
government is structured like a
company union. It is a puppet
government, a government with
no real power.
We maintain that students
have certain rights. To assert
these rights, the ASSU must be
made a lobbying organization, a
bargaining power, a consumer's
union.
Restructure LASSU
We advocate a basic restruc
turing of LASSU. At present,

The Daily asked each of the five ASSU presidential candidates
to submit a platform statement written by himself or a supporter.

the student legislature has more
members than the United States
Senate. A new legislature, com
posed of about fifteen members,
would be both more representa
tive and more effective. Also,
faculty members should be per
mitted to serve if elected by stu
dents.
Students must recognize when
they are being used by the Ad
ministration. There is a differ
ence between working with and
working for the Administration.
We seek support from all seg
ments of the student body. Spe
cifically, it is wrong to condemn
fraterities as a group. Students
should be treated as individuals,
and each fraternity should be
treated as an individual living
group. Also, we feel graduate
students can make significant
contributions to the student as
sociation.
Alumni Contact
We seek closer contact with
the alumni. At present, their
only formal contact with the
University is through the Ad
ministration. They should be in
formed of student views by a
student-written newsletter. Stu
dnnt speakers should attend
alumni dinners.
We need a good course evalu
ation booklet. Last year, with a
budget of $114,500.00, the legis
lature appropriated only $850.00
for a Scratch Sheet. You get
what you pay for, if you're
lucky. Course evaluation de
serves more money.
We need a union which will
get students discounts in local
stores, at ski resorts, etc. We
favor a permanent location for
the Experiment. Students want
a coffee house. We suggest it
be located atop Hoover Tower
and the Tower be covered with
ivy.
This campaign has raised
many issues which divide stu
dents, but certain goals are com
mon to all. This election is not
an end, but rather a beginning.
It is a time for all students to
assume an active role in student
affairs. We must unite behind
the new President if we are to
realize those goals we all share.

• SrU son
Fritz Schaefer and Gene Cub
bison are working to involve all
11,000 Stanford students in the
of <student government.
Their platform is:
Reform Of The Student
legislature
Fritz Schaefer, as a minority
voice in LASSU, has introduced
two bills to make the Legislature
representative. The first changes
the numbers of seats in LASSU
to 60 by providing for one repre
sentative for every 200 students.
This would give real importance
to LASSU seats and bring in
opinions from all sectors of the
university. The second bill
breaks down the graduate stu
dent constituencies into smaller,
workable units, one such being
the graduate Electrical Engi
neers, having 3 representatives
under the new system.
Educational Improvement
Schaefer and Cubbison feel
that the purpose of the univer
sity is to provide a climate in
which the individual student can
develop his academic interests
in those directions which he so
chooses.
They propose a permanent, ac
tive ASSU committee to investi
gate the quality of teaching at
Stanford. The purposes of this
committee would be 1) to pro
vide student feedback to instruc
tors and professors and 2) to
bring to reality the long express
ed student opinion that teaching
ability should be a definite fac
tor in decisions on academic
promotion.
Pass-fail meets a very real
need in providing a student with
an opportunity to broaden the
scope of his education by tak
ing a course in an area in which,
because of his background, he
feels unable to compete. Schaef
er and Cubbison favor the allo
cation of 15 units of general
studies requirements to each
student on a pass-fail basis.
Residences
The key to a successful hous
ing arrangement at Stanford is
to provide each student with a
choice from a diversity of attrac
tive possibilities. Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the elimination
of any of the present living
groups at Stanford. They wel
come the coed dorms as another
attractive possibility for Stan
ford students. They feel that in
dependents and freshmen should
be given the opportunity to have
the type of housing which sets
off the new fraternity clusters.
The need for liveable on-cam
pus housing for graduate stu
dents must be considered.
Schaefer and Cubbison propose
the more or less immediate con
struction of a number of small
graduate student houses for
single grad students. This would
also enable Escondido Village
to house more married students.
Experiment, Athletics, ROTO
Since, in practice, the Experi
ment now serves primarily as
a vehicle for one-sided political
indoctrination, Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the use of stu
dent funds by the Experiment.
They also oppose giving a per
manent home to the Experiment,
the Young Republicans, or any
other political group.
The chief problem with inter
collegiate athletics at Stanford is
that not enough enthusiastic
fans show up lor the football
games.
ROTC meets the needs of a
considerable number of stu
dents and should not be subject
ed to the unwarranted abuse
that it is presently receiving.

• Sharmhan-Levinjson

Yes, it's ASSU election time
again, that symbolic event of
Spring when hypocrisy is re
vealed in its most blatant forms,
when opportunism rises freely
to the surface and when endless
catechisms are intoned over the
absurdity of it all; some agitat
ors even go so far as to question
"why" the unwanted bastard,
ASSU, fathered and foisted upon
us by a shameless Administra
tion, should be allowed to exist.
And who should appear out of
the blue, according to exclusive
Daily coverage, but the sensi
tive and aware Candidate, eager
to point the way to the Real
University and perhaps at the
real university. When He speaks,
"spontaneous" crowds gather at
his feet and applaud. Other
"candidates" address themselves
to His positions . . . and He shall
be known by His White Papers.
Surely He is not to be denied!
But this Phenomenon is by no
means unique. Indeed, His ideas
as well as those of the other
candidates are rehashings of the
Presidential campaigns of the
past few years, with certain
relevant modifications on the
Wilbur Experiment, the Packer
Committee and OFF!
Platforms Similar
If differences between the
platforms are illusory, and I be
lieve they are, then much more
meaningful distinctions can be
made between the candidates.
Because student government
should exist to facilitate, not
merely to advocate, goals set
forth in platforms at election
time, the student body must in
sure that the President it
chooses will present a coherent
plan for dealing effectively with
rocklike administrative struc
tures, with diffident and apathet
ic students and with hesitant, if
willing, faculty members.
Experienced
There are two candidates run
ning for ASSU President and
ASSU Vice-President who have
articulated a viable, positive
plan for furthering student in
terests and student-initiated pro
posals. Their backgrounds re
veal broad-ranging experience in
dealing with students, faculty
and administrators in effecting
valuable programs and ideas at
Stanford. Unlike other candi
dates, they have been involved
with the opinion-making pro
cesses both within and outside
of student government since
their arrival at Stanford.
Unlike other candidates, they
are committed to involve those
with whom they differ at elec
tion time to participate in for
mulating, advocating and enact
ing our ideas next year; it is
important that all students with
an interest in and a commitment
to the achievement of tangible
goals, be they fundamentally
radical, moderate or conserva
tive, be involved. They are com
mitted to mobilizing and direct
ing your opinions and your ac
tions. They are receptive to your
ideas; they are not inflexibly
committed to a single sociologi
cal concept of effecting change,
nor will they remain silent and
merely react to delaying'tactics
or purposeful obscurantism by
administration and faculty.
They hope to lead you, with
your fullest consent and partici
pation, to a university which has
more fully reconciled its actual
existence with its ideal condi
tion. Tom Shanahan and Henry
Levinson deserve your support.
• Hansen-Church
We believe, as most of the
candidates do, that student in
volvement is central to creating
a University community and an
atmosphere conducive to per
sonal discovery through the ex
change of diverse viewpoints,
but we differ on what is the
best means of achieving these
ends. We do not agree with the
concept of student power. There
is no inherent power in ASSU.
If student power is supposed
to mean student force, we reject
the idea as not being the most
effective way of accomplishing
our goals. First, we doubt that
most Stanford students are will
ing to mobilize against the ad
ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary
gain that might be achieved by
rebelling students would be off
set by destroying lines of com
munication necessary for stu
dents to constructively negotiate
with the faculty and the admini
stration.
We substitute instead the con
cept of student influence, and it
must be a powerful and effec
tive influence. We do not see the
administration and students as
adversaries. We expect them to
be typically diverse elements of
the community who must be
willing to deal with each other
if any "community" is going to
be established and positive
changes made.
Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing

going to see the system, with

creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat
ing a community of scholars
that includes faculty and stu
dents, but destroying what little
"community" of students we
now have. A community of stu
dents will depend on a rational
discussion between different
groups of students, based on
a respect for each other's opin
ions and purposes for being at
the University. There is no pos
sibility for rational discussion if
either side begins with the be
lief that they are absolutely
right and the time for debate
is past.
No one philosophy of educa
tion will be acceptable to all
students, and we feel tlr' a
united student philosophy i
a necessary ingredient v.j ac
complishing any positive change
at Stanford. We would submit
that many of the changes that
are being considered such as
coed housing and grading re
form do not necessarily have to
be limited to one philosophy of
education, thereby crystalizing
opposition becausc it is too nar
rowly defined.
To be legitimate, student gov
ernment must be representative.
It must speak for you, not to
you.

• Lyman-Mnasarenti
Present University education
is the capstone of a well-defined
process of socialization, training,
and inculcation in which indivi
duals learn to fill pre-determined
roles and make correct behavior
responses. In understanding edu
cation to be training, the Uni
versity is preparing the student
neither to live a creative life nor
to fulfill his responsibilities as
a citizen. Not only is it futile to
train students for roles which
may not exist in the future, but
it is debasing to reduce the defi
nition of the student to his so
cial function, e.g., engineer or
historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
fully understands his potential
and his freedom to choose a
role. Education, as it is now de
fined, threatens the student in
precisely those areas in which a
true education would develop
him: how to apply his intelli
gence to the world; how to re-

late honestly to others; how to
fulfill his needs to be creative;
how to live a sane life in a
rapidly changing society.
We can no longer afford to
ignore our interests. The follow
ing sketch of a community gov
ernment is a realistic alterna
tive to the disintegrated present.
The students and faculty will
each elect twenty-five represen
tatives to a community senate.
It would preside over a merger
of student, faculty and admini
strative investigative and initiat
ing committees. The senate will
find its support in the town
meeting, a convention of all stu
dents, graduate and undergradu
ate, scientific and artistic, satis
fied and dissatisfied. In these
large meetings students will rep
resent themselves to themselves
and to their fellows on the fac
ulty. Issues of importance to
the entire University must be
resolved by the community;
Stanford cannot afford nor
should it afford the mockery
of representative forms when it
can enjoy the luxury and fitness
of participatory democracy.
With the resolution and direct
ness available to the senate the
responsibility and comprehen
siveness of town meetings, the
students of Stanford will be firm
without being hostile, respon
sible without being dulled, con
cerned but not careless. The for
cefulness implicit in fair de
mands will emerge, and the Uni
versity will move for the better
ment of us all.
We do not seek the creation
of a "perfect residence" to be
copied by all others. We demand
only that the diversity of choice
become a greater number of real
alternatives, not the present
variations on a cell-block theme.
Let the residents of each living
group, in full responsibility, deal
with their residence as they will.
Thus, fraternities will be able to
exploit their full potential as
small, well-housed, autonomous
groups; a Stern house and a
house in Lagunita may wish to
exchange floors; and we can
attempt a co-op. In short, we
shall assess our needs and fill
them imaginatively.

• Reich-Kane
We seek a community of stu
dents. The concept of a "com
munity of scholars" is appealing
but unrealistic. Undergraduates
simply do not have the wide
spread faculty support and re
spect which would be necessary.
We must build a strong com
munity of students before we
can build a community of schol
ars.
The present student associa
tion, as defined in the ASSU
Constitution, is based on the con
cept of in loco parentis. The
Board of Trustees has granted
the students certain "privileges
and responsibilities." Student
government is structured like a
company union. It is a puppet
government, a government with
no real power.
We maintain that students
have certain rights. To assert
these rights, the ASSU must be
made a lobbying organization, a
bargaining power, a consumer's
union.
Restructure LASSU
We advocate a basic restruc
turing of LASSU. At present,

The Daily asked each of the five ASSU presidential candidates
to submit a platform statement written by himself or a supporter.

the student legislature has more
members than the United States
Senate. A new legislature, com
posed of about fifteen members,
would be both more representa
tive and more effective. Also,
faculty members should be per
mitted to serve if elected by stu
dents.
Students must recognize when
they are being used by the Ad
ministration. There is a differ
ence between working with and
working for the Administration.
We seek support from all seg
ments of the student body. Spe
cifically, it is wrong to condemn
fraterities as a group. Students
should be treated as individuals,
and each fraternity should be
treated as an individual living
group. Also, we feel graduate
students can make significant
contributions to the student as
sociation.
Alumni Contact
We seek closer contact with
the alumni. At present, their
only formal contact with the
University is through the Ad
ministration. They should be in
formed of student views by a
student-written newsletter. Stu
dnnt speakers should attend
alumni dinners.
We need a good course evalu
ation booklet. Last year, with a
budget of $114,500.00, the legis
lature appropriated only $850.00
for a Scratch Sheet. You get
what you pay for, if you're
lucky. Course evaluation de
serves more money.
We need a union which will
get students discounts in local
stores, at ski resorts, etc. We
favor a permanent location for
the Experiment. Students want
a coffee house. We suggest it
be located atop Hoover Tower
and the Tower be covered with
ivy.
This campaign has raised
many issues which divide stu
dents, but certain goals are com
mon to all. This election is not
an end, but rather a beginning.
It is a time for all students to
assume an active role in student
affairs. We must unite behind
the new President if we are to
realize those goals we all share.

• SrU son
Fritz Schaefer and Gene Cub
bison are working to involve all
11,000 Stanford students in the
of <student government.
Their platform is:
Reform Of The Student
legislature
Fritz Schaefer, as a minority
voice in LASSU, has introduced
two bills to make the Legislature
representative. The first changes
the numbers of seats in LASSU
to 60 by providing for one repre
sentative for every 200 students.
This would give real importance
to LASSU seats and bring in
opinions from all sectors of the
university. The second bill
breaks down the graduate stu
dent constituencies into smaller,
workable units, one such being
the graduate Electrical Engi
neers, having 3 representatives
under the new system.
Educational Improvement
Schaefer and Cubbison feel
that the purpose of the univer
sity is to provide a climate in
which the individual student can
develop his academic interests
in those directions which he so
chooses.
They propose a permanent, ac
tive ASSU committee to investi
gate the quality of teaching at
Stanford. The purposes of this
committee would be 1) to pro
vide student feedback to instruc
tors and professors and 2) to
bring to reality the long express
ed student opinion that teaching
ability should be a definite fac
tor in decisions on academic
promotion.
Pass-fail meets a very real
need in providing a student with
an opportunity to broaden the
scope of his education by tak
ing a course in an area in which,
because of his background, he
feels unable to compete. Schaef
er and Cubbison favor the allo
cation of 15 units of general
studies requirements to each
student on a pass-fail basis.
Residences
The key to a successful hous
ing arrangement at Stanford is
to provide each student with a
choice from a diversity of attrac
tive possibilities. Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the elimination
of any of the present living
groups at Stanford. They wel
come the coed dorms as another
attractive possibility for Stan
ford students. They feel that in
dependents and freshmen should
be given the opportunity to have
the type of housing which sets
off the new fraternity clusters.
The need for liveable on-cam
pus housing for graduate stu
dents must be considered.
Schaefer and Cubbison propose
the more or less immediate con
struction of a number of small
graduate student houses for
single grad students. This would
also enable Escondido Village
to house more married students.
Experiment, Athletics, ROTO
Since, in practice, the Experi
ment now serves primarily as
a vehicle for one-sided political
indoctrination, Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the use of stu
dent funds by the Experiment.
They also oppose giving a per
manent home to the Experiment,
the Young Republicans, or any
other political group.
The chief problem with inter
collegiate athletics at Stanford is
that not enough enthusiastic
fans show up lor the football
games.
ROTC meets the needs of a
considerable number of stu
dents and should not be subject
ed to the unwarranted abuse
that it is presently receiving.

• Sharmhan-Levinjson

Yes, it's ASSU election time
again, that symbolic event of
Spring when hypocrisy is re
vealed in its most blatant forms,
when opportunism rises freely
to the surface and when endless
catechisms are intoned over the
absurdity of it all; some agitat
ors even go so far as to question
"why" the unwanted bastard,
ASSU, fathered and foisted upon
us by a shameless Administra
tion, should be allowed to exist.
And who should appear out of
the blue, according to exclusive
Daily coverage, but the sensi
tive and aware Candidate, eager
to point the way to the Real
University and perhaps at the
real university. When He speaks,
"spontaneous" crowds gather at
his feet and applaud. Other
"candidates" address themselves
to His positions . . . and He shall
be known by His White Papers.
Surely He is not to be denied!
But this Phenomenon is by no
means unique. Indeed, His ideas
as well as those of the other
candidates are rehashings of the
Presidential campaigns of the
past few years, with certain
relevant modifications on the
Wilbur Experiment, the Packer
Committee and OFF!
Platforms Similar
If differences between the
platforms are illusory, and I be
lieve they are, then much more
meaningful distinctions can be
made between the candidates.
Because student government
should exist to facilitate, not
merely to advocate, goals set
forth in platforms at election
time, the student body must in
sure that the President it
chooses will present a coherent
plan for dealing effectively with
rocklike administrative struc
tures, with diffident and apathet
ic students and with hesitant, if
willing, faculty members.
Experienced
There are two candidates run
ning for ASSU President and
ASSU Vice-President who have
articulated a viable, positive
plan for furthering student in
terests and student-initiated pro
posals. Their backgrounds re
veal broad-ranging experience in
dealing with students, faculty
and administrators in effecting
valuable programs and ideas at
Stanford. Unlike other candi
dates, they have been involved
with the opinion-making pro
cesses both within and outside
of student government since
their arrival at Stanford.
Unlike other candidates, they
are committed to involve those
with whom they differ at elec
tion time to participate in for
mulating, advocating and enact
ing our ideas next year; it is
important that all students with
an interest in and a commitment
to the achievement of tangible
goals, be they fundamentally
radical, moderate or conserva
tive, be involved. They are com
mitted to mobilizing and direct
ing your opinions and your ac
tions. They are receptive to your
ideas; they are not inflexibly
committed to a single sociologi
cal concept of effecting change,
nor will they remain silent and
merely react to delaying'tactics
or purposeful obscurantism by
administration and faculty.
They hope to lead you, with
your fullest consent and partici
pation, to a university which has
more fully reconciled its actual
existence with its ideal condi
tion. Tom Shanahan and Henry
Levinson deserve your support.
• Hansen-Church
We believe, as most of the
candidates do, that student in
volvement is central to creating
a University community and an
atmosphere conducive to per
sonal discovery through the ex
change of diverse viewpoints,
but we differ on what is the
best means of achieving these
ends. We do not agree with the
concept of student power. There
is no inherent power in ASSU.
If student power is supposed
to mean student force, we reject
the idea as not being the most
effective way of accomplishing
our goals. First, we doubt that
most Stanford students are will
ing to mobilize against the ad
ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary
gain that might be achieved by
rebelling students would be off
set by destroying lines of com
munication necessary for stu
dents to constructively negotiate
with the faculty and the admini
stration.
We substitute instead the con
cept of student influence, and it
must be a powerful and effec
tive influence. We do not see the
administration and students as
adversaries. We expect them to
be typically diverse elements of
the community who must be
willing to deal with each other
if any "community" is going to
be established and positive
changes made.
Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing
student influence is to have an
ASSU that is representative of
the students, not just a single
faction. Students are not going
to come to the ASSU President
to get involved, especially if he
represents a narrow philosophy
that excludes many of them. The
President will have to go to
them. He will have to attend
IFC, ICC, IHC, Wilbur council,
and graduate association meet
ings. He must encourage stu
dents to participate in solving
their own problems by co-ordi
nating and channeling their ef
forts.
By polarizing the student
government, radicals versus con
servatives, eventually we are
going to see the system, with
all the benefits it can provide in
creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat

• Lyman-Mnasarenti
Present University education
is the capstone of a well-defined
process of socialization, training,
and inculcation in which indivi
duals learn to fill pre-determined
roles and make correct behavior
responses. In understanding edu
cation to be training, the Uni
versity is preparing the student
neither to live a creative life nor
to fulfill his responsibilities as
a citizen. Not only is it futile to
train students for roles which
may not exist in the future, but
it is debasing to reduce the defi
nition of the student to his so
cial function, e.g., engineer or
historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
fully understands his potential
and his freedom to choose a
role. Education, as it is now de
fined, threatens the student in
precisely those areas in which a
true education would develop
him: how to apply his intelli
gence to the world; how to re-

late honestly to others; how to
fulfill his needs to be creative;
how to live a sane life in a
rapidly changing society.
We can no longer afford to
ignore our interests. The follow
ing sketch of a community gov
ernment is a realistic alterna
tive to the disintegrated present.
The students and faculty will
each elect twenty-five represen
tatives to a community senate.
It would preside over a merger
of student, faculty and admini
strative investigative and initiat
ing committees. The senate will
find its support in the town
meeting, a convention of all stu
dents, graduate and undergradu
ate, scientific and artistic, satis
fied and dissatisfied. In these
large meetings students will rep
resent themselves to themselves
and to their fellows on the fac
ulty. Issues of importance to
the entire University must be
resolved by the community;
Stanford cannot afford nor
should it afford the mockery
of representative forms when it
can enjoy the luxury and fitness
of participatory democracy.
With the resolution and direct
ness available to the senate the
responsibility and comprehen
siveness of town meetings, the
students of Stanford will be firm
without being hostile, respon
sible without being dulled, con
cerned but not careless. The for
cefulness implicit in fair de
mands will emerge, and the Uni
versity will move for the better
ment of us all.
We do not seek the creation
of a "perfect residence" to be
copied by all others. We demand
only that the diversity of choice
become a greater number of real
alternatives, not the present
variations on a cell-block theme.
Let the residents of each living
group, in full responsibility, deal
with their residence as they will.
Thus, fraternities will be able to
exploit their full potential as
small, well-housed, autonomous
groups; a Stern house and a
house in Lagunita may wish to
exchange floors; and we can
attempt a co-op. In short, we
shall assess our needs and fill
them imaginatively.

• Reich-Kane
We seek a community of stu
dents. The concept of a "com
munity of scholars" is appealing
but unrealistic. Undergraduates
simply do not have the wide
spread faculty support and re
spect which would be necessary.
We must build a strong com
munity of students before we
can build a community of schol
ars.
The present student associa
tion, as defined in the ASSU
Constitution, is based on the con
cept of in loco parentis. The
Board of Trustees has granted
the students certain "privileges
and responsibilities." Student
government is structured like a
company union. It is a puppet
government, a government with
no real power.
We maintain that students
have certain rights. To assert
these rights, the ASSU must be
made a lobbying organization, a
bargaining power, a consumer's
union.
Restructure LASSU
We advocate a basic restruc
turing of LASSU. At present,

The Daily asked each of the five ASSU presidential candidates
to submit a platform statement written by himself or a supporter.

the student legislature has more
members than the United States
Senate. A new legislature, com
posed of about fifteen members,
would be both more representa
tive and more effective. Also,
faculty members should be per
mitted to serve if elected by stu
dents.
Students must recognize when
they are being used by the Ad
ministration. There is a differ
ence between working with and
working for the Administration.
We seek support from all seg
ments of the student body. Spe
cifically, it is wrong to condemn
fraterities as a group. Students
should be treated as individuals,
and each fraternity should be
treated as an individual living
group. Also, we feel graduate
students can make significant
contributions to the student as
sociation.
Alumni Contact
We seek closer contact with
the alumni. At present, their
only formal contact with the
University is through the Ad
ministration. They should be in
formed of student views by a
student-written newsletter. Stu
dnnt speakers should attend
alumni dinners.
We need a good course evalu
ation booklet. Last year, with a
budget of $114,500.00, the legis
lature appropriated only $850.00
for a Scratch Sheet. You get
what you pay for, if you're
lucky. Course evaluation de
serves more money.
We need a union which will
get students discounts in local
stores, at ski resorts, etc. We
favor a permanent location for
the Experiment. Students want
a coffee house. We suggest it
be located atop Hoover Tower
and the Tower be covered with
ivy.
This campaign has raised
many issues which divide stu
dents, but certain goals are com
mon to all. This election is not
an end, but rather a beginning.
It is a time for all students to
assume an active role in student
affairs. We must unite behind
the new President if we are to
realize those goals we all share.

• SrU son
Fritz Schaefer and Gene Cub
bison are working to involve all
11,000 Stanford students in the
of <student government.
Their platform is:
Reform Of The Student
legislature
Fritz Schaefer, as a minority
voice in LASSU, has introduced
two bills to make the Legislature
representative. The first changes
the numbers of seats in LASSU
to 60 by providing for one repre
sentative for every 200 students.
This would give real importance
to LASSU seats and bring in
opinions from all sectors of the
university. The second bill
breaks down the graduate stu
dent constituencies into smaller,
workable units, one such being
the graduate Electrical Engi
neers, having 3 representatives
under the new system.
Educational Improvement
Schaefer and Cubbison feel
that the purpose of the univer
sity is to provide a climate in
which the individual student can
develop his academic interests
in those directions which he so
chooses.
They propose a permanent, ac
tive ASSU committee to investi
gate the quality of teaching at
Stanford. The purposes of this
committee would be 1) to pro
vide student feedback to instruc
tors and professors and 2) to
bring to reality the long express
ed student opinion that teaching
ability should be a definite fac
tor in decisions on academic
promotion.
Pass-fail meets a very real
need in providing a student with
an opportunity to broaden the
scope of his education by tak
ing a course in an area in which,
because of his background, he
feels unable to compete. Schaef
er and Cubbison favor the allo
cation of 15 units of general
studies requirements to each
student on a pass-fail basis.
Residences
The key to a successful hous
ing arrangement at Stanford is
to provide each student with a
choice from a diversity of attrac
tive possibilities. Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the elimination
of any of the present living
groups at Stanford. They wel
come the coed dorms as another
attractive possibility for Stan
ford students. They feel that in
dependents and freshmen should
be given the opportunity to have
the type of housing which sets
off the new fraternity clusters.
The need for liveable on-cam
pus housing for graduate stu
dents must be considered.
Schaefer and Cubbison propose
the more or less immediate con
struction of a number of small
graduate student houses for
single grad students. This would
also enable Escondido Village
to house more married students.
Experiment, Athletics, ROTO
Since, in practice, the Experi
ment now serves primarily as
a vehicle for one-sided political
indoctrination, Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the use of stu
dent funds by the Experiment.
They also oppose giving a per
manent home to the Experiment,
the Young Republicans, or any
other political group.
The chief problem with inter
collegiate athletics at Stanford is
that not enough enthusiastic
fans show up lor the football
games.
ROTC meets the needs of a
considerable number of stu
dents and should not be subject
ed to the unwarranted abuse
that it is presently receiving.

• Sharmhan-Levinjson

Yes, it's ASSU election time
again, that symbolic event of
Spring when hypocrisy is re
vealed in its most blatant forms,
when opportunism rises freely
to the surface and when endless
catechisms are intoned over the
absurdity of it all; some agitat
ors even go so far as to question
"why" the unwanted bastard,
ASSU, fathered and foisted upon
us by a shameless Administra
tion, should be allowed to exist.
And who should appear out of
the blue, according to exclusive
Daily coverage, but the sensi
tive and aware Candidate, eager
to point the way to the Real
University and perhaps at the
real university. When He speaks,
"spontaneous" crowds gather at
his feet and applaud. Other
"candidates" address themselves
to His positions . . . and He shall
be known by His White Papers.
Surely He is not to be denied!
But this Phenomenon is by no
means unique. Indeed, His ideas
as well as those of the other
candidates are rehashings of the
Presidential campaigns of the
past few years, with certain
relevant modifications on the
Wilbur Experiment, the Packer
Committee and OFF!
Platforms Similar
If differences between the
platforms are illusory, and I be
lieve they are, then much more
meaningful distinctions can be
made between the candidates.
Because student government
should exist to facilitate, not
merely to advocate, goals set
forth in platforms at election
time, the student body must in
sure that the President it
chooses will present a coherent
plan for dealing effectively with
rocklike administrative struc
tures, with diffident and apathet
ic students and with hesitant, if
willing, faculty members.
Experienced
There are two candidates run
ning for ASSU President and
ASSU Vice-President who have
articulated a viable, positive
plan for furthering student in
terests and student-initiated pro
posals. Their backgrounds re
veal broad-ranging experience in
dealing with students, faculty
and administrators in effecting
valuable programs and ideas at
Stanford. Unlike other candi
dates, they have been involved
with the opinion-making pro
cesses both within and outside
of student government since
their arrival at Stanford.
Unlike other candidates, they
are committed to involve those
with whom they differ at elec
tion time to participate in for
mulating, advocating and enact
ing our ideas next year; it is
important that all students with
an interest in and a commitment
to the achievement of tangible
goals, be they fundamentally
radical, moderate or conserva
tive, be involved. They are com
mitted to mobilizing and direct
ing your opinions and your ac
tions. They are receptive to your
ideas; they are not inflexibly
committed to a single sociologi
cal concept of effecting change,
nor will they remain silent and
merely react to delaying'tactics
or purposeful obscurantism by
administration and faculty.
They hope to lead you, with
your fullest consent and partici
pation, to a university which has
more fully reconciled its actual
existence with its ideal condi
tion. Tom Shanahan and Henry
Levinson deserve your support.
• Hansen-Church
We believe, as most of the
candidates do, that student in
volvement is central to creating
a University community and an
atmosphere conducive to per
sonal discovery through the ex
change of diverse viewpoints,
but we differ on what is the
best means of achieving these
ends. We do not agree with the
concept of student power. There
is no inherent power in ASSU.
If student power is supposed
to mean student force, we reject
the idea as not being the most
effective way of accomplishing
our goals. First, we doubt that
most Stanford students are will
ing to mobilize against the ad
ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary
gain that might be achieved by
rebelling students would be off
set by destroying lines of com
munication necessary for stu
dents to constructively negotiate
with the faculty and the admini
stration.
We substitute instead the con
cept of student influence, and it
must be a powerful and effec
tive influence. We do not see the
administration and students as
adversaries. We expect them to
be typically diverse elements of
the community who must be
willing to deal with each other
if any "community" is going to
be established and positive
changes made.
Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing
student influence is to have an
ASSU that is representative of
the students, not just a single
faction. Students are not going
to come to the ASSU President
to get involved, especially if he
represents a narrow philosophy
that excludes many of them. The
President will have to go to
them. He will have to attend
IFC, ICC, IHC, Wilbur council,
and graduate association meet
ings. He must encourage stu
dents to participate in solving
their own problems by co-ordi
nating and channeling their ef
forts.
By polarizing the student
government, radicals versus con
servatives, eventually we are
going to see the system, with
all the benefits it can provide in
creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat
ing a community of scholars
that includes faculty and stu
dents, but destroying what little
"community" of students we
now have. A community of stu
dents will depend on a rational
discussion between different
groups of students, based on
a respect for each other's opin
ions and purposes for being at
the University. There is no pos
sibility for rational discussion if
either side begins with the be
lief that they are absolutely
right and the time for debate
is past.
No one philosophy of educa
tion will be acceptable to all
students, and we feel tlr' a
united student philosophy i
a necessary ingredient v.j ac

• Lyman-Mnasarenti
Present University education
is the capstone of a well-defined
process of socialization, training,
and inculcation in which indivi
duals learn to fill pre-determined
roles and make correct behavior
responses. In understanding edu
cation to be training, the Uni
versity is preparing the student
neither to live a creative life nor
to fulfill his responsibilities as
a citizen. Not only is it futile to
train students for roles which
may not exist in the future, but
it is debasing to reduce the defi
nition of the student to his so
cial function, e.g., engineer or
historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
fully understands his potential
and his freedom to choose a
role. Education, as it is now de
fined, threatens the student in
precisely those areas in which a
true education would develop
him: how to apply his intelli
gence to the world; how to re-

late honestly to others; how to
fulfill his needs to be creative;
how to live a sane life in a
rapidly changing society.
We can no longer afford to
ignore our interests. The follow
ing sketch of a community gov
ernment is a realistic alterna
tive to the disintegrated present.
The students and faculty will
each elect twenty-five represen
tatives to a community senate.
It would preside over a merger
of student, faculty and admini
strative investigative and initiat
ing committees. The senate will
find its support in the town
meeting, a convention of all stu
dents, graduate and undergradu
ate, scientific and artistic, satis
fied and dissatisfied. In these
large meetings students will rep
resent themselves to themselves
and to their fellows on the fac
ulty. Issues of importance to
the entire University must be
resolved by the community;
Stanford cannot afford nor
should it afford the mockery
of representative forms when it
can enjoy the luxury and fitness
of participatory democracy.
With the resolution and direct
ness available to the senate the
responsibility and comprehen
siveness of town meetings, the
students of Stanford will be firm
without being hostile, respon
sible without being dulled, con
cerned but not careless. The for
cefulness implicit in fair de
mands will emerge, and the Uni
versity will move for the better
ment of us all.
We do not seek the creation
of a "perfect residence" to be
copied by all others. We demand
only that the diversity of choice
become a greater number of real
alternatives, not the present
variations on a cell-block theme.
Let the residents of each living
group, in full responsibility, deal
with their residence as they will.
Thus, fraternities will be able to
exploit their full potential as
small, well-housed, autonomous
groups; a Stern house and a
house in Lagunita may wish to
exchange floors; and we can
attempt a co-op. In short, we
shall assess our needs and fill
them imaginatively.

• Reich-Kane
We seek a community of stu
dents. The concept of a "com
munity of scholars" is appealing
but unrealistic. Undergraduates
simply do not have the wide
spread faculty support and re
spect which would be necessary.
We must build a strong com
munity of students before we
can build a community of schol
ars.
The present student associa
tion, as defined in the ASSU
Constitution, is based on the con
cept of in loco parentis. The
Board of Trustees has granted
the students certain "privileges
and responsibilities." Student
government is structured like a
company union. It is a puppet
government, a government with
no real power.
We maintain that students
have certain rights. To assert
these rights, the ASSU must be
made a lobbying organization, a
bargaining power, a consumer's
union.
Restructure LASSU
We advocate a basic restruc
turing of LASSU. At present,

The Daily asked each of the five ASSU presidential candidates
to submit a platform statement written by himself or a supporter.

the student legislature has more
members than the United States
Senate. A new legislature, com
posed of about fifteen members,
would be both more representa
tive and more effective. Also,
faculty members should be per
mitted to serve if elected by stu
dents.
Students must recognize when
they are being used by the Ad
ministration. There is a differ
ence between working with and
working for the Administration.
We seek support from all seg
ments of the student body. Spe
cifically, it is wrong to condemn
fraterities as a group. Students
should be treated as individuals,
and each fraternity should be
treated as an individual living
group. Also, we feel graduate
students can make significant
contributions to the student as
sociation.
Alumni Contact
We seek closer contact with
the alumni. At present, their
only formal contact with the
University is through the Ad
ministration. They should be in
formed of student views by a
student-written newsletter. Stu
dnnt speakers should attend
alumni dinners.
We need a good course evalu
ation booklet. Last year, with a
budget of $114,500.00, the legis
lature appropriated only $850.00
for a Scratch Sheet. You get
what you pay for, if you're
lucky. Course evaluation de
serves more money.
We need a union which will
get students discounts in local
stores, at ski resorts, etc. We
favor a permanent location for
the Experiment. Students want
a coffee house. We suggest it
be located atop Hoover Tower
and the Tower be covered with
ivy.
This campaign has raised
many issues which divide stu
dents, but certain goals are com
mon to all. This election is not
an end, but rather a beginning.
It is a time for all students to
assume an active role in student
affairs. We must unite behind
the new President if we are to
realize those goals we all share.

• SrU son
Fritz Schaefer and Gene Cub
bison are working to involve all
11,000 Stanford students in the
of <student government.
Their platform is:
Reform Of The Student
legislature
Fritz Schaefer, as a minority
voice in LASSU, has introduced
two bills to make the Legislature
representative. The first changes
the numbers of seats in LASSU
to 60 by providing for one repre
sentative for every 200 students.
This would give real importance
to LASSU seats and bring in
opinions from all sectors of the
university. The second bill
breaks down the graduate stu
dent constituencies into smaller,
workable units, one such being
the graduate Electrical Engi
neers, having 3 representatives
under the new system.
Educational Improvement
Schaefer and Cubbison feel
that the purpose of the univer
sity is to provide a climate in
which the individual student can
develop his academic interests
in those directions which he so
chooses.
They propose a permanent, ac
tive ASSU committee to investi
gate the quality of teaching at
Stanford. The purposes of this
committee would be 1) to pro
vide student feedback to instruc
tors and professors and 2) to
bring to reality the long express
ed student opinion that teaching
ability should be a definite fac
tor in decisions on academic
promotion.
Pass-fail meets a very real
need in providing a student with
an opportunity to broaden the
scope of his education by tak
ing a course in an area in which,
because of his background, he
feels unable to compete. Schaef
er and Cubbison favor the allo
cation of 15 units of general
studies requirements to each
student on a pass-fail basis.
Residences
The key to a successful hous
ing arrangement at Stanford is
to provide each student with a
choice from a diversity of attrac
tive possibilities. Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the elimination
of any of the present living
groups at Stanford. They wel
come the coed dorms as another
attractive possibility for Stan
ford students. They feel that in
dependents and freshmen should
be given the opportunity to have
the type of housing which sets
off the new fraternity clusters.
The need for liveable on-cam
pus housing for graduate stu
dents must be considered.
Schaefer and Cubbison propose
the more or less immediate con
struction of a number of small
graduate student houses for
single grad students. This would
also enable Escondido Village
to house more married students.
Experiment, Athletics, ROTO
Since, in practice, the Experi
ment now serves primarily as
a vehicle for one-sided political
indoctrination, Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the use of stu
dent funds by the Experiment.
They also oppose giving a per
manent home to the Experiment,
the Young Republicans, or any
other political group.
The chief problem with inter
collegiate athletics at Stanford is
that not enough enthusiastic
fans show up lor the football
games.
ROTC meets the needs of a
considerable number of stu
dents and should not be subject
ed to the unwarranted abuse
that it is presently receiving.

• Sharmhan-Levinjson

Yes, it's ASSU election time
again, that symbolic event of
Spring when hypocrisy is re
vealed in its most blatant forms,
when opportunism rises freely
to the surface and when endless
catechisms are intoned over the
absurdity of it all; some agitat
ors even go so far as to question
"why" the unwanted bastard,
ASSU, fathered and foisted upon
us by a shameless Administra
tion, should be allowed to exist.
And who should appear out of
the blue, according to exclusive
Daily coverage, but the sensi
tive and aware Candidate, eager
to point the way to the Real
University and perhaps at the
real university. When He speaks,
"spontaneous" crowds gather at
his feet and applaud. Other
"candidates" address themselves
to His positions . . . and He shall
be known by His White Papers.
Surely He is not to be denied!
But this Phenomenon is by no
means unique. Indeed, His ideas
as well as those of the other
candidates are rehashings of the
Presidential campaigns of the
past few years, with certain
relevant modifications on the
Wilbur Experiment, the Packer
Committee and OFF!
Platforms Similar
If differences between the
platforms are illusory, and I be
lieve they are, then much more
meaningful distinctions can be
made between the candidates.
Because student government
should exist to facilitate, not
merely to advocate, goals set
forth in platforms at election
time, the student body must in
sure that the President it
chooses will present a coherent
plan for dealing effectively with
rocklike administrative struc
tures, with diffident and apathet
ic students and with hesitant, if
willing, faculty members.
Experienced
There are two candidates run
ning for ASSU President and
ASSU Vice-President who have
articulated a viable, positive
plan for furthering student in
terests and student-initiated pro
posals. Their backgrounds re
veal broad-ranging experience in
dealing with students, faculty
and administrators in effecting
valuable programs and ideas at
Stanford. Unlike other candi
dates, they have been involved
with the opinion-making pro
cesses both within and outside
of student government since
their arrival at Stanford.
Unlike other candidates, they
are committed to involve those
with whom they differ at elec
tion time to participate in for
mulating, advocating and enact
ing our ideas next year; it is
important that all students with
an interest in and a commitment
to the achievement of tangible
goals, be they fundamentally
radical, moderate or conserva
tive, be involved. They are com
mitted to mobilizing and direct
ing your opinions and your ac
tions. They are receptive to your
ideas; they are not inflexibly
committed to a single sociologi
cal concept of effecting change,
nor will they remain silent and
merely react to delaying'tactics
or purposeful obscurantism by
administration and faculty.
They hope to lead you, with
your fullest consent and partici
pation, to a university which has
more fully reconciled its actual
existence with its ideal condi
tion. Tom Shanahan and Henry
Levinson deserve your support.
• Hansen-Church
We believe, as most of the
candidates do, that student in
volvement is central to creating
a University community and an
atmosphere conducive to per
sonal discovery through the ex
change of diverse viewpoints,
but we differ on what is the
best means of achieving these
ends. We do not agree with the
concept of student power. There
is no inherent power in ASSU.
If student power is supposed
to mean student force, we reject
the idea as not being the most
effective way of accomplishing
our goals. First, we doubt that
most Stanford students are will
ing to mobilize against the ad
ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary
gain that might be achieved by
rebelling students would be off
set by destroying lines of com
munication necessary for stu
dents to constructively negotiate
with the faculty and the admini
stration.
We substitute instead the con
cept of student influence, and it
must be a powerful and effec
tive influence. We do not see the
administration and students as
adversaries. We expect them to
be typically diverse elements of
the community who must be
willing to deal with each other
if any "community" is going to
be established and positive
changes made.
Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing
student influence is to have an
ASSU that is representative of
the students, not just a single
faction. Students are not going
to come to the ASSU President
to get involved, especially if he
represents a narrow philosophy
that excludes many of them. The
President will have to go to
them. He will have to attend
IFC, ICC, IHC, Wilbur council,
and graduate association meet
ings. He must encourage stu
dents to participate in solving
their own problems by co-ordi
nating and channeling their ef
forts.
By polarizing the student
government, radicals versus con
servatives, eventually we are
going to see the system, with
all the benefits it can provide in
creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat
ing a community of scholars
that includes faculty and stu
dents, but destroying what little
"community" of students we
now have. A community of stu
dents will depend on a rational
discussion between different
groups of students, based on
a respect for each other's opin
ions and purposes for being at
the University. There is no pos
sibility for rational discussion if
either side begins with the be
lief that they are absolutely
right and the time for debate
is past.
No one philosophy of educa
tion will be acceptable to all
students, and we feel tlr' a
united student philosophy i
a necessary ingredient v.j ac
complishing any positive change
at Stanford. We would submit
that many of the changes that
are being considered such as
coed housing and grading re
form do not necessarily have to
be limited to one philosophy of
education, thereby crystalizing
opposition becausc it is too nar
rowly defined.
To be legitimate, student gov
ernment must be representative.
It must speak for you, not to
you.

historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
fully understands his potential
and his freedom to choose a
role. Education, as it is now de
fined, threatens the student in
precisely those areas in which a
true education would develop
him: how to apply his intelli
gence to the world; how to re-

late honestly to others; how to
fulfill his needs to be creative;
how to live a sane life in a
rapidly changing society.
We can no longer afford to
ignore our interests. The follow
ing sketch of a community gov
ernment is a realistic alterna
tive to the disintegrated present.
The students and faculty will
each elect twenty-five represen
tatives to a community senate.
It would preside over a merger
of student, faculty and admini
strative investigative and initiat
ing committees. The senate will
find its support in the town
meeting, a convention of all stu
dents, graduate and undergradu
ate, scientific and artistic, satis
fied and dissatisfied. In these
large meetings students will rep
resent themselves to themselves
and to their fellows on the fac
ulty. Issues of importance to
the entire University must be
resolved by the community;
Stanford cannot afford nor
should it afford the mockery
of representative forms when it
can enjoy the luxury and fitness
of participatory democracy.
With the resolution and direct
ness available to the senate the
responsibility and comprehen
siveness of town meetings, the
students of Stanford will be firm
without being hostile, respon
sible without being dulled, con
cerned but not careless. The for
cefulness implicit in fair de
mands will emerge, and the Uni
versity will move for the better
ment of us all.
We do not seek the creation
of a "perfect residence" to be
copied by all others. We demand
only that the diversity of choice
become a greater number of real
alternatives, not the present
variations on a cell-block theme.
Let the residents of each living
group, in full responsibility, deal
with their residence as they will.
Thus, fraternities will be able to
exploit their full potential as
small, well-housed, autonomous
groups; a Stern house and a
house in Lagunita may wish to
exchange floors; and we can
attempt a co-op. In short, we
shall assess our needs and fill
them imaginatively.

• Reich-Kane
We seek a community of stu
dents. The concept of a "com
munity of scholars" is appealing
but unrealistic. Undergraduates
simply do not have the wide
spread faculty support and re
spect which would be necessary.
We must build a strong com
munity of students before we
can build a community of schol
ars.
The present student associa
tion, as defined in the ASSU
Constitution, is based on the con
cept of in loco parentis. The
Board of Trustees has granted
the students certain "privileges
and responsibilities." Student
government is structured like a
company union. It is a puppet
government, a government with
no real power.
We maintain that students
have certain rights. To assert
these rights, the ASSU must be
made a lobbying organization, a
bargaining power, a consumer's
union.
Restructure LASSU
We advocate a basic restruc
turing of LASSU. At present,

The Daily asked each of the five ASSU presidential candidates
to submit a platform statement written by himself or a supporter.

the student legislature has more
members than the United States
Senate. A new legislature, com
posed of about fifteen members,
would be both more representa
tive and more effective. Also,
faculty members should be per
mitted to serve if elected by stu
dents.
Students must recognize when
they are being used by the Ad
ministration. There is a differ
ence between working with and
working for the Administration.
We seek support from all seg
ments of the student body. Spe
cifically, it is wrong to condemn
fraterities as a group. Students
should be treated as individuals,
and each fraternity should be
treated as an individual living
group. Also, we feel graduate
students can make significant
contributions to the student as
sociation.
Alumni Contact
We seek closer contact with
the alumni. At present, their
only formal contact with the
University is through the Ad
ministration. They should be in
formed of student views by a
student-written newsletter. Stu
dnnt speakers should attend
alumni dinners.
We need a good course evalu
ation booklet. Last year, with a
budget of $114,500.00, the legis
lature appropriated only $850.00
for a Scratch Sheet. You get
what you pay for, if you're
lucky. Course evaluation de
serves more money.
We need a union which will
get students discounts in local
stores, at ski resorts, etc. We
favor a permanent location for
the Experiment. Students want
a coffee house. We suggest it
be located atop Hoover Tower
and the Tower be covered with
ivy.
This campaign has raised
many issues which divide stu
dents, but certain goals are com
mon to all. This election is not
an end, but rather a beginning.
It is a time for all students to
assume an active role in student
affairs. We must unite behind
the new President if we are to
realize those goals we all share.

• SrU son
Fritz Schaefer and Gene Cub
bison are working to involve all
11,000 Stanford students in the
of <student government.
Their platform is:
Reform Of The Student
legislature
Fritz Schaefer, as a minority
voice in LASSU, has introduced
two bills to make the Legislature
representative. The first changes
the numbers of seats in LASSU
to 60 by providing for one repre
sentative for every 200 students.
This would give real importance
to LASSU seats and bring in
opinions from all sectors of the
university. The second bill
breaks down the graduate stu
dent constituencies into smaller,
workable units, one such being
the graduate Electrical Engi
neers, having 3 representatives
under the new system.
Educational Improvement
Schaefer and Cubbison feel
that the purpose of the univer
sity is to provide a climate in
which the individual student can
develop his academic interests
in those directions which he so
chooses.
They propose a permanent, ac
tive ASSU committee to investi
gate the quality of teaching at
Stanford. The purposes of this
committee would be 1) to pro
vide student feedback to instruc
tors and professors and 2) to
bring to reality the long express
ed student opinion that teaching
ability should be a definite fac
tor in decisions on academic
promotion.
Pass-fail meets a very real
need in providing a student with
an opportunity to broaden the
scope of his education by tak
ing a course in an area in which,
because of his background, he
feels unable to compete. Schaef
er and Cubbison favor the allo
cation of 15 units of general
studies requirements to each
student on a pass-fail basis.
Residences
The key to a successful hous
ing arrangement at Stanford is
to provide each student with a
choice from a diversity of attrac
tive possibilities. Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the elimination
of any of the present living
groups at Stanford. They wel
come the coed dorms as another
attractive possibility for Stan
ford students. They feel that in
dependents and freshmen should
be given the opportunity to have
the type of housing which sets
off the new fraternity clusters.
The need for liveable on-cam
pus housing for graduate stu
dents must be considered.
Schaefer and Cubbison propose
the more or less immediate con
struction of a number of small
graduate student houses for
single grad students. This would
also enable Escondido Village
to house more married students.
Experiment, Athletics, ROTO
Since, in practice, the Experi
ment now serves primarily as
a vehicle for one-sided political
indoctrination, Schaefer and
Cubbison oppose the use of stu
dent funds by the Experiment.
They also oppose giving a per
manent home to the Experiment,
the Young Republicans, or any
other political group.
The chief problem with inter
collegiate athletics at Stanford is
that not enough enthusiastic
fans show up lor the football
games.
ROTC meets the needs of a
considerable number of stu
dents and should not be subject
ed to the unwarranted abuse
that it is presently receiving.

• Sharmhan-Levinjson

Yes, it's ASSU election time
again, that symbolic event of
Spring when hypocrisy is re
vealed in its most blatant forms,
when opportunism rises freely
to the surface and when endless
catechisms are intoned over the
absurdity of it all; some agitat
ors even go so far as to question
"why" the unwanted bastard,
ASSU, fathered and foisted upon
us by a shameless Administra
tion, should be allowed to exist.
And who should appear out of
the blue, according to exclusive
Daily coverage, but the sensi
tive and aware Candidate, eager
to point the way to the Real
University and perhaps at the
real university. When He speaks,
"spontaneous" crowds gather at
his feet and applaud. Other
"candidates" address themselves
to His positions . . . and He shall
be known by His White Papers.
Surely He is not to be denied!
But this Phenomenon is by no
means unique. Indeed, His ideas
as well as those of the other
candidates are rehashings of the
Presidential campaigns of the
past few years, with certain
relevant modifications on the
Wilbur Experiment, the Packer
Committee and OFF!
Platforms Similar
If differences between the
platforms are illusory, and I be
lieve they are, then much more
meaningful distinctions can be
made between the candidates.
Because student government
should exist to facilitate, not
merely to advocate, goals set
forth in platforms at election
time, the student body must in
sure that the President it
chooses will present a coherent
plan for dealing effectively with
rocklike administrative struc
tures, with diffident and apathet
ic students and with hesitant, if
willing, faculty members.
Experienced
There are two candidates run
ning for ASSU President and
ASSU Vice-President who have
articulated a viable, positive
plan for furthering student in
terests and student-initiated pro
posals. Their backgrounds re
veal broad-ranging experience in
dealing with students, faculty
and administrators in effecting
valuable programs and ideas at
Stanford. Unlike other candi
dates, they have been involved
with the opinion-making pro
cesses both within and outside
of student government since
their arrival at Stanford.
Unlike other candidates, they
are committed to involve those
with whom they differ at elec
tion time to participate in for
mulating, advocating and enact
ing our ideas next year; it is
important that all students with
an interest in and a commitment
to the achievement of tangible
goals, be they fundamentally
radical, moderate or conserva
tive, be involved. They are com
mitted to mobilizing and direct
ing your opinions and your ac
tions. They are receptive to your
ideas; they are not inflexibly
committed to a single sociologi
cal concept of effecting change,
nor will they remain silent and
merely react to delaying'tactics
or purposeful obscurantism by
administration and faculty.
They hope to lead you, with
your fullest consent and partici
pation, to a university which has
more fully reconciled its actual
existence with its ideal condi
tion. Tom Shanahan and Henry
Levinson deserve your support.
• Hansen-Church
We believe, as most of the
candidates do, that student in
volvement is central to creating
a University community and an
atmosphere conducive to per
sonal discovery through the ex
change of diverse viewpoints,
but we differ on what is the
best means of achieving these
ends. We do not agree with the
concept of student power. There
is no inherent power in ASSU.
If student power is supposed
to mean student force, we reject
the idea as not being the most
effective way of accomplishing
our goals. First, we doubt that
most Stanford students are will
ing to mobilize against the ad
ministration, and second, we feel
that if they did, any temporary
gain that might be achieved by
rebelling students would be off
set by destroying lines of com
munication necessary for stu
dents to constructively negotiate
with the faculty and the admini
stration.
We substitute instead the con
cept of student influence, and it
must be a powerful and effec
tive influence. We do not see the
administration and students as
adversaries. We expect them to
be typically diverse elements of
the community who must be
willing to deal with each other
if any "community" is going to
be established and positive
changes made.
Representative ASSU Needed
The first step in developing
student influence is to have an
ASSU that is representative of
the students, not just a single
faction. Students are not going
to come to the ASSU President
to get involved, especially if he
represents a narrow philosophy
that excludes many of them. The
President will have to go to
them. He will have to attend
IFC, ICC, IHC, Wilbur council,
and graduate association meet
ings. He must encourage stu
dents to participate in solving
their own problems by co-ordi
nating and channeling their ef
forts.
By polarizing the student
government, radicals versus con
servatives, eventually we are
going to see the system, with
all the benefits it can provide in
creating a student community,
collapse. Already this year sev
eral of the graduate schools
have tried to pull out of ASSU.
We are succeeding, not in creat
ing a community of scholars
that includes faculty and stu
dents, but destroying what little
"community" of students we
now have. A community of stu
dents will depend on a rational
discussion between different
groups of students, based on
a respect for each other's opin
ions and purposes for being at
the University. There is no pos
sibility for rational discussion if
either side begins with the be
lief that they are absolutely
right and the time for debate
is past.
No one philosophy of educa
tion will be acceptable to all
students, and we feel tlr' a
united student philosophy i
a necessary ingredient v.j ac
complishing any positive change
at Stanford. We would submit
that many of the changes that
are being considered such as
coed housing and grading re
form do not necessarily have to
be limited to one philosophy of
education, thereby crystalizing
opposition becausc it is too nar
rowly defined.
To be legitimate, student gov
ernment must be representative.
It must speak for you, not to
you.

• Lyman-Mnasarenti
Present University education
is the capstone of a well-defined
process of socialization, training,
and inculcation in which indivi
duals learn to fill pre-determined
roles and make correct behavior
responses. In understanding edu
cation to be training, the Uni
versity is preparing the student
neither to live a creative life nor
to fulfill his responsibilities as
a citizen. Not only is it futile to
train students for roles which
may not exist in the future, but
it is debasing to reduce the defi
nition of the student to his so
cial function, e.g., engineer or
historian, and expect the other
aspects of his existence to de
velop themselves.
Education, then, must be un
derstood as the development of
a mature person — one who
