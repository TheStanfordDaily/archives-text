# 'In-Crowd Conspiracy'
## Leaflets Create Elections Dispute 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Last-minute campaign action in the
ASSU presidential contest consisted
primarily of accusations and apol
ogies.
The controversy stemmed from
handbills posted in residences and
kiosks around Quad Monday night.
The sheets charged an "in-crowd" com
posed of members of Beta Chi, Grove
House, and The Dally as constituting
a "power" clique aiming to subvert
the election.
The posters were printed by an ad
hoc group entitled Students for Free
Elections (SFE). In a statement sub
mitted to The Daily last night, David
Mitchell, spokesman for the group,
said the material was "written by a
student who supported Joe Reich."
Broad-Based"
At an informal gathering in White
Plaza early yesterday afternoon
Mitchell had said that those who sup
ported the statement represented a
"broad-based" group, and that at least

three candidates had support among
the SFE. Among those distributing
the leaflets at noon were Mitchell,
Roger Fink, and David Vanbockel.
Candidates Joe Reich and Jeff Kane
said they did not have a part in draft
ing the statement, but knew about the
document and participated in its dis
tribution. Reich told The Daily, "We
regret that we had a role in the dis
tribution of the statement."
Statement
In a statement issued late yester
day afternoon Kane stated:
"I wish to formally express my
apologies to those individuals and liv
ing groups mentioned in the recent
statement entitled 'The In-Crowd.'
This campaign has placed me in a
position to which I am unaccustomed.
It is natural to criticize one's oppon
ent, but a negative outlook prevents
objectivity. I regret in the distribu
tion of the sheets. It is my firm con
viction now that the allegations are
fraudulent."

Kane also made a public apology
yesterday at a Wilbur election rally
sponsored by Lyman supporters.
Knew Nothing?
Candidates Pete Hansen and Tom
Shanahan said they knew nothing
about the origins of the "in-crowd"
statement before the sheets appeared
yesterday morning. Lyman campaign
workers said that they were informed
of the sheet by SFE representatives
at about 3 a.m. Tuesday.
Candidate Fritz Schaefer denied
having any connection with publica
tion but said that he had been con
tacted by Kane Sunday and asked to
sign the document. Schaefer refused
to endorse the statement.
Reich later said that he and Kane
"might have" contacted Schaefer on
Sunday to see if he were interested
in supporting the statement. Reich
also said that he had seen the docu
ment in its finished form for the first
time on Monday.
Commitment
Reich said the author of the state
ment had "gotten a commitment" that
his anonymity would be assured.
Mitchell's statement also said that the
allegations were drafted by one per
son, but that "the material however
was felt to reflect the plight of all
of Peter Lyman's opponents."
Mitchell further staled that Reich
and Kane participated in the distribu
tion of the sheets without the knowl
edge of the organization: "SFE re
grets that they made the delivery
since it opens the door to charges
that SFE is working in co-ordination
with Mr. Reich. This is definitely not
the situation.

Mitchell's statement said that at
tempts by Lyman and his supporters
to "pass SFE off as a campaign front
for one candidate" were "merely at
tempts to avoid the valid criticism
which SFE has offered."
Appearance
Mitchell had made early morning
appearances in Stern and the eating
clubs, explaining the purpose of the
sheets and saying that many of them
had already been torn down by
a Lyman campaign worker. The
posters were returned to Mitchell.
Elections Commissioner Bill Berry
said that no action on the matter
would be taken at the present time
and that it was unclear whether the
matter would fall within the Commis
sion's juridiction. He said that there
may have been some procedural vio'
lations which would ordinarily result
in a penalty or fine. Regarding the
allegations in the sheets themselves,
Berry said that the Commission had
no jurisdiction in this area but could
make a recommendation for judicial
action in the event of false or slander
ous accusations.
Last night a handbill appeared in
some women's dorms accusing can
didate Tom Shanahan of not voting
favorably in last fall's OFF referen
dum. The statement referred to a
recent KZSU interview in which Shan
ahan was questioned by Public Af
fairs Director Tim Logan. In a letter
to The Dally, Logan said he had given
no one permission to use his name in
connection with any such poster. At
time of Daily publication, no action
on this incident had been taken by the
Election Commission. The source of
the document was not known.
