# A 						Tree Is A Tree Is Not Free

Andy Mayo has noticed the rising
cost of just about everything lately â€”
particularly eucalyptus trees.
Cruising along Palm Drive, Wed
nesday, March 8, at a cool 45 miles
per hour, he hit a 25 m.p.h. speed
limit sign, and was stopped by a 50-
foot eucalyptus.
Several weeks later, he received a
bill for $440 from Perry B. Hackett,
Superintendent of Roads and Grounds,

explaining that the tree was "for prac
tical reasons, a total loss."
Attached to the bill was a statement
from University Agronomist Dirk
Schroder. "Seventy-five per cent of
the bark and the cambium layer are
removed or damaged," it explained.
Mayo was also charged $25 for the
speed limit sign, and is spending
Spring Quarter at Stanford in Austria
with his foot in a cast.
