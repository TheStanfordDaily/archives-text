# Jury Hung In Lane-Kaplan 'Trial'; 'Only Historians Can Decide Issue'
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
Protesting the strict limitations un
der which he had been placed, Mark
Lane, author of Rush To Judgment,
came to Stanford yesterday to "sue"
Professor John Kaplan of the Law
School for libel.
The mock trial, which took place in
Dinkelspiel, was the result of a chal
lenge Lane issued to Kaplan to de
bate. In that challenge Lane said
that Kaplan could "bring his own
rules and his own moderator." The
moderator selected was the Honor
able Sidney Feinberg, Judge of the
Palo Alto Municipal Court. The basis
for the "suit" was Kaplan's hypo
thetical statement that Rush To Judg
ment was "a tissue of deliberate dis
tortions."
Politics
Lane began by taking Kaplan to
task for trying to interject politics
into the discussion. This charge came
from a statement in a Kaplan article
entitled "The Assassins" which ap
peared in The American Scholar.
The statement was, "The great body
of complaint about the Commission
has come from the left."
In response to Lane's charge Kap
lan said, "I think that it is fairly
clear that it (Commission criticism)
has (come from the Left). The rea
son I give is a reason completely un
related to the veracity of Mr. Lane."
Claiming that the trial was being
held "for his satisfaction" Kaplan
went on to say that several of the
books which criticized the Warren
Commission Report "were deliberate
attempts to take advantage of their
gullible audience," and that "Mr.
Lane's book was an attempt to under
mine the Commission by sharp prac
tices, by quoting out of context, and
by a whole series of distortions."
Kaplan warned the audience that
Lane's only choice in answering his
charges would be to try and "frus
trate the inquiry." Kaplan asked the

audience to watch, "because if he
doesn't, well then I'm wrong, and if
he does, well then I'm right."
In the cross-examination period
Kaplan brought up four points which
he felt demonstrated the lengths to
which Lane had gone to convince his
readers. These included 1) Commis
sion Exhibit #399 â€” two fragments
of bullet which the Commission as
serted came from Lee Oswald's gun
and were found in President Kennedy's
car, 2) The now famous picture show
ing Oswald holding what is purported
to be the murder weapon; 3) The fact
that several witnesses claimed to have
seen a puff of smoke near the wooden
fence on the grassy knoll; 4) The
tape of the telephone conversation
between Lane and Mrs. Helen Mark
ham.
In all four of these areas Kaplan
attempted to show that by omissions
of fact or by quoting out of context
Lane had attempted to mislead his

audience. Lane answered each ques
tion in turn and tried to show that
there were sufficient reasons for his
book to raise the question that it did.
Lane's part of the cross-examina
tion period was continually interrupt
ed by Kaplan's objections that Lane
was straying too far afield from the
statements of the book. Lane argued
that he had to have some latitude in
order to disprove Kaplan's allega
tions. Judge Feinberg sustained most
of the objections, forcing Lane to
deal only with his book and Kaplan's
article.
In his closing remarks Kaplan said
that it would be very difficult to de
bate Lane because Lane "is a very
tricky man." Kaplan went on to sug
gest that Lane was not being com
pletely honest, and that he was guilty
of further distortion. Lane objected
to what he called "personal vitupera
tion."
Lane closed by reiterating his de

sire for a debate in the strict sense
of the word. He offered Kaplan all
the time he wanted to make his
charges, and suggested that a debate
format might be more edifying than
playing the "game" of courtroom
trial.
After the mock trial had ended,
Lane, in a statement to the Daily,
said that he was satisfied with the re
sults of the afternoon's discussion,
but felt that he had been forced to
rebut Kaplan's charges rather than
allowed to disprove them. Kaplan,
contacted by the Daily, said, "Thank
God it's over. Those who came pre
pared to believe me went away be
lieving me, and those who came pre
pared to believe Mr. Lane went away
believing Mr. Lane. Historians will
decide the issue."
KZSU will broadcast the tape of the
mock trial Monday evening at 7 and
Lane's Monday speech on Sunday at
7.
