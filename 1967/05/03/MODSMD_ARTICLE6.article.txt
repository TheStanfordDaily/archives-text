# Anti-Draft Union
## Anti-Draft Union Plans Future 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Active demonstrations against draft
boards, university ranking of stu
dents, and the draft in general were
proposed at an Anti-Draft Union
(ADU) meeting Monday night.
Courses of future action suggested
by the 35 members present ranged
from active civil disobedience pro
posed by ex-student president David
Harris to a continuing program of
information dissemination on con
scientious objection (C.0.) and legal
assistance.
Other ideas put forward include an
"attack" on Ford Ord Army base with

megaphones, sending a letter of con
gratulations to Muhammad Ali (Cas
sius Clay), and attaining more signa
tures to the "We won't go" petitions.
Harris unveiled a plan for nation
wide non-cooperation and non-obedi
ence for next October. "Objectors will
refuse to take any classification at all
from their draft boards, even with
the knowledge that a jail sentence
will inevitably follow," Harris stated.
Harris emphasized that this action
should be without political expecta
tion; it will be strictly personal. "We
don't want people to jump into this.
If you won't do it as an individual,
don't do it at all. It will be you alone
that will have to take the jail sen
tence," he added.
"We hope to build up a psychic com
munity," Harris stated. "This act is
not aimed at the government but at
the rest of the students in America."
"It will not be an attempt to change
Lyndon Johnson's mind, but an at
tempt to set up a community of resis
tance. We need to build an atmos
phere so that the government will not
be able to continue conscription."
Harris expects as many as 500 peo
ple to join the movement from this
area by next October. Present plans
call for press conferences to be called
all across the nation within the space
of 24 hours to release the names of
those who will refuse to cooperate.
A conference has been scheduled
for Sunday, May 14, at 2:00 p.m. at
Walden School in Berkeley to discuss
the project. People from throughout
the state are expected for the confer
ence.
In the immediate future, two dem
onstrations are planned for ADU in
San Francisco for next Monday. The
morning demonstration, at the San
Francisco Federal Building, will pro
test the arrest of Malcolm Dundro, a
former Peace Corps member.
Dundro was given a C.O. status
while in the Corps. He was convicted
of the violation of the Selective Ser
vice Act after he refused to accept
C.O. status on the grounds that it is
discriminatory.
The afternoon demonstration May 8
will be at the San Francisco draft
board, 300 MacAllister Street. It will
protest the hearings on the draft that
are to be held in Washington, D.C.,
next week.
"We may file into the draft board
and sit down or create a disturbance,"
announced Peter Ware, who chaired
the ADU meeting. "We will demon
strate against people getting together
to decide what to do with our lives."
Ware stated that "immediate atten
tion should be given to the abolish
ment of local draft institutions, in

cluding the disclosure of student rank
and grades to draft boards and the
National Service Office on campus.
On the subject of a student referen
dum to end student ranking, both
Ware and ADU member John Saari
commented that "the referendum
will have to be followed by some
kind of action. Otherwise, it may not
be heeded." Saari noted that other
schools have passed such referen
dums or have received 50-50 splits.
In regards to the "We won't go"
program, ADU secretary-treasurer
Gary Coutin announced that there was
"poor reaction in the community to
The Dally ad" of April 25. "We re
ceived only 15 more signatures in the
mail. People at Stanford are too safe,
too complacent." There are presently
208 signatures to the "We won't go"
petition.
Plans to place an ad in the Chron
icle were termed "impractical at pres
ent," by Coutin. S.F. State and Berke
ley are now being solicited to share
the costs.
Ware also disclosed that a legal
service may be set up in the future
for those threatened with induction
by their boards. Legal counseling on
loyalty oaths and how to make the
draft system not want an individual
is also being considered.
At the beginning of the meeting,
Ware emphasized that the Union is
"all-inclusive. We will not exclude
anyone who wants to resist the draft
in any way. We are all opposed to the
system in one way or another." He
termed Harris' proposal of non-coop
eration "a brave, legitimate action."

and grades to draft boards and the
National Service Office on campus.
On the subject of a student referen
dum to end student ranking, both
Ware and ADU member John Saari
commented that "the referendum
will have to be followed by some
kind of action. Otherwise, it may not
be heeded." Saari noted that other
schools have passed such referen
dums or have received 50-50 splits.
In regards to the "We won't go"
program, ADU secretary-treasurer
Gary Coutin announced that there was
"poor reaction in the community to
The Dally ad" of April 25. "We re
ceived only 15 more signatures in the
mail. People at Stanford are too safe,
too complacent." There are presently
208 signatures to the "We won't go"
petition.
Plans to place an ad in the Chron
icle were termed "impractical at pres
ent," by Coutin. S.F. State and Berke
ley are now being solicited to share
the costs.
Ware also disclosed that a legal
service may be set up in the future
for those threatened with induction
by their boards. Legal counseling on
loyalty oaths and how to make the
draft system not want an individual
is also being considered.
At the beginning of the meeting,
Ware emphasized that the Union is
"all-inclusive. We will not exclude
anyone who wants to resist the draft
in any way. We are all opposed to the
system in one way or another." He
termed Harris' proposal of non-coop
eration "a brave, legitimate action."
Active demonstrations against draft
boards, university ranking of stu
dents, and the draft in general were
proposed at an Anti-Draft Union
(ADU) meeting Monday night.
Courses of future action suggested
by the 35 members present ranged
from active civil disobedience pro
posed by ex-student president David
Harris to a continuing program of
information dissemination on con
scientious objection (C.0.) and legal
assistance.
Other ideas put forward include an
"attack" on Ford Ord Army base with

megaphones, sending a letter of con
gratulations to Muhammad Ali (Cas
sius Clay), and attaining more signa
tures to the "We won't go" petitions.
Harris unveiled a plan for nation
wide non-cooperation and non-obedi
ence for next October. "Objectors will
refuse to take any classification at all
from their draft boards, even with
the knowledge that a jail sentence
will inevitably follow," Harris stated.
Harris emphasized that this action
should be without political expecta
tion; it will be strictly personal. "We
don't want people to jump into this.
If you won't do it as an individual,
don't do it at all. It will be you alone
that will have to take the jail sen
tence," he added.
"We hope to build up a psychic com
munity," Harris stated. "This act is
not aimed at the government but at
the rest of the students in America."
"It will not be an attempt to change
Lyndon Johnson's mind, but an at
tempt to set up a community of resis
tance. We need to build an atmos
phere so that the government will not
be able to continue conscription."
Harris expects as many as 500 peo
ple to join the movement from this
area by next October. Present plans
call for press conferences to be called
all across the nation within the space
of 24 hours to release the names of
those who will refuse to cooperate.
A conference has been scheduled
for Sunday, May 14, at 2:00 p.m. at
Walden School in Berkeley to discuss
the project. People from throughout
the state are expected for the confer
ence.
In the immediate future, two dem
onstrations are planned for ADU in
San Francisco for next Monday. The
morning demonstration, at the San
Francisco Federal Building, will pro
test the arrest of Malcolm Dundro, a
former Peace Corps member.
Dundro was given a C.O. status
while in the Corps. He was convicted
of the violation of the Selective Ser
vice Act after he refused to accept
C.O. status on the grounds that it is
discriminatory.
The afternoon demonstration May 8
will be at the San Francisco draft
board, 300 MacAllister Street. It will
protest the hearings on the draft that
are to be held in Washington, D.C.,
next week.
"We may file into the draft board
and sit down or create a disturbance,"
announced Peter Ware, who chaired
the ADU meeting. "We will demon
strate against people getting together
to decide what to do with our lives."
Ware stated that "immediate atten
tion should be given to the abolish
ment of local draft institutions, in

cluding the disclosure of student rank

National Service Office on campus.

Harris expects as many as 500 peo
ple to join the movement from this
area by next October. Present plans
call for press conferences to be called
all across the nation within the space
of 24 hours to release the names of
those who will refuse to cooperate.
A conference has been scheduled
for Sunday, May 14, at 2:00 p.m. at
Walden School in Berkeley to discuss
the project. People from throughout
the state are expected for the confer
ence.
In the immediate future, two dem
onstrations are planned for ADU in
San Francisco for next Monday. The
morning demonstration, at the San
Francisco Federal Building, will pro
test the arrest of Malcolm Dundro, a
former Peace Corps member.
Dundro was given a C.O. status
while in the Corps. He was convicted
of the violation of the Selective Ser
vice Act after he refused to accept
C.O. status on the grounds that it is
discriminatory.
The afternoon demonstration May 8
will be at the San Francisco draft
board, 300 MacAllister Street. It will
protest the hearings on the draft that
are to be held in Washington, D.C.,
next week.
"We may file into the draft board
and sit down or create a disturbance,"
announced Peter Ware, who chaired
the ADU meeting. "We will demon
strate against people getting together
to decide what to do with our lives."
Ware stated that "immediate atten
tion should be given to the abolish
ment of local draft institutions, in

cluding the disclosure of student rank
and grades to draft boards and the
National Service Office on campus.
On the subject of a student referen
dum to end student ranking, both
Ware and ADU member John Saari
commented that "the referendum
will have to be followed by some
kind of action. Otherwise, it may not
be heeded." Saari noted that other
schools have passed such referen
dums or have received 50-50 splits.
In regards to the "We won't go"
program, ADU secretary-treasurer
Gary Coutin announced that there was
"poor reaction in the community to
The Dally ad" of April 25. "We re
ceived only 15 more signatures in the
mail. People at Stanford are too safe,
too complacent." There are presently
208 signatures to the "We won't go"
petition.
Plans to place an ad in the Chron
icle were termed "impractical at pres
ent," by Coutin. S.F. State and Berke
ley are now being solicited to share
the costs.
Ware also disclosed that a legal
service may be set up in the future
for those threatened with induction
by their boards. Legal counseling on
loyalty oaths and how to make the
draft system not want an individual
is also being considered.
At the beginning of the meeting,
Ware emphasized that the Union is
"all-inclusive. We will not exclude
anyone who wants to resist the draft
in any way. We are all opposed to the
system in one way or another." He
termed Harris' proposal of non-coop
eration "a brave, legitimate action."
