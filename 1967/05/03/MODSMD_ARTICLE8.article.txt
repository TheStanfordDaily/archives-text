# Thurber, Character Sketches To Highlight Spring One-Acts
## 
### 
Ram's Head presents the first
of its Spring One-Acts tonight
as it presents "A Thurber Carni
val" on The Nitery stage at 8:30
p.m.
Included in tonight's show are
excerpts from Thurber's wit,
"The Night That the Bed Fell
On Father" and the pre-psyche
delie fantasies of "A Unicorn In
The Garden." A combo high
lights sylizations of his most
famous cartoon captions.
Appearing with Thurbur is a
stark character study named "A
Cold Day in Hell." The play is
making its west coast debut and
is a trilogy of sketches.
The first sketch is "AM." It
tells of the roleplaying escapism
of a typical New York couple.
The entire scene is played on a
bed.
The middle sketch is "PM,"
in which a stereotyped Scarsdale
Matron soliloquizes while sure

pititiously refilling her martini
from a flask as she spends an
hour at. the Schrafts fountain.
Ending the trilogy is "The
Morning After" which confronts
the question of identity, as four
young men attempt to define
their existence in a new and
strange environment. One fan
tasizes a sea-shore, another a
jungle, a third a hostile place.
Ticket sales for Spring One-
Acts continue today in front of
the Post Office, at the Tresidder
Box Office, and at the door on
the evening of performances.
One-Acts play tonight through
Saturday .
Spring One-Acts is a produc
tion of Ram's Head Board fea
turing the directing talents of
candidates for the Speech and
Drama Department's Master of
Fine Arts Degree. Producer for
this year's show is Lisa Gon
zalez.
