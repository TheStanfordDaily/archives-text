# Pass-Fail: Solution To Grade Problem?
## 
### LINDSAY BLACKMAN 
Why not exttyid pass-fail grading? What
about grading courses in General Studies and
in the major on a pass-fail basis? What's
wrong with a pass-fail freshman year?
It appears that extension of the concept
of pass-fail grading calls for more than a
mere bureaucratic reshuffling. Before such
a change can be implemented, a host of con
sequences must be considered by administra
tors, faculty members, and students alike.
University Registrar Harvey Hall feels that
i traditional grading scale provides a more
refined "qualitative distinction among stu
dents" than does pass-fail. He saw a grad
ing system performing two primary func
tions: 1) discriminating among students des
tined for graduate study, and 2) determining
eligibility of students for limited scholarship
and loan resources.
Other Criteria
Pass-fail proponents criticize the grading
system for performing a sorting process they
feel should be left to graduate schools. They
cite criteria other than a student's academic
record — Graduate Record Examinations, law
and medical boards, and personal recommen
dations — that could be employed in select
ing students for graduate work.
A Daily editorial of April 19 criticized the
present grading system for its dependence
on "statistics so often based on the whims
of section leaders or the rigid mathematics
of a professor's curve."
Hall pointed out, however, that studies of
graduate student performance have shown a
student's academic record to be the best in

dicator of success, with tests second and rec
ommendations last.
The Registrar's Advisory Committee has
discussed possible extension of pass-fail to
include General Studies courses and the en
tire freshman year, Hall said.
Pass-Fail Elsewhere
Pass-fail system at other universities can
be examined to give some idea of how the
system would function at Stanford, although
most of these arrangements do not serve as
helpful examples, since each college sets dif
ferent requirements for its students.
California Institute of Technology, for ex
ample, has a pass-fail freshman year, but its
freshman are required to take a fairly rigid
program emphasizing math and science. Cal
Tech's experience is not significant for Stan
ford's elective system, according to Hall.
In favor of reducing the number of grad
ing categories, Hall described a grading sys
tem currently under consideration. It would
evaluate work as honors (B plus and above),
pass, or fail.
Hall noted that while many students tak
ing a course pass-fail perform admirably, oth
ers use a passing grade as a camouflage for
mediocrity.
The "GPA Game"
The Registrar also observed that the pass
fail option was being abused by students in
terested only in maintaining their grade point
average rather than broadening their educa
tional experience.
Pass-fail declarations are due within the
first four weeks of a quarter. Hall cited a"sig
nificant number" of petitions for change of
pass-fail declaration occurring after the dead

line. He concedes that it is difficult to deter
mine whether these petitions result from di
latory decisions, sluggish bookkeeping, or
from students playing the GPA numbers
game.
Pass-Fail Statistics
Numbers tell the story of pass-fail's first
two quarters at Stanford. Autumn quarter,
1091 students elected the option, 1008 passed,
37 failed (a rate of 3.3'?->, 41 had incom
pletes and 5 took conditional withdrawals.
During winter quarter, 1521 took courses pass
fail, 1443 passed, 30 failed ,1.97'i), with 38
incompletes and 10 conditional withdrawals.
Hall noted that the failure rate in courses
taken on a pass-fail basis was higher than
in graded courses; during the 1964-65 academic
year, the failure rate was about 1V2%.
The Registrar emphasized that it is diffi
cult to draw conclusions from this data,
since the pass-fail experiment at Stanford
is relatively young. As more statistics are
assembled on the performance of pass-fail,
more accurate observations can be made
as to the effectiveness of the option.
Hall predicted that the Registrar's Ad
visory Committee will continue its consid
eration of possibilities for extending pass
fail.
Briggs Reviews Pass-Fail
Biology professor Winslow Briggs, chair
man of the Registrar's Advisory Commit
tee, agreed that a "careful assessment"
must be made of the pass-fail experiment.
Briggs felt it not in the spirit of pass-fail
for students to make switches merely to
guard their GPAs, but he wondered wheth
er this "hypocrisy element" should be con

sidered a necessary reason to discontinue
pass-fail or prevent its extension.
Briggs favored an extension of pass-fail,
but felt that additional information on its
performance was needed before the sys
tem can be expanded.
Briggs pointed out factors that different
iate Stanford from other schools, such as
Pamona and UC at Santa Clara, where
pass-fail experiments have been tried. Stan
ford's student body is more heterogeneous,
and there are generally more students in
any class here, fewer of whom are known
by the professor.
Briggs felt that direct communication be
tween a student and his professors is an
important, if not essential, aspect of edu
cation. He considered that Stanford is de
ficient in this respect.
While the personal element is important,
Briggs noted that the additional spur of a
large course might play an important moti
vation role. To blindly institute a complete
pass-fail system might result in an erosion
of student motivation.
The question is whether students really
need the push of grades or whether they have
sufficient intellectual energy to fuel their quest
for knowledge.
Briggs also mentioned that many advanced
undergraduate courses are heavily enrolled
with graduate students, who supposedly have
a different motivation in taking these classes.
Peter Dahl, Assistant to the Director of
General Studies, had some thoughts on the
extension of pass-fail grading to General Stu
dies courses. He conceded that graduate
schools are not vitally concerned with a stu

dent's performance in a General Studies
course.
But Dahl pointed out that instituting pass
fail in General Studies courses would require
the approval and cooperation of the many de
partments involved. He felt that pass-fail
General Studies courses might be neglected
while students concentrated on graded
courses.
Grade consciousness is a habit Stanford
students acquire in the fierce high school
competition they must survive to be ad
mitted. To expect students to suddenly
wean themselves from grades and pursue
knolwedge for its own sake would be naive.
But to believe that the transition can never
be made would be cynical. Between these
two views lie a solution.
From his own teaching experience, Dahl
has observed that students fail to complete
the work for a course when they are being
graded in it. He wonders whether students
in a pass-fail course would perform any
better.
Prevailing Attitudes
The prevailing attitude toward pass-fai
seems to be this: pass-fail is a valuable ex
periment which should be continued; discus
sion about extending pass-fail should con
tinue as more data becomes available in fu
ture quarters; and although pass-fail grad
ing may alleviate a philistine attitude to
ward knowledge, it is not likely to be a
panacea for the problems of the University.
Going gradeless is an increasingly attrac
tive idea. But those charged with making
the decision continue considering the con
sequences.

Pass-Fail Statistics
Numbers tell the story of pass-fail's first
two quarters at Stanford. Autumn quarter,
1091 students elected the option, 1008 passed,
37 failed (a rate of 3.3'?->, 41 had incom
pletes and 5 took conditional withdrawals.
During winter quarter, 1521 took courses pass
fail, 1443 passed, 30 failed ,1.97'i), with 38
incompletes and 10 conditional withdrawals.
Hall noted that the failure rate in courses
taken on a pass-fail basis was higher than
in graded courses; during the 1964-65 academic
year, the failure rate was about 1V2%.
The Registrar emphasized that it is diffi
cult to draw conclusions from this data,
since the pass-fail experiment at Stanford
is relatively young. As more statistics are
assembled on the performance of pass-fail,
more accurate observations can be made
as to the effectiveness of the option.
Hall predicted that the Registrar's Ad
visory Committee will continue its consid
eration of possibilities for extending pass
fail.
Briggs Reviews Pass-Fail
Biology professor Winslow Briggs, chair
man of the Registrar's Advisory Commit
tee, agreed that a "careful assessment"
must be made of the pass-fail experiment.
Briggs felt it not in the spirit of pass-fail
for students to make switches merely to
guard their GPAs, but he wondered wheth
er this "hypocrisy element" should be con

sidered a necessary reason to discontinue
pass-fail or prevent its extension.
Briggs favored an extension of pass-fail,
but felt that additional information on its
performance was needed before the sys
tem can be expanded.
Briggs pointed out factors that different
iate Stanford from other schools, such as
Pamona and UC at Santa Clara, where
pass-fail experiments have been tried. Stan
ford's student body is more heterogeneous,
and there are generally more students in
any class here, fewer of whom are known
by the professor.
Briggs felt that direct communication be
tween a student and his professors is an
important, if not essential, aspect of edu
cation. He considered that Stanford is de
ficient in this respect.
While the personal element is important,
Briggs noted that the additional spur of a
large course might play an important moti
vation role. To blindly institute a complete
pass-fail system might result in an erosion
of student motivation.
The question is whether students really
need the push of grades or whether they have
sufficient intellectual energy to fuel their quest
for knowledge.
Briggs also mentioned that many advanced
undergraduate courses are heavily enrolled
with graduate students, who supposedly have
a different motivation in taking these classes.
Peter Dahl, Assistant to the Director of
General Studies, had some thoughts on the
extension of pass-fail grading to General Stu
dies courses. He conceded that graduate
schools are not vitally concerned with a stu

dent's performance in a General Studies
course.
But Dahl pointed out that instituting pass
fail in General Studies courses would require
the approval and cooperation of the many de
partments involved. He felt that pass-fail
General Studies courses might be neglected
while students concentrated on graded
courses.
Grade consciousness is a habit Stanford
students acquire in the fierce high school
competition they must survive to be ad
mitted. To expect students to suddenly
wean themselves from grades and pursue
knolwedge for its own sake would be naive.
But to believe that the transition can never
be made would be cynical. Between these
two views lie a solution.
From his own teaching experience, Dahl
has observed that students fail to complete
the work for a course when they are being
graded in it. He wonders whether students
in a pass-fail course would perform any
better.
Prevailing Attitudes
The prevailing attitude toward pass-fai
seems to be this: pass-fail is a valuable ex
periment which should be continued; discus
sion about extending pass-fail should con
tinue as more data becomes available in fu
ture quarters; and although pass-fail grad
ing may alleviate a philistine attitude to
ward knowledge, it is not likely to be a
panacea for the problems of the University.
Going gradeless is an increasingly attrac
tive idea. But those charged with making
the decision continue considering the con
sequences.
Why not exttyid pass-fail grading? What
about grading courses in General Studies and
in the major on a pass-fail basis? What's
wrong with a pass-fail freshman year?
It appears that extension of the concept
of pass-fail grading calls for more than a
mere bureaucratic reshuffling. Before such
a change can be implemented, a host of con
sequences must be considered by administra
tors, faculty members, and students alike.
University Registrar Harvey Hall feels that
i traditional grading scale provides a more
refined "qualitative distinction among stu
dents" than does pass-fail. He saw a grad
ing system performing two primary func
tions: 1) discriminating among students des
tined for graduate study, and 2) determining
eligibility of students for limited scholarship
and loan resources.
Other Criteria
Pass-fail proponents criticize the grading
system for performing a sorting process they
feel should be left to graduate schools. They
cite criteria other than a student's academic
record — Graduate Record Examinations, law
and medical boards, and personal recommen
dations — that could be employed in select
ing students for graduate work.
A Daily editorial of April 19 criticized the
present grading system for its dependence
on "statistics so often based on the whims
of section leaders or the rigid mathematics
of a professor's curve."
Hall pointed out, however, that studies of
graduate student performance have shown a
student's academic record to be the best in

dicator of success, with tests second and rec
ommendations last.
The Registrar's Advisory Committee has
discussed possible extension of pass-fail to
include General Studies courses and the en
tire freshman year, Hall said.
Pass-Fail Elsewhere
Pass-fail system at other universities can
be examined to give some idea of how the
system would function at Stanford, although
most of these arrangements do not serve as
helpful examples, since each college sets dif
ferent requirements for its students.
California Institute of Technology, for ex
ample, has a pass-fail freshman year, but its
freshman are required to take a fairly rigid
program emphasizing math and science. Cal
Tech's experience is not significant for Stan
ford's elective system, according to Hall.
In favor of reducing the number of grad
ing categories, Hall described a grading sys
tem currently under consideration. It would
evaluate work as honors (B plus and above),
pass, or fail.
Hall noted that while many students tak
ing a course pass-fail perform admirably, oth
ers use a passing grade as a camouflage for
mediocrity.
The "GPA Game"
The Registrar also observed that the pass
fail option was being abused by students in
terested only in maintaining their grade point
average rather than broadening their educa
tional experience.
Pass-fail declarations are due within the
first four weeks of a quarter. Hall cited a"sig
nificant number" of petitions for change of
pass-fail declaration occurring after the dead

line. He concedes that it is difficult to deter
mine whether these petitions result from di
latory decisions, sluggish bookkeeping, or
from students playing the GPA numbers
game.

partments involved. He felt that pass-fail
General Studies courses might be neglected
while students concentrated on graded
courses.
Grade consciousness is a habit Stanford
students acquire in the fierce high school
competition they must survive to be ad
mitted. To expect students to suddenly
wean themselves from grades and pursue
knolwedge for its own sake would be naive.
But to believe that the transition can never
be made would be cynical. Between these
two views lie a solution.
From his own teaching experience, Dahl
has observed that students fail to complete
the work for a course when they are being
graded in it. He wonders whether students
in a pass-fail course would perform any
better.
Prevailing Attitudes
The prevailing attitude toward pass-fai
seems to be this: pass-fail is a valuable ex
periment which should be continued; discus
sion about extending pass-fail should con
tinue as more data becomes available in fu
ture quarters; and although pass-fail grad
ing may alleviate a philistine attitude to
ward knowledge, it is not likely to be a
panacea for the problems of the University.
Going gradeless is an increasingly attrac
tive idea. But those charged with making
the decision continue considering the con
sequences.
Why not exttyid pass-fail grading? What
about grading courses in General Studies and
in the major on a pass-fail basis? What's
wrong with a pass-fail freshman year?
It appears that extension of the concept
of pass-fail grading calls for more than a
mere bureaucratic reshuffling. Before such
a change can be implemented, a host of con
sequences must be considered by administra
tors, faculty members, and students alike.
University Registrar Harvey Hall feels that
i traditional grading scale provides a more
refined "qualitative distinction among stu
dents" than does pass-fail. He saw a grad
ing system performing two primary func
tions: 1) discriminating among students des
tined for graduate study, and 2) determining
eligibility of students for limited scholarship
and loan resources.
Other Criteria
Pass-fail proponents criticize the grading
system for performing a sorting process they
feel should be left to graduate schools. They
cite criteria other than a student's academic
record — Graduate Record Examinations, law
and medical boards, and personal recommen
dations — that could be employed in select
ing students for graduate work.
A Daily editorial of April 19 criticized the
present grading system for its dependence
on "statistics so often based on the whims
of section leaders or the rigid mathematics
of a professor's curve."
Hall pointed out, however, that studies of
graduate student performance have shown a
student's academic record to be the best in

dicator of success, with tests second and rec
ommendations last.
The Registrar's Advisory Committee has
discussed possible extension of pass-fail to
include General Studies courses and the en
tire freshman year, Hall said.
Pass-Fail Elsewhere
Pass-fail system at other universities can
be examined to give some idea of how the
system would function at Stanford, although
most of these arrangements do not serve as
helpful examples, since each college sets dif
ferent requirements for its students.
California Institute of Technology, for ex
ample, has a pass-fail freshman year, but its
freshman are required to take a fairly rigid
program emphasizing math and science. Cal
Tech's experience is not significant for Stan
ford's elective system, according to Hall.
In favor of reducing the number of grad
ing categories, Hall described a grading sys
tem currently under consideration. It would
evaluate work as honors (B plus and above),
pass, or fail.
Hall noted that while many students tak
ing a course pass-fail perform admirably, oth
ers use a passing grade as a camouflage for
mediocrity.
The "GPA Game"
The Registrar also observed that the pass
fail option was being abused by students in
terested only in maintaining their grade point
average rather than broadening their educa
tional experience.
Pass-fail declarations are due within the
first four weeks of a quarter. Hall cited a"sig
nificant number" of petitions for change of
pass-fail declaration occurring after the dead

line. He concedes that it is difficult to deter
mine whether these petitions result from di
latory decisions, sluggish bookkeeping, or
from students playing the GPA numbers
game.
Pass-Fail Statistics
Numbers tell the story of pass-fail's first
two quarters at Stanford. Autumn quarter,
1091 students elected the option, 1008 passed,
37 failed (a rate of 3.3'?->, 41 had incom
pletes and 5 took conditional withdrawals.
During winter quarter, 1521 took courses pass
fail, 1443 passed, 30 failed ,1.97'i), with 38
incompletes and 10 conditional withdrawals.
Hall noted that the failure rate in courses
taken on a pass-fail basis was higher than
in graded courses; during the 1964-65 academic
year, the failure rate was about 1V2%.
The Registrar emphasized that it is diffi
cult to draw conclusions from this data,
since the pass-fail experiment at Stanford
is relatively young. As more statistics are
assembled on the performance of pass-fail,
more accurate observations can be made
as to the effectiveness of the option.
Hall predicted that the Registrar's Ad
visory Committee will continue its consid
eration of possibilities for extending pass
fail.
Briggs Reviews Pass-Fail
Biology professor Winslow Briggs, chair
man of the Registrar's Advisory Commit
tee, agreed that a "careful assessment"
must be made of the pass-fail experiment.
Briggs felt it not in the spirit of pass-fail
for students to make switches merely to
guard their GPAs, but he wondered wheth
er this "hypocrisy element" should be con

sidered a necessary reason to discontinue
pass-fail or prevent its extension.
Briggs favored an extension of pass-fail,
but felt that additional information on its
performance was needed before the sys
tem can be expanded.
Briggs pointed out factors that different
iate Stanford from other schools, such as
Pamona and UC at Santa Clara, where
pass-fail experiments have been tried. Stan
ford's student body is more heterogeneous,
and there are generally more students in
any class here, fewer of whom are known
by the professor.
Briggs felt that direct communication be
tween a student and his professors is an
important, if not essential, aspect of edu
cation. He considered that Stanford is de
ficient in this respect.
While the personal element is important,
Briggs noted that the additional spur of a
large course might play an important moti
vation role. To blindly institute a complete
pass-fail system might result in an erosion
of student motivation.
The question is whether students really
need the push of grades or whether they have
sufficient intellectual energy to fuel their quest
for knowledge.
Briggs also mentioned that many advanced
undergraduate courses are heavily enrolled
with graduate students, who supposedly have
a different motivation in taking these classes.
Peter Dahl, Assistant to the Director of
General Studies, had some thoughts on the
extension of pass-fail grading to General Stu
dies courses. He conceded that graduate
schools are not vitally concerned with a stu

dent's performance in a General Studies
course.
But Dahl pointed out that instituting pass

helpful examples, since each college sets dif
ferent requirements for its students.
California Institute of Technology, for ex
ample, has a pass-fail freshman year, but its
freshman are required to take a fairly rigid
program emphasizing math and science. Cal
Tech's experience is not significant for Stan
ford's elective system, according to Hall.
In favor of reducing the number of grad
ing categories, Hall described a grading sys
tem currently under consideration. It would
evaluate work as honors (B plus and above),
pass, or fail.
Hall noted that while many students tak
ing a course pass-fail perform admirably, oth
ers use a passing grade as a camouflage for
mediocrity.
The "GPA Game"
The Registrar also observed that the pass
fail option was being abused by students in
terested only in maintaining their grade point
average rather than broadening their educa
tional experience.
Pass-fail declarations are due within the
first four weeks of a quarter. Hall cited a"sig
nificant number" of petitions for change of
pass-fail declaration occurring after the dead

line. He concedes that it is difficult to deter
mine whether these petitions result from di
latory decisions, sluggish bookkeeping, or
from students playing the GPA numbers
game.
Pass-Fail Statistics
Numbers tell the story of pass-fail's first
two quarters at Stanford. Autumn quarter,
1091 students elected the option, 1008 passed,
37 failed (a rate of 3.3'?->, 41 had incom
pletes and 5 took conditional withdrawals.
During winter quarter, 1521 took courses pass
fail, 1443 passed, 30 failed ,1.97'i), with 38
incompletes and 10 conditional withdrawals.
Hall noted that the failure rate in courses
taken on a pass-fail basis was higher than
in graded courses; during the 1964-65 academic
year, the failure rate was about 1V2%.
The Registrar emphasized that it is diffi
cult to draw conclusions from this data,
since the pass-fail experiment at Stanford
is relatively young. As more statistics are
assembled on the performance of pass-fail,
more accurate observations can be made
as to the effectiveness of the option.
Hall predicted that the Registrar's Ad
visory Committee will continue its consid
eration of possibilities for extending pass
fail.
Briggs Reviews Pass-Fail
Biology professor Winslow Briggs, chair
man of the Registrar's Advisory Commit
tee, agreed that a "careful assessment"
must be made of the pass-fail experiment.
Briggs felt it not in the spirit of pass-fail
for students to make switches merely to
guard their GPAs, but he wondered wheth
er this "hypocrisy element" should be con

sidered a necessary reason to discontinue
pass-fail or prevent its extension.
Briggs favored an extension of pass-fail,
but felt that additional information on its
performance was needed before the sys
tem can be expanded.
Briggs pointed out factors that different
iate Stanford from other schools, such as
Pamona and UC at Santa Clara, where
pass-fail experiments have been tried. Stan
ford's student body is more heterogeneous,
and there are generally more students in
any class here, fewer of whom are known
by the professor.
Briggs felt that direct communication be
tween a student and his professors is an
important, if not essential, aspect of edu
cation. He considered that Stanford is de
ficient in this respect.
While the personal element is important,
Briggs noted that the additional spur of a
large course might play an important moti
vation role. To blindly institute a complete
pass-fail system might result in an erosion
of student motivation.
The question is whether students really
need the push of grades or whether they have
sufficient intellectual energy to fuel their quest
for knowledge.
Briggs also mentioned that many advanced
undergraduate courses are heavily enrolled
with graduate students, who supposedly have
a different motivation in taking these classes.
Peter Dahl, Assistant to the Director of
General Studies, had some thoughts on the
extension of pass-fail grading to General Stu
dies courses. He conceded that graduate
schools are not vitally concerned with a stu

dent's performance in a General Studies
course.
But Dahl pointed out that instituting pass
fail in General Studies courses would require
the approval and cooperation of the many de
partments involved. He felt that pass-fail
General Studies courses might be neglected
while students concentrated on graded
courses.
Grade consciousness is a habit Stanford
students acquire in the fierce high school
competition they must survive to be ad
mitted. To expect students to suddenly
wean themselves from grades and pursue
knolwedge for its own sake would be naive.
But to believe that the transition can never
be made would be cynical. Between these
two views lie a solution.
From his own teaching experience, Dahl
has observed that students fail to complete
the work for a course when they are being
graded in it. He wonders whether students
in a pass-fail course would perform any
better.
Prevailing Attitudes
The prevailing attitude toward pass-fai
seems to be this: pass-fail is a valuable ex
periment which should be continued; discus
sion about extending pass-fail should con
tinue as more data becomes available in fu
ture quarters; and although pass-fail grad
ing may alleviate a philistine attitude to
ward knowledge, it is not likely to be a
panacea for the problems of the University.
Going gradeless is an increasingly attrac
tive idea. But those charged with making
the decision continue considering the con
sequences.
