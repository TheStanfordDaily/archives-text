# 'Teamwork' Helps Men With Records
## 
### 
If a man has a record with a
prison or mental institution he
may well be laboring under a
"hidden handicap." The difficulty
that such a record brings in
trying to get a job sends a large
percentage of men back to the
institutions from which they
were released.
Stanley Radford, founder of
Teamwork Associates, has used
$3000 of his private capital to im
prove the existing situation.
Radford, a disabled veteran
who has had three mental break
downs himself, is familiar with
the problems of the hidden han
dicapped. His Teamwork group
at 1441 East Bayshore Road in
East Palo Alto provides tempo
rary employment and lodging
while members look for perma
nent employment.
In addition, Teamwork offers
camarderie and Radford's good
relations with local employers.

Since it started one year ago,
Teamwork had processed over
30 men and women.
The present Teamwork organi
zation is housed in three rooms
in an old commercial building
where members work and sleep.
The products turned out by
Teamwork members include
scratching posts for cats, fence
stakes, Christmas tree stands,
ashtrays, spray shoe-shine and
costume jewelry.
Of the more than 30 persons
who have stayed and worked
with Teamwork, about twelve
are now fully employed. This is
a remarkable success rate con
sidering the high number of
those who return to prisons and
mental hospitals.
Tom Berry, a graduate stu
dent in Communications, has
made a 16 mm. film on the
Teamwork organization which
will be shown at 7:45 on May 22
at the Palo Alto High School.
