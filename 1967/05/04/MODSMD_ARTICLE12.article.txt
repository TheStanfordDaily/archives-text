# Hoffer Speaks
## Vietnam War Will Advance Equality 
### 
The Vietnam war probably
will do more to advance racial
equality in America than the
civil right's movement, accord

ing to longshoreman-author Eric
Hoflfer.
Speaking informally with Stan
ford's professional journalism
fellows, he said Martin Luther

King Jr. could develop a whole
new generation ot local leaders
among Negro veterans of Viet
nam.
In the Army and on the battle
field, he explained, Negroes have
achieved a level of equality and
self-respect denied them else
where in society. This respect is
the key to social integration.
Defeat Would Spread Nazism
An American defeat in Viet
nam would lead to an unprece
dented spread of Nazism here, he
predicted. Hoffer's best known
book, "The True Believer," is an
analysis of authoritarian behav
ior based on Hitler's Germany
and Stalin's Russia.
Mass movements stem from
massive social change, Holler
suggested.
Individuals trying to cope
with change need to experience
a second transition similar to
the change from youth to man
hood. This transition may be

eased by social institutions or it
may result in a relapse to juve
nile, authoritarian behavior by
adults.
Widening Gap
Hoffer cited the experience of
the Jews in modern Israel and
of recruits in the American
Army as two examples of how
individuals may be "re-born."
The rapid widening of the
"generation gap" in this country
reflects bitter teen-age resent
ment of adults trying to behave
like juveniles, he speculated.
Both are struggling with mas
sive change in a society which
no longer enjoys wide consensus
on basic values.
New Kind of llero
The U.S. might well build
monuments to a new kind of
hero-—the man in the middle—
starting with a statue of Clark
Kerr near the Sproul Hall steps,
Hoffer suggested.
