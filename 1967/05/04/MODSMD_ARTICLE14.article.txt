### JOSEPH R. HIGGINS 
Sports are an important aspect of western world culture. They
serve as a means of breaking down ethnic and cultural barriers as
illustrated in Olympic competition and Peace Corp involvement.
Sports have provided an important means of social mobility (es
pecially in the U.S.) through a commonality of expression and un
derstanding not easily achieved in other ways. Involvement in
sports as a spectator or as the active participant serves to inte
grate the human personality and reflect the totality or oneness of
the human organism.
Growing Awareness
A growing awareness and concern on the part of students for
their education and an interest by students, faculty and adminis
trators alike in the quality of the educational process has raised
serious questions regarding the justification and implication of
present intercollegiate athletic programs.
Questions such as: (1) educational needs, (2) academic relevance,
(3) instructional and recreational opportunities, (4) departmental
attitude toward teaching and the development of the individual in
the context of the educational institution, (5) recruitment of ath
letes, (6) admissions policies, and (7) financial and work aid.
No Dissociation
To dissociate the program of intercollegiate athletics from the
total educational process is futile. Accordingly one cannot dissociate
the intramural and physical education programs from the overall
intercollegiate athletic program.
Intramurals, physical education, and intercollegiate athletics are
a means in the educational process through which students find a
satisfactory way of developing their sports skills, achieving an in
telligent understanding of the biological need for movement, and
achieving a level of competitive experience in keeping with individ
ually defined personal needs.
The quality sports program, justifiable in an institution of higher
learning, is reflected in the mutuality of understanding and em
phasis between the instructional program in physical education, the
organized intramural program, intercollegiate athletics and recrea
tion.
Participation in competitive sports, at every level of participation
and skill, should be for pleasure, and enjoyment. The need for ath
letic competition should not be to satisfy or feed one's narcissism;
nor to aid one in proving himself by the self-aggrandizement of his
physical prowess.
Economic Difficulties
Athletic programs in colleges and universities are beginning to
experience many serious economic difficulties. This may, in part, be
the result of the growing public interest in professional sports.
Many self-supporting athletic and physical education departments
are, therefore, having to rely more upon general university fund
support.
No longer is a winning team justification for the athletic program
—educationally or financially. Justification for an athletic program
must be based upon its relevance in providing the best possible en
vironment for the development of academic, intellectual, and social
qualities in an individual.
When a coach or department must depend upon a winning team
for existence an associated need is implied which demands the im
position of values not in keeping with sound educational philosophy.
Entertainment and financial considerations too often become the
overriding value in departmental decisions and policies and in the
selection of athletes and instructional/coaching staff.
Funds received as athletic gate receipts should go into the gen
eral university fund, and the department should conduct its opera
tions and instructional programs, hire its staff, and maintain the
physical structures in the same pattern as do other departments in
the university. An athletic program should not be conducted as a
business operation but should instead be an educational enterprise.
Recruiting, Admission
Considerable discussion and criticism has centered around inter
collegiate athletic programs' recruitment and admission policies.
Recruitment programs should reflect the educational goals of the
institution. It is indeed unfortunate when students who are selected
for college as a result of their athletic achievements are not en
couraged to realize the importance of the educational opportunity
awaiting them.
Athletic recruiting practices such as parent days on the campus,
letters of intent, and home visitations by coaching staff encourages
a student to make a commitment to a specific school and based
upon the often limited consideration of the athletic value. The val
ues of his own personal and intellectual growth through the total
educational opportunity are thus easily relegated to second class
citizenship.
It is the responsibility of the institution to adhere to the goals
and philosophies which will precipitate an attitude of intellectual
and academic concern on the part of the incoming student athlete.

An educationally balanced and meaningful sports education pro
gram should ideally receive several additional philosophical con
siderations. Clear and meaningful avenues for communication
through which individuals (student and faculty) can express their
ideas and needs and thus affect a meaningful change appears to be
vital. We must continually strive for a break from narrow and tra
ditional images of the past and a look toward the realiaztion and
satisfaction of the changing values of the individual and of society.
The same educational and administrative philosophy and control
affecting the total educational program of the institution should
affect the intercollegiate athletic, instructional and intramural pro
gram.
Qualified professional staff who have achieved recognition as
scholars and innovators in their area of interest and who have an
overview of education are essential to the sound program. Their
fundamental concern and interest must be in the development of
the individual's intellectual, psychological, and physical potentiali
ties.
Must Be Seen As Students
Students participating in athletics must be perceived as students;
students who are interested in and capable of a high level of aca
demic as well as athletic excellence. The goals and objectives of an
athletic program must not be defined in ways which will encourage
attitudinal development of athletic participation as the primary
goal of the educational experience.
A variety of instructional and competitive sports offerings seem
essential. The content of each course should be such that the stu
dent has the opportunity to gain not only skill but insights into the
meaning of the movement of his physical form in union with under
standings of deeper psychological feelings and satisfactions.
Participation in intercollegiate athletics naturally imposes re
sponsibilities, obligations and the need for self discipline and or
ganization by the individual. These impositions can be beneficial for
the individual only when they reflect the attitudes and values of
that individual in the total context of the educational opportunity.

vital. We must continually strive for a break from narrow and tra
ditional images of the past and a look toward the realiaztion and
satisfaction of the changing values of the individual and of society.
The same educational and administrative philosophy and control
affecting the total educational program of the institution should
affect the intercollegiate athletic, instructional and intramural pro
gram.
Qualified professional staff who have achieved recognition as
scholars and innovators in their area of interest and who have an
overview of education are essential to the sound program. Their
fundamental concern and interest must be in the development of
the individual's intellectual, psychological, and physical potentiali
ties.
Must Be Seen As Students
Students participating in athletics must be perceived as students;
students who are interested in and capable of a high level of aca
demic as well as athletic excellence. The goals and objectives of an
athletic program must not be defined in ways which will encourage
attitudinal development of athletic participation as the primary
goal of the educational experience.
A variety of instructional and competitive sports offerings seem
essential. The content of each course should be such that the stu
dent has the opportunity to gain not only skill but insights into the
meaning of the movement of his physical form in union with under
standings of deeper psychological feelings and satisfactions.
Participation in intercollegiate athletics naturally imposes re
sponsibilities, obligations and the need for self discipline and or
ganization by the individual. These impositions can be beneficial for
the individual only when they reflect the attitudes and values of
that individual in the total context of the educational opportunity.
Sports are an important aspect of western world culture. They
serve as a means of breaking down ethnic and cultural barriers as
illustrated in Olympic competition and Peace Corp involvement.
Sports have provided an important means of social mobility (es
pecially in the U.S.) through a commonality of expression and un
derstanding not easily achieved in other ways. Involvement in
sports as a spectator or as the active participant serves to inte
grate the human personality and reflect the totality or oneness of
the human organism.
Growing Awareness
A growing awareness and concern on the part of students for
their education and an interest by students, faculty and adminis
trators alike in the quality of the educational process has raised
serious questions regarding the justification and implication of
present intercollegiate athletic programs.
Questions such as: (1) educational needs, (2) academic relevance,
(3) instructional and recreational opportunities, (4) departmental
attitude toward teaching and the development of the individual in
the context of the educational institution, (5) recruitment of ath
letes, (6) admissions policies, and (7) financial and work aid.
No Dissociation
To dissociate the program of intercollegiate athletics from the
total educational process is futile. Accordingly one cannot dissociate
the intramural and physical education programs from the overall
intercollegiate athletic program.
Intramurals, physical education, and intercollegiate athletics are
a means in the educational process through which students find a
satisfactory way of developing their sports skills, achieving an in
telligent understanding of the biological need for movement, and
achieving a level of competitive experience in keeping with individ
ually defined personal needs.
The quality sports program, justifiable in an institution of higher
learning, is reflected in the mutuality of understanding and em
phasis between the instructional program in physical education, the
organized intramural program, intercollegiate athletics and recrea
tion.
Participation in competitive sports, at every level of participation
and skill, should be for pleasure, and enjoyment. The need for ath
letic competition should not be to satisfy or feed one's narcissism;
nor to aid one in proving himself by the self-aggrandizement of his
physical prowess.
Economic Difficulties
Athletic programs in colleges and universities are beginning to
experience many serious economic difficulties. This may, in part, be
the result of the growing public interest in professional sports.
Many self-supporting athletic and physical education departments
are, therefore, having to rely more upon general university fund
support.
No longer is a winning team justification for the athletic program
—educationally or financially. Justification for an athletic program
must be based upon its relevance in providing the best possible en
vironment for the development of academic, intellectual, and social
qualities in an individual.
When a coach or department must depend upon a winning team
for existence an associated need is implied which demands the im
position of values not in keeping with sound educational philosophy.
Entertainment and financial considerations too often become the
overriding value in departmental decisions and policies and in the
selection of athletes and instructional/coaching staff.
Funds received as athletic gate receipts should go into the gen
eral university fund, and the department should conduct its opera
tions and instructional programs, hire its staff, and maintain the
physical structures in the same pattern as do other departments in
the university. An athletic program should not be conducted as a
business operation but should instead be an educational enterprise.
Recruiting, Admission
Considerable discussion and criticism has centered around inter
collegiate athletic programs' recruitment and admission policies.
Recruitment programs should reflect the educational goals of the
institution. It is indeed unfortunate when students who are selected
for college as a result of their athletic achievements are not en
couraged to realize the importance of the educational opportunity
awaiting them.
Athletic recruiting practices such as parent days on the campus,
letters of intent, and home visitations by coaching staff encourages
a student to make a commitment to a specific school and based
upon the often limited consideration of the athletic value. The val
ues of his own personal and intellectual growth through the total
educational opportunity are thus easily relegated to second class
citizenship.
It is the responsibility of the institution to adhere to the goals
and philosophies which will precipitate an attitude of intellectual
and academic concern on the part of the incoming student athlete.

An educationally balanced and meaningful sports education pro
gram should ideally receive several additional philosophical con
siderations. Clear and meaningful avenues for communication
through which individuals (student and faculty) can express their
ideas and needs and thus affect a meaningful change appears to be
vital. We must continually strive for a break from narrow and tra
ditional images of the past and a look toward the realiaztion and
satisfaction of the changing values of the individual and of society.

Entertainment and financial considerations too often become the
overriding value in departmental decisions and policies and in the
selection of athletes and instructional/coaching staff.
Funds received as athletic gate receipts should go into the gen
eral university fund, and the department should conduct its opera
tions and instructional programs, hire its staff, and maintain the
physical structures in the same pattern as do other departments in
the university. An athletic program should not be conducted as a
business operation but should instead be an educational enterprise.
Recruiting, Admission
Considerable discussion and criticism has centered around inter
collegiate athletic programs' recruitment and admission policies.
Recruitment programs should reflect the educational goals of the
institution. It is indeed unfortunate when students who are selected
for college as a result of their athletic achievements are not en
couraged to realize the importance of the educational opportunity
awaiting them.
Athletic recruiting practices such as parent days on the campus,
letters of intent, and home visitations by coaching staff encourages
a student to make a commitment to a specific school and based
upon the often limited consideration of the athletic value. The val
ues of his own personal and intellectual growth through the total
educational opportunity are thus easily relegated to second class
citizenship.
It is the responsibility of the institution to adhere to the goals
and philosophies which will precipitate an attitude of intellectual
and academic concern on the part of the incoming student athlete.

An educationally balanced and meaningful sports education pro
gram should ideally receive several additional philosophical con
siderations. Clear and meaningful avenues for communication
through which individuals (student and faculty) can express their
ideas and needs and thus affect a meaningful change appears to be
vital. We must continually strive for a break from narrow and tra
ditional images of the past and a look toward the realiaztion and
satisfaction of the changing values of the individual and of society.
The same educational and administrative philosophy and control
affecting the total educational program of the institution should
affect the intercollegiate athletic, instructional and intramural pro
gram.
Qualified professional staff who have achieved recognition as
scholars and innovators in their area of interest and who have an
overview of education are essential to the sound program. Their
fundamental concern and interest must be in the development of
the individual's intellectual, psychological, and physical potentiali
ties.
Must Be Seen As Students
Students participating in athletics must be perceived as students;
students who are interested in and capable of a high level of aca
demic as well as athletic excellence. The goals and objectives of an
athletic program must not be defined in ways which will encourage
attitudinal development of athletic participation as the primary
goal of the educational experience.
A variety of instructional and competitive sports offerings seem
essential. The content of each course should be such that the stu
dent has the opportunity to gain not only skill but insights into the
meaning of the movement of his physical form in union with under
standings of deeper psychological feelings and satisfactions.
Participation in intercollegiate athletics naturally imposes re
sponsibilities, obligations and the need for self discipline and or
ganization by the individual. These impositions can be beneficial for
the individual only when they reflect the attitudes and values of
that individual in the total context of the educational opportunity.
Sports are an important aspect of western world culture. They
serve as a means of breaking down ethnic and cultural barriers as
illustrated in Olympic competition and Peace Corp involvement.
Sports have provided an important means of social mobility (es
pecially in the U.S.) through a commonality of expression and un
derstanding not easily achieved in other ways. Involvement in
sports as a spectator or as the active participant serves to inte
grate the human personality and reflect the totality or oneness of
the human organism.
Growing Awareness
A growing awareness and concern on the part of students for
their education and an interest by students, faculty and adminis
trators alike in the quality of the educational process has raised
serious questions regarding the justification and implication of
present intercollegiate athletic programs.
Questions such as: (1) educational needs, (2) academic relevance,
(3) instructional and recreational opportunities, (4) departmental
attitude toward teaching and the development of the individual in
the context of the educational institution, (5) recruitment of ath
letes, (6) admissions policies, and (7) financial and work aid.
No Dissociation
To dissociate the program of intercollegiate athletics from the
total educational process is futile. Accordingly one cannot dissociate
the intramural and physical education programs from the overall
intercollegiate athletic program.
Intramurals, physical education, and intercollegiate athletics are
a means in the educational process through which students find a
satisfactory way of developing their sports skills, achieving an in
telligent understanding of the biological need for movement, and
achieving a level of competitive experience in keeping with individ
ually defined personal needs.
The quality sports program, justifiable in an institution of higher
learning, is reflected in the mutuality of understanding and em
phasis between the instructional program in physical education, the
organized intramural program, intercollegiate athletics and recrea
tion.
Participation in competitive sports, at every level of participation
and skill, should be for pleasure, and enjoyment. The need for ath
letic competition should not be to satisfy or feed one's narcissism;
nor to aid one in proving himself by the self-aggrandizement of his
physical prowess.
Economic Difficulties
Athletic programs in colleges and universities are beginning to
experience many serious economic difficulties. This may, in part, be
the result of the growing public interest in professional sports.
Many self-supporting athletic and physical education departments
are, therefore, having to rely more upon general university fund
support.
No longer is a winning team justification for the athletic program
—educationally or financially. Justification for an athletic program
must be based upon its relevance in providing the best possible en
vironment for the development of academic, intellectual, and social
qualities in an individual.
When a coach or department must depend upon a winning team
for existence an associated need is implied which demands the im
position of values not in keeping with sound educational philosophy.
Entertainment and financial considerations too often become the
overriding value in departmental decisions and policies and in the
selection of athletes and instructional/coaching staff.
