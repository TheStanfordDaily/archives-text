# Contributes To Education
## SU Athletics Meet The Challenge 
### CHUCK TAYLOR 
The ideal of athletic sports
as a part of the educational
process goes very, very far
back in the history of Western
Civilization.
The Athenian philosophers
and historians believed that
they originated the ideal that
athletic sports, not merely cal
isthenic exercise, tested not
only the physical prowess, but
the moral courage and indeed
the wits of young men . . . and
that this was a far superior
system of education to the one
that went all the way, as for
a time the Spartans did in
merely drilling young men for
the arts of war, or all the
other way as some of the
seophists might have liked to
go . . . concentrating wholly
on intellectual pursuits.
By the same token, all of
these people worried about
keeping these two things in
balance for they saw the dang
er in allowing either one to
destroy the other.
Only Justification
Athletic sports and games
can only be justified in an aca
demic and educational curricu
lum if they contribute to the
process of education ... as is
the case with most every pur
suit in the framework of an ed
ucational institution.
The definition of education
varies in its extent from "to ed
ucate the young and to enlarge
the boundaries of knowledge"
to "the process which makes
a mature adult out of a child.
It is life itself.
"Everything contributes to
this process . . . observation,
experience, association with
others, the thinking process,
formal and informal schooling,
games and recreation, and the
inspiration that comes from na
ture, art and music, and from
every impact with the whole
universe.
"Each of these affect different
people in various ways ... some
more . . . some less. The more
sensitive one is to all these in
fluences, the riper and richer
is his education. Education thus

becomes a lifelong enrichment
of the individual."
Prefers Broad Meaning
I do not presume to claim
any background as a profes
sional educator; however, as
one modestly associated with
the educational process through
the medium of competitive
sports, I prefer the broad mean
ing of education.
I firmly believe that, if con
ducted on a high level of integ
rity, athletics stress, and con
sequently develop loyalty, fun
damental concepts of right
and wrong, self-reliance, an un
derstanding of the necessity of
discipline, the meaning of self
sacrifice, and a realization that
adversity is not a personal
thing but only something to
overcome.
I submit that this is educa
tion in its most basic form even
though lacking in academic
content.
Danger of Abuses
But, let us not deceive our
selves. As dedicated as I am to
the belief that education is in
herent in competitive sports it
is of no value unless measured
in the context of honesty. In
herent also is the danger of
abuses and extremes that can
contribute to its self-destruc
tion.
The record has not always
been clean, neither has it al
ways been clean in the arts, the
professions, the business world,
and even in the broad field of
the academic community.
Importance To Athletes
Competitive sports at Stan
ford affect the educational proc
ess ... I believe in a positive
way ... of approximately 800
students each year. These men
know better that I its value.
I would hazard a guess that
if questioned in depth, an over
whelming majority would at
test that the educational values
received through participation
far outweigh the limited sacri
fices, and that athletic partici
pation is of great importance
to them as an educational en
richment experience.
Today the curriculum of our

University is so full of exciting
educational experiences that no
one individual, be he an athlete
or not, has time to participate
in all. Those who choose to
spend time in this physical pur
suit have had to make a choice
. . . a choice not devoid of edu
cational values.
Sports Worthwhile
Kept within proper bounds of
time, place, and emphasis, I
believe strongly that competi
tive sports are indeed worth
while. The spectacle, the color,
the excitement will linger only
in memory, but the basic values
will survive.
It is a responsibility of those
charged with the administra
tion of physical education, in
tramurals, and athletics to over
come the limited opportunities
for greater numbers of partici
pants. It is our responsibility to
continue to work towards more
competitive activities on every
level of physical ability.
Do Not Drain Funds
Stanford is fortunate in that
the competitive sports pro
grams do not drain funds from
the financial resources of the
University which otherwise
could be used in academic re
search, facilities, or instruction.
The history of sports at Stan

ford shows that it has always
been self-sufficient, indeed has
contributed significantly to al
lied activities . . . physical ed
ucation, intramurals, and to a
small extent club team competi
tion, and over the years to such
physical buildings as Branner
Hall, the women's gymnasium,
and of course much of the pres
ent physical education plant.
But again, this is not the rea
son for justification of competi
tive sports.
Anti-Intellectual Concern
Some concern centers around
the feeling that the intellectual
climate of a university is erod
ed by involvement in physical
activity which draws mass at
tention. Evidence supporting
the contention, I believe, is
hard to find. Here again those
who participate may be the best
judge as to their personal in
tellectual involvement.
Is it fair to assume that
every student must become in
volved in all the great range
of intellectual stimulants? Each
individual must have a choice
and certainly the history of
sports participants has shown
a wide range of success in
after college life, and service to
their communities and the na
tion . . . probably the rpsult of

their college career association
with stimulating professors and
a challenging curriculum.
Eiml The Myth
Finally, the myth that stu
dents who participate in ath
letics are somehow a different
breed than the general student
body should be laid to rest. No
evidence has ever been pro
duced to indicate that the stu
dent-athletes as a whole do not
have the same frustrations,
joys, disappointments, and suc
cesses of the range of all stu
dents.
Stanford's athletic program
over many years has faced the
challenge of combining aca
demics and physical activity in
competition with other institu
tions. I believe the student-ath
letes have met this challenge in
an extraordinary fine way, and
my hat is off to each and every
one who physically competes on
whatever level of ability, for
I believe they have added an
important ingredient to their
total educational experience.

search, facilities, or instruction.
The history of sports at Stan

ford shows that it has always
been self-sufficient, indeed has
contributed significantly to al
lied activities . . . physical ed
ucation, intramurals, and to a
small extent club team competi
tion, and over the years to such
physical buildings as Branner
Hall, the women's gymnasium,
and of course much of the pres
ent physical education plant.
But again, this is not the rea
son for justification of competi
tive sports.
Anti-Intellectual Concern
Some concern centers around
the feeling that the intellectual
climate of a university is erod
ed by involvement in physical
activity which draws mass at
tention. Evidence supporting
the contention, I believe, is
hard to find. Here again those
who participate may be the best
judge as to their personal in
tellectual involvement.
Is it fair to assume that
every student must become in
volved in all the great range
of intellectual stimulants? Each
individual must have a choice
and certainly the history of
sports participants has shown
a wide range of success in
after college life, and service to
their communities and the na
tion . . . probably the rpsult of

their college career association
with stimulating professors and
a challenging curriculum.
Eiml The Myth
Finally, the myth that stu
dents who participate in ath
letics are somehow a different
breed than the general student
body should be laid to rest. No
evidence has ever been pro
duced to indicate that the stu
dent-athletes as a whole do not
have the same frustrations,
joys, disappointments, and suc
cesses of the range of all stu
dents.
Stanford's athletic program
over many years has faced the
challenge of combining aca
demics and physical activity in
competition with other institu
tions. I believe the student-ath
letes have met this challenge in
an extraordinary fine way, and
my hat is off to each and every
one who physically competes on
whatever level of ability, for
I believe they have added an
important ingredient to their
total educational experience.
The ideal of athletic sports
as a part of the educational
process goes very, very far
back in the history of Western
Civilization.
The Athenian philosophers
and historians believed that
they originated the ideal that
athletic sports, not merely cal
isthenic exercise, tested not
only the physical prowess, but
the moral courage and indeed
the wits of young men . . . and
that this was a far superior
system of education to the one
that went all the way, as for
a time the Spartans did in
merely drilling young men for
the arts of war, or all the
other way as some of the
seophists might have liked to
go . . . concentrating wholly
on intellectual pursuits.
By the same token, all of
these people worried about
keeping these two things in
balance for they saw the dang
er in allowing either one to
destroy the other.
Only Justification
Athletic sports and games
can only be justified in an aca
demic and educational curricu
lum if they contribute to the
process of education ... as is
the case with most every pur
suit in the framework of an ed
ucational institution.
The definition of education
varies in its extent from "to ed
ucate the young and to enlarge
the boundaries of knowledge"
to "the process which makes
a mature adult out of a child.
It is life itself.
"Everything contributes to
this process . . . observation,
experience, association with
others, the thinking process,
formal and informal schooling,
games and recreation, and the
inspiration that comes from na
ture, art and music, and from
every impact with the whole
universe.
"Each of these affect different
people in various ways ... some
more . . . some less. The more
sensitive one is to all these in
fluences, the riper and richer
is his education. Education thus

becomes a lifelong enrichment
of the individual."
Prefers Broad Meaning
I do not presume to claim
any background as a profes
sional educator; however, as
one modestly associated with
the educational process through
the medium of competitive
sports, I prefer the broad mean
ing of education.
I firmly believe that, if con
ducted on a high level of integ
rity, athletics stress, and con
sequently develop loyalty, fun
damental concepts of right
and wrong, self-reliance, an un
derstanding of the necessity of
discipline, the meaning of self
sacrifice, and a realization that
adversity is not a personal
thing but only something to
overcome.
I submit that this is educa
tion in its most basic form even
though lacking in academic
content.
Danger of Abuses
But, let us not deceive our
selves. As dedicated as I am to
the belief that education is in
herent in competitive sports it
is of no value unless measured
in the context of honesty. In
herent also is the danger of
abuses and extremes that can
contribute to its self-destruc
tion.
The record has not always
been clean, neither has it al
ways been clean in the arts, the
professions, the business world,
and even in the broad field of
the academic community.
Importance To Athletes
Competitive sports at Stan
ford affect the educational proc
ess ... I believe in a positive
way ... of approximately 800
students each year. These men
know better that I its value.
I would hazard a guess that
if questioned in depth, an over
whelming majority would at
test that the educational values
received through participation
far outweigh the limited sacri
fices, and that athletic partici
pation is of great importance
to them as an educational en
richment experience.
Today the curriculum of our

University is so full of exciting
educational experiences that no
one individual, be he an athlete
or not, has time to participate
in all. Those who choose to
spend time in this physical pur
suit have had to make a choice
. . . a choice not devoid of edu
cational values.
Sports Worthwhile
Kept within proper bounds of
time, place, and emphasis, I
believe strongly that competi
tive sports are indeed worth
while. The spectacle, the color,
the excitement will linger only
in memory, but the basic values
will survive.
It is a responsibility of those
charged with the administra
tion of physical education, in
tramurals, and athletics to over
come the limited opportunities
for greater numbers of partici
pants. It is our responsibility to
continue to work towards more
competitive activities on every
level of physical ability.
Do Not Drain Funds
Stanford is fortunate in that
the competitive sports pro
grams do not drain funds from
the financial resources of the
University which otherwise
could be used in academic re
search, facilities, or instruction.

But, let us not deceive our
selves. As dedicated as I am to
the belief that education is in
herent in competitive sports it
is of no value unless measured
in the context of honesty. In
herent also is the danger of
abuses and extremes that can
contribute to its self-destruc
tion.
The record has not always
been clean, neither has it al
ways been clean in the arts, the
professions, the business world,
and even in the broad field of
the academic community.
Importance To Athletes
Competitive sports at Stan
ford affect the educational proc
ess ... I believe in a positive
way ... of approximately 800
students each year. These men
know better that I its value.
I would hazard a guess that
if questioned in depth, an over
whelming majority would at
test that the educational values
received through participation
far outweigh the limited sacri
fices, and that athletic partici
pation is of great importance
to them as an educational en
richment experience.
Today the curriculum of our

University is so full of exciting
educational experiences that no
one individual, be he an athlete
or not, has time to participate
in all. Those who choose to
spend time in this physical pur
suit have had to make a choice
. . . a choice not devoid of edu
cational values.
Sports Worthwhile
Kept within proper bounds of
time, place, and emphasis, I
believe strongly that competi
tive sports are indeed worth
while. The spectacle, the color,
the excitement will linger only
in memory, but the basic values
will survive.
It is a responsibility of those
charged with the administra
tion of physical education, in
tramurals, and athletics to over
come the limited opportunities
for greater numbers of partici
pants. It is our responsibility to
continue to work towards more
competitive activities on every
level of physical ability.
Do Not Drain Funds
Stanford is fortunate in that
the competitive sports pro
grams do not drain funds from
the financial resources of the
University which otherwise
could be used in academic re
search, facilities, or instruction.
The history of sports at Stan

ford shows that it has always
been self-sufficient, indeed has
contributed significantly to al
lied activities . . . physical ed
ucation, intramurals, and to a
small extent club team competi
tion, and over the years to such
physical buildings as Branner
Hall, the women's gymnasium,
and of course much of the pres
ent physical education plant.
But again, this is not the rea
son for justification of competi
tive sports.
Anti-Intellectual Concern
Some concern centers around
the feeling that the intellectual
climate of a university is erod
ed by involvement in physical
activity which draws mass at
tention. Evidence supporting
the contention, I believe, is
hard to find. Here again those
who participate may be the best
judge as to their personal in
tellectual involvement.
Is it fair to assume that
every student must become in
volved in all the great range
of intellectual stimulants? Each
individual must have a choice
and certainly the history of
sports participants has shown
a wide range of success in
after college life, and service to
their communities and the na
tion . . . probably the rpsult of

their college career association
with stimulating professors and
a challenging curriculum.
Eiml The Myth
Finally, the myth that stu
dents who participate in ath
letics are somehow a different
breed than the general student
body should be laid to rest. No
evidence has ever been pro
duced to indicate that the stu
dent-athletes as a whole do not
have the same frustrations,
joys, disappointments, and suc
cesses of the range of all stu
dents.
Stanford's athletic program
over many years has faced the
challenge of combining aca
demics and physical activity in
competition with other institu
tions. I believe the student-ath
letes have met this challenge in
an extraordinary fine way, and
my hat is off to each and every
one who physically competes on
whatever level of ability, for
I believe they have added an
important ingredient to their
total educational experience.
The ideal of athletic sports
as a part of the educational
process goes very, very far
back in the history of Western
Civilization.
The Athenian philosophers
and historians believed that
they originated the ideal that
athletic sports, not merely cal
isthenic exercise, tested not
only the physical prowess, but
the moral courage and indeed
the wits of young men . . . and
that this was a far superior
system of education to the one
that went all the way, as for
a time the Spartans did in
merely drilling young men for
the arts of war, or all the
other way as some of the
seophists might have liked to
go . . . concentrating wholly
on intellectual pursuits.
By the same token, all of
these people worried about
keeping these two things in
balance for they saw the dang
er in allowing either one to
destroy the other.
Only Justification
Athletic sports and games
can only be justified in an aca
demic and educational curricu
lum if they contribute to the
process of education ... as is
the case with most every pur
suit in the framework of an ed
ucational institution.
The definition of education
varies in its extent from "to ed
ucate the young and to enlarge
the boundaries of knowledge"
to "the process which makes
a mature adult out of a child.
It is life itself.
"Everything contributes to
this process . . . observation,
experience, association with
others, the thinking process,
formal and informal schooling,
games and recreation, and the
inspiration that comes from na
ture, art and music, and from
every impact with the whole
universe.
"Each of these affect different
people in various ways ... some
more . . . some less. The more
sensitive one is to all these in
fluences, the riper and richer
is his education. Education thus

becomes a lifelong enrichment
of the individual."
Prefers Broad Meaning
I do not presume to claim
any background as a profes
sional educator; however, as
one modestly associated with
the educational process through
the medium of competitive
sports, I prefer the broad mean
ing of education.
I firmly believe that, if con
ducted on a high level of integ
rity, athletics stress, and con
sequently develop loyalty, fun
damental concepts of right
and wrong, self-reliance, an un
derstanding of the necessity of
discipline, the meaning of self
sacrifice, and a realization that
adversity is not a personal
thing but only something to
overcome.
I submit that this is educa
tion in its most basic form even
though lacking in academic
content.
