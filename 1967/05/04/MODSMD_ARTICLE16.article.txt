# Commitment Forces Conflict For Seekers Of Knowledge
## 
### DELL MARTIN 
In attempting to discuss the
role of intercollegiate athletics
in the university, the program
should be measured against
some ideal definition of the
goals of an academic commun
ity.
The university, for the stu
dents, should be a place of in
tellectual stimulation, a place
where freedom of thought and
action is encouraged, a place
where a critical and constructive
attitude toward ideas and insti
tutions is fostered.
Much of such education, the
exercising of minds and talents,
must take place outside of th>
classroom. Many individual ath
letes at Stanford work well with
in this concept of the university;
they are active, contributing
members of the intellectual com
munity.
Leading, Creative Role
But the feeling always re
mains that their success in find
ing a leading, creative role in
the university has been achieved
in spite of rather than with the
assistance of Stanford's athletic
programs.

At best team sports such as
basketball and football can
claim to build spirits of coopera
tion and competition which will
make their participating mem
bers better suited to live in mod
ern, high-pressure society.
Fundamental Purpose
But one searches in vain for a
valid raison d'etre which di
rectly relates to the fundamen
tal university purpose of build
ing clear, strong, independent
minds.
Instead the athletic depart
ment, through recruiting, intro
duces into Stanfoi d a large body
of men who expected to
commit massive amounts of
time and energy to gaining
strictly physical skills.
And if these athletes are re
ceiving athletic grants-in-aid or
Buck Club money, the voluntary

aspect of their participation is
sharply reduced. The discovery
of an exciting life in the extra
curricular university off the
playing field can only be intense
ly frustrating rather than re
warding to an athlete who con
fronts three or four hours of
practice sessions and strategy
meeting daily.
Some Find Time
But many athletes do find
time to function extra-curricu
larly off the playing field, and
certainly many do above-aver
age academic work in the class
room.
One might, however, desire a
better measure of athletes' par
ticipation in the university than
the often-published athletic de
partment figures on grades and
graduation percentages — we
might ask how many athletes
are Wilbur associates, members
of film forums, members of lIR,
workers in KZSU, holding Ex
periment seminars, or working
for Sequoia, The Daily, or
Chappie.
The presence of numbers of
students who cannot become in
volved in the vast range of avail
able intellectual pursuits be
cause of their huge commitment
to physical games can only be
destructive to the building of a
truly integral university commu
nity.
Corrobation of a divorce from
the majority concerns of the
University may be found in the
existence of athletic subcommit
tees or indeed subcultures with
in the University.
Athletic Department Grouping
The athletic department itself
creates one such grouping with
its "training tables" at which
the athlete finds himself divided
from significant contact with
anyone but fellow athletes.
Training tables are freely ad
mitted to exist so that the diners
will "think ball" instead of de
structively (to Stanford's ath
letic success) follow other lines
of thought and communication.
And the objective fact exists

that at least one fraternity on
campus has established enough
of an athletic community to
boast the membership of twenty
seven varsity football players
(Rush at Stanford, 1967).
Divided From The Community
Thus is the athlete divided
from the rest of the university
community even his off-field
hours; and his perspectives thus
become limited to nonintellec
tual concerns, his interests in a
fascinating, compelling environ
ment become limited to athletic
games.
The athletic department itself
often furnishes frightening evi
dence of the major, overwhelm
ing part it believes athletics
should play in the individual
lives of students by creating
separate, special roles and con
siderations for the athlete.
Freshman football meetings
are scheduled in conflict with
university convocation. Personal
appearance of athletes is rigidly
controlled by the department.
Tutors
Tutors are provided free to
athletes who are in academic
difficulties creating a sense of
dependence on the Bureau of
Athletic Control as well as a
feeling of a privileged, unique
role in the academic sector of
university life.

And the athletic department
also creates considerable eco
nomic favoritism for the athlete,
providing him with high-paying
jobs which are available to ath
letes only.
Armies Of Coaches
In the highly institutionalized
framework of big time athletics
employing armies of coaches
and expending and earning
thousands of dollars every year,
one might even begin to fear
that the true spirit of athletics,
and certainly of athletics in the
university, may be lost.
Participation in games must
be both voluntary because of the
intense satisfaction gained from
playing the games, and a sec
ondary exeprience in one's total
life.
When the game becomes a
compulsion (either from inter
nal or external causes) or an
overriding concern in all areas
of thought and action, then it is
no longer a game.
A Way Of Life
The game becomes a way of
life, it destroys a full participa
tion in a larger existence (i.e.
the university).
I fear that Stanford's intercol
legiate athletic program may no
longer be—if it evi'r was—truly
called the playing of games.

are scheduled in conflict with
university convocation. Personal
appearance of athletes is rigidly
controlled by the department.
Tutors
Tutors are provided free to
athletes who are in academic
difficulties creating a sense of
dependence on the Bureau of
Athletic Control as well as a
feeling of a privileged, unique
role in the academic sector of
university life.

And the athletic department
also creates considerable eco
nomic favoritism for the athlete,
providing him with high-paying
jobs which are available to ath
letes only.
Armies Of Coaches
In the highly institutionalized
framework of big time athletics
employing armies of coaches
and expending and earning
thousands of dollars every year,
one might even begin to fear
that the true spirit of athletics,
and certainly of athletics in the
university, may be lost.
Participation in games must
be both voluntary because of the
intense satisfaction gained from
playing the games, and a sec
ondary exeprience in one's total
life.
When the game becomes a
compulsion (either from inter
nal or external causes) or an
overriding concern in all areas
of thought and action, then it is
no longer a game.
A Way Of Life
The game becomes a way of
life, it destroys a full participa
tion in a larger existence (i.e.
the university).
I fear that Stanford's intercol
legiate athletic program may no
longer be—if it evi'r was—truly
called the playing of games.
In attempting to discuss the
role of intercollegiate athletics
in the university, the program
should be measured against
some ideal definition of the
goals of an academic commun
ity.
The university, for the stu
dents, should be a place of in
tellectual stimulation, a place
where freedom of thought and
action is encouraged, a place
where a critical and constructive
attitude toward ideas and insti
tutions is fostered.
Much of such education, the
exercising of minds and talents,
must take place outside of th>
classroom. Many individual ath
letes at Stanford work well with
in this concept of the university;
they are active, contributing
members of the intellectual com
munity.
Leading, Creative Role
But the feeling always re
mains that their success in find
ing a leading, creative role in
the university has been achieved
in spite of rather than with the
assistance of Stanford's athletic
programs.

At best team sports such as
basketball and football can
claim to build spirits of coopera
tion and competition which will
make their participating mem
bers better suited to live in mod
ern, high-pressure society.
Fundamental Purpose
But one searches in vain for a
valid raison d'etre which di
rectly relates to the fundamen
tal university purpose of build
ing clear, strong, independent
minds.
Instead the athletic depart
ment, through recruiting, intro
duces into Stanfoi d a large body
of men who expected to
commit massive amounts of
time and energy to gaining
strictly physical skills.
And if these athletes are re
ceiving athletic grants-in-aid or
Buck Club money, the voluntary

aspect of their participation is
sharply reduced. The discovery
of an exciting life in the extra
curricular university off the
playing field can only be intense
ly frustrating rather than re
warding to an athlete who con
fronts three or four hours of
practice sessions and strategy
meeting daily.
Some Find Time
But many athletes do find
time to function extra-curricu
larly off the playing field, and
certainly many do above-aver
age academic work in the class
room.
One might, however, desire a
better measure of athletes' par
ticipation in the university than
the often-published athletic de
partment figures on grades and
graduation percentages — we
might ask how many athletes
are Wilbur associates, members
of film forums, members of lIR,
workers in KZSU, holding Ex
periment seminars, or working
for Sequoia, The Daily, or
Chappie.
The presence of numbers of
students who cannot become in
volved in the vast range of avail
able intellectual pursuits be
cause of their huge commitment
to physical games can only be
destructive to the building of a
truly integral university commu
nity.
Corrobation of a divorce from
the majority concerns of the
University may be found in the
existence of athletic subcommit
tees or indeed subcultures with
in the University.
Athletic Department Grouping
The athletic department itself
creates one such grouping with
its "training tables" at which
the athlete finds himself divided
from significant contact with
anyone but fellow athletes.
Training tables are freely ad
mitted to exist so that the diners
will "think ball" instead of de
structively (to Stanford's ath
letic success) follow other lines
of thought and communication.
And the objective fact exists

that at least one fraternity on
campus has established enough
of an athletic community to
boast the membership of twenty
seven varsity football players
(Rush at Stanford, 1967).
Divided From The Community
Thus is the athlete divided
from the rest of the university
community even his off-field
hours; and his perspectives thus
become limited to nonintellec
tual concerns, his interests in a
fascinating, compelling environ
ment become limited to athletic
games.
The athletic department itself
often furnishes frightening evi
dence of the major, overwhelm
ing part it believes athletics
should play in the individual
lives of students by creating
separate, special roles and con
siderations for the athlete.

cause of their huge commitment
to physical games can only be
destructive to the building of a
truly integral university commu
nity.
Corrobation of a divorce from
the majority concerns of the
University may be found in the
existence of athletic subcommit
tees or indeed subcultures with
in the University.
Athletic Department Grouping
The athletic department itself
creates one such grouping with
its "training tables" at which
the athlete finds himself divided
from significant contact with
anyone but fellow athletes.
Training tables are freely ad
mitted to exist so that the diners
will "think ball" instead of de
structively (to Stanford's ath
letic success) follow other lines
of thought and communication.
And the objective fact exists

that at least one fraternity on
campus has established enough
of an athletic community to
boast the membership of twenty
seven varsity football players
(Rush at Stanford, 1967).
Divided From The Community
Thus is the athlete divided
from the rest of the university
community even his off-field
hours; and his perspectives thus
become limited to nonintellec
tual concerns, his interests in a
fascinating, compelling environ
ment become limited to athletic
games.
The athletic department itself
often furnishes frightening evi
dence of the major, overwhelm
ing part it believes athletics
should play in the individual
lives of students by creating
separate, special roles and con
siderations for the athlete.
Freshman football meetings
are scheduled in conflict with
university convocation. Personal
appearance of athletes is rigidly
controlled by the department.
Tutors
Tutors are provided free to
athletes who are in academic
difficulties creating a sense of
dependence on the Bureau of
Athletic Control as well as a
feeling of a privileged, unique
role in the academic sector of
university life.

And the athletic department
also creates considerable eco
nomic favoritism for the athlete,
providing him with high-paying
jobs which are available to ath
letes only.
Armies Of Coaches
In the highly institutionalized
framework of big time athletics
employing armies of coaches
and expending and earning
thousands of dollars every year,
one might even begin to fear
that the true spirit of athletics,
and certainly of athletics in the
university, may be lost.
Participation in games must
be both voluntary because of the
intense satisfaction gained from
playing the games, and a sec
ondary exeprience in one's total
life.
When the game becomes a
compulsion (either from inter
nal or external causes) or an
overriding concern in all areas
of thought and action, then it is
no longer a game.
A Way Of Life
The game becomes a way of
life, it destroys a full participa
tion in a larger existence (i.e.
the university).
I fear that Stanford's intercol
legiate athletic program may no
longer be—if it evi'r was—truly
called the playing of games.
In attempting to discuss the
role of intercollegiate athletics
in the university, the program
should be measured against
some ideal definition of the
goals of an academic commun
ity.
The university, for the stu
dents, should be a place of in
tellectual stimulation, a place
where freedom of thought and
action is encouraged, a place
where a critical and constructive
attitude toward ideas and insti
tutions is fostered.
Much of such education, the
exercising of minds and talents,
must take place outside of th>
classroom. Many individual ath
letes at Stanford work well with
in this concept of the university;
they are active, contributing
members of the intellectual com
munity.
Leading, Creative Role
But the feeling always re
mains that their success in find
ing a leading, creative role in
the university has been achieved
in spite of rather than with the
assistance of Stanford's athletic
programs.

At best team sports such as
basketball and football can
claim to build spirits of coopera
tion and competition which will
make their participating mem
bers better suited to live in mod
ern, high-pressure society.
Fundamental Purpose
But one searches in vain for a
valid raison d'etre which di
rectly relates to the fundamen
tal university purpose of build
ing clear, strong, independent
minds.
Instead the athletic depart
ment, through recruiting, intro
duces into Stanfoi d a large body
of men who expected to
commit massive amounts of
time and energy to gaining
strictly physical skills.
And if these athletes are re
ceiving athletic grants-in-aid or
Buck Club money, the voluntary

aspect of their participation is
sharply reduced. The discovery
of an exciting life in the extra
curricular university off the
playing field can only be intense
ly frustrating rather than re
warding to an athlete who con
fronts three or four hours of
practice sessions and strategy
meeting daily.
Some Find Time
But many athletes do find
time to function extra-curricu
larly off the playing field, and
certainly many do above-aver
age academic work in the class
room.
One might, however, desire a
better measure of athletes' par
ticipation in the university than
the often-published athletic de
partment figures on grades and
graduation percentages — we
might ask how many athletes
are Wilbur associates, members
of film forums, members of lIR,
workers in KZSU, holding Ex
periment seminars, or working
for Sequoia, The Daily, or
Chappie.
The presence of numbers of
students who cannot become in
volved in the vast range of avail
able intellectual pursuits be
cause of their huge commitment
to physical games can only be
destructive to the building of a
truly integral university commu
nity.
