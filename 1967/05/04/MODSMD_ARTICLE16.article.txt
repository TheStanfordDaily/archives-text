# Commitment Forces Conflict For Seekers Of Knowledge

### DELL MARTIN 
In attempting to discuss the
role of intercollegiate athletics
in the university, the program
should be measured against
some ideal definition of the
goals of an academic commun
ity.
The university, for the stu
dents, should be a place of in
tellectual stimulation, a place
where freedom of thought and
action is encouraged, a place
where a critical and constructive
attitude toward ideas and insti
tutions is fostered.
Much of such education, the
exercising of minds and talents,
must take place outside of th>
classroom. Many individual ath
letes at Stanford work well with
in this concept of the university;
they are active, contributing
members of the intellectual com
munity.
Leading, Creative Role
But the feeling always re
mains that their success in find
ing a leading, creative role in
the university has been achieved
in spite of rather than with the
assistance of Stanford's athletic
programs.

At best team sports such as
basketball and football can
claim to build spirits of coopera
tion and competition which will
make their participating mem
bers better suited to live in mod
ern, high-pressure society.
Fundamental Purpose
But one searches in vain for a
valid raison d'etre which di
rectly relates to the fundamen
tal university purpose of build
ing clear, strong, independent
minds.
Instead the athletic depart
ment, through recruiting, intro
duces into Stanfoi d a large body
of men who expected to
commit massive amounts of
time and energy to gaining
strictly physical skills.
And if these athletes are re
ceiving athletic grants-in-aid or
Buck Club money, the voluntary

aspect of their participation is
sharply reduced. The discovery
of an exciting life in the extra
curricular university off the
playing field can only be intense
ly frustrating rather than re
warding to an athlete who con
fronts three or four hours of
practice sessions and strategy
meeting daily.
Some Find Time
But many athletes do find
time to function extra-curricu
larly off the playing field, and
certainly many do above-aver
age academic work in the class
room.
One might, however, desire a
better measure of athletes' par
ticipation in the university than
the often-published athletic de
partment figures on grades and
graduation percentages — we
