The concepts and ideals of athletics within the University are
now becoming major topics of discussion, both at Stanford and
in the entire country.
What athletics should do for the individual within the educa
tional framework of the University is an important question the
Study of Education will consider.
To examine this question, The Daily asked four people inti
mately connected with athletics to write articles.
Mr. Joseph Higgins, Director of Wilbur Hall and former
director of the intramural program, posits an idealist's view of
athletics, which might serve as a standard for the other articles.
Dell Martin, former member of Stanford's track team and now
a runner for the Santa Clara Youth Village, explains his view
that Stanford athletics do not meet any ideal, while Chuck Tay
lor, Director of Athletics, advocates the present program.
Wells Shoemaker, former Daily Sports Editor and manager
of the swimming and water polo teams, and Walter Poterbin, a
member of the water polo team, describe the intangible benefits
of sports competition.
