# Competition Offers Intangible Benefits

### WELLS SHOEMAKER WALTER POTERBIN 
The reasons for competing in
intercollegiate athletics vary as
widely as the individuals who
participate.
Courage, heart, determination,
spirit, desire—all have become
unfortunately jaded expressions
of a vivid, compelling state of
mind that moves hundreds of
thousands of students to strive
for and achieve success in inter
collegiate athletics. Recognizing
the inherent dangers of generali
zation and emotionalism, I shall
try to elucidate a few of these
intangibles.
Measure Self
Collegiate athletics provide
one of the few places where a
man can measure himself face to
face against another man. Not
only are his physical capabilities
brought to a test, but his mental
determination to bring his physi
cal potential to fruition—which
often involves far exceeding the
estimates of his peers.
Physical self-realization, the
ultimate goal of a serious athlete,
requires a probing confrontation
of an individual's basic motiva
tions followed by a resolution to
carry them through.
The achievement of maturity
in any field must be prefaced by
such introspection. An athlete
who has faced himself under one
circumstance may find it easier
to be honest with himself when
the moment of decision arrives
in another endeavor.
To Strive And To Lose
An athlete learns what it is to
put all his hopes, his work, his
pride into one effort, one game,
one meet . . . and lose. He learns
to combat total despair. He
comes back harder for the next
chance.
Acceptance of crushing dis
appointment without resignation
to defeat is a grim proposition,
but it represents an attitude that
may acquire immense value
when life turns one's aspirations
into emptiness.

Intercollegi ate athletics
teaches a student to discipline
himself. He must arrange his
time to treat all of his responsi
bilities. He must make sacrifices
to be able to serve his athletic
demands, but these sacrifices
need not include academics.
Fellowship
The fellowship of a team is
often the foremost reason an ath
lete offers for his participation
in collegiate sports. The close
and lasting friendships that arise
among a group of men who have
established common goals for
themselves remain much longer
than any impression on the rec
ord board.
The inspiration that drives a
certain man to culture his sport
to an artistic degree of perfec
tion is a kinetic enthusiasm that
athletes can share with one
another.
The prolonged, intimate, and
sometimes frustrating work
among members of a team may
create human tensions that both
test and develop the invaluable
ability to work together with
other people.
Develop Individual
An athlete develops his indi
vidual nature through enrich
ment and interaction with his
peers. The common aspirations
of a team provide the common
ground for these interactions to
develop meaningfully and mem
orably.
Finally, intercollegiate athlet
ics are fun. Very few college ath
letes will go on with a sport that
ceases to offer anything more
than an outlet to masochism.
Certainly, no team can ever be
successful if the sport isn't fun.
I am not speaking of an intra
mentary diversion of an intra
mural softball game, but of a
deeper satisfaction.
Intergollegiate training often
pushes men to the limits of pain
. . . but never drudgery. The fun
comes in the results: watching
oneself and one's teammates
come through—often beyond the
wildest expectations—to win.
