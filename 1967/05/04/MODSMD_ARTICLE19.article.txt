## Kaplan, Lane Star In Murder Thriller 
### BRUCE MERRY 
! A star is in the making. Will
Professor Kaplan of Stanford
go into movies or
â€¢legitimate theater? Informed
sources close to the successful
ex-lawyer indicate that illegiti
mate theater is a possibility, but
these are unfortunately not ver
ifiable.
Mark Lane, on the other hand,
is much less ambitious. He is
playing only serious roles at the
present time, and has been do
ing so since the assassination
of President Kennedy.
Lane's acting style is sober, re
strained, almost tragic. John
Kaplan, on the other hand, ap
pears to favor the histrionic
zealot, and we believe that his
inspiration here was the War
ren Commission.
The styles of the rival actors
were wonderfully exhibited at
Tuesday afternoon's "Murder
Revue" in Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium. A capacity audience hissed,
whistled and booed while the
two protagonists slogged their
way through demanding roles,
and the wistful prompter from
a Palo Alto company tried to
balance their false cues.
Tasteless Jokes
The text of the play was ap
parently loaded by Kaplan so
that Lane could not deliver his
best lines. Perhaps the script
was censored by Ronnie Goneril
of Sacramento Conservatory
Theater. Goneril seems envious
of Kaplan's success in the
acting world.
Many of the pokes in "Murder
Revue" are tasteless. "What,"
declaimed Kaplan in the tre
mendous summing-up toward
the end of the third act, "is
the point of inquiring about a
conspiracy to murder the Presi
dent?" "What indeed?" says
Lane, who has incidentally writ
ten a handbook to "Murder Re
vue" called Rush To Judgment.
Kaplan's part is a presenta
tion of the "Lone Assassin"
case, a friendly rehash of the
Warren Commission's convic
tion that the soloist in the orig
should have been Lee Harvey
Oswald.
Subside
Lane's part was forced on
him by his rival protagonist. For
the revue displeased him; but
that was his fault entirely, be
cause he accepted the part in
the first place. The nice prompt
er was at great pains to point
this out to him (though he
never quite quelled Kaplan's
bubbling improvisations) and
usually Lane kept his cool. He

even started telling Kaplan to
"subside."
The actors concentrated on
four main scenes in the play.
Out of a possible four or five
thousand scenes they elected to
enact only these four; concern
ed comment from Lane was
available after the show about
this rather selective attitude.
He appears to be indignant.
The four scenes dealt with
the grooves on the bullet that
was supposed to have pene
trated Kennedy's neck, the Os
wald photograph which might
just have been a fake ("we all
know Uncle Edgar Hoover and
the nice F. 8.1.", Lane's lines ap
peared to suggest), thirdly the
fact that top snipers could not
shoot the President's dummy
from the same distance, and also
Kennedy's famous last word's
clearly uttered at a time when
his throat had been shot apart.
Playboy
Kaplan's acting style through
out the four scenes was viva
cious to say the most. He made
constant but irrelevant skits on
Playboy and McCarthyism, so
that at least one member of the
audience felt inclined to ask
him: "Suppose you think Mc-
Carthy murdered the Pres.?"
Kaplan's style verges on the
grotesque, but it got a lot of
sympathetic laughs. In the "min

uscule fragments" part of the
first sketch (Bullet Grooves) he
was oblivious to any of his co
actor's lines, frustrating in his
evident insincerity but always
in control of the audience.
Not nearly such a past-master
in audience grabbing techniques,
Lane was forced to rely on in
tegrity and an appeal to the
truth. This is disastrous to live
drama, though I imagine it must
be pretty useful in politics.
Both actors were obstinately
convinced that their own lines
were the best. Occasionally Lane
admitted he had dropped a cue;
Kaplan pretended the same
when it was convenient. Judging
by auditorium response, it was
often convenient.
Jolly Prompter
Despite the integrity of his
acting, Lane does have mo
ments of humor. He was tre
mendously sarcastic when Kap
lan kept objecting to his lines.
1 have never seen sarcasm ex
pressed without words on the
live stage.
Clearly the jolly prompter con
sidered contingent material ex
traeous to the case. In an ac
tual court of law I feel that
sincerely presented contingent
evidence is discreetly admitted
by judges. But, of course, this
was just a play.

Kaplan feels above all that
Lane's part is "a tissue of dis
tortions." He was attacked for
libel by Lane. Other reviews of
the show feel that this libel
was not proven. How can you
prove anything on a four-out-of
four thousand basis?
Lane stuck doggedly to his
convictions. Often this reviewer
suffered for the skillful mortifi
cation which Kaplan inflicts on
him. Surprisingly, however, in
the closing sequences of the
show Kaplan flustered; "I ob
ject", "I object", he yapped,
thus tying up pleasantly with
his "Have the recorder repeat
the last question" which recur
red in the early scenes of the
revue.
McCarthyism
Lane took umbrage at a speci
fic assertion by Kaplan that
Left-wing agitation was the root
of dissatisfaction with the find
ings of the Warren Commission.
"Johnson is held in hatred in
large parts of the country. This
is mainly due to the Left. It is
close to McCarthyism: the Left
wing is creating this situation
of hatred for Johnson."
So Kaplan plays the role of
the "lone assassin" actor. But
he never suggested in his per
formance why the Dallas Police

did not protect the fellow who
had just murdered their Presi
dent. Also, actors like Kaplan
really ought to prove that, had
Oswald survived, there would
have been sufficient evidence
phase of the assassination. In
to connect him with every
short, who were the accomp
lices?
The Warren Commission Re
port is at best fishy: at worst
a discredited comedy. This the
revue stressed lovingly. It dwelt
on all the histrionic defects of
Ruby's role, it cracked a sharp
rap on the knuckles of the
careless Texas Police.
But incidentally, it never
showed why President Johnson
was entitled to select for an im
portant inquiry some members
who hardly attended enough ses
sions to know what was going
on. Warren could, and did, run
the whole show.
