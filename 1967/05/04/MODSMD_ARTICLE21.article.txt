# Concert Review
## Sabicas Guitar Technically Excellent 
### PETER WALLENSTEIN 
1967 seems to be the year in
which the Spanish are recon
quering the Peninsula. Only a
week after we were completely
captivated by the Romeros,
guitarist Sabicas strummed his
way to the Stanford campus.
However, it must be said that
Monday night's performance
lacked the vitality achieved by
the Romeros.
It was devoted exclusively to
Flamenco music. In Rnniores de
Granada, the curtain raiser, Sa
bicas executed a number of
chromatic runs in flawless style.
The following piece, El Albaicin,
was characterized by delicate
and precise finger tapping on
the sound board.
Sabicas always features him
self in his own compositions.
In the remaining four numbers
of the first part of the program,
he revealed an astonishing mas
tery of very complex musical
passages.
Flamenco etymologically prob
ably comes from the Arabic,
(felaj-mangur). The 16th cen
tury King, Charles V of Ger
many, imported this type of
music with him to Spain. Dur
ing that era, everything for
eign was called "flamenco"
(Flemish)..
The compositions in the sec
ond part formed a group en
titled Nostalgia. In this bou

quet of numbers, Sabicas creat
ed a very serene and sedate ef
fect with his tender, almost mel
ancholy tone. In one of the
pieces Sabicas evoked some very
oriental images, reminding one
of topless belly-dancers a la
Arabesque. In fine Arabia was
saturated with serenity and
seductiveness.
Cadence
The circumstance and pomp
of Sevilla were beautifully re
vealed in Feria en Sevilla, the
lid sealer for this third part of
the concert. Hearing this piece,
one saw a patrol of Franco's
loyal troops marching down Ma
drid's Paseo del Prado in very
strict time to the immortal 1,
2, 3, 4 cadence count.
Sabicas was definitely a pre
cocious infante, plucking guitar
strings at age five and making
his public debut at age eight.
His boyhood years were spent
in the heart and soul of Fla
menco Spain, Andalusia. Sabicas
and his gypsy upbringing rings
clearly off the strings of his
guitar.
By the third and last section
of the concert, the soloist had
the audience completely in the
palm of his hand. Each of the
works was characterized by in
majestically snappy finishes.
These compositions also in
cluded drum-like effects achiev
ed by tapping the thumb and

index finger in rapid succession
against the body of the guitar.
Sabicas obliged the enthu
siastic audience by perform
ing three encores, in which he
revealed tremendous chromatic
dexterity. Especially notable
was the way his right hand
covered the whole musical
range of the guitar by making
rapid jumps back and forth.
Sabicas covers the range of
his instrument as well as Willie
Mays patrols the outfield pas
tures for the San Francisco
Giants.

While this was a techni
cally excellent performance, one
has nevertheless experienced
guitar playing with consider
ably greater vitality.
Question: Why did the friendly
family concern, the Palo Alto
Times cover Sabicas, "The
King of the Spanish Guitar,"
but fail to review the Ro
meros?
Answer: Because, like not a
few Americans, our local
newspaper is blinded by
Royalty.
