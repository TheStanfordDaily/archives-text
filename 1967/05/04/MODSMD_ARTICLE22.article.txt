# Little Big Meet
## Stanford Frosh Face Cat Spikes 
### JIM MALLERY 
The Stanford Papooses lay
their perfect 7-0 record on the
line against the Cal Frosh this
Saturday as they team with the
varsity in the 1967 edition of the
Big Meet.
It will be the toughest test of
the year for the Cards, who have
won meets by as much as seven
ty points. A dope sheet based on
best performances of the season
shows the Bears winning in a
close contest, but both teams
will concede that the meet is still
up for grabs.
Freshmen Injured Too
The Frosh tracksters have fol
lowed the varsity's bad example
of having key men injured, and

it could be on the strength of
these men that the meet is won
or lost.
Jim Donart, the Tribe's unde
feated sprinter, is suffering from
a muscle pull in the thigh and
may not be at full strength.
Tony Rogers, who ran a blazing
50.8 in the 440 in the first meet
of the season, is trying to shake
off a lingering hamstring pull
that has slowed him down in re
cent meets.
Strength In Field Events
Stanford's biggest hope for
points is in the field events. In
the pole vault both Clint Os
trander and Steve Flannery have
sailed higher than Cal's best
man, Ostrander going 15'-2" and
Flannery 14'-6, compared to
Bear Jeff Demanes at 14'-0".
Dave Arnold has the edge over
Steve Simon in the discus, 156'-
1" to 145'-7". Again in the jave
lin Stanford has the two best
throws. Neil Heller and Jerry
Porter are both over 180', while
Bob Kurtz is near 150'.
Undefeated Stanford high
jumper Dave Harper will have
his hands full when he faces
Cal's Clarence Johnson, who as
a high schooler cleared 7'-0".
Clarence has done 7'-%" this
year and Harper 6'-7%".
Pressure On Distance Men
The distance runners, who
beat the Cal Frosh in cross-coun
try last fall, are going to have
to do the same Saturday if the
Cards are to pull the meet out.
Cal brings with them two ex
cellent runners, Wally Mattingly
in the mile and Bob Waldon in
the 2-mile. Mattingly, with a
best of 4:16.2, will run against
Greg Brock who has a best of
4:19.8. Brock is just rounding
back into shape after severely
spraining his ankle midway
through the season.
Chuck Menz will tackle Wal
don in the 2-mile. Menz has a
9:17 to his credit this year, and
Waldon a 9:10.
The meet will be run in the
stadium in conjunction with the
varsity meet, with the Frosh
field events starting at 12:15
p.m.
