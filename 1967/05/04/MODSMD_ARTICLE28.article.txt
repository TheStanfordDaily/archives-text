# Letters To The Editor
## Reply To 'In-Crowd' Accusers 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
' I am rather sick of the "in
crowd" affair, but after yester
day's attack on my person in the
letter of Messrs. Mitchell, Loom
is, and Newton, I feel I must
clarify a few errors.
First, I wish to make it clear
that I alone am fully responsible
for my action of tearing down
the "in-crowd" signs in Stern
(to my knowledge, none were
removed in Wilbur; the infer
ence that I was responsible for
such an act is false.) I would
like to apologize to the members
of the community and to the
people of the SFE for my irre
sponsible act.
It was motivated by the very
great anger at the slanderous
inferences from faulty facts
that had marked the whole cam
paign. Furthermore, the docu
ments were all unsigned when I
removed them. However, on re
considering the act for a few
minutes, I went with several
friends to replace at least four
of the sheets in each bathroom
of Stern, where new and still
unsigned sheets had already ap
peared.
Clarification
Beyond that, I only wish to
clarify the events of the entire
evening for Mr. Mitchell, whose
telephone conversation with Mr.
Fitts has been mis-represented.
I had spoken with three gentle
men at Stern at approximately
3:00 a.m. and volunteered my
name and the fact that I dis
liked anonymous literature of a
slanderous form.
At about 4:15 I returned to
the Grove House on a personal
matter, and was speaking with
Mr. Fitts when Mr. Mitchell
phoned. Mr. Mitchell said he rep
resented a group called "Stu
dents for Freedom', and that I
had torn down their literature.
Mr. Fitts said that he couldn't
control the whole campus but
that "no more material would
be torn down" by anyone he
could contact. That some were
torn down in Wilbur, if it is
true, might have been genuine
response to a disgusting accu
sation.
Finally I was glad to see that
the group's earlier claim to be
"critical" of Mr. Lyman was cor
rected to say "attack" in the last
paragraph of the letter. I hope
that we can all return to more
sane behavior.

• Here They Are Again
Editor, The Daily:
Students for Free Elections
was formed last Monday night
with the purpose of distributing
material to expose The Daily's
biased coverage of the current
elections.
The material was written by
a student who supported Joe
Reich. The material however
was felt to reflect the plight of
all of Peter Lyman's opponents.
A successful attempt was made
to get workers for the organi
zation which supported several
different candidates.
The workers which distributed
material in various men's dor
matories and at the "non-rally"
Tuesday were told that although
they were free to support any
candidate SFE was not to be
involved. It was even decided
to choose officers (or spokes
men) who supported different
candidates.
Without the knowledge of the

organization the author gave
Mr. Reich and Mr. Kane some of
the material to deliver it to a
couple of women who had vol
unteered to distribute it in the
women's residences. It is not
surprising that the candidates
were willing to make the de
livery since they were in agree
ment with the statements ex
pressed.
Nonetheless, SFE regrets that
they made the delivery since it
opens the door to charges that
SFE is working in co-ordination
with Mr. Reich. This is definitely
not the situation. Moreover,
merely because Mr. Reich and
Mr. Kane unwisely delivered
the material the statements it
contains are no less true.
Attempts which Mr. Lyman
and his friends have made to
pass SFE off as a campaign
front for one candidate are
merely attempts to avoid the
valid criticisms which SFE has
offered.
We are glad that Mr. Kano
has apologized for the deliver
ing. It was a unwise act which
probably hurt our cause. The
fact that he repudiated some of
our statements is his own busi
ness. It is important to note
again, however, that our policy
is to refuse the endorsement of
any candidate as well as to re
fuse to endorse any candidate.
Therefore, whether or not he
agrees or disagrees with us is
not a major concern of ours.

• Outside The System
Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Paine's letter to The
Daily on Monday he objected
to the University's granting
housing to The Experiment be
cause it "does not consider al
ternatives within the existing
order". I would like to point out
what I think such a stand im
plies. To decide to work within
the existing order, whether of
a nation, university or smaller
community, is to avoid the ques
tion of whether or not the exist
ing order still solves our prob
lems as they arise. To say that
they must go on within the
present order is to fail to face
the possibility that there may
be something basically wrong
with it.
It is the kind of possibility a
clergyman faces if he dares
question the very existence of
God; that a fraternity man faces
if he considers the possibility
that the basis of his system
(selectivity) has somehow be
come wrong for him today;
that a loyal American faces if
he questions the principle that,
has led to deaths of thousands
of people. It takes guts to doubt
the structures which define us,
but we must realize that the
solutions to our problems are
more important than the preser
vation of a system. I only use
Mr. Paine's statement as a jump
ing off place and I cannot speak
for The Experiment. However,
I think that the important ques
tions today concerning the na
tion, the university, and our
selves as individuals can only
be seriously dealt with by those
who risk the security of existing
orders by going outside them.

Editor, The Daily:
In a letter in Monday's Daily

Mr. Frank Paine, a junior in
political science, entered the con
troversy over the Experiment.
He interpreted a statement by
Barry Greenberg that the Ex
periment is an "honest, open
search for possible alternative
ways of living, both with our
selves and with others,' as mean
ing that the Experiment is con
sidering "alternatives outside
the existing social order; i.e.,
the Experiment is only consider
ing the possibilities for radical
social change, for a new order."
I feel this interpretation dis
plays the same intellectual over
simplification of which he ac
cuses Mr. Greenberg, at the be
ginning of his letter. The idea
that there are faults in the pres
ent social system appears often
in Resistance and in the activi
ties of the Experiment, yet I
feel that the clear desire of these
t. o associations to remain cen
naily located on campus is an
involvement within, and a con
cern for, the established society.
The search for "alternative
ways of living" is to include
people other than Experiment
members. All who wish to con
tribute to a reform and improve
ment of society, within or with
out that society, are invited to
do so.
When Mr. Paine asserts later
on that there is "in fact an as
sumption of a political nature
in the Experiment's program,"
I don't disagree with him. But
why, in fact, are a number of
university members so terrified
by a political commitment? I
think the belief that the Ameri
can system of life is definitely
dissatisfying is given its chief
consistency and value only when
it is organized politically. It is
this political and moral consist
ency above all which makes the
Experiment the valuable forum
that it is. A definite and well-con
sidered movement towards
greater openness of thought and
action must be carried out re
gardless of social orders. There
is only an objective which must
be accomplished before it's no
longer possible.
The "New Left, 'is in my mind
neither an attempt to destroy or
create whole societies, but an
effort to do what Babbitt tells
his son to do—to live in a more
personally meaningful way. It
may be that few means to ac
complish this change remain
available, but that is all the
more reason to initiate debate
and commitment. Consequently,
Mr. Paine is correct in saying
that the Experiment is politi
cally and morally commited, but
in accurate when he adds that
the Experiment "does not con
sider alternatives within the ex
isting order."
To give my abstractions a lit
tle more concrete, existential
value, I would like to add that
my undergraduate education at
Stanford so stifled my aware
ness of self that it was only two
days ago that I realized firmly
that my reading must be guided
by its application to my needs
and desires in life. Up until then,
I read what I thought it was
proper and academically correct
for an English major to read.
The Experiment was at least
partly instrumental in bringing
about the new awareness.

• Kudos To Kaplan
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Tuesday's confron
tation between Mark Lane and
John Kaplan:
In his summation, Lane denies
that Kaplan had proven Rush to
Judgment a tissue of distortion,
partially because Kaplan had at
tacked a mere 4 of its 4500 cita
tions. Undoubtedly, Kaplan
failed to show that all of Lane's
allegations were false, just as no
one was able to demonstrate
that none of Senator McCarthy's
200 Communist agents in the
State Department were, indeed,
Communists. However, by con
centrating on a few examples,
Kaplan did provide some in
sights into Lane's techniques.
Kaplan brought to the atten
tion of the audience a passage
in Rush to Judgment accusing
Warren Commission counsel of
interrupting witness Lee Bow
ers, Jr. in mid-sentence to pre
vent Bowers from relating an
important piece of evidence
(Rush to Judgment, p. 32). Kap
lan then pointed out that later
in his testimony, Commission
counsel three times asked Mr.
Bowers if he had any other in
formation pertaining to the
assassination, receiving answers
of, "Nothing that I can recall.',
"Yes, I believe that I have re
lated everything which I have
told the city police, and also the
FBI.", and "To my knowledge
I can remember nothing else."
(Warren Commission Hearings,
Vol. VII, p. 288-289).
While the record clearly
shows that Bowers had the op
portunity to tell all he knew,
Lane did not retract his accusa
tion, nor did he plead ignorance
of the latter part of Bower's
testimony. Instead he asserted
that the only relevant consider
ation was that Bowers himself,
in a subsequent interview, had
erroneously alleged that Com
mission counsel had not allowed
him the opportunity to give his
information.
There are other equally flag
rant and intentional distrotions
in Lane's book. For example,
the Warren Commission con
tends that shortly after the
assassination Oswald boarded a
bus driven by Cecil J. McWat
ters, citing as evidence a trans
fer allegedly found in Oswald's
pocket on which were marks
giving the date, time and place
of issuance, as well as the driver
who issued it. (Warren Commis
sion Report, p. 157). Lane, in his
book, mentions the transfer, but,
neglects to state that it could
only have been issued at 12:36
p.m. on the day of the assassin
ation on McWatter's bus (Rush
to Judgment, p. 161)— at the
same time and on the same bus
that the Warren Commission in
sists, but Lane denies, Lee Har
vey Oswald boarded after leav
ing the Book Depository build
ing. Lane's denial would be more
convincing had he not com
pletely ignored a very import
ant piece of evidence.
I salute Professor Kaplan for
his courage and skill in publicly
and successfully confronting
Mr. Lane despite a huge disad
vantage in the length of time
spent studying the evidence.

The search for "alternative

When Mr. Paine asserts later

why, in fact, are a number of

by a political commitment? I
think the belief that the Ameri

dissatisfying is given its chief

it is organized politically. It is
this political and moral consist

Experiment the valuable forum

The "New Left, 'is in my mind

• Kudos To Kaplan
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Tuesday's confron
tation between Mark Lane and
John Kaplan:
In his summation, Lane denies
that Kaplan had proven Rush to
Judgment a tissue of distortion,
partially because Kaplan had at
tacked a mere 4 of its 4500 cita
tions. Undoubtedly, Kaplan
failed to show that all of Lane's
allegations were false, just as no
one was able to demonstrate
that none of Senator McCarthy's
200 Communist agents in the
State Department were, indeed,
Communists. However, by con
centrating on a few examples,
Kaplan did provide some in
sights into Lane's techniques.
Kaplan brought to the atten
tion of the audience a passage
in Rush to Judgment accusing
Warren Commission counsel of
interrupting witness Lee Bow
ers, Jr. in mid-sentence to pre
vent Bowers from relating an
important piece of evidence
(Rush to Judgment, p. 32). Kap
lan then pointed out that later
in his testimony, Commission
counsel three times asked Mr.
Bowers if he had any other in
formation pertaining to the
assassination, receiving answers
of, "Nothing that I can recall.',
"Yes, I believe that I have re
lated everything which I have
told the city police, and also the
FBI.", and "To my knowledge
I can remember nothing else."
(Warren Commission Hearings,
Vol. VII, p. 288-289).
While the record clearly
shows that Bowers had the op
portunity to tell all he knew,
Lane did not retract his accusa
tion, nor did he plead ignorance
of the latter part of Bower's
testimony. Instead he asserted
that the only relevant consider
ation was that Bowers himself,
in a subsequent interview, had
erroneously alleged that Com
mission counsel had not allowed
him the opportunity to give his
information.
There are other equally flag
rant and intentional distrotions
in Lane's book. For example,
the Warren Commission con
tends that shortly after the
assassination Oswald boarded a
bus driven by Cecil J. McWat
ters, citing as evidence a trans
fer allegedly found in Oswald's
pocket on which were marks
giving the date, time and place
of issuance, as well as the driver
who issued it. (Warren Commis
sion Report, p. 157). Lane, in his
book, mentions the transfer, but,
neglects to state that it could
only have been issued at 12:36
p.m. on the day of the assassin
ation on McWatter's bus (Rush
to Judgment, p. 161)— at the
same time and on the same bus
that the Warren Commission in
sists, but Lane denies, Lee Har
vey Oswald boarded after leav
ing the Book Depository build
ing. Lane's denial would be more
convincing had he not com
pletely ignored a very import
ant piece of evidence.
I salute Professor Kaplan for
his courage and skill in publicly
and successfully confronting
Mr. Lane despite a huge disad
vantage in the length of time
spent studying the evidence.

Editor, The Dally:
' I am rather sick of the "in
crowd" affair, but after yester
day's attack on my person in the
letter of Messrs. Mitchell, Loom
is, and Newton, I feel I must
clarify a few errors.
First, I wish to make it clear
that I alone am fully responsible
for my action of tearing down
the "in-crowd" signs in Stern
(to my knowledge, none were
removed in Wilbur; the infer
ence that I was responsible for
such an act is false.) I would
like to apologize to the members
of the community and to the
people of the SFE for my irre
sponsible act.
It was motivated by the very
great anger at the slanderous
inferences from faulty facts
that had marked the whole cam
paign. Furthermore, the docu
ments were all unsigned when I
removed them. However, on re
considering the act for a few
minutes, I went with several
friends to replace at least four
of the sheets in each bathroom
of Stern, where new and still
unsigned sheets had already ap
peared.
Clarification
Beyond that, I only wish to
clarify the events of the entire
evening for Mr. Mitchell, whose
telephone conversation with Mr.
Fitts has been mis-represented.
I had spoken with three gentle
men at Stern at approximately
3:00 a.m. and volunteered my
name and the fact that I dis
liked anonymous literature of a
slanderous form.
At about 4:15 I returned to
the Grove House on a personal
matter, and was speaking with
Mr. Fitts when Mr. Mitchell
phoned. Mr. Mitchell said he rep
resented a group called "Stu
dents for Freedom', and that I
had torn down their literature.
Mr. Fitts said that he couldn't
control the whole campus but
that "no more material would
be torn down" by anyone he
could contact. That some were
torn down in Wilbur, if it is
true, might have been genuine
response to a disgusting accu
sation.
Finally I was glad to see that
the group's earlier claim to be
"critical" of Mr. Lyman was cor
rected to say "attack" in the last
paragraph of the letter. I hope
that we can all return to more
sane behavior.

• Here They Are Again
Editor, The Daily:
Students for Free Elections
was formed last Monday night
with the purpose of distributing
material to expose The Daily's
biased coverage of the current
elections.
The material was written by
a student who supported Joe
Reich. The material however
was felt to reflect the plight of
all of Peter Lyman's opponents.
A successful attempt was made
to get workers for the organi
zation which supported several
different candidates.
The workers which distributed
material in various men's dor
matories and at the "non-rally"
Tuesday were told that although
they were free to support any
candidate SFE was not to be
involved. It was even decided
to choose officers (or spokes
men) who supported different
candidates.
Without the knowledge of the

organization the author gave
Mr. Reich and Mr. Kane some of
the material to deliver it to a
couple of women who had vol
unteered to distribute it in the
women's residences. It is not
surprising that the candidates
were willing to make the de
livery since they were in agree
ment with the statements ex
pressed.
Nonetheless, SFE regrets that
they made the delivery since it
opens the door to charges that
SFE is working in co-ordination
with Mr. Reich. This is definitely
not the situation. Moreover,
merely because Mr. Reich and
Mr. Kane unwisely delivered
the material the statements it
contains are no less true.
Attempts which Mr. Lyman
and his friends have made to
pass SFE off as a campaign
front for one candidate are
merely attempts to avoid the
valid criticisms which SFE has
offered.
We are glad that Mr. Kano
has apologized for the deliver
ing. It was a unwise act which
probably hurt our cause. The
fact that he repudiated some of
our statements is his own busi
ness. It is important to note
again, however, that our policy
is to refuse the endorsement of
any candidate as well as to re
fuse to endorse any candidate.
Therefore, whether or not he
agrees or disagrees with us is
not a major concern of ours.

• Outside The System
Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Paine's letter to The
Daily on Monday he objected
to the University's granting
housing to The Experiment be
cause it "does not consider al
ternatives within the existing
order". I would like to point out
what I think such a stand im
plies. To decide to work within
the existing order, whether of
a nation, university or smaller
community, is to avoid the ques
tion of whether or not the exist
ing order still solves our prob
lems as they arise. To say that
they must go on within the
present order is to fail to face
the possibility that there may
be something basically wrong
with it.
It is the kind of possibility a
clergyman faces if he dares
question the very existence of
God; that a fraternity man faces
if he considers the possibility
that the basis of his system
(selectivity) has somehow be
come wrong for him today;
that a loyal American faces if
he questions the principle that,
has led to deaths of thousands
of people. It takes guts to doubt
the structures which define us,
but we must realize that the
solutions to our problems are
more important than the preser
vation of a system. I only use
Mr. Paine's statement as a jump
ing off place and I cannot speak
for The Experiment. However,
I think that the important ques
tions today concerning the na
tion, the university, and our
selves as individuals can only
be seriously dealt with by those
who risk the security of existing
orders by going outside them.

Editor, The Daily:
In a letter in Monday's Daily

Mr. Frank Paine, a junior in
political science, entered the con
troversy over the Experiment.
He interpreted a statement by
Barry Greenberg that the Ex

search for possible alternative
ways of living, both with our
selves and with others,' as mean
ing that the Experiment is con
sidering "alternatives outside
the existing social order; i.e.,
the Experiment is only consider
ing the possibilities for radical
social change, for a new order."
I feel this interpretation dis
plays the same intellectual over
simplification of which he ac
cuses Mr. Greenberg, at the be

that there are faults in the pres
ent social system appears often
in Resistance and in the activi
ties of the Experiment, yet I
feel that the clear desire of these
t. o associations to remain cen

The search for "alternative

had torn down their literature.
Mr. Fitts said that he couldn't
control the whole campus but
that "no more material would
be torn down" by anyone he
could contact. That some were
torn down in Wilbur, if it is
true, might have been genuine
response to a disgusting accu

• Here They Are Again
Editor, The Daily:
Students for Free Elections
was formed last Monday night
with the purpose of distributing
material to expose The Daily's
biased coverage of the current
elections.
The material was written by
a student who supported Joe
Reich. The material however
was felt to reflect the plight of
all of Peter Lyman's opponents.
A successful attempt was made
to get workers for the organi
zation which supported several
different candidates.
The workers which distributed
material in various men's dor
matories and at the "non-rally"
Tuesday were told that although
they were free to support any
candidate SFE was not to be
involved. It was even decided
to choose officers (or spokes
men) who supported different
candidates.
Without the knowledge of the

organization the author gave
Mr. Reich and Mr. Kane some of
the material to deliver it to a
couple of women who had vol
unteered to distribute it in the
women's residences. It is not
surprising that the candidates
were willing to make the de
livery since they were in agree
ment with the statements ex
pressed.
Nonetheless, SFE regrets that
they made the delivery since it
opens the door to charges that
SFE is working in co-ordination
with Mr. Reich. This is definitely
not the situation. Moreover,
merely because Mr. Reich and
Mr. Kane unwisely delivered
the material the statements it
contains are no less true.
Attempts which Mr. Lyman
and his friends have made to
pass SFE off as a campaign
front for one candidate are
merely attempts to avoid the
valid criticisms which SFE has
offered.
We are glad that Mr. Kano
has apologized for the deliver
ing. It was a unwise act which
probably hurt our cause. The
fact that he repudiated some of
our statements is his own busi
ness. It is important to note
again, however, that our policy
is to refuse the endorsement of
any candidate as well as to re
fuse to endorse any candidate.
Therefore, whether or not he
agrees or disagrees with us is
not a major concern of ours.

• Outside The System
Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Paine's letter to The
Daily on Monday he objected
to the University's granting
housing to The Experiment be
cause it "does not consider al
ternatives within the existing
order". I would like to point out
what I think such a stand im
plies. To decide to work within
the existing order, whether of
a nation, university or smaller
community, is to avoid the ques
tion of whether or not the exist
ing order still solves our prob
lems as they arise. To say that
they must go on within the
present order is to fail to face
the possibility that there may
be something basically wrong
with it.
It is the kind of possibility a
clergyman faces if he dares
question the very existence of
God; that a fraternity man faces
if he considers the possibility
that the basis of his system
(selectivity) has somehow be
come wrong for him today;
that a loyal American faces if
he questions the principle that,
has led to deaths of thousands
of people. It takes guts to doubt
the structures which define us,
but we must realize that the
solutions to our problems are
more important than the preser
vation of a system. I only use
Mr. Paine's statement as a jump
ing off place and I cannot speak
for The Experiment. However,
I think that the important ques
tions today concerning the na
tion, the university, and our
selves as individuals can only
be seriously dealt with by those
who risk the security of existing

Editor, The Daily:
In a letter in Monday's Daily

Mr. Frank Paine, a junior in
political science, entered the con
troversy over the Experiment.
He interpreted a statement by
Barry Greenberg that the Ex
periment is an "honest, open
search for possible alternative
ways of living, both with our
selves and with others,' as mean
ing that the Experiment is con
sidering "alternatives outside
the existing social order; i.e.,
the Experiment is only consider
ing the possibilities for radical
social change, for a new order."
I feel this interpretation dis
plays the same intellectual over
simplification of which he ac
cuses Mr. Greenberg, at the be
ginning of his letter. The idea
that there are faults in the pres
ent social system appears often
in Resistance and in the activi
ties of the Experiment, yet I
feel that the clear desire of these
t. o associations to remain cen
naily located on campus is an
involvement within, and a con
cern for, the established society.
The search for "alternative
ways of living" is to include
people other than Experiment
members. All who wish to con
tribute to a reform and improve
ment of society, within or with
out that society, are invited to
do so.
When Mr. Paine asserts later
on that there is "in fact an as
sumption of a political nature
in the Experiment's program,"
I don't disagree with him. But
why, in fact, are a number of
university members so terrified
by a political commitment? I
think the belief that the Ameri
can system of life is definitely
dissatisfying is given its chief
consistency and value only when
it is organized politically. It is
this political and moral consist
ency above all which makes the
Experiment the valuable forum
that it is. A definite and well-con
sidered movement towards
greater openness of thought and
action must be carried out re
gardless of social orders. There
is only an objective which must
be accomplished before it's no
longer possible.
The "New Left, 'is in my mind
neither an attempt to destroy or
create whole societies, but an
effort to do what Babbitt tells
his son to do—to live in a more
personally meaningful way. It
may be that few means to ac
complish this change remain
available, but that is all the
more reason to initiate debate
and commitment. Consequently,
Mr. Paine is correct in saying
that the Experiment is politi
cally and morally commited, but
in accurate when he adds that
the Experiment "does not con
sider alternatives within the ex
isting order."
To give my abstractions a lit
tle more concrete, existential
value, I would like to add that
my undergraduate education at
Stanford so stifled my aware
ness of self that it was only two
days ago that I realized firmly
that my reading must be guided
by its application to my needs
and desires in life. Up until then,
I read what I thought it was
proper and academically correct
for an English major to read.
The Experiment was at least
partly instrumental in bringing
about the new awareness.

• Kudos To Kaplan
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Tuesday's confron
tation between Mark Lane and
John Kaplan:
In his summation, Lane denies
that Kaplan had proven Rush to
Judgment a tissue of distortion,
partially because Kaplan had at
tacked a mere 4 of its 4500 cita
tions. Undoubtedly, Kaplan
failed to show that all of Lane's
allegations were false, just as no
one was able to demonstrate
that none of Senator McCarthy's
200 Communist agents in the
State Department were, indeed,
Communists. However, by con
centrating on a few examples,
Kaplan did provide some in
sights into Lane's techniques.
Kaplan brought to the atten
tion of the audience a passage
in Rush to Judgment accusing
Warren Commission counsel of
interrupting witness Lee Bow
ers, Jr. in mid-sentence to pre
vent Bowers from relating an
important piece of evidence
(Rush to Judgment, p. 32). Kap
lan then pointed out that later
in his testimony, Commission
counsel three times asked Mr.
Bowers if he had any other in
formation pertaining to the
assassination, receiving answers
of, "Nothing that I can recall.',
"Yes, I believe that I have re
lated everything which I have
told the city police, and also the
FBI.", and "To my knowledge
I can remember nothing else."
(Warren Commission Hearings,
Vol. VII, p. 288-289).
While the record clearly
shows that Bowers had the op
portunity to tell all he knew,
Lane did not retract his accusa
tion, nor did he plead ignorance
of the latter part of Bower's
testimony. Instead he asserted
that the only relevant consider
ation was that Bowers himself,
in a subsequent interview, had
erroneously alleged that Com
mission counsel had not allowed
him the opportunity to give his
information.
There are other equally flag
rant and intentional distrotions
in Lane's book. For example,
the Warren Commission con
tends that shortly after the
assassination Oswald boarded a
bus driven by Cecil J. McWat
ters, citing as evidence a trans
fer allegedly found in Oswald's
pocket on which were marks
giving the date, time and place
of issuance, as well as the driver
who issued it. (Warren Commis
sion Report, p. 157). Lane, in his
book, mentions the transfer, but,
neglects to state that it could
only have been issued at 12:36
p.m. on the day of the assassin
ation on McWatter's bus (Rush
to Judgment, p. 161)— at the
same time and on the same bus
that the Warren Commission in
sists, but Lane denies, Lee Har
vey Oswald boarded after leav
ing the Book Depository build
ing. Lane's denial would be more
convincing had he not com
pletely ignored a very import
ant piece of evidence.
I salute Professor Kaplan for
his courage and skill in publicly
and successfully confronting
Mr. Lane despite a huge disad
vantage in the length of time
spent studying the evidence.

Editor, The Dally:
' I am rather sick of the "in
crowd" affair, but after yester
day's attack on my person in the
letter of Messrs. Mitchell, Loom
is, and Newton, I feel I must
clarify a few errors.
First, I wish to make it clear
that I alone am fully responsible
for my action of tearing down
the "in-crowd" signs in Stern
(to my knowledge, none were
removed in Wilbur; the infer
ence that I was responsible for
such an act is false.) I would
like to apologize to the members
of the community and to the
people of the SFE for my irre
sponsible act.
It was motivated by the very
great anger at the slanderous
inferences from faulty facts
that had marked the whole cam
paign. Furthermore, the docu
ments were all unsigned when I
removed them. However, on re
considering the act for a few
minutes, I went with several
friends to replace at least four
of the sheets in each bathroom
of Stern, where new and still
unsigned sheets had already ap
peared.
Clarification
Beyond that, I only wish to
clarify the events of the entire
evening for Mr. Mitchell, whose
telephone conversation with Mr.
Fitts has been mis-represented.
I had spoken with three gentle
men at Stern at approximately
3:00 a.m. and volunteered my

resented a group called "Stu

Mr. Fitts said that he couldn't
control the whole campus but
that "no more material would
be torn down" by anyone he
could contact. That some were
torn down in Wilbur, if it is
true, might have been genuine
response to a disgusting accu
sation.
Finally I was glad to see that
the group's earlier claim to be
"critical" of Mr. Lyman was cor

that we can all return to more

• Kudos To Kaplan
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Tuesday's confron
tation between Mark Lane and
John Kaplan:
In his summation, Lane denies
that Kaplan had proven Rush to
Judgment a tissue of distortion,
partially because Kaplan had at
tacked a mere 4 of its 4500 cita
tions. Undoubtedly, Kaplan
failed to show that all of Lane's
allegations were false, just as no
one was able to demonstrate
that none of Senator McCarthy's
200 Communist agents in the
State Department were, indeed,
Communists. However, by con
centrating on a few examples,
Kaplan did provide some in
sights into Lane's techniques.
Kaplan brought to the atten
tion of the audience a passage
in Rush to Judgment accusing
Warren Commission counsel of
interrupting witness Lee Bow
ers, Jr. in mid-sentence to pre
vent Bowers from relating an
important piece of evidence
(Rush to Judgment, p. 32). Kap
lan then pointed out that later
in his testimony, Commission
counsel three times asked Mr.
Bowers if he had any other in
formation pertaining to the
assassination, receiving answers
of, "Nothing that I can recall.',
"Yes, I believe that I have re
lated everything which I have
told the city police, and also the
FBI.", and "To my knowledge
I can remember nothing else."
(Warren Commission Hearings,
Vol. VII, p. 288-289).
While the record clearly
shows that Bowers had the op
portunity to tell all he knew,
Lane did not retract his accusa
tion, nor did he plead ignorance
of the latter part of Bower's
testimony. Instead he asserted
that the only relevant consider
ation was that Bowers himself,
in a subsequent interview, had
erroneously alleged that Com
mission counsel had not allowed
him the opportunity to give his
information.
There are other equally flag
rant and intentional distrotions
in Lane's book. For example,
the Warren Commission con
tends that shortly after the
assassination Oswald boarded a
bus driven by Cecil J. McWat
ters, citing as evidence a trans
fer allegedly found in Oswald's
pocket on which were marks
giving the date, time and place
of issuance, as well as the driver
who issued it. (Warren Commis
sion Report, p. 157). Lane, in his
book, mentions the transfer, but,
neglects to state that it could
only have been issued at 12:36
p.m. on the day of the assassin
ation on McWatter's bus (Rush
to Judgment, p. 161)— at the
same time and on the same bus
that the Warren Commission in
sists, but Lane denies, Lee Har
vey Oswald boarded after leav
ing the Book Depository build
ing. Lane's denial would be more
convincing had he not com
pletely ignored a very import
ant piece of evidence.
I salute Professor Kaplan for
his courage and skill in publicly

Mr. Lane despite a huge disad
vantage in the length of time

' I am rather sick of the "in

clarify a few errors.
First, I wish to make it clear
that I alone am fully responsible
for my action of tearing down
the "in-crowd" signs in Stern
(to my knowledge, none were
removed in Wilbur; the infer
ence that I was responsible for
such an act is false.) I would
like to apologize to the members

It was motivated by the very
great anger at the slanderous

removed them. However, on re
considering the act for a few

Beyond that, I only wish to

I had spoken with three gentle

At about 4:15 I returned to

Mr. Fitts said that he couldn't

that "no more material would
be torn down" by anyone he

torn down in Wilbur, if it is
true, might have been genuine
response to a disgusting accu

• Here They Are Again
Editor, The Daily:
Students for Free Elections
was formed last Monday night
with the purpose of distributing
material to expose The Daily's
biased coverage of the current
elections.
The material was written by
a student who supported Joe
Reich. The material however
was felt to reflect the plight of
all of Peter Lyman's opponents.
A successful attempt was made
to get workers for the organi
zation which supported several
different candidates.
The workers which distributed
material in various men's dor
matories and at the "non-rally"
Tuesday were told that although
they were free to support any
candidate SFE was not to be
involved. It was even decided
to choose officers (or spokes
men) who supported different
candidates.
Without the knowledge of the

organization the author gave
Mr. Reich and Mr. Kane some of
the material to deliver it to a
couple of women who had vol
unteered to distribute it in the
women's residences. It is not
surprising that the candidates
were willing to make the de
livery since they were in agree
ment with the statements ex
pressed.
Nonetheless, SFE regrets that
they made the delivery since it
opens the door to charges that
SFE is working in co-ordination
with Mr. Reich. This is definitely
not the situation. Moreover,
merely because Mr. Reich and
Mr. Kane unwisely delivered
the material the statements it
contains are no less true.
Attempts which Mr. Lyman
and his friends have made to
pass SFE off as a campaign
front for one candidate are
merely attempts to avoid the
valid criticisms which SFE has
offered.
We are glad that Mr. Kano
has apologized for the deliver
ing. It was a unwise act which
probably hurt our cause. The
fact that he repudiated some of
our statements is his own busi
ness. It is important to note
again, however, that our policy
is to refuse the endorsement of
any candidate as well as to re
fuse to endorse any candidate.
Therefore, whether or not he
agrees or disagrees with us is
not a major concern of ours.

• Outside The System
Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Paine's letter to The
Daily on Monday he objected
to the University's granting
housing to The Experiment be
cause it "does not consider al
ternatives within the existing
order". I would like to point out
what I think such a stand im
plies. To decide to work within
the existing order, whether of
a nation, university or smaller
community, is to avoid the ques
tion of whether or not the exist
ing order still solves our prob
lems as they arise. To say that
they must go on within the
present order is to fail to face
the possibility that there may
be something basically wrong
with it.
It is the kind of possibility a
clergyman faces if he dares
question the very existence of
God; that a fraternity man faces
if he considers the possibility
that the basis of his system
(selectivity) has somehow be
come wrong for him today;
that a loyal American faces if
he questions the principle that,
has led to deaths of thousands
of people. It takes guts to doubt
the structures which define us,
but we must realize that the
solutions to our problems are
more important than the preser
vation of a system. I only use
Mr. Paine's statement as a jump
ing off place and I cannot speak
for The Experiment. However,
I think that the important ques
tions today concerning the na
tion, the university, and our
selves as individuals can only
be seriously dealt with by those
who risk the security of existing
orders by going outside them.
JEFF BROWNING

• Awareness
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter in Monday's Daily

Mr. Frank Paine, a junior in
political science, entered the con
troversy over the Experiment.
He interpreted a statement by
Barry Greenberg that the Ex
periment is an "honest, open
search for possible alternative
ways of living, both with our
selves and with others,' as mean
ing that the Experiment is con
sidering "alternatives outside
the existing social order; i.e.,
the Experiment is only consider
ing the possibilities for radical
social change, for a new order."
I feel this interpretation dis
plays the same intellectual over
simplification of which he ac
cuses Mr. Greenberg, at the be
ginning of his letter. The idea
that there are faults in the pres
ent social system appears often
in Resistance and in the activi
ties of the Experiment, yet I
feel that the clear desire of these
t. o associations to remain cen
naily located on campus is an
involvement within, and a con
cern for, the established society.
The search for "alternative
ways of living" is to include
people other than Experiment
members. All who wish to con
tribute to a reform and improve
ment of society, within or with
out that society, are invited to
do so.
When Mr. Paine asserts later
on that there is "in fact an as
sumption of a political nature
in the Experiment's program,"
I don't disagree with him. But
why, in fact, are a number of
university members so terrified
by a political commitment? I
think the belief that the Ameri
can system of life is definitely
dissatisfying is given its chief
consistency and value only when
it is organized politically. It is
this political and moral consist
ency above all which makes the
Experiment the valuable forum
that it is. A definite and well-con
sidered movement towards
greater openness of thought and
action must be carried out re
gardless of social orders. There
is only an objective which must
be accomplished before it's no
longer possible.
The "New Left, 'is in my mind
neither an attempt to destroy or
create whole societies, but an
effort to do what Babbitt tells
his son to do—to live in a more
personally meaningful way. It
may be that few means to ac
complish this change remain
available, but that is all the
more reason to initiate debate
and commitment. Consequently,
Mr. Paine is correct in saying
that the Experiment is politi
cally and morally commited, but
in accurate when he adds that
the Experiment "does not con
sider alternatives within the ex
isting order."
To give my abstractions a lit

my undergraduate education at

days ago that I realized firmly
that my reading must be guided

The material was written by
a student who supported Joe
Reich. The material however
was felt to reflect the plight of

A successful attempt was made
to get workers for the organi

different candidates.
The workers which distributed
material in various men's dor
matories and at the "non-rally"
Tuesday were told that although
they were free to support any
candidate SFE was not to be

to choose officers (or spokes

Without the knowledge of the

organization the author gave
Mr. Reich and Mr. Kane some of
the material to deliver it to a
couple of women who had vol
unteered to distribute it in the
women's residences. It is not
surprising that the candidates
were willing to make the de
livery since they were in agree
ment with the statements ex
pressed.
Nonetheless, SFE regrets that
they made the delivery since it
opens the door to charges that
SFE is working in co-ordination
with Mr. Reich. This is definitely
not the situation. Moreover,
merely because Mr. Reich and
Mr. Kane unwisely delivered
the material the statements it
contains are no less true.
Attempts which Mr. Lyman
and his friends have made to
pass SFE off as a campaign
front for one candidate are
merely attempts to avoid the
valid criticisms which SFE has
offered.
We are glad that Mr. Kano
has apologized for the deliver
ing. It was a unwise act which
probably hurt our cause. The
fact that he repudiated some of
our statements is his own busi
ness. It is important to note
again, however, that our policy

Therefore, whether or not he

• Outside The System
Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Paine's letter to The
Daily on Monday he objected
to the University's granting
housing to The Experiment be
cause it "does not consider al
ternatives within the existing
order". I would like to point out
what I think such a stand im
plies. To decide to work within
the existing order, whether of
a nation, university or smaller
community, is to avoid the ques
tion of whether or not the exist
ing order still solves our prob
lems as they arise. To say that
they must go on within the
present order is to fail to face
the possibility that there may
be something basically wrong
with it.
It is the kind of possibility a
clergyman faces if he dares
question the very existence of
God; that a fraternity man faces
if he considers the possibility
that the basis of his system
(selectivity) has somehow be
come wrong for him today;
that a loyal American faces if
he questions the principle that,
has led to deaths of thousands
of people. It takes guts to doubt
the structures which define us,
but we must realize that the
solutions to our problems are
more important than the preser
vation of a system. I only use
Mr. Paine's statement as a jump
ing off place and I cannot speak
for The Experiment. However,
I think that the important ques

be seriously dealt with by those

troversy over the Experiment.
He interpreted a statement by
Barry Greenberg that the Ex
periment is an "honest, open
search for possible alternative
ways of living, both with our

ing that the Experiment is con
sidering "alternatives outside
the existing social order; i.e.,
the Experiment is only consider
ing the possibilities for radical
social change, for a new order."
I feel this interpretation dis
plays the same intellectual over
simplification of which he ac
cuses Mr. Greenberg, at the be
ginning of his letter. The idea
that there are faults in the pres
ent social system appears often
in Resistance and in the activi
ties of the Experiment, yet I
feel that the clear desire of these
t. o associations to remain cen
naily located on campus is an
involvement within, and a con
cern for, the established society.
The search for "alternative
ways of living" is to include
people other than Experiment
members. All who wish to con
tribute to a reform and improve
ment of society, within or with
out that society, are invited to
do so.
When Mr. Paine asserts later
on that there is "in fact an as
sumption of a political nature
in the Experiment's program,"
I don't disagree with him. But
why, in fact, are a number of
university members so terrified
by a political commitment? I
think the belief that the Ameri
can system of life is definitely
dissatisfying is given its chief
consistency and value only when
it is organized politically. It is
this political and moral consist
ency above all which makes the
Experiment the valuable forum
that it is. A definite and well-con
sidered movement towards
greater openness of thought and
action must be carried out re
gardless of social orders. There
is only an objective which must
be accomplished before it's no
longer possible.
The "New Left, 'is in my mind
neither an attempt to destroy or
create whole societies, but an
effort to do what Babbitt tells
his son to do—to live in a more
personally meaningful way. It
may be that few means to ac
complish this change remain
available, but that is all the
more reason to initiate debate
and commitment. Consequently,
Mr. Paine is correct in saying
that the Experiment is politi
cally and morally commited, but
in accurate when he adds that
the Experiment "does not con
sider alternatives within the ex
isting order."
To give my abstractions a lit
tle more concrete, existential
value, I would like to add that
my undergraduate education at
Stanford so stifled my aware
ness of self that it was only two
days ago that I realized firmly
that my reading must be guided
by its application to my needs
and desires in life. Up until then,
I read what I thought it was
proper and academically correct
for an English major to read.
The Experiment was at least
partly instrumental in bringing

• Kudos To Kaplan
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Tuesday's confron
tation between Mark Lane and
John Kaplan:
In his summation, Lane denies
that Kaplan had proven Rush to
Judgment a tissue of distortion,
partially because Kaplan had at
tacked a mere 4 of its 4500 cita
tions. Undoubtedly, Kaplan
failed to show that all of Lane's
allegations were false, just as no
one was able to demonstrate
that none of Senator McCarthy's
200 Communist agents in the
State Department were, indeed,
Communists. However, by con
centrating on a few examples,
Kaplan did provide some in
sights into Lane's techniques.
Kaplan brought to the atten
tion of the audience a passage
in Rush to Judgment accusing
Warren Commission counsel of
interrupting witness Lee Bow
ers, Jr. in mid-sentence to pre
vent Bowers from relating an
important piece of evidence
(Rush to Judgment, p. 32). Kap
lan then pointed out that later
in his testimony, Commission
counsel three times asked Mr.
Bowers if he had any other in
formation pertaining to the
assassination, receiving answers
of, "Nothing that I can recall.',
"Yes, I believe that I have re
lated everything which I have
told the city police, and also the
FBI.", and "To my knowledge
I can remember nothing else."
(Warren Commission Hearings,
Vol. VII, p. 288-289).
While the record clearly
shows that Bowers had the op
portunity to tell all he knew,
Lane did not retract his accusa
tion, nor did he plead ignorance
of the latter part of Bower's
testimony. Instead he asserted
that the only relevant consider
ation was that Bowers himself,
in a subsequent interview, had
erroneously alleged that Com
mission counsel had not allowed
him the opportunity to give his
information.
There are other equally flag
rant and intentional distrotions
in Lane's book. For example,
the Warren Commission con
tends that shortly after the
assassination Oswald boarded a
bus driven by Cecil J. McWat
ters, citing as evidence a trans
fer allegedly found in Oswald's
pocket on which were marks
giving the date, time and place
of issuance, as well as the driver
who issued it. (Warren Commis
sion Report, p. 157). Lane, in his
book, mentions the transfer, but,
neglects to state that it could
only have been issued at 12:36
p.m. on the day of the assassin
ation on McWatter's bus (Rush
to Judgment, p. 161)— at the
same time and on the same bus
that the Warren Commission in
sists, but Lane denies, Lee Har
vey Oswald boarded after leav
ing the Book Depository build
ing. Lane's denial would be more
convincing had he not com
pletely ignored a very import
ant piece of evidence.
I salute Professor Kaplan for
his courage and skill in publicly
and successfully confronting
Mr. Lane despite a huge disad
vantage in the length of time
spent studying the evidence.

Editor, The Dally:
' I am rather sick of the "in
crowd" affair, but after yester
day's attack on my person in the
letter of Messrs. Mitchell, Loom
is, and Newton, I feel I must
clarify a few errors.
First, I wish to make it clear
that I alone am fully responsible
for my action of tearing down
the "in-crowd" signs in Stern
(to my knowledge, none were
removed in Wilbur; the infer
ence that I was responsible for
such an act is false.) I would
like to apologize to the members
of the community and to the
people of the SFE for my irre
sponsible act.
It was motivated by the very
great anger at the slanderous
inferences from faulty facts
that had marked the whole cam
paign. Furthermore, the docu
ments were all unsigned when I
removed them. However, on re
considering the act for a few
minutes, I went with several
friends to replace at least four
of the sheets in each bathroom
of Stern, where new and still
unsigned sheets had already ap
peared.
Clarification
Beyond that, I only wish to
clarify the events of the entire
evening for Mr. Mitchell, whose
telephone conversation with Mr.
Fitts has been mis-represented.
I had spoken with three gentle
men at Stern at approximately
3:00 a.m. and volunteered my
name and the fact that I dis
liked anonymous literature of a
slanderous form.
At about 4:15 I returned to
the Grove House on a personal
matter, and was speaking with
Mr. Fitts when Mr. Mitchell
phoned. Mr. Mitchell said he rep
resented a group called "Stu
dents for Freedom', and that I
had torn down their literature.
Mr. Fitts said that he couldn't
control the whole campus but
that "no more material would
be torn down" by anyone he
could contact. That some were
torn down in Wilbur, if it is
true, might have been genuine
response to a disgusting accu
sation.
Finally I was glad to see that
the group's earlier claim to be
"critical" of Mr. Lyman was cor
rected to say "attack" in the last
paragraph of the letter. I hope
that we can all return to more
sane behavior.

tation between Mark Lane and
John Kaplan:
In his summation, Lane denies
that Kaplan had proven Rush to
Judgment a tissue of distortion,
partially because Kaplan had at
tacked a mere 4 of its 4500 cita
tions. Undoubtedly, Kaplan
failed to show that all of Lane's
allegations were false, just as no
one was able to demonstrate
that none of Senator McCarthy's
200 Communist agents in the
State Department were, indeed,
Communists. However, by con
centrating on a few examples,
Kaplan did provide some in
sights into Lane's techniques.
Kaplan brought to the atten
tion of the audience a passage
in Rush to Judgment accusing
Warren Commission counsel of
interrupting witness Lee Bow
ers, Jr. in mid-sentence to pre
vent Bowers from relating an
important piece of evidence
(Rush to Judgment, p. 32). Kap
lan then pointed out that later
in his testimony, Commission
counsel three times asked Mr.
Bowers if he had any other in
formation pertaining to the
assassination, receiving answers
of, "Nothing that I can recall.',
"Yes, I believe that I have re
lated everything which I have
told the city police, and also the
FBI.", and "To my knowledge
I can remember nothing else."
(Warren Commission Hearings,
Vol. VII, p. 288-289).
While the record clearly
shows that Bowers had the op
portunity to tell all he knew,
Lane did not retract his accusa
tion, nor did he plead ignorance
of the latter part of Bower's
testimony. Instead he asserted
that the only relevant consider
ation was that Bowers himself,
in a subsequent interview, had
erroneously alleged that Com
mission counsel had not allowed
him the opportunity to give his
information.
There are other equally flag
rant and intentional distrotions
in Lane's book. For example,
the Warren Commission con
tends that shortly after the
assassination Oswald boarded a
bus driven by Cecil J. McWat
ters, citing as evidence a trans
fer allegedly found in Oswald's
pocket on which were marks
giving the date, time and place
of issuance, as well as the driver
who issued it. (Warren Commis
sion Report, p. 157). Lane, in his
book, mentions the transfer, but,
neglects to state that it could
only have been issued at 12:36
p.m. on the day of the assassin
ation on McWatter's bus (Rush
to Judgment, p. 161)— at the
same time and on the same bus
that the Warren Commission in
sists, but Lane denies, Lee Har
vey Oswald boarded after leav
ing the Book Depository build
ing. Lane's denial would be more
convincing had he not com
pletely ignored a very import
ant piece of evidence.
I salute Professor Kaplan for
his courage and skill in publicly
and successfully confronting
Mr. Lane despite a huge disad
vantage in the length of time
spent studying the evidence.

Editor, The Dally:
' I am rather sick of the "in
crowd" affair, but after yester
day's attack on my person in the
letter of Messrs. Mitchell, Loom
is, and Newton, I feel I must
clarify a few errors.
First, I wish to make it clear
that I alone am fully responsible
for my action of tearing down
the "in-crowd" signs in Stern
(to my knowledge, none were
removed in Wilbur; the infer
ence that I was responsible for
such an act is false.) I would
like to apologize to the members
of the community and to the
people of the SFE for my irre
sponsible act.
It was motivated by the very
great anger at the slanderous
inferences from faulty facts
that had marked the whole cam
paign. Furthermore, the docu
ments were all unsigned when I
removed them. However, on re
considering the act for a few
minutes, I went with several
friends to replace at least four
of the sheets in each bathroom
of Stern, where new and still
unsigned sheets had already ap
peared.
Clarification
Beyond that, I only wish to
clarify the events of the entire
evening for Mr. Mitchell, whose
telephone conversation with Mr.
Fitts has been mis-represented.
I had spoken with three gentle
men at Stern at approximately
3:00 a.m. and volunteered my
name and the fact that I dis
liked anonymous literature of a
slanderous form.
At about 4:15 I returned to
the Grove House on a personal
matter, and was speaking with
Mr. Fitts when Mr. Mitchell
phoned. Mr. Mitchell said he rep
resented a group called "Stu
dents for Freedom', and that I
had torn down their literature.
Mr. Fitts said that he couldn't
control the whole campus but
that "no more material would
be torn down" by anyone he
could contact. That some were
torn down in Wilbur, if it is
true, might have been genuine
response to a disgusting accu
sation.
Finally I was glad to see that
the group's earlier claim to be
"critical" of Mr. Lyman was cor
rected to say "attack" in the last
paragraph of the letter. I hope
that we can all return to more
sane behavior.

• Here They Are Again
Editor, The Daily:
Students for Free Elections
was formed last Monday night
with the purpose of distributing
material to expose The Daily's
biased coverage of the current
elections.
The material was written by
a student who supported Joe
Reich. The material however
was felt to reflect the plight of
all of Peter Lyman's opponents.
A successful attempt was made
to get workers for the organi
zation which supported several
different candidates.
The workers which distributed
material in various men's dor
matories and at the "non-rally"
Tuesday were told that although
they were free to support any
candidate SFE was not to be
involved. It was even decided
to choose officers (or spokes
men) who supported different
candidates.
Without the knowledge of the

organization the author gave
Mr. Reich and Mr. Kane some of
the material to deliver it to a
couple of women who had vol
unteered to distribute it in the
women's residences. It is not
surprising that the candidates
were willing to make the de
livery since they were in agree
ment with the statements ex
pressed.
Nonetheless, SFE regrets that
they made the delivery since it
opens the door to charges that
SFE is working in co-ordination
with Mr. Reich. This is definitely
not the situation. Moreover,
merely because Mr. Reich and
Mr. Kane unwisely delivered
the material the statements it
contains are no less true.
Attempts which Mr. Lyman
and his friends have made to
pass SFE off as a campaign
front for one candidate are
merely attempts to avoid the
valid criticisms which SFE has
offered.
We are glad that Mr. Kano
has apologized for the deliver
ing. It was a unwise act which
probably hurt our cause. The
fact that he repudiated some of
our statements is his own busi
ness. It is important to note
again, however, that our policy
is to refuse the endorsement of
any candidate as well as to re
fuse to endorse any candidate.
Therefore, whether or not he
agrees or disagrees with us is
not a major concern of ours.

• Outside The System
Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Paine's letter to The
Daily on Monday he objected
to the University's granting
housing to The Experiment be
cause it "does not consider al
ternatives within the existing
order". I would like to point out
what I think such a stand im
plies. To decide to work within
the existing order, whether of
a nation, university or smaller
community, is to avoid the ques
tion of whether or not the exist
ing order still solves our prob
lems as they arise. To say that
they must go on within the
present order is to fail to face
the possibility that there may
be something basically wrong
with it.
It is the kind of possibility a
clergyman faces if he dares
question the very existence of
God; that a fraternity man faces
if he considers the possibility
that the basis of his system
(selectivity) has somehow be
come wrong for him today;
that a loyal American faces if
he questions the principle that,
has led to deaths of thousands
of people. It takes guts to doubt
the structures which define us,
but we must realize that the
solutions to our problems are
more important than the preser
vation of a system. I only use
Mr. Paine's statement as a jump
ing off place and I cannot speak
for The Experiment. However,
I think that the important ques
tions today concerning the na
tion, the university, and our
selves as individuals can only
be seriously dealt with by those
who risk the security of existing
orders by going outside them.

• Awareness
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter in Monday's Daily

Mr. Frank Paine, a junior in
political science, entered the con
troversy over the Experiment.
He interpreted a statement by
Barry Greenberg that the Ex
periment is an "honest, open
search for possible alternative
ways of living, both with our
selves and with others,' as mean
ing that the Experiment is con
sidering "alternatives outside
the existing social order; i.e.,
the Experiment is only consider
ing the possibilities for radical
social change, for a new order."
I feel this interpretation dis
plays the same intellectual over
simplification of which he ac
cuses Mr. Greenberg, at the be
ginning of his letter. The idea
that there are faults in the pres
ent social system appears often
in Resistance and in the activi
ties of the Experiment, yet I
feel that the clear desire of these
t. o associations to remain cen
naily located on campus is an
involvement within, and a con
cern for, the established society.
The search for "alternative
ways of living" is to include
people other than Experiment
members. All who wish to con
tribute to a reform and improve
ment of society, within or with
out that society, are invited to
do so.
When Mr. Paine asserts later
on that there is "in fact an as
sumption of a political nature
in the Experiment's program,"
I don't disagree with him. But
why, in fact, are a number of
university members so terrified
by a political commitment? I
think the belief that the Ameri
can system of life is definitely
dissatisfying is given its chief
consistency and value only when
it is organized politically. It is
this political and moral consist
ency above all which makes the
Experiment the valuable forum
that it is. A definite and well-con
sidered movement towards
greater openness of thought and
action must be carried out re
gardless of social orders. There
is only an objective which must
be accomplished before it's no
longer possible.
The "New Left, 'is in my mind
neither an attempt to destroy or
create whole societies, but an
effort to do what Babbitt tells
his son to do—to live in a more
personally meaningful way. It
may be that few means to ac
complish this change remain
available, but that is all the
more reason to initiate debate
and commitment. Consequently,
Mr. Paine is correct in saying
that the Experiment is politi
cally and morally commited, but
in accurate when he adds that
the Experiment "does not con
sider alternatives within the ex
isting order."
To give my abstractions a lit
tle more concrete, existential
value, I would like to add that
my undergraduate education at
Stanford so stifled my aware
ness of self that it was only two
days ago that I realized firmly
that my reading must be guided
by its application to my needs
and desires in life. Up until then,
I read what I thought it was
proper and academically correct
for an English major to read.
The Experiment was at least
partly instrumental in bringing
about the new awareness.
