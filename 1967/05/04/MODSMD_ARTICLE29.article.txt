## Lane-Kaplan 'Trial' A Waste Of Time, Effort, And Talent 
### Robert E. Stone 
Now that I have set down in
an unbiased news story the
events of Tuesday's Lane-Kap
lan "trial," I would like to take
the opportunity to set down
some of the disappointments of
that meeting.
It is a shame that both par
ticipants were so reluctant to
participate at all. Lane continu

a'ly complained about the re
strictions under which he had
been placed by Kaplan's rules.
Kaplan regretted that he had
to appear. For a while, just be
fore the trial started, the argu
ment over rules was so hot and
heavy, it appeared that the two
men might never get on stage
at all.
The meeting itself was unsat
isfactory, and, in general, its
being so was the fault of the
rules that Kaplan laid down.
Lane was forced time and time
again to rebut Kaplan's allega
tions. He was not allowed to dis
prove them.
To do so Lane would have had
to introduce evidence that was
not contained in his book. Kap
lan warned the audience that
Lane might try to bring up his
"running battle with the Warren
Commission" and objected each
time Lane attempted to do so.
"Tricky Man"
As the trial developed, it be
came evident that Kaplan was
depending upon Lane's corrobo
ration to prove his points. When
Lane refused to co-operate, Kap
lan called him "a very tricky
man."
Kaplan, as well as Lane,
was hampered by the rules. In
trying to prove that Rush To
Judgment was a "tissue of de
liberate distortions," Kaplan con
tinually asked Lane if it would
not have been helpful to his
(Lane's) readers to have includ
ed this or that piece of evidence.
Lane responded that it wou ] d
have been most helpful to his
readers if he had included all 26
volumes of testimony taken be
fore the Warren Commission.
Lane added, "However, that's
already been done."
Given the recent Gallup Poll
showing 66 per cent of the Amer
ican public in disagreement
with the Warren Commission
Report, and given the current
state of affairs in New Orleans,
it is safe to conclude that there
is some question as to whether
or not Lee Harvey Oswald was a
lone, demented assassin. Profes
sor Kaplan readily admits that
he has serious questions about
the Warren Commission Report.
Waste Of Time
It is incredible that these
questions were not the basis of
Tuesday's meeting. That two
eminent men should spend 2VÂ£
hours debating methods of dis
tortion, and in doing so should
ignore the larger more basic
issue, can only be put down as
a colossal waste of time. Nor
is it sufficient to say that the
proof that Lee Harvey Oswald
killed President Kennedy is the
assertion by the Warren Com
mission that he did so.
Professor Kaplan agreed Tues
day night that there might have
been more benefit to the audi
ence if there had been a debate
instead of the trial, but added
that he could not possibly hope
to compete in such a setting. He
added that the only person in
the whole country who was as
familiar with the workings of
the Commission as Lane was
Wesley Liebeler of UCLA and
"Lane won't touch him."
It is unsatisfactory to hear
Kaplan's platitude that "histor

ians will decide the issue." The
people want to know and are
entitled to know. Officialdom
only serves to fan rumors by
hiding information and refus
ing to discuss the issue. What
are they hiding?
Maybe Mark Lane's methods
remind Professor Kaplan of Mc-
Carthyism, but the methods of
those concerned with the infor
mation about the assassination
appear to be closely aligned with
totalitarianism rather than
democracy.
A time machine could pro
vide a satisfactory answer, but
lacking that piece of equipment
public pressure is the only way
to gain satisfaction. And, sat
isfaction is long overdue.
