# It Ain't Gonna Rain No More...

Spring has, in the words of the im
mortal folk philosopher Joe Bananas,
sprung. P(H>i>le have shed the heavy
clothing of the nether months, finally,
and marvel tiiat the sky is just as blue
as they remembered from last year.
It's May, it's May, the lusty month
of May, as the song has it. Pretty
girls are selling cotton candy on
White Plaza. The race is on for stu
dent offices, beaches, baseball games
and other such youtliful pasttimes.
"Yes, indeed,' said Warren G. Won
ka, contacted by ship-to-shore tele
prone as he continued his search off
Martha's Vineyard for the lost city
of Atlantis. "It certainly has."
