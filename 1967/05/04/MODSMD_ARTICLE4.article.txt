# Pavilion, Space Center Construction Begins
## 
### 
Construction has already begun on
two new campus buildings â€” the
Roscoe Maples Basketball Pavilion
and the Space Engineering Building.
Both structures are slated for com
pletion in late 1968.
Maples Pavilion, which will seat
8,000 was designed by John Carl War
necke and Associates, the same firm
(hat designed the Henry J. Meyer Li
brary.
The $2,677,000 pavilion will be avail
able for concerts and lectures as well
as athletic events, although the acous

tics of the hall are as yet undeterm
ined. Three cross-wise basketball
courts will be available for intra
mural basketball. The present pavil
ion will be used for wrestling, boxing,
gymnastics, and, of course, registra
tion.
A PACE project, Maples Pavilion
was funded with private gifts to the
University. Donations do not yet
cover the total cost. The Physical Edu
cation Department is presently mak
ing up the difference.
The Space Engineering Building, a

five-level, 116,000 square-foot building
next to the McCullough Building on
Lomita Drive, is being built with
grants from NASA and the Air Force,
totalling about $3,000,000, and private
donations. Although NASA and the
Air Force can support graduate re
search, all undergraduate classrooms
must be financed in other ways.
The building will be headquarters
for the Aeronautics and Astronautics
Department. It will house people from
a number of other departments, who
are working on inter-disciplinary pro
jects related to space engineering,
such as the current Air Force Guid
ance and Control project.
The first level of the building,
largely underground, includes an
auditorium, with facilities for com
puterized demonstrations, and a num
ber of specialized laboratories.
These include a "hotshot tunnel"

for aerodynamic studies, "creep labs"
for studying materials under stress,
a "zero gee lab" that can be used
for the simulation of gravity in outer
space, a radiation gas dynamics lab
oratory, and "clean" facilities for
assembling components that will be
shot into space.
The upper stories contain offices for
faculty and graduate students, in
structional laboratories, and confer
ence rooms. The fourth floor has two
enclosed terraces. One will be land
scaped and the other will provide an
antenna deck for the equipment of
the radio sciences researchers.
Spencer, Lee and Buss, designer of
Tresidder Union, is the architectural
firm for the building, which will have
a red tile roof and a view from the
conference rooms straight down what
was once Escondido Road to the
Meyer Library.
