Illegal popcorn was found in White Plaza yesterday after University Health
Officer Hal Wilson inspected the many food concessions for Con Home week.
Food-selling activities will probably continue, conforming: to Wilson's and the
the state's criteria for cleanliness. Con Home activities run through Friday
on Wliite Plaza.
