### SANDY SHAPIRO 
The frozen bananas were in danger
yesterday. The pop corn and sno-coties
were seriously threatened.
Food concession booths for the
Stanford Convalescent Children's
Home (Con Home) Benefit Fair were,

in fact, operating precariously. Uni

informed several of the volunteer
hashers that they were violating the
California State Restaurant Act by
selling food on White Plaza.
According to Wilson the cotton

candy, ice cream cone, pickles, snow
cone, and chocolate-covered frozen
banana booths did not conform to the
health standards of the Itinerant Res
taurant Act.
Following conferences with Carol
Cierny, chairman of on-campus con
cessions, and Barbara Dray, Assistant
to the Dean of Students, the booth
operators were advised to make cer
tain improvements in their proced
ures. Food is to be protected from the
elements and prospective customers,
and wet towels or similar cleaning
aids should be available for wiping
the counter tops.
Girls were asked to handle food
with plastic gloves and use only stain
less steel utensils for scooping snow
cones. Mrs. Dray added that next
year efforts would be made to see
that the booths conformed more
strictly to regulations.
