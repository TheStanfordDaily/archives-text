# Molnar Hits Philosophy's 'Flight From Reality'
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Three hundred years ago, philo
phers in search of reality, according to
Prof. Thomas Molnar, began a flight
from reality. As a result of philo
phy's abandoning reality, we live in
an idcalogical age.
As part of his speech sponsored
by the Western Political Society, Mol
nar went on to list the philosophers
who have led to this situation. The
subject of his speech concerns his
most recent book Utopia, the Peren
nial Heresy.
The first step was presented by
Kant, from whose effect philosophy
is "still suffering." He insisted that
man will "never know the exact na
ture of reality."

Hegel followed in an attempt to re
habilitate Kant. He insisted, "Every
thing that is rational is real."
Three different schools of thought
presented philosophies before Heid
deger postulated, "Philosophy can
not even name the mythicalness of
being."
The first of the schools of thought
was the logical positivists. The basis
of their contention was, "What can
not be verified scientifically is not a
part of philosophy or reality."
The anthropologists who followed
added to the current of Kant's
thoughts. Men such as the French
structural anthropologist Levi-Strauss

insisted that philosophy can speak
only terms of each single civilization.
"They sought to reduce all civiliza
tion to a common denominator where
they all presented themselves for a
structural analysis."
The third school of thought, the
phenomenologists saw a "cleavage
between the object world and the
world as we see it." Hussel resolved
this conflict be suspending "judgment
of reality to reflect on reality as he
saw it in himself."
Sartre felt "individual consciousness
is all that exists." For this reason man
was in a "hopeless passion because
he couldn't be the image he has in
his mind."
A contrary opinion, and a very

dangerous one to hold in the eigh
teenth century, was Claudel's idea,
"For me, the world outside exists."
A somewhat different idea was
the Greek's moral philosophy which
said, "We live in a philosophically
impoverished world. The desire to
change the world takes the place of
philosophy."
This to Molnar was a paraphrase
of what Marx was to say.
Saint-Simon presented the view that
because of contemporary technology,
"the world will have to become one."
The full circle is finally reached
when religion comes to accept Utopia.
Molnar referred to this as the idea
that "evolution has prepared us to
be super mankind."

impoverished world. The desire to
change the world takes the place of
philosophy."
This to Molnar was a paraphrase
of what Marx was to say.
Saint-Simon presented the view that
because of contemporary technology,
"the world will have to become one."
The full circle is finally reached
when religion comes to accept Utopia.
Molnar referred to this as the idea
that "evolution has prepared us to
be super mankind."
Three hundred years ago, philo
phers in search of reality, according to
Prof. Thomas Molnar, began a flight
from reality. As a result of philo
phy's abandoning reality, we live in
an idcalogical age.
As part of his speech sponsored
by the Western Political Society, Mol
nar went on to list the philosophers
who have led to this situation. The
subject of his speech concerns his
most recent book Utopia, the Peren
nial Heresy.
The first step was presented by
Kant, from whose effect philosophy
is "still suffering." He insisted that
man will "never know the exact na
ture of reality."

Hegel followed in an attempt to re
habilitate Kant. He insisted, "Every
thing that is rational is real."
Three different schools of thought
presented philosophies before Heid
deger postulated, "Philosophy can
not even name the mythicalness of
being."
The first of the schools of thought
was the logical positivists. The basis
of their contention was, "What can
not be verified scientifically is not a
part of philosophy or reality."
The anthropologists who followed
added to the current of Kant's
thoughts. Men such as the French
structural anthropologist Levi-Strauss

insisted that philosophy can speak
only terms of each single civilization.
"They sought to reduce all civiliza
tion to a common denominator where
they all presented themselves for a
structural analysis."
The third school of thought, the
phenomenologists saw a "cleavage
between the object world and the
world as we see it." Hussel resolved
this conflict be suspending "judgment
of reality to reflect on reality as he
saw it in himself."
Sartre felt "individual consciousness
is all that exists." For this reason man
was in a "hopeless passion because
he couldn't be the image he has in
his mind."
A contrary opinion, and a very

dangerous one to hold in the eigh
teenth century, was Claudel's idea,
"For me, the world outside exists."
A somewhat different idea was
the Greek's moral philosophy which
said, "We live in a philosophically
impoverished world. The desire to
change the world takes the place of
philosophy."
This to Molnar was a paraphrase
of what Marx was to say.
Saint-Simon presented the view that
because of contemporary technology,
"the world will have to become one."
The full circle is finally reached
when religion comes to accept Utopia.
Molnar referred to this as the idea
that "evolution has prepared us to
be super mankind."
