# Lyman Sweeps Primary
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Peter Lyman yesterday was elected
ASSU President, polling 50.1% of the
3593 votes cast. Lyman is the first
candidate to win a majority in the
primary election since 1956. He is the
first graduate student ASSU Presi
dent since Armin Rosencrantz was
elected in 1962.
Lyman and Cesare Massarenti, his
running mate received 1800 votes,
three more than a majority. The offi
cial count was announced late last
night by Elections Commissioner Bill
Berry after a recount at the request
of Lyman and Pete Hansen, who ran
second. The first vote count also gave
Lyman a three vote majority.
After the second counting of the
ballots, a controversy developed over
blank ballots cast for ASSU president.
If the 59 blanks were included in the

total votes cast, Lyman would not
have a majority, but with them dis
carded, Lyman held his three vote
majority.
Collins Makes Ruling
At midnight last night President
Michael Collins ruled that those bal
lots which are blank shall not be
counted as votes officially cast in the
election. Ballots on which an absten
tion was specifically indicated were
counted as votes cast. Lyman was
therefore certified as the winner at
midnight.
Elections Commissioner Bill Berry
and ASSU vice president Bill Stone
concurred with this ruling by Collins.
Runnerups Hansen, Schaefer, and
Shanahan said they would not con
test the results. Reich was not avail
able for comment. Collins stated that
should anyone wish to appeal this

ruling, the appeal should be directed
to the ASSIJ Legislature, charged
with the interpretation of the Consti
tution.
During the recount, overseas votes
were received from Stanford in Aus
tria on a field trip in Athens. Votes
were previously received from over
seas groups in France, Italy, and Ger
many. Stanford-in-Britain did not hold
a primary.
Community Government
Lyman is a graduate student in po
litical science and a tutor of the
Grove Project. He ran on a platform
of broad educational reform and call
ed for a community government to
involve the entire university.
Lyman last night said: "I hope the
election means that students will take
the initiative in dealing directly with
the faculty and administration about
their needs." He "hopes the election
marks the point when students take
the initiative, start creating the kind
of university they want to live in."
He plans to take a week off and
then organize a series of seminars
for interested faculty and students.
"We must train students to think for
themselves," he says. He emphasized
"the election of one person doesn't
mean anything, it's the election of a
set of ideas."
Cesare Massarenti is in his second
year at Stanford, a Ph.D. candidate
in sociology. He was for four years
head of the union of students at the
University of Milan, Italy.
Massarenti commented on the elec
tion which saw many personal attacks
made against him: "This is my tenth
student campaign and it is certainly
the dirtiest that I have been through.
I hope no one in the University will
be hurt by what has been said. I do
not intend to do anything about what
has been said. This would only hurt
the whole University."
Hansen Second
Pete Hansen, a graduate business
student, and Forrest Church, a fresh

man, ran second, receiving 751 votes.
Hansen said last night: "I think Peter
and Cesare realize they were backed
with a lot of moderate support and
will try to cooperate as much as pos
sible with the powers that be to ac
complish something constructive next
year."
He continued: "I think the admini
stration and the Board of Trustees
should take note of the fact that the
vast majority of the students who
have worked with them in the past
have found it a frustrating experience
and that part of the responsibility
for this is the administration's and
Board's."
Fritz Schaefer, chemistry graduate
student and Daily columnist ran third.
He campaigned "to stamp out the
Berkeley image" at Stanford. He also
sought to stem the "usurpation of the
rights of students by the student
establishmentâ€”the New Left."
Last night Schaefer told the Daily:
"We had hoped that our candidacy
would arouse a substantial number of
students who had previously been un
interested in student government. Un
fortunately it remains that the single
overwhelming fact of the government
at Stanford is that the students really
don't care."
Tom Shanahan, a junior in Kappa
Sigma, ran fourth with 9.9 per cent
of the total vote. In a statement late
last night, he said. "It's time to 'bind
up the campus's wounds' and to be
sure what happened to David Harris
in paranoid reactions doesn't happen
to Peter Lyman. I trust that Peter
will be very liberal and open in his
appointments. I wish him a good year
and I will help him in any way I cin."
