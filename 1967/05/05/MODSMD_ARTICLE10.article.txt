# Poli Sci Plan Honors Seminar
## 
### 
Beginning in September 1967,
the Political Science Department
will offer an Honors Seminar.
For the past several months
the Department, through its Un
dergraduate Program Commit
tee, has been considering a revi
sion of its honors program. This
week the Department announced
that it has approved the propo
sals of the Committee, whose
members included three under
graduates jointly selected by
ASSU and the Committee's facul
ty members.
According to the Department,
the aim of the new program is to
"offer students of high caliber an
encounter in depth with the cen
tral intellectual problems of the
discipline and with the process of
political analysis."
16 Juniors
The seminar will be staffed by
several faculty members and will
involve 16 selected juniors. It

will be organized around a sin
gle, broad theme that is of com
mon concern to several of the dis
cipline's sub-fields.
The theme for the 1967-1968
seminar is "The Bases of Politi
cal Conflict and the Means of
Conflict Resolution," although
the details are yet to be worked
out.
Faculty participants will in

mond, Executive Head of the De
partment (comparative politics);
David Abernethy (comparative
politics, Africa); Robert Home

al law); Michael Oksenberg
(comparative politics, China);
and Joseph Paff (political theo
ry), who will join the staff in
September.
The faculty participants were
drawn from various sub-fields in
the Political Science Department.
It is expected that topics and fac

ulty participants will change
each year.
The seminar will meet during
Autumn and Winter Quarters
for 5 units of credit each quarter.
If sufficient interest is expressed
and extension into the Spring
Quarter is administratively feasi

last for two quarters, 60 if it lasts
for three.
Candidates may apply for ad

Following the junior year, each
student will write an honors

pervision of any Department
member.
At present a student may
graduate with honors having

For the proposed honors pro

The honors program currently

discontinued.
Beginning in September 1967,
