# Law School Given Grant To Review Criminal Law
## 
### 
The Law School has been
granted $210,000 to study ques
tions of criminal law and pub
lic safety, the Ford Foundation
disclosed Wednesday.
Stanford professors John Kap
lan and Herbert Packer will
work in concert with professors
Caleb Foote and Sanford Kad
dish of Berkeley in pursuing the
study.
The studies may include:
• examination of criminal
cases in Northern California to
determine to what extent con
fessions have been essential for
convictions and law enforce
ment.
• Opinion sampling of public
attitudes toward punishment
and treatment of criminals.
• Analysis of after-careers
and psychic and social effects
on persons imprisoned for deter
rent reasons, for example, in
come-tax evaders.
• Examination of police mis
conduct complaints in San Fran
cisco.
• Research on the effective
ness of current narcotics-control
methods.

The program reflects a new
direction in legal research, for
merly dependent on searches
through law books for prece
dents previously laid down by
judicial and legislative author
ities.
Judges and lawyers, however,
are finding increasing use for
empirical research techniques
in resolving social issues in the
law. For the new research,
lawyers are interviewing groups
of citizens, hiring opinion-poll
ing firms, and sifting through
statistical data.
In some instances the result
may be to strengthen a defen
dant's case, in others to shed
new light on the effectiveness
and impartiality of law enforce
ment and criminal justice ad
ministration. By means of such
socio-logical research, questions
that may lead to new develop
ments in public policy are be
ing raised.
Similar Berkeley studies, for
example, will seek to assess how
effective current sentencing pro
cedures are in the general pre
vention of crime.
