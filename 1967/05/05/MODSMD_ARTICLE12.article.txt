## Mafia, Ram's Head Come On Strong 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The amateur shows on campus
are usually every bit as good as
the pros. The Ram's Head one
acts are a case in point. Opening
Wednesday night at the Nitery,
they were good because they
were entertaining.
Ram's Head vies with Midnite
Mafia at the moment. Mafia came
up with an outstanding version
of British playwright Harold Pin
ter's Dumb Waiter Saturday eve
ning. In this show the campus
amateurs proved yet again that
good and entertaining drama can
be mounted in a tasteless theater
on a hopeless stage.
While you can criticize Ram's
Head for such a sterile choice of
plays in Wednesday night's
show, you could not fault what,
for want of a better word, I call
their 'verve.' For some reason A
Cold Day In Hell, well-acted driv
el, was mounted first. This pseu
do-Absurdist three-act by Otis
Bigelow was followed by an ex
cellent rendering of James Thur
ber's Thurber Carnival.
If Ram's Head chose badly,
Midnight Mafia continues to
choose eminently actable shows.
The Mafia program for tomor
row evening at the Nitery ("Mid
nite": D.S.T. 11:30 p.m.) has been
changed. As usual, however, both
the choice and the potential are
viable.
Sheldon "I'll show the c r i t s"

Feldner is performing Anton
Chekhov's The Harmfulness Of
Smoking Tobacco. Then, after
the customary "free" victuals,
Mrs. Lucille Medalis and Feldner
do Brecht's The Jewish Wife. In
cidentally, tickets to the Mafia
extravaganza go on sale at Tres
idder next Monday.
Back to Ram's Head, who re
deemed Bigelow's A.M., P.M., and
The Morning After with a su
perb middle section. Kathleen
Marriott was both nebulous and
incisive as the fashionable lady
who was high up in the queue
when God was handing out thirst.
In The Morning After, which
put the lid on his coffin, Bigelow
attempts a quasi-Godotesque sit
uation. Four characters again, if
you discount the Boy in Beckett's
show. Messrs Young, Martin,
Denny and Berthold did their
best for the situation. Shall I say
that it lacked spatio-temporal
meaningfulness?
Thurber's Carnival showed
Ram's Head at their strongest:
nice dance routines, good use of
limited space and useful mime. I
especially liked Gretchen Grant
in a Red Riding Hood parody. She
shoots the wolf with an auto
matic from her purse. "Modern
youth", mutters the dying villain.
The one-act play at the Nitery
tonight and tomorrow 8:30 p.m.
Cheap at a price, tickets are for
sale at the door.
