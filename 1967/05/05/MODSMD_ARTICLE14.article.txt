# Ailing 'Dear Liar' Star Replaced By Director
## 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
What happens when the lead
ing actor in a play is taken to
the hospital just half an hour
before show time and the under
study is busy acting in another
play? A difficult situation per
haps. But the show must go on.
And it did.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was
filled to capacity last Sunday
night. The American Conserva
tory Theatre was coming to per
form Dear Liar. The stage was
sparsely decorated; one half
with a writing table at which
George Bernard Shaw stood, the
other half with a cozy chair in
which sat Mrs. Patrick Camp
bell, his favorite actress.
Then an announcement was
made. Michael O'Sullivan, the
male lead, was indisposed, but
William Ball, general director of
the company, was coming from
San Francisco to substitute.
Shortly before nine o'clock, Mr.
Ball was seen leaping up the
front stairs of the auditorium.
Dress Rehearsal
Inside, on stage, he introduced
himself, caught his breath and
tried out his voice. He assured
the audience that he had seen a
dress rehearsal of the play and
had even read it, years ago.
Now he began slowly and de
liberately to got acquainted with
his lines. Whatever hesitations
or slips there were in the read

ing, underlined the spontaneity
of the letters and provided an
interesting foil for the self-con
fident, professional manner in
which Barbara Colby delivered
Mrs. Patrick Campbell's share
of the correspondence.
Fortunately Miss Colby knew
not only her lines but his as well.
At one point, a meek G.B.S.
turned unexpectedly to his sta
tuesque muse, unable to pro
nounce a key word. "Belove
dovedest", she replied easily.
Dear Liar, written by Jerome
Kitty, is not really a play in the
traditional sense of the word.
Rather, it provides a show piece
for this epistolary romance. All
of G. B.'s wit is there, and Mrs.
Campbell's, too.
Eternal Separation
In one letter, Shaw complains
about their eternal separation,
for throughout the "romance"
he never left his wife and dur
ing it the widowed Mrs. Camp
bell remarried. "Solitude is
great" he writes, "but not
alone."
After the war breaks out, he
appeals to the women of the
world to stop making babies as
long as there is fighting. And
at the end of their correspon
dence Mrs. Campbell, having
saved all of Shaw's letters in a
hatbox which she kept under
her bed, writes affectionately:
"Finally, Joey, you are under
my bed."'
