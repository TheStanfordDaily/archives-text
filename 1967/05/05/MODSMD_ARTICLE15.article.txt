# Italian Films Capture Postwar Era
## 
### DAVID PROCHASKA 
Tresidder is showing a series
of postwar Italian lllms Friday
nights this quarter. It does not
attempt to be representative of
postwar Italian cinema (no eight
films could be) but, rather, a
sampling of four directors'
work.
The four remaining films are
Lunchino Visconti's Rocco and
His Brothers and three by Vit
torio de Sica, Bicycle Thief, Uni
bcrto I), and Two Women.
Postwar Italian film is often
considered synonymous with
neo-realism. Although neo-real
ism lasted only through the
early 1950'5, it is undoubtedly
the foundation of subsequent
Italian cinema. To understand
neo-realism we must consider
why it occurred when it did and
what it stood for.
From the beginning, Italian
film has been famous for its
historical spectacles in which
the thousands of feet of film
are surpassed by the thousands
of extras. Steve Reeves is only
the latest in a long tradition.
"White Telephone"
During the 1920's and '30's
the Italians added another genre,
the highly decadent, high-society
"white telephone" films. Neo

realism's attempt to capture im
mediate social reality is a reac
tion to previous Italian cinema.
The "immediate social real
ity" of 1945 was fascism and
World War II Period spectacles
tell us little about Mussolini;
white telephones are hardly vi
able symbols for German occu
pation. A new form had to be
invented; neo-realism is a re
sponse to fascism and war.
Roberto Rossellini, more than
anyone else, invented, or rather
stumbled onto, the new form.
His Oi»cn City is set in Rome
during the German occupation.
Rossellini reversed nearly all
the cinematic rules of produc
tion and technique.
"Virtues"
The greatness of Open City
lies in the fact that Rossellini
capitalized on his weaknesses
and made them virtues. He shot
on location rather than in a
studio. His equipment continual
ly broke down. He used non-pro
fessional actors. He used what
ever scraps of film he could
find, whatever the make or con
dition. He constantly stopped
filming for lack of money.
Yet subject matter and tech
nique combine to produce a
heightened sense of reality, the

"illusion of the present tense
in James Agee's phrase.
OjM-n City was the impetus
lor a whole generation of film
makers. Federico Fellini collo
borated on the screenplay of
Rossellini's next film,
as well as Open City. De Sica
directed and Cesare Zavattini
wrote Shoesliine, liieyele Thief,
and Uniberto I). Visconti made
La Terra Treina and his war
time harbinger of neo-realism,
Ossessione, was re released after
the war.
End To Gadgetry
Zavattini canonized the in
sights into theory. Do away with
the professional actor people
playing themselves are the most
natural. Do away with the tech
nical gadgetry which separates
the filmmaker from reality. Do
away with the story — "every
day living can never be boring."
Neo-realism never went as far
in practice as Zavattini had gone
in theory. Non-professional ac
tors were used primarily but
not solely. The story was cer
tainly less important but not
discarded. It remained for cine
nia verite ("truth cinema") to
banish the written screenplay
by simply eliminating editing.
For the neo-realist, the most
compelling subjects are social
ones; social realism succeeds
the theatrical film. The course
of Italian neo-realism reflects
the changing social reality.
Depression and Old Age
In the immediate years after
the war, dramas derived from
war incidents predominated. As
war receded further into the

past, more contemporary social
themes were cinematized
economic depression in Bicycle
Tliit'f and old age in Umberto I).
In the early 1950's neo-realism
faltered and began to decline
as the social realities shifted.
The postwar economic boom en
gendered an optimism previous
ly absent. Commercialism re
turned and brought with it the
cinema of sex, featuring inter
alia lactiferous tissue of Gina
and Sofia.
More important to the decline
of neo-realism is that it demands
a great amount of skill and
creative vision to lift it above
reportage and sensationalism.
And this it failed to do in its
later stages. The de Sica who
made Two Women is not the de
Sica who made Umberto D and
Bicycle Thief.
Neo-realism cleared away the
useless stylistic clutter of earl
ier Italian cinema but also pro
duced art. The best of these
films don't capture the present
tense, they transform it into art.
