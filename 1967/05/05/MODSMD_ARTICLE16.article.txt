### 
The Con Home Week festival
will conclude with an open-air
concert in Frost Amphitheatre
Sunday at 2 p.m. The highlight
of Con Homo activities, the con
cert will feature Negro come
dian Dick Gregory. Also billed
is folk-rock group The Jefferson
•plane.
•gory, now twenty-eight,
u is born in St. Louis and grew
up on relief. He was a crack high
school miler, later set records
at Southern Illinois University.
In Army talent contests he
emerged as a competent comic.
When working as a clerk in the
Chicago post office, he couldn't
stop telling jokes about the mail
service, was finally fired and
moved on to the night circuit.
So few clubs wanted Negro
comedians that he began at $10
a night. By now he is well

known and well-paid.
Of The Airplane, Philip El
wood commented in the January
13 San Francisco Examiner:
"The Airplane, like the early
jazz and blue groups 50 years
is not wholly effective for
a sit-down audience. The dance
beat is dominant and the band's
spirit and arrangements assume
an athletic audience.
"But when they wrap up a
raucous set with footstomping
lines like ' . . . find some-bo-dy to
love,' in six hard beats with
three voices, guitars, bass, tam
bourine and all manner of audio
hell breaking loose, it doesn't
matter what the style is called."
Reserved-section tickets for
the show arc on sale today on
the Plaza and Sunday at the
gate. Prices are $3.25 and $2.50
for chairs and $1.75 for grass.
