# Cal Challenges Cards' Baseball Lead
## Long John Curve Ball 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford baseball fortunes
took a nice upturn last weekend
as the team swept a doublehead
er from UCLA. However, the
race for the league champion
ship is anything but over.
There are four teams still
in the thick of it: USC, UCLA,
and Oregon, and even something
as neutral as a rain out could
knock a team out of the title.
In this tight chase for the
Pac-8 pennant, Oregon may be
dumped on by the weather man.
They have been rained out five
times in league play so far.
Out of 17 possible games, a
team must play nine in order
to qualify for the title. The lea
gue championship will be de
cided on won-lost percentage,
with ties ignored.
Long-ball Bear?
The Indians take on a hard
luck Cal squad in a single game
Saturday at 3:00 p.m. The game
will be in Sunken Diamond.
Bear pitcher Dave Aldrich
threw a two hitter at UCLA
last Friday and lost, 1-0, on a

wild pitch. He will throw against
Stan ford.
Cal has won most of their
games on hitting, however.
Shortstop Dennis Dalton is the
number four hitter in the lea
gue at batting .387. Jim Magnu
son and Sandy Ingersoll are a
couple of long ball hitters bat
ting over .300 for the Bears.
Stanford's only hitter amongst
the top 21 in league is Mike
Schomaker at .360.
Vanee: Questionable
Bob Boone with two home
runs last week has been coming
around and should be breaking
over the .300 mark in league
soon. Centerfielder JefT Robbing
has also been doing well, especi
ally in the RBI department.
On the mound, Sandy Vance's
arm is still a question mark. It
will be a last minute decision as
to whether or not he pitches
Saturday. If he can't go, then
either Daro Quiring or Rod Po
teete will get the nod.
Although the Indians have
been hitting poorly, they are
number two in fielding percent
age in league behind UCLA.

UCLA scraped the bottom of the bullpen search
ing for a pitcher to get a second out against
Stanford's rampaging Indians last weekend. Even
a one-legged motion could not stop an 8 run, first
inning attack that butchered three Bruin pitchers.
Stanford tied USC, 3-3 ,and knocked the Bruins
twice, 8-3 and 9-2, to take over the AAWU top
spot..

will be in Sunken Diamond.
Bear pitcher Dave Aldrich
threw a two hitter at UCLA
last Friday and lost, 1-0, on a

wild pitch. He will throw against
Stan ford.
Cal has won most of their
games on hitting, however.
Shortstop Dennis Dalton is the
number four hitter in the lea
gue at batting .387. Jim Magnu
son and Sandy Ingersoll are a
couple of long ball hitters bat
ting over .300 for the Bears.
Stanford's only hitter amongst
the top 21 in league is Mike
Schomaker at .360.
Vanee: Questionable
Bob Boone with two home
runs last week has been coming
around and should be breaking
over the .300 mark in league
soon. Centerfielder JefT Robbing
has also been doing well, especi
ally in the RBI department.
On the mound, Sandy Vance's
arm is still a question mark. It
will be a last minute decision as
to whether or not he pitches
Saturday. If he can't go, then
either Daro Quiring or Rod Po
teete will get the nod.
Although the Indians have
been hitting poorly, they are
number two in fielding percent
age in league behind UCLA.

UCLA scraped the bottom of the bullpen search
ing for a pitcher to get a second out against
Stanford's rampaging Indians last weekend. Even
a one-legged motion could not stop an 8 run, first
inning attack that butchered three Bruin pitchers.
Stanford tied USC, 3-3 ,and knocked the Bruins
twice, 8-3 and 9-2, to take over the AAWU top
spot..
Stanford baseball fortunes
took a nice upturn last weekend
as the team swept a doublehead
er from UCLA. However, the
race for the league champion
ship is anything but over.
There are four teams still
in the thick of it: USC, UCLA,
and Oregon, and even something
as neutral as a rain out could
knock a team out of the title.
In this tight chase for the
Pac-8 pennant, Oregon may be
dumped on by the weather man.
They have been rained out five
times in league play so far.
Out of 17 possible games, a
team must play nine in order
to qualify for the title. The lea
gue championship will be de
cided on won-lost percentage,
with ties ignored.
Long-ball Bear?
The Indians take on a hard
luck Cal squad in a single game
Saturday at 3:00 p.m. The game
will be in Sunken Diamond.
