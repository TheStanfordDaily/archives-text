# Fogelman, Tom In Prexy Finals; Honor Code Kept
## 
### 
Mark Fogelman and Soleng Tom,
Jr., have reached the runoff in the
race for Senior Class president. Their
running mates, Jere Horowitz and
Robin Wiseman, will runoff for Senior
Class vice president.
In the election of NSA Representa
tive at large, Gail Kitaji was elected
with 808 votes. Bob Brooks and Gregg
Murphy will runoff for the second
spot. Murphy edged out Paul Floto
by only six votes.
The Honor Code referendum show
ed students favored retention of the
Honor Code by a 90% majority. How
ever, only 8% favored a strict third
person responsibility. Of the others
409r indicated they favored an Honor
Code with no legal third person re
sponsibility. The remainder voted to
observe an Honor Code in which "of
fenders should be reported only if ef
forts by direct confrontation and so
cial pressure should fail to stop the
offender."
In the senior class elections, Fogel
man and Wiseman led the candidates
for president and vice president.
They had earlier filed as running
mates, but Elections Commissioner
Bill Berry ruled that all candidates
would run separately. Tom and Hor
witz had originally filed as running
mates also. Mel "Ace" Knox, one of
the two Senior Class prexy candidates
who filed without a running mate re
ceived 104 votes and ran fourth.
The Honor Code referendum was
only a straw vote and is binding on
no one. LASSU placed the referendum
on the ballot.
All runoffs will be held next week
in the final election on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
