# The 						Lyman Victory
## 
### 
Peter Lyman's impressive sweep of the ASSU
primary provides but another indication of
the manifest discontent of large segments of
the student community with Stanford's edu
cational program. Lyman's perception of the
educational shortcomings of this institution,
and his ideas and programs for improvement
have touched a responsive chord among the
students. Like Dave Harris before him, Ly
man has repeatedly pointed up the failure of
Stanford to meet the true needs of the stu
dents. And Lyman's victory, no less than Har
ris', indicates that their feelings are shared
by others as well. We hope it also indicates that
these people are willing to work with Lyman
both to implement and to augment his program
of reform. It will indeed be tragic if they
are again content merely to register their pro
test at the polls, without being ready to carry
through the substantial endeavors necessary
to bring change to the Farm.
Lyman's election could not have come at
a better time. Next year promises unprecedent
ed opportunities for reform, particularly with
the Study of Education in full swing. Prof.
Packer has made repeated pleas for student in
volvement with the Study, but has done very
little to insure broad-based participation by
the members of the community. The Study is
so important to Stanford that the student input
now so lacking must be provided if it is to
be successful in its goal.
We hope Lyman will receive Packer's co
operation in implementing some of the pro
grams he has been advocating throughout the
campaign, namely student referenda, open hear
ings, and town meetings on issues of major
concern.

Lyman has called attention to the primary
goals of a university. He has sketched a philo
sophy of education, something which neither
the university leaders nor the Study of Educa
tion has yet been willing to do.
Equally encouraging are his ideas on resi
dential education. Barring a catastrophic May
18 rejection of the Wilbur Experiment by the
Trustees, there will be integrated coeducational
housing with an academic theme in parts of
Wilbur next year. But this must be only a be
ginning. The student community and its elect
ed representative must continue to carry the
burden of suggesting and pushing through still
more programs for diversity and experimenta
tion in the residential structure of our residence
university.
But perhaps his most exciting proposals con
cern the establishment of some form of com
munity government. We can only agree with
his rejection of the present structure of the
ASSU as irrelevant and unresponsive to stu
dent needs, and our discontent with the greater
decision-making processes in the University has
already been voiced.
The difficulties in bringing about revolution
ary changes in a power structure far from con
vinced of the efficacy of change are staggering.
But the potential benefits to those most directly
involved in the central business of this Univer
sity — the students and the faculty — are
such that the endeavor deserves our finest ef
forts. We can envision no worthier consequence
of the Lyman election than that it should bring
about the end of student government, the end
of the ASSU sandbox, and the end of separa
tion, fragmentation, and alienation of student,
faculty, and administrative interests.

Equally encouraging are his ideas on resi
dential education. Barring a catastrophic May
18 rejection of the Wilbur Experiment by the
Trustees, there will be integrated coeducational
housing with an academic theme in parts of
Wilbur next year. But this must be only a be
ginning. The student community and its elect
ed representative must continue to carry the
burden of suggesting and pushing through still
more programs for diversity and experimenta
tion in the residential structure of our residence
university.
But perhaps his most exciting proposals con
cern the establishment of some form of com
munity government. We can only agree with
his rejection of the present structure of the
ASSU as irrelevant and unresponsive to stu
dent needs, and our discontent with the greater
decision-making processes in the University has
already been voiced.
The difficulties in bringing about revolution
ary changes in a power structure far from con
vinced of the efficacy of change are staggering.
But the potential benefits to those most directly
involved in the central business of this Univer
sity — the students and the faculty — are
such that the endeavor deserves our finest ef
forts. We can envision no worthier consequence
of the Lyman election than that it should bring
about the end of student government, the end
of the ASSU sandbox, and the end of separa
tion, fragmentation, and alienation of student,
faculty, and administrative interests.
Peter Lyman's impressive sweep of the ASSU
primary provides but another indication of
the manifest discontent of large segments of
the student community with Stanford's edu
cational program. Lyman's perception of the
educational shortcomings of this institution,
and his ideas and programs for improvement
have touched a responsive chord among the
students. Like Dave Harris before him, Ly
man has repeatedly pointed up the failure of
Stanford to meet the true needs of the stu
dents. And Lyman's victory, no less than Har
ris', indicates that their feelings are shared
by others as well. We hope it also indicates that
these people are willing to work with Lyman
both to implement and to augment his program
of reform. It will indeed be tragic if they
are again content merely to register their pro
test at the polls, without being ready to carry
through the substantial endeavors necessary
to bring change to the Farm.
Lyman's election could not have come at
a better time. Next year promises unprecedent
ed opportunities for reform, particularly with
the Study of Education in full swing. Prof.
Packer has made repeated pleas for student in
volvement with the Study, but has done very
little to insure broad-based participation by
the members of the community. The Study is
so important to Stanford that the student input
now so lacking must be provided if it is to
be successful in its goal.
We hope Lyman will receive Packer's co
operation in implementing some of the pro
grams he has been advocating throughout the
campaign, namely student referenda, open hear
ings, and town meetings on issues of major
concern.

Lyman has called attention to the primary
goals of a university. He has sketched a philo
sophy of education, something which neither
the university leaders nor the Study of Educa
tion has yet been willing to do.
