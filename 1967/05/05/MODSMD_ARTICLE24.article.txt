# Two Minutes of Haight
## New 'In-Crowd' Replaces Old 
### Tim Haight 
Resplendent in his very faded
blue work-shirt, dirty Levis and
rusty SNCC button, the long
haired, bearded activist survey
ed the Tresidder back patio and
said, "Christ, I thought I was
the in-crowd."
"Times change," a portly
Theta Chi filling a wrought-wire
chair across the table said.
"Only a few weeks ago I won a
student body election, and my
hous6 has traditionally held
ASSU offices. I thought I was
in.",
"Why do you think I dropped
out?" a neatly-clad man in
pressed pants, a vest and a
paisley shirt said. "The I Ching
said that was the tao."
Like Yesterday's DAILY
"Wow," said the activist.
"We're like yesterday's Daily.
I never thought that when we
helped set up the Grove House
only last January that it was
going to do this."
"Yesterday," Paisley said, "It
was LSD and turn on or not
turn on. Now it's the Honor
Code and turn in or not turn in.
Yesterday it was Wally we were
accusing, now its Cesare."
"Last year," portley said, "It
was Jay Kadane and LASSU.

Now it's some attempt to make
LASSU to anything. Last year
it was Carl Schmidt."
"Who?"
"That's what I mean. One day
you're on a poster, the next your
working for your father up
state."
Stunning Remark
At this remark, a stunned si
lence settled over the group,
broken only when a clean-cut,
Madras-shirted, white Levied,
boy moved over from another
table.
"I couldn't help overhearing.
You guys think you have prob
lems. Ten years ago, even five,
you were pretty much nothing
unless you looked like me. Now
some of the brothers say the
only way to preserve our species
is to declare the Row a wildlife
preserve.
"Times change, men, and if
what you're concerned about is
to be where it's at, you have to
figure out where the crowd is
going and push your way to the
front. Some houses are doing
that now. You see more acid and
pot, more Negroes, more talk
about Vietnam."
"But that's not what's in now,"
said the activist. "That's what

we cared about, what we still
care about. That's why we're
out."
"Well, what's in?" Paisley
asked, "All the leaflet in the
john said was that you had to
be in Beta Chi, or the Grove,
or The Daily. But what does
that mean? Are we victims of
a conspiracy perpetrated by
Steve Gruber, Jim Briscoe, Bob
Stone, and Kip Hargrove?"
"Who?"
"They're on The Daily. So is
Fritz Schaefer, for that matter."
Lyman Is 'In'
"You have to be Peter Ly
man," Activist said. "He's the
in-crowd. That's what the
posters really meant."
"But he isn't on The Daily,
and doesn't even belong to Beta
Chi."
"I'm confused," Paisley said.
"I don't know where 'in' is. I do,
however, know where 'up' is,
and if you gentlemen will ex
cuse me, I'm going to go turn
on."
"Wait," Madras-shirt said.
"Don't you care about being
'in'?"
"To paraphrase Antonioni, I
am in." With this, Paisley left,
his footsteps echoing across the

back terrace, to the accompany
ment of a soft "Hare Krishna
har Krishna, Krishna, Krishna,
hare, hare . . .
"What about you?" Madras
said to Activist. "What are you
going to do now that the in
stant historians have written
you out of the script?"
Medium Is Message
"I don't know — keep writing
my draft board and sending 88c
telegrams. Maybe I'll go over to
Joel Smith's and argue. That'll
make me feel better. I also have
been inspired by all this. A new
tactic might be to put WE AC
CUSE over the urinals, like the
'in-crowd' notices. Perhaps the
medium is the message."
"Say, Madras," said Portly,
"How about a beer?" And with
this summary, the group dis
persed.
The moral of this tale is: Al
though the results are not in,
some analysts have found a
low but significant correlation
between reading The Daily dur
ing election campaigns and per
manent brain damage. It has
also been found that "In-Crowd"
posters can cause damage when
they are crammed onto chromo
somes cultured on a Petri dish.

care about. That's why we're
out."
"Well, what's in?" Paisley
asked, "All the leaflet in the
john said was that you had to
be in Beta Chi, or the Grove,
or The Daily. But what does
that mean? Are we victims of
a conspiracy perpetrated by
Steve Gruber, Jim Briscoe, Bob
Stone, and Kip Hargrove?"
"Who?"
"They're on The Daily. So is
Fritz Schaefer, for that matter."
Lyman Is 'In'
"You have to be Peter Ly
man," Activist said. "He's the
in-crowd. That's what the
posters really meant."
"But he isn't on The Daily,
and doesn't even belong to Beta
Chi."
"I'm confused," Paisley said.
"I don't know where 'in' is. I do,
however, know where 'up' is,
and if you gentlemen will ex
cuse me, I'm going to go turn
on."
"Wait," Madras-shirt said.
"Don't you care about being
'in'?"
"To paraphrase Antonioni, I
am in." With this, Paisley left,
his footsteps echoing across the

back terrace, to the accompany
ment of a soft "Hare Krishna
har Krishna, Krishna, Krishna,
hare, hare . . .
"What about you?" Madras
said to Activist. "What are you
going to do now that the in
stant historians have written
you out of the script?"
Medium Is Message
"I don't know — keep writing
my draft board and sending 88c
telegrams. Maybe I'll go over to
Joel Smith's and argue. That'll
make me feel better. I also have
been inspired by all this. A new
tactic might be to put WE AC
CUSE over the urinals, like the
'in-crowd' notices. Perhaps the
medium is the message."
"Say, Madras," said Portly,
"How about a beer?" And with
this summary, the group dis
persed.
The moral of this tale is: Al
though the results are not in,
some analysts have found a
low but significant correlation
between reading The Daily dur
ing election campaigns and per
manent brain damage. It has
also been found that "In-Crowd"
posters can cause damage when
they are crammed onto chromo
somes cultured on a Petri dish.
Resplendent in his very faded
blue work-shirt, dirty Levis and
rusty SNCC button, the long
haired, bearded activist survey
ed the Tresidder back patio and
said, "Christ, I thought I was
the in-crowd."
"Times change," a portly
Theta Chi filling a wrought-wire
chair across the table said.
"Only a few weeks ago I won a
student body election, and my
hous6 has traditionally held
ASSU offices. I thought I was
in.",
"Why do you think I dropped
out?" a neatly-clad man in
pressed pants, a vest and a
paisley shirt said. "The I Ching
said that was the tao."
Like Yesterday's DAILY
"Wow," said the activist.
"We're like yesterday's Daily.
I never thought that when we
helped set up the Grove House
only last January that it was
going to do this."
"Yesterday," Paisley said, "It
was LSD and turn on or not
turn on. Now it's the Honor
Code and turn in or not turn in.
Yesterday it was Wally we were
accusing, now its Cesare."
"Last year," portley said, "It
was Jay Kadane and LASSU.

Now it's some attempt to make
LASSU to anything. Last year
it was Carl Schmidt."
"Who?"
"That's what I mean. One day
you're on a poster, the next your
working for your father up
state."
Stunning Remark
At this remark, a stunned si
lence settled over the group,
broken only when a clean-cut,
Madras-shirted, white Levied,
boy moved over from another
table.
"I couldn't help overhearing.
You guys think you have prob
lems. Ten years ago, even five,
you were pretty much nothing
unless you looked like me. Now
some of the brothers say the
only way to preserve our species
is to declare the Row a wildlife
preserve.
"Times change, men, and if
what you're concerned about is
to be where it's at, you have to
figure out where the crowd is
going and push your way to the
front. Some houses are doing
that now. You see more acid and

rusty SNCC button, the long
haired, bearded activist survey
ed the Tresidder back patio and
said, "Christ, I thought I was
the in-crowd."
"Times change," a portly
Theta Chi filling a wrought-wire
chair across the table said.
"Only a few weeks ago I won a
student body election, and my
hous6 has traditionally held
ASSU offices. I thought I was
in.",
"Why do you think I dropped
out?" a neatly-clad man in
pressed pants, a vest and a
paisley shirt said. "The I Ching
said that was the tao."
Like Yesterday's DAILY
"Wow," said the activist.
"We're like yesterday's Daily.
I never thought that when we
helped set up the Grove House
only last January that it was
going to do this."
"Yesterday," Paisley said, "It
was LSD and turn on or not
turn on. Now it's the Honor
Code and turn in or not turn in.
Yesterday it was Wally we were
accusing, now its Cesare."
"Last year," portley said, "It
was Jay Kadane and LASSU.

Now it's some attempt to make
LASSU to anything. Last year
it was Carl Schmidt."
"Who?"
"That's what I mean. One day
you're on a poster, the next your
working for your father up
state."
Stunning Remark
At this remark, a stunned si
lence settled over the group,
broken only when a clean-cut,
Madras-shirted, white Levied,
boy moved over from another
table.
"I couldn't help overhearing.
You guys think you have prob
lems. Ten years ago, even five,
you were pretty much nothing
unless you looked like me. Now
some of the brothers say the
only way to preserve our species
is to declare the Row a wildlife
preserve.
"Times change, men, and if
what you're concerned about is
to be where it's at, you have to
figure out where the crowd is
going and push your way to the
front. Some houses are doing
that now. You see more acid and
pot, more Negroes, more talk
about Vietnam."
"But that's not what's in now,"
said the activist. "That's what

we cared about, what we still
care about. That's why we're
out."
"Well, what's in?" Paisley
asked, "All the leaflet in the
john said was that you had to
be in Beta Chi, or the Grove,
or The Daily. But what does
that mean? Are we victims of
a conspiracy perpetrated by
Steve Gruber, Jim Briscoe, Bob
Stone, and Kip Hargrove?"
"Who?"
"They're on The Daily. So is
Fritz Schaefer, for that matter."
Lyman Is 'In'
"You have to be Peter Ly
man," Activist said. "He's the
in-crowd. That's what the
posters really meant."
"But he isn't on The Daily,
and doesn't even belong to Beta
Chi."
"I'm confused," Paisley said.
"I don't know where 'in' is. I do,
however, know where 'up' is,
and if you gentlemen will ex
cuse me, I'm going to go turn
on."
"Wait," Madras-shirt said.
"Don't you care about being
'in'?"
"To paraphrase Antonioni, I
am in." With this, Paisley left,
his footsteps echoing across the

back terrace, to the accompany
ment of a soft "Hare Krishna
har Krishna, Krishna, Krishna,
hare, hare . . .
"What about you?" Madras
said to Activist. "What are you
going to do now that the in
stant historians have written
you out of the script?"
Medium Is Message
"I don't know — keep writing
my draft board and sending 88c
telegrams. Maybe I'll go over to
Joel Smith's and argue. That'll
make me feel better. I also have
been inspired by all this. A new
tactic might be to put WE AC
CUSE over the urinals, like the
'in-crowd' notices. Perhaps the
medium is the message."
"Say, Madras," said Portly,
"How about a beer?" And with
this summary, the group dis
persed.
The moral of this tale is: Al
though the results are not in,
some analysts have found a
low but significant correlation
between reading The Daily dur
ing election campaigns and per
manent brain damage. It has
also been found that "In-Crowd"
posters can cause damage when
they are crammed onto chromo
somes cultured on a Petri dish.
