## 'Rebuttal' Fails To Face Campaign Issues 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It appears that I will be unable
to return to the anti-political
shell I mentioned in Wednesday's
letter. The Students for Free
Elections—no longer an anony
mous group but now an infa
mous one—have done it a g a in.
Their latest foray into the wilds
of absurdity came with the ap
pearance of a sheet entitled "Re
buttal to The Stanford Daily"
which attempts to reassert and
reclarify their original state
ment. Unfortunately, it m is s e s
the point.
Gentlemen, the reaction which
your first statement received was
not merely the indignation of a
few Lyman supporters. Rather,
it was an indication of intense
disgust with which students of
many political persuasions re
gard such a lack of morality in
campaigning. This campaign
should be fought on the issues
at hand rather than on purely
personal attacks or two-bit con
tentions of a conspiracy of si
lence to elect a certain candidate
(a contention which I place a lit
tle lower than tho one about the
man in the funny red suit who
visits good little kiddies every
December).
For those of you who have for
gotten, there are issues in this af
fair—the proper role of students
vis-a-vis faculty vis-a-vis admin
istration, the proper function of
an education, to name a few.
These issues are not being ob
scurred by The Daily—they have
been obscurred by certain of the
candidates for office and by sev
eral of their misguided support
ers, SFE included. As Mr. Han
sen (who I am sure is not con
nected with SFE) stated near the
beginning of the campaign, Peter
Lyman is the man to beat. But is
this the proper way to do it?

Editor, The Daily:
In Wednesday's Dally appear
ed an editorial entitled "The
Paranoid Style in ASSU Poli
tics." In the next to last para
graph is expressed the opinion
that "an unhealthy element is
emerging in this University.
Whereas those who are apath
etic and do not care for the
future of this institution used
to keep silent, they have now
become outspoken." This charge
was levied against the authors
of the anonymous bills which
appeared on campus Monday.
In accord with The Daily, I
agree that the nature of this
sheet warrents much criticism;
however, I believe this criticism
should be directed to the form
which those accusations took,

and not because an "unhealthy
element" has finally "become
outspoken" as it was interpreted
by The Dally. Is this actually a
form of political paranoia, or
is it possibly a reflection of the
"fear" that perhaps those who
have been apathetic and have
offered little public comment on
past issues (which would seem
to encompass a majority of stu
dents) are now making an ini
tiative? This charge, it seems,
affects more than just the au
thors of Monday's handbill.
I associate myself neither with
the "New Left" nor the Old
Right (although I once consider
ed rushing Beta Chi) — I'm
what you might term an apath
etic Middle-of-the-Roader. In this
rather wishy-washy position
(which I have adhered to for
the past three years), the neces
sity of opposition groups has
become somewhat clearer for
me (let's here it for W. F. Heg
el!). Soft-spoken and politically
apathetic or outspoken and po
litically active — a choice be
tween political paranoia or po
litical "monotheism." In the
words of an often belittled high
school math teacher: "Let's see
you get off your ass and do
something — but remember to
put your name in the upper
right hand corner."

• 4 lnner' Speaks Out
Editor, The Daily:
Not to be left out of the In-
Crowd writing to the Daily, I feel
called upon to mention my role
in the "In-Crowd" affair.
The campaign of Jon Reider
and myself was designed to pro
voke a decent campaign of is
sues. If we had won, there would
have been a new election in Sep
tember, and ASSU would be the
same ghost it is now, with mo
mentary delay. The day of our
campaign I met with Mr. Reich
and Mr. Kane and suggested
some ideas and issues which I
felt important. I told them that
their preliminary white paper, as
well as the others I heard about
or read, were inadequate. They
followed more or less closely my
suggestions, which was satisfy
ing. I told them I would with
draw if they seemed to me to
overcome the usual emptiness of
Stanford elections, a vow they
accepted without difficulty. At
that time I knew nothing, and no
one knew anything, about the
possibility of Peter Lyman's
candidacy. When it became an
actuality I withdrew because he
has my friendship and my re
spect, and I trusted him in a way
I could not trust other candi
dates.
The "In-Crowd" paper is a
typical hate sheet befitting
Southern racist attempts; in
quality it falls below theirs. I as
sume this is because such a tact
is new to the Students for Free
Election; I feel confident that
their capabilities will improve as
their bitterness and fear in
creases.
I have not eaten at Beta Chi
for a year. Currently all Stanford
students are members of the
house, even students for a free
election. I am pleased that the
In-Crowd is so large. I hope fac
ulty and administrators will join
as well.
I met the author of the In-
Crowd sheet Tuesday. I asked
him why he did not call me be
fore writing about my activities.
He said he did not need to. If he
or his associates (close or not)
change their minds, I can be
reached at 325-5404. May I extend
now my personal invitation to
them for dinner at the Grove.
The food is excellent, the conver
sation good, and the weather
pleasant.
I would print this letter as an
ad to avoid further charges, but
all of my funds have been ex
pended on oil for the political
machine which I control by ESP.
My apologies.

• Anonymity
Editor, The Daily:
I am one of the workers for
Students for Free Elections
(CFE) who were called anony
mous by your May 3rd editorial.
Now I may not be well known,
but I do resent being anony

mous. If you want to meet me
some time, come on over.

Miss Casto, but the reason we
called you anonymous is that
we didn't know who you were.)
• Apology
Editor, The Daily:
I have been informed by Dr.
William Shockley's attorney
that he considers my letter
(Daily, January 18, 1957) criti
cizing Dr. Shockley's address to
the Commonwealth Club as de
famatory."
While I do not accept this de
scription of my letter, I do wish
to retract it and to apologize for
any ill it may have caused Dr.
Shockley.

• Inferior Work?
Editor, The Daily:
In my experience, most stu
dents taking courses for "pass
fail" do inferior work. Their rea
son for not wanting a more con
ventional mark is often that
they simply do not have time to
do the work normally required.
A vague interest in the course

material incites them to take
the course, but they are forced
to come to class unprepared or
poorly prepared. In a class
where day-to-day student partici
pation is essential, one or more
unprepared pass-fail students
detract from the benefit of the
whole group.
It would seem that these pass
fail students could benefit just
as much from a course by simp
ly auditing it, thereby leaving
a place in the class for a stu
dent with more time to devote to
serious work.
If the pass-fail system is to
be continued, however, it might
be interesting to increase the
difficulty of receiving a "pass"
mark. Presently a student do
ing D work passes the course.
Such a student is certainly not
qualified to take more advanced
courses in the subject studied,
and one wonders whether he
"got anything" out of the course
at all.
How many students would
take courses under the "pass
fail" system if the line between
"pass" and "fail" were drawn
between Band C, or even C and
D, instead of D and F?
