# Yale President To Speak
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Kingman Brewster, President of
Yale University, will open a five-day
visit to Stanford this Sunday by de
livering the first of three Harry Camp
Memorial Lectures. Brewster will
speak on, "The Academic Process:
The Individual" at 3:30 p.m. in Me
morial Auditorium.

Brewster will present the following
lectures in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
the second Tuesday evening at 7:45,
and the third, Thursday afternoon at
4:15. These will be entitled, "The Aca
demic Process: The Institution," and
"The Academic Process: The State."
These lectures will be the most
lengthy statements of Brewster's edu-

cational philosophy since he became
President of Yale in 1963. They will
be carefully examined by observers
across the country, some of whom
think Brewster has political aspira
tions and even Presidential aspira
tions.
At present, Brewster is a member
of the President's Commission on
Law Enforcement of Administration
of Justice, and also sits on the Presi
dent's National Commission on Selec
tive Service.
V
While at Stanford, Brewster and
his wife will keep busy with numer
ous luncheons, dinners, and meetings.
On Monday he will lunch with Dean
Joel Smith and eight students, in
cluding Dave Harris. The others in
vited are Rick Levin, Henry Levinson,
M ik e Q u in n , Kathy Golding, Jane
Aries, Charles Bell, and Judy Kessler.
Brewster will meet the Steering Com
mittee of S.E.S. over lunch on Wed
nesday.
Since taking over the reins of power
at Yale four years ago, Brewster has
entered more and more into the public
eye. He spoke out against inequities
in the draft at last years Yale gradu
ation, and at Yale itself, he has insti
tuted several educational reforms that
have attracted national notice.
For example, eleven Yale juniors
are spending five years to get a B.A.
rather than the usual four. The extra
year is known at Yale as "junior year
in the jungle" during which the stu
denst are free to travel anywhere in
the world to explore some relevant
area of study.
The latest Brewster idea is to move
Vassar, an all girls college in Pough
keepsie, N.Y., to New Haven to estab
lish a Harvard-Radcliff type of re
lationship.
The Harry Camp Memorial Lec
tures, now in their sixth year, are
sponsored by the Harry Camp Memor
ial Fund, established by friends of
the late Harry Camp, a prominent
San Francisco business man. Previous
speakers were: Erwin D. Canham,
H. L. A. Hart, Roger Sessions, Frank
E. Manuel, adn John Huston Finely,
Jr.
