# Race, Poverty Still Plague U.S.â€”Payton
## 
### BONNIE SELWAY 
"The gap is not being closed on the
race picture; if anything it's widen
ing," said the Reverend Doctor Benja
min F. Payton, Executive Director
of the Department of Social Justice
of the National Council of Churches
in his speech on "Race, Poverty and
Peace," last night at Tresidder Union.
"Cynicism and pessimism have set
in about the ability of this country
even to deal with the problem (of civil
rights) ... the euphoria that gener
ated the march on Washington was
grounded more on hopeful expecta
tion than any changes," he continued.
Payton is a pastor, teacher, author
and co-founder of the committee
"Clergy and Laity Concern about
Vietnam." He holds degrees in theol
ogy- philosophy and sociology from
Harvard, Columbia and Yale, has
taught at Howard College, and was
recently appointed President at Bene
dict College, a predominantly Negro
college in South Carolina.
No Enforcement
Measures being taken for the equal
ization of civil rights in America are
inadequate, he stated. Legislation
passed since 1957 is not being en
forced, and Negroes cannot support
themselves.
"A Negro family makes 50 percent
of what an average white family
makes." Unrest arises in the big cities,
and the 'Watt's syndrome' is be
coming institutionalized."
Negroes are still treated as slaves
in the United States, Dr. Payton said.
The nation still retains the "notion
and evaluation of Negroes as slaves,
not acceptable unless we (Negroes)
come with bowing and scrapings . . .
and this is not what it means to be
a man."
Meet Problem Directly
Measures against poverty, such as
guaranteed annual income and family
allowances, don't meet the race prob
lem directly, said Payton. Poverty is
not an "absence of income," but the
"inability to play a meaningful role
in one's society and make a pro
ductive living for your family in that
society."
These poverty program can have
repercussions "unless spelled out."
The Negro is given a small allow
ance, and the employers "go on hir
ing whites again . . . with a bigger
section of population on the outside."
Money is being mischanneled. Pay
ton cited the appeal of Negro women
before the Senate petitioning not
for charity but jobs and on-the-job
training for their husbands and fath
ers. "The Senate chambers were
shocked!" he said.
Misguided Federal Aid
An example of a misguided federal
aid to the Negro education is "Head
Start," which "keeps the child in the
same delapidated school system.' Such
programs "don't adequately train the
Negro; they just keep him off the
streets."
The economic problem of the Negro
community is how to develop itself
when it has no money within. There
Is a "brain drain" of young Negro
talent by white organizations.
Payton believed that resources that
should be used to educate our people,
arrest poverty and rebuild cities are
being taken by the "war machine."
Only three billion dollars a year, Is
spont on poverty. "Less than 21 dol
lars per individual in all poverty pro

grams is spent a year, while it takes
$435,000 to kill one Vietnamese," he
quoted.
Hawks Segregationists
Race and war get mixed up, said
Payton. "The loudest hawks retain
their segregational citadels."
He stated that 22 percent of the
troops fighting in Vietnam are Negro-
American, but disproportionally 53
percent are on the front line.
"The Negro has no equal opportun
ity to live in peace, but finds it all too
easy to find more than an equal oppor
tunity to die in war," he continued.
Moving into the field of religion,
Payton advocated that Negro civil
rights workers, ministers and educa
tors expand their horizons from civil
rights to political questions. He espec
ially calls on churchmen to "come
out of their empty shells, face the
world, and develop techniques that
will solicit response (from their con
gregations)." He is disappointed at
the lack of ferment in business and
labor concerning the war.
In response to questions from the
floor, Payton praised Marten Luther
King's stand against the war, and
lauded Stokely Carmichael's "sheer
moral integrity." "It is a viscious, de
meaning notion that Negroes should
be only concerned about civil rights
. . . all great people play multiple
roles."

college in South Carolina.
No Enforcement
Measures being taken for the equal
ization of civil rights in America are
inadequate, he stated. Legislation
passed since 1957 is not being en
forced, and Negroes cannot support
themselves.
"A Negro family makes 50 percent
of what an average white family
makes." Unrest arises in the big cities,
and the 'Watt's syndrome' is be
coming institutionalized."
Negroes are still treated as slaves
in the United States, Dr. Payton said.
The nation still retains the "notion
and evaluation of Negroes as slaves,
not acceptable unless we (Negroes)
come with bowing and scrapings . . .
and this is not what it means to be
a man."
Meet Problem Directly
Measures against poverty, such as
guaranteed annual income and family
allowances, don't meet the race prob
lem directly, said Payton. Poverty is
not an "absence of income," but the
"inability to play a meaningful role
in one's society and make a pro
ductive living for your family in that
society."
These poverty program can have
repercussions "unless spelled out."
The Negro is given a small allow
ance, and the employers "go on hir
ing whites again . . . with a bigger
section of population on the outside."
Money is being mischanneled. Pay
ton cited the appeal of Negro women
before the Senate petitioning not
for charity but jobs and on-the-job
training for their husbands and fath
ers. "The Senate chambers were
shocked!" he said.
Misguided Federal Aid
An example of a misguided federal
aid to the Negro education is "Head
Start," which "keeps the child in the
same delapidated school system.' Such
programs "don't adequately train the
Negro; they just keep him off the
streets."
The economic problem of the Negro
community is how to develop itself
when it has no money within. There
Is a "brain drain" of young Negro
talent by white organizations.
Payton believed that resources that
should be used to educate our people,
arrest poverty and rebuild cities are
being taken by the "war machine."
Only three billion dollars a year, Is
spont on poverty. "Less than 21 dol
lars per individual in all poverty pro

grams is spent a year, while it takes
$435,000 to kill one Vietnamese," he
quoted.
Hawks Segregationists
Race and war get mixed up, said
Payton. "The loudest hawks retain
their segregational citadels."
He stated that 22 percent of the
troops fighting in Vietnam are Negro-
American, but disproportionally 53
percent are on the front line.
"The Negro has no equal opportun
ity to live in peace, but finds it all too
easy to find more than an equal oppor
tunity to die in war," he continued.
Moving into the field of religion,
Payton advocated that Negro civil
rights workers, ministers and educa
tors expand their horizons from civil
rights to political questions. He espec
ially calls on churchmen to "come
out of their empty shells, face the
world, and develop techniques that
will solicit response (from their con
gregations)." He is disappointed at
the lack of ferment in business and
labor concerning the war.
In response to questions from the
floor, Payton praised Marten Luther
King's stand against the war, and
lauded Stokely Carmichael's "sheer
moral integrity." "It is a viscious, de
meaning notion that Negroes should
be only concerned about civil rights
. . . all great people play multiple
roles."
"The gap is not being closed on the
race picture; if anything it's widen
ing," said the Reverend Doctor Benja
min F. Payton, Executive Director
of the Department of Social Justice
of the National Council of Churches
in his speech on "Race, Poverty and
Peace," last night at Tresidder Union.
"Cynicism and pessimism have set
in about the ability of this country
even to deal with the problem (of civil
rights) ... the euphoria that gener
ated the march on Washington was
grounded more on hopeful expecta
tion than any changes," he continued.
Payton is a pastor, teacher, author
and co-founder of the committee
"Clergy and Laity Concern about
Vietnam." He holds degrees in theol
ogy- philosophy and sociology from
Harvard, Columbia and Yale, has
taught at Howard College, and was
recently appointed President at Bene

college in South Carolina.
