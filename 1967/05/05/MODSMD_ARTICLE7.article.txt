## Sponsor Selections: Praise, Criticism 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
In the midst of the flurry of election cam
paigning, Con Home balloons, and Wilson
Picket amplification on White Plaza, the an
nouncement of women sponsors for next year
went almost unnoticed by all except those
directly involved.
The process of applying and choosing was
long and difficult, and the reactions of those
involved vary from frustration and bitterness
to praise and approval. Both the written ap
plication and the format of the half-hour in
terviews were changed this year. Two Roble
and two Branner sponsors, one freshman and
one senior selected at large, and either the
Director or Roble or Branner evaluated the
applications and conducted the interviews in
an informal setting.
Freedom of Expression
According to one of the sponsors who par
ticipated in the screening, this year's applica
tion was intended to provide a starting point
for the interview and to give the girl's "a sense
of freedom to talk about themselves in their
own way." The questions on the application
were:
• Ask a question and answer it.
• In one sentence tell why you want to be
a sponsor.
• Describe someone or something.
• Why shouldn't you be a sponsor?
• Bring us a picture.
Some of the girls contacted felt the applica
tion was slanted toward creativity. As one girl
summarized, "It stressed creative writing abil
ity and imagination. It was so vague I wasn't
sure how to answer."
Others said the application caused them to
think and to "reveal" themselves. "My first
reaction was anger because the application
seemed a pre judgment in favor of a certain
kind of person. But when I started to think and

write I found a place for all my thoughts on
sponsoring," one successful candidate said.
The objection, "They were looking for a cer
tain type of girls," was voiced frequently by
applicants, although those evaluating them
stressed that they attempted to deal with each
girl on an individual basis.
"We tried to take what we knew about the
girls and what we knew about sponsoring and
see if they went together," one of the mem
bers of the selection committee explained.
"We had a real feeling that often sponsors
hadn't thought about their real motives, and
we wanted to give people time to think before
their interviews.
Questions asked during the interviews varied
from girl to girl, though most were asked some
thing about friendship, education, and respon
sibility. "Do you think you have the moral
right to influence other peoples' lives?" was
nearly always asked. The girl who posed that
question said it exemplified the type of prob
lems she and other sponsors had asked them
selves and had difficulty answering.
Soul Searching'
The interviews were described as "strenu
ous," "soul-searching," and "penetrating." Some
girls cried, others said their interviews were
"fun" and "stimulating." In discussing the
interviews, the sponsor from Roble said, "It
was the hardest thing I ever tried to do be
cause people cared so much and we were mak
ing personal judgments on their maturity
which we often felt unqualified to make."
She said that situational questions were
avoided because "it was unfair to ask a person
to think in those terms." She gave several ex
amples of the questions asked:
• Is apathy a sin?
• Have you ever consciously exposed your
self to something you had resistances
against?

• How do you know education is taking place
within you?
• What is the difference between a woman
and a girl and where do you stand?
She added that "it was sad to see girls strug
gling when they said something they hadn't
thought about. We tried to find out who a
person was and felt despair when we couldn't."
Stilted Words
One sophomore applicant felt the questions
were "so abstract and profound that I found
myself saying the first thing I could get
out . . . words sound stilted in that situation.
Someone asked me what the most dissatisfying
aspect of my relationship with my boyfriend
was, and I refused to answer. Later I was ask
ed if I had thought about the effect of spon
soring on my privacy. It was difficult to be so
personal with a group of strangers."
Another sophomore said that she enjoyed
her interview and "ended up telling them a
story. It wasn't a discussion of freshmen as
much as it was about me and people. I was
impressed with the group . . . they tried to
give a lot of freedom. They asked me 'what is
anguish?' and some questions about right and
wrong and whether 1 thought I'd be isolated
by freshmen."
A Branner sponsor who interviewed empha
sized the difficulty of selection and said that
she had to leave the room on several occasions.
"It was such a delicate thing with every indivi
dual that it's hard to generalize. Now that it's
over it's hard to talk about."
The freshman girl who helped with the selec
tion described it as a "learning experience." She
explained, "I was looking for someone who was
questioning herself . . . someone I felt I could
go to as a friend . . . who was experiencing
education and could be a teacher to freshmen
in the broad sense and could learn from them."

"The interviews frightened a lot of girls,"
another would-be sponsor said. "Some of the
questions were stupid, like 'what part of you
is emotional and what part is intellectual?'
They seemed to want a creative, super-intellect
ual girl with an almost-£austic wit. I didn't feel
I really showed myself and the things I thought
I could contribute to sponsoring."
Many of the applicants and those who review
ed them felt that the lack of time during inter
views and the number of girls who were ques
tioned were severe limitations and added to
the strain. Girls gave three references on their
applicantions, but some said their references
were not contacted. According to one sponsor,
the committee used references in cases where
confusion existed. She said that they also talk
ed to "people who knew the applicants."
Self-Conseious
A girl who was the last of nine consecutive
applicants to be interviewed in one afternoon
said, "They seemed rather self-righteous and
made no attempts at friendliness at the outset.
They just started asking the most personal
kinds of questions without any preliminaries.
They were as self-conscious as any applicant
could have been."
Alternatives to the application-interview proc
ess such as hostels or group discussions were
considered, but according to one sponsor, it
was decided that the nervousness and competi
tion that might arise would be harmful.
She re-emphasized, "We weren't looking for
any special characteristics. We wanted to choose
people who would provide real alternatives for
freshmen ... we felt a responsibility to pick
the most mature and sensitive people. We often
hurt each other in the process because we are
so hung up on judging. Wo hated being to
gether for that purpose. We tried to give each
applicant an honest look and hoped that they
would have faith in our open-mindedness."
