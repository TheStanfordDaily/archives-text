# Vote Serious ASSU Reform
## 
### 
The open forum of the Stanford community last night was for
many a dream-come-true. But as this representative student voice
slowly emerges, a potential nightmare looms in the election of an
irresponsible, listless candidate as student president.
Eleven thousand or even eleven hundred students can't chair
an open meeting, or feasibly discuss every issue of student con
cern with the appropriate University functionaries.
No candidate will be representative in his ideas for Stanford,
but a student president can surely work for a potent partnership
among students and faculty for University reform.
The election of a serious candidate is imperative. We urge you
to vote today and tomorrow for Michael Bruwer, Denis Hayes,
or HarveyH. Hukari, Jr.
