## Threat Renewed In Germany 
### 
(This column was submitted

student in Political Science.)
In an America preoccupied
with Civil Rights and Vietnam it
may seem irrelevant to draw at
tention to a further menace to
peace and democracy in this
world.
It is less than 25 years since
the 407,316 th American died in
World War II fighting Fascism.
Altogether more than eleven
million people were killed in ac
tion on the Allied side alone in
that war. Ghastly though the
casualty figures are in Vietnam,
they seem very small compared
to eleven million.
In this situation much more
attention and action should be
focused throughout all the
world on the results of the rec
ent State elections in Baden-
Wurtemberg. West Germany.
In particular attention should be
paid to Wilhelm Gutmann, lead
er of the National Democrats in
Baden-Wurtemberg, and No. 2
in the party after Adolf von
Thadden.

Gutmann joined the Nazi
Party in 1932, and remained a
party member until 1945. His
membership number was 966564.
He is a war criminal, who was
sentenced to 18 months gaol for
helping to persecute the Jews.
During the infamous Crystal
Night of 1938, as Burgermeister
of the village of Tiengen near
the Swiss border in Baden-Wurt
emburg, he delivered a violently
anti-Semetic speech in which he
is quoted as saying "We must
make an end to the Jews." After
this speech he helped to dese
crate the Jewish cemetry and
plunder the synagogue and Jew
ish businesses.
As No. 2 in the NPD he can
be regarded as the power behind
the throne. He rarely speaks at
rallies, but his difficult and
stormy relationship with von
Thadden indicate that, in a party
of extremists, he leans even fur
ther towards a revival of
Nazism than do his fellow ex
tremists.
The growth of the Nazi party
in the 1920s and 1930s took

place against a background of
coalition government, wild pro
tests and demonstrations, police
brutality and economic disorder
too similar to recent events in
West Germany to be taken
casually.
So much has been sacrificed
by our parents generation to
destroy this evil force. Are we
going to sit idly by again and
fail to act until it is too late to
avoid another, perhaps deadlier,
war?
Sir Winston Churchill said
"We should not set ourselves
against the duty which some
times falls upon nations and in
dividuals of standing up boldly
in defence of the right, even
though that may not be unat
tended with risk." This was true
in 1938: it is still true in 1968.

Thadden.

Gutmann joined the Nazi
Party in 1932, and remained a
party member until 1945. His
membership number was 966564.
He is a war criminal, who was
sentenced to 18 months gaol for
helping to persecute the Jews.
During the infamous Crystal
Night of 1938, as Burgermeister
of the village of Tiengen near
the Swiss border in Baden-Wurt
emburg, he delivered a violently
anti-Semetic speech in which he
is quoted as saying "We must
make an end to the Jews." After
this speech he helped to dese
crate the Jewish cemetry and
plunder the synagogue and Jew
ish businesses.
As No. 2 in the NPD he can
be regarded as the power behind
the throne. He rarely speaks at
rallies, but his difficult and
stormy relationship with von
Thadden indicate that, in a party
of extremists, he leans even fur
ther towards a revival of
Nazism than do his fellow ex
tremists.
The growth of the Nazi party
in the 1920s and 1930s took

place against a background of
coalition government, wild pro
tests and demonstrations, police
brutality and economic disorder
too similar to recent events in
West Germany to be taken
casually.
So much has been sacrificed
by our parents generation to
destroy this evil force. Are we
going to sit idly by again and
fail to act until it is too late to
avoid another, perhaps deadlier,
war?
Sir Winston Churchill said
"We should not set ourselves
against the duty which some
times falls upon nations and in
dividuals of standing up boldly
in defence of the right, even
though that may not be unat
tended with risk." This was true
in 1938: it is still true in 1968.

In an America preoccupied
with Civil Rights and Vietnam it
may seem irrelevant to draw at
tention to a further menace to
peace and democracy in this
world.
It is less than 25 years since
the 407,316 th American died in
World War II fighting Fascism.
Altogether more than eleven
million people were killed in ac
tion on the Allied side alone in
that war. Ghastly though the
casualty figures are in Vietnam,
they seem very small compared
to eleven million.
In this situation much more
attention and action should be
focused throughout all the
world on the results of the rec
ent State elections in Baden-
Wurtemberg. West Germany.
In particular attention should be
paid to Wilhelm Gutmann, lead
er of the National Democrats in
Baden-Wurtemberg, and No. 2
in the party after Adolf von
Thadden.
