# England's 'Aliens'

### ROBIN KNIGHT (First of two parts 
In the United States the exist
ence of racial discrimination is
an aspect of society which has
been part of the social scene
since the first slaves arrived
from Africa. Its existence has
hardly been acknowledged at
all until the 19605.
This two-part article attempts
to describe the type of discrimi
nation to recent events which
have brought the racial issue to
the forefront of British politi
cal life.
The description of discrimina
tion is based, in large part, on
the evidence of a survey car
ried out in 1967, and now avail
able in a Penguin book entitled
"Racial Discrimination in En
gland."
In 1950 the total coloured
population of Great Britain
numbered about 100,000. At
that time most West Indian
Negroes emigrated to the
United States, but this was
stopped by the McCarran Act,
signed by President Truman)
In 1952. During the following
ten years coloured {migration
to Britain resembled a tidal
wave. By 1966 about 1 mil
lion coloured persons were es
timated to be living in Britain,
which represented two per
cent of the population.
A break-down of this total re
veals the compounded nature of
Britain's racial problem. Instead
of dealing with one minority
coloured group, as in this coun
try, the British face at least four,
including West Indians, Indians,
Pakistanis, and Africans. By
1985 an estimated million
coloured people will be living in
Britain, about six per cent of
the projected population of that
time.
Faced with this serious social
problem, the British have react
ed ambivalently. On the one hand
government legislation has been
passed in 1962, 1965 and 1968 in
an attempt both to stop the in
flux of immigrants and to at
tack through the courts the
practice of discrimination.
On the other hand, as the
1967 survey showed most clear
ly, covert and overt discrimi
nation by the white population
reached "massive and substan
tial" levels. Physical violence
has occured infrequently in
the last ten years; so far noth
ing approaching the riots in
Watts | or Washington has
taken place.
Discrimination is defined as
"a practice or policy which af
-fects members of a minority

group differently because of
colour or country of origin." It
is the "inequitable treatment of
equals." The immigrant to Bri
tain will not be faced with ac
tual segregation: instead he will
find that in employment, hous
ing and services he is treated as
a second-class citizen.
Cases of blunt, open discrimi
nation seem to be rare. More
often than not British discrimi
nation is likely to be indirect.
The landlord will say "the flat's
gone" or the employer will say
"no vacancy."
The result of this disenchant
ment has been the progres
sive isolation of immigrants
in embryonic ghettos. By cater
ing to their own needs within
their own communities, immi
grants are able to diminish
the impact of discrimination.
At the same time this develops
ment promises to repeat the
American experience of de
facto segregation, without the
benefit of equal nationality.
So far the British have been
dealing with an alien group, al
though most immigrants hold
British passports as members
of the Commonwealth. Immi
grants often regard their stay
in Britain as temporary, especi
ally the Asians. However, this
factor will disappear as increas
ing numbers of first-generation
children are born in England.
Already thirty-five per cent of
the immigrant coloured popula
tion is under 16.
The aspect of discrimination
most often encountered by
coloured people is in employ
ment. Levels of unemployment
amongst the coloured population
are twice as high (six per cent)
as for the white population. For
most persons the move to Britain
involves a down-grading in skill
and status.
As the report emphasizes,
"experience of discrimination
is most widespread among
people who, on every criterion
of ability, are the most able
and best qualified." Half the
immigrants surveyed who had
previously held clerical, admin'
istrative or professional posi
tions in their own countries
were now employed as wholly
unskilled manual workers.
British, employers bear the
brunt of criticism expressed
about this situation. The pre
vailing attitude towards employ
ing coloured workers is one of
reluctance. A high degree of
generalizing and stereotyping
with regard to immigrants is
typical.
Once employed the coloured
person has only surmounted
the first of many hurdles. The
higher the Job level "the
greater the pressure and prac
tical <-onsiderations that In
hibit the employment of col
oured people." British man
agement regards coloureds as
"wholly unacceptable," ac
cording to the survey, and a
consensus "would not promote
a coloured man over white
workers whatever his qualifi
cations."
Subtle discrimination is wide
spread in the retail and distribu
tive sectors of industry. Accord
ing to the type of work discrim
ination varies, hut "the closer
relationships of coloured people
and white people in jobs, the
more unacceptable they are to
employers." Translated, this
means that coloured people can
handle tinned food but not fresh
food, can sell pots and pans
but not bras.
In Trade Union life, although
officially any form of racial dis
crimination is banned, the sur
vey discovered that coloured

union members are more likely
to have experienced discrimina
tion than nonunion coloureds.
In fact coloured people in Brit
ain appear to lack commitment
to unions, which is not surpris
ing as it has been shown that
the unions often feel on common
ground with employers in deal
ing with coloured people.
Turning to housing, the col
oured immigrant is confronted
by a situation in which "only
the worst type of housing is
available" to him. This applies
to buy a house, to rent accom
modation, or to get council hous
ing (rent municipally owned
houses).
Of private lettings available
in Britain, a report in 1966 esti
mated that only 11 per cent was
open to coloured people. In situ
ations tests for the 1967 survey
a West Indian was discriminated
against in two-thirds of the tests
when he wasn't excluded in ad
vance. As the survey empha
sized "No coloureds, Sorry no
coloureds, Europeans only —
such stipulations vie in frequen
cy with 'no animals' or 'no pets'
on advertising rented ac

commodation in news agents'
windows."
The results of the 1967 sur
vey was to demonstrate to the
British beyond argument the
existence of widespread and
common discrimination. To a
nation accustomed to the idea
that any man, whatever his
colour or creed, was welcome
In its midst the report came as
an unwelcome shock. However
It cannot be said to have pro
duced any feeling of repent
ance or conscience.
In the United States, what
ever else may be felt about the
Negro, his American nationality
is unquestioned. In Britain most
coloured people are recent im
migrants who, as the survey
showed, have not been absorbed
into the socio-economic struc
ture of the existing society. It
can be, and has been, seriously
advocated that the British gov
ernment pay a grant to all im
migrants wishing to return to
their own countries.
The recognizing of discrimin
ation has only served to empha
size the alien nature of coloured
peop'° to most white British.
