# Protestors Holding Old Union As Lyman Rejects Demands
## 
### DAN SNELL 
As The Daily went to press,
these were the recent develop
ments in the Interim Judicial
Board (IJB) suspensions contro
versy :
Three to four hundred stu
dents seemed prepared to oc
cupy the Old Union last night in
a peaceful demonstration that
began at 1 that afternoon.
Students on the demonstra
tion's tactics committee held a
meeting to decide what action to

take through the night and to
day.
The decision to stay the night
followed an earlier move to leave
the building in response to a vote
of an ASSU mass meeting at 8:20
p.m. in the Old Union courtyard.
In the vote students rejected the
occupation of the building as a
tactic.
Reportedly four student mem
bers of the arbitrating student
faculty - administration Commit
tee of Fifteen said last night at

an open meeting in Memorial
Auditorium they would remain
at today's meeting of the com
mittee if the committee would
adopt a final proposal to alter
the IJB. They emphasized that
the IJB must be abolished and
the case against the students
dismissed, and they said they
would stay in the committee
meeting as long as necessary to
complete a proposal today.
Provost Richard Lyman ap
peared at an open meeting in

Memorial Auditorium attended
by about 1800 students and fac
ulty in which he defended Pres
ident J. E. Wallace Sterling's
statement of Sunday.
Lyman rejected the first de
mand, that the IJB decision for
suspension not be accepted, by
saying that Sterling did not
want to act until he had al
lowed time to consult individ
ually with the defendants. Ly
man said the students' offense
was only "minor in so far as
we (the administration) pre
vented a sit-in from happen
ing."
He rejected the second de
mand, that the IJB be disbanded,
saying "it is a thoroughly legi
timate body." He said that to
grant its abolition "under the
kind of pressure we now have"
would be a "sad commentary"
on the times.
The third demand, for an ap
pellate board composed of four
faculty members and five stu
dents, would soon be met in
spirit when, according to Ly
man, the Committee of Fifteen
(Cl 5) a faculty - administration
student arbitrating body, pre
sents its recommendations "with
in the next six weeks."

Lyman said the fourth de
mand, that only appeals from de
fendants be heard by the appel
late board, could not be met be
cause "The ASSU Judicial Coun
cil is the creature of the Legi
slature." The Legislature would
then have undue power "over
every other element in this com
munity," Lyman said.
He called the demand that
Sterling address the students
yesterday a "delusive tactic"
and denounced "deadlines for»
giving simple answers to com
plex questions."
In the ASSU mass meeting at
the Old Union earlier, ASSU
President Cesare Massarenti re
iterated that there had been no
damage to anything in the build
ing. He said, "President , Sterl
ing's letter in The Daily does
not answer our demands at all."
After several students and
three faculty members had spok
en, Legislature Speaker Michael
Weinstein conducted a hand
vote of the assembled students.
Students voted to support the
sit-inners' four demands, rejected
the sit-in as a tactic, and sup
ported amnesty for those who
did sit-in.
