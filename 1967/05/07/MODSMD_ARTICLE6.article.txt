# IJB's Turbulent History Spawns Latest Controversy
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Behind the present contro
versy on the Interim Judicial
Body (IJB) is a long history of
strange developments.
Stanford's judicial system was
the product of many weeks of
negotiations between the admin

istration and the students which
took place in the spring and
summer of 1965.
The negotiations were the di
rect outgrowth of the contro
versial Crow-Halverson Report,
which was highly critical of the
dean of women at the time,
Lucile Allen, and the dean of
students at the time, H. Donald
Winbigler.
The report said Dean Allen
did not "recognize Women's
Council as an independent or
ganization . . . (and) thinks of
the council as part of her ad
ministration."
It was critical of Winbigler
for his handling of the Frank
Morse case of 1964, in which a
student was suspended from the
University by unilateral action
of the dean's office.
The report said Winbigler
was inconsistent in his decisions
and had attempted to pressure
the judicial body involved.
WTien the Crow-Halverson re
port was made public in early
February 1965. the student
legislature reacted by passing
a strongly worded resolution
"that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw in
terpreted the resolution as
meaning partly that Judicial
Council would enforce Univers
ity policy except when it con
flicts with ASSU policy.
At the time, the only such
conflict was on liquor policy
(though this particular conflict
no longer exists).
Later in the month, LASSU
passed an even stronger act, the
Judicial Competance Bill, stat
ing that Judicial Council would
not consider a violation of Uni
versity policy to be a violation
of the Fundamental Standard
unless that policy had been ap
proved by two-thirds vote of
LASSU.
The Committee of 15 was set
up in March to negotiate a new
judicial system. The committee

had five representatives each
from the student body, the fac
ulty and the administration.
Late in September 1965, final
agrement was reached and a
week later, LASSU and Presi
dent Wallace Sterling both ap
proved the compromise.
The student Judicial Council
was to have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases regard
ing student affairs and conduct,
unless a specific conflict existed
between ASSU and University
policies.
Students brought before Ju
dicial Council were guaranteed
certain rights, including the
right to have the case heard by
the dean of students.
The compromise included an
appeals system. A joint stu
dent-faculty appeals board was
to be set up at a later date, and
meanwhile appeals would be
heard by an all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body.
(Today, more than two years
later, this student-faculty ap
peals board has still not been
established. No method was
ever agreed upon for appoint
ing the student members.)
When the compromise was
reached, LASSU amended its
Judicial Competence Bill to con
