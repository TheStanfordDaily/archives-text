If your hair started hurting as it withered and fell from your
scalp, you would rush to see us because you wouldn't accept
such a condition and endure pain. The fact that falling hair
is not accompanied by pain should not deceive you. No gen
eral, good for everybody treatment can provide results. Our
entirely different personalized treatment cannot be compared
with "assembly line" methods. If you are growing only short,
soft hairs, if there is excessive dandruff; excessive oiliness or
dryness; excessive hair in the combings; those may be Nature's
own warnings of impending baldness.
Don't delay. Get a comprehensive hair and scalp examination
today or tonight, absolutely free. Find out why hundreds of
your friends and neighbors are telling others about us. We
accept ONLY cases we CAN POSITIVELY IMPROVE. Don't re
sign yourself to baldness.
Certain things can and cannot be done. The important thing
is to come in first, without delay, the examination is FREE.
No matter where you've been or what you've tried, spend
15 FREE minutes with us. If nothing else comes of it we guaran
tee you will learn a lot. No appointment needed for free con
sultation-examination.
Hours: Daily 11a.m. to 8 p.m.—Thursday 4 to 8 p.m.
