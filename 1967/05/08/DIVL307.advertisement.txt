Try Camaro-"The Hugger"
, ■■= " "
Camaro hugs a road closer, straightens a curve easier because it's the
widest stance sportster at its price. It's lower, heavier, too...big-car solid and steady.
You get a better ride, more precise handling for your money.
Ask any Camaro owner, he'll tell you.
Now, during the Camaro Pacesetter Sale,
you also get special savings on specially equipped sport coupes and convertibles.
Save on all this: the 250-cu.-in. Six,
whitewalls, wheel covers, bumper guards, wheel opening moldings, body striping,
deluxe steering wheel, extra brightwork inside.
And, at no extra cost during the Sale,
get a floor shift for the 3-speed transmission and the sporty hood stripe!
Compare Camaro. See your Chevrolet dealer now.
(Sale savings, too, on specially equipped Fleetside pickups, Model C 510934.)
