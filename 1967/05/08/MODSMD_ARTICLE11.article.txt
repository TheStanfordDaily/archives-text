# Wilbur Sponsors For Class Of '71 Selected
## 
### 
Next year's Wilbur sponsors
have been chosen. The selec
tions were made by a committee
of four sponsors, a faculty resi
dent of Wilbur and the Wilbur
director.
Each applicant had submitted
an application and then was
interviewed for 20 to 30 minutes.
Head sponsor Scott Soames said
the kind of person they were
looking for was "hard to char
acterize." One prerequisite, he
added, was "the ability to serve
as a kind of informal teacher
. . . , concerned with his own
education and that of others."
The questions on each appli
cation included, "What moti
vates you to be a sponsor;"
"what experiences, activities and
so on have contributed most to
ability to sponsor;" "what has
been most lacking in your ex
perience as a college student;"
"how do you conceive of your
relationship with individual
freshmen;" and "who are your
heroes and why?"
In the interviews, the com
mittee did not pose the same
questions to every applicant. In
general, said Soames, the pur
pose was to "try to get to talk
about what a person thinks a lot
about." Some of the qualities
looked for were "depth and con
sistency of thought, integrity, a
kind of interest, and personal
warmth and enthusiasm."
