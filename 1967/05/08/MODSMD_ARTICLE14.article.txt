# Group Plans Discussion, Disengagement From War
## 
### 
Seeking increased discussion
of the Vietnam war by members
of the Stanford community,
three Stanford organizations
and a number of prominent pro
fessors today called for a meet
ing of the "concerned commun
ity" to discuss disengagement
from the war and to suggest
plans for community action.
Called "Toward Disengage
ment," the meeting is planned
for the afternoon and evening
of Tuesday, May 16, in Memor
ial Auditorium. The three spon
soring groups are Stanford Com
munity Concerned About Viet
nam, the Stanford Faculty-Staff
Committee for Peace in Viet
nam, and the Stanford Chapter
of Students for a Democratic
Society.
Among professors endorsing
the meeting are Robert McAffee
Brown, Professor of Religion
and a prominent theologian, Hu
bert Marshall, Professor of Po
litical Science, and Wallace
Stegner, Professor of English,
author, and director of the Crea
tive Writing Center. Others in
cluded B. Davie Napier, Dean of
Chapel, Brooks Otis, Chairman
of the Department of Classics,
and Charles Drekmeier, Profes
sor of Political Science.
"Another Go-'round"
Doctor Marshall cited in a
Daily interview, his belief that
there has been inadequate rec
ent discussion of Vietnam on the
Stanford campus as his reason
for supporting "Toward Disen
gagement." "We simply ought
to have another round of talk
and debate on the issue. It was

really two years ago that we
had the teach-ins and I guess
a lot of us don't realize that we
have a new generation of stu
dents here and it just might be
time for us to have another go
'round," he said.
"My own interest is that we
find some way of disengaging
from what seems to me as an
unwise involvement in South
east Asia. My concern, as a spon
sor of this meeting, is that Stan
ford people be as informed as
possible," he concluded.
To Affect Policy
"I am for any meeting which
can promote discussion by
which we can find some, or hope
fully find some, way in which
the process of democracy and
the process of dissent can actu
ally be brought to bear upon
American policy. It seems to me
that the protest goes on and on
and bounces off policy like a ten
nis ball off a wall," said Stegner
in another Daily interview.
In a printed announcement of
the meeting, the sponsors said:
"The war goes on—it increases,
in South Vietnam, in North Viet
nam, into Laos, Cambodia, Thai
land, China, and if not physi
cally, then morally and polit
ically in the United States. . . .
Considering the mounting
war, perhaps debating alterna
tive policies is naive," the an
nouncement continued, but "act
ing is not." "We must under
stand what might be, what can
be—assessing the feasibility and
the naivete of alternatives," the
announcement explained, "if we
are to discover what must be
done."
