# Boys, Girls Differ
## Psychologists Offer Evidence 
### 
Boys and girls don't learn to
be different — they just natural
ly are.
While the foregoing statement
will hardly be news to parents
and teachers, current research
on the subject is summed up in
a new book, The Development of
Sex Differences, edited by Elea
nor Macoby of the Psychology
Department.
The contributors, who include

Dr. David Hamburg, head of the
Psychiatry Department at the
Medical School, and Sanford
Dornbusch, professor of socio
logy, show that little boys start
more fights, make more noise,
take more risks, think more in
dependently, are harder to edu
cate, and are more fragile. They
are more likely to stutter, to
have reading problems, and to
suffer emotional quirks of every
sort. They lag behind girls in
physical development and even
at the start of school, their hand
muscle control is markedly less
mature.
Little girls, on the other hand,
are more robust and mature, yet
more dependent, submissive,
conforming and unadventrous.
They are more interested in peo
ple than in things, show more
concern for others, are more sen
sitive to others' reactions, and
are more likely by far to remem
ber names and places.
While there is no difference in
IQ levels in early childhood, girls
excel in verbal abilities "even
before they know they are
girls," according to one of the
researchers. They talk earlier,
spell better and write more.

Boys outclass them in math and
science and creative; thinking.
Some other research high
lights noted in the hook:
Males have a higher rate of
alcoholism than females because
there is a greater disparity be
tween the man's role as a boy
and as an adult.
America's rapid social change
"causes a low level of consen
sus" among researchers on sex
roles: Negro wives are lively to
have more power in the family
than white wives; lower-class
wives are expected to be more
subservient than middle-class
wives; there are regional differ
ences in the willingness of girls
to "play dump" in order to
please their dates.
Both males and females grow
more masculine as they age,
one researcher finds. Another
shows that more females prefer
to be males than the other way
around. "The tomboy is more
acceptable than '.he sissy," notes
Prof. Dornbusch. "When females
deviate they are attempting to
take on the preferred role,
whereas deviating males are at
tacking the prel'<?rence order for
the sexes."

are more likely by far to remem
ber names and places.
While there is no difference in
IQ levels in early childhood, girls
excel in verbal abilities "even
before they know they are
girls," according to one of the
researchers. They talk earlier,
spell better and write more.

Boys outclass them in math and
science and creative; thinking.
Some other research high
lights noted in the hook:
Males have a higher rate of
alcoholism than females because
there is a greater disparity be
tween the man's role as a boy
and as an adult.
America's rapid social change
"causes a low level of consen
sus" among researchers on sex
roles: Negro wives are lively to
have more power in the family
than white wives; lower-class
wives are expected to be more
subservient than middle-class
wives; there are regional differ
ences in the willingness of girls
to "play dump" in order to
please their dates.
Both males and females grow
more masculine as they age,
one researcher finds. Another
shows that more females prefer
to be males than the other way
around. "The tomboy is more
acceptable than '.he sissy," notes
Prof. Dornbusch. "When females
deviate they are attempting to
take on the preferred role,
whereas deviating males are at
tacking the prel'<?rence order for
the sexes."
Boys and girls don't learn to
be different — they just natural
ly are.
While the foregoing statement
will hardly be news to parents
and teachers, current research
on the subject is summed up in
a new book, The Development of
Sex Differences, edited by Elea
nor Macoby of the Psychology
Department.
The contributors, who include

Dr. David Hamburg, head of the
Psychiatry Department at the
Medical School, and Sanford
Dornbusch, professor of socio
logy, show that little boys start
more fights, make more noise,
take more risks, think more in
dependently, are harder to edu
cate, and are more fragile. They
are more likely to stutter, to
have reading problems, and to
suffer emotional quirks of every
sort. They lag behind girls in
physical development and even
at the start of school, their hand
muscle control is markedly less
mature.
Little girls, on the other hand,
are more robust and mature, yet
more dependent, submissive,
conforming and unadventrous.
They are more interested in peo
ple than in things, show more
concern for others, are more sen
sitive to others' reactions, and
are more likely by far to remem
ber names and places.
