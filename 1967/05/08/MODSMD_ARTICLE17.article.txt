# Vietnam War Changes Life For Nha Trang Residents
## 
### DOUG OHMANS 
Nha Trang, Vietnam is a long
way from Stanford. As I put
busy collegiate days between
myself and the eloven weeks I
spent there, my memories of
real people in real situations
yield to flat abstractions.
"How was it?"
"I guess it was fine."
"What did you do?"
"I built garbage bins with
Vietnamese students."
There was mo:re to it than
that. There were new percep
tions, painfully disturbing.
There was the natural beauty
and harmony of a fertile agri
cultural country, overlaid with
frightening social disorganiza
tion. There was the helpless feel
ing that people were losing con
trol over their lives. There were
the problems of international
development and the attempts
at solving them, both immensely
magnified by the war. But these
too are abstractions. So there
was the beach.
Nha Trang facos onto the

South China Sea along several
miles of smooth white beach.
Fishing junks with delicate rag
ged sails move between the
beach and two small off-shore
islands; at night, their lamps
complete the oval of lights be
gun by the streetlights along
the waterfront. Sometimes I
would sit on the beach at night,
within the faint ring of lights,
and watch Vietnamese parents
play with their children before
taking them home to bed.
One end of the beach is fenc
ed off because military supplies
are landed and stockpiled there.
The other end is off-limits to
civilians because it borders on
the Province Headquarters — a
fisherman was killed in August
when he accidentally landed
there. Across the street from
the beach bars, most of the once
luxurious waterfront hotels
have been taken over by the
U.S. Army, for Nha Trang is
the logistics center for Vietnam's
"Region II".
The beach itself is becoming

littered with beer cans and pic
nic scraps. Once I found a live
80-millimeter mortar shell half
buried in the sand; it had been
dumped there accidentally with
a pile of ammunition wrappings.
MP's patrol up and down the
beach in their Jeeps, and Gl's
bring their girls for four-wheel
drive truck rides in the sand.
But sometimes, as on August
25th, the effects of the Ameri
cans on the beach of Vietnam
seemed as disastrous as the ef
fects of the combat itself. That
night I wrote in my journal:
"Two boys at the beach
brought up 'dirty pictures' to
sell — horrible faded photo
graphs of every pervesion imag
inable. We asked them whether
they liked the photos, and one
told us that he didn't, but that
Americans would buy them and
he was helping his family
through financial hard times.
"Three young girls on the
beach shouted, grinned, and
pointed at us. A skinny pri
vate approached them and offer
ed to take them to a 'party*. 'I
give you free cigarettes, beer',
he whined, and couldn't believe
it when they refused. When his
Negro friend approached, two
of the girls scurried laughing
into the water.
"Later, they inexplicably offer
ed us some sugar cane, and sat
down on our towels. They said
they were 19, 20, and 20, but
they looked much younger. One
of them would shout a question
to me in Vietnamese, and when
I couldn't answer, would hit my
leg with a strand of cane and
laugh loudly, incongruously.
They affect a very disturbing
sort of superficial toughness,
and talk quickly of 'Hey you —
boom - boom?' "
The abstractions fall away if
I let them, and I must answer
the questions asked at Tresid
der:
"Well, how was it?"
" I guess it was sad."
"What did you do?"
"What could I do?"
