# Greek Coup Ends Activism
## 
### 
(CPS) — The major student
groups in Greece have been dis
solved by the new military re
gime, and it is believed that
many student leaders are im
prisoned.
The EEFE, the National Un
ion of Greek Students, had been
extremely active in street dem
onstrations supporting the Cen

ter Union party of former Greek
prime minister George Papan
dreou and his son Andreas.
EEFE was controlled by stu
dents representing the left-wing
of Center Union, favoring An
dreas over his more moderate
father. Andreas, a former eco
nomics professor at two Ameri
can universities, had success
fully organized a strong grass
roots movement of support,
built upon his experience as an
organizer in the Stevenson cam
paign of 1952.
Some have called him the first
"twentieth-century Kennedy
style politician" in Greek politi
cal history.
The Center Union leaders
within EEFE are reported op
posed to U.S. foreign policy and
involvement in Greece, but they
are non-Communist. EEFE ad
vocates "democratization and re
form in education."
Financed partly by contribu
tions from the Center Union
party, the group has an inter
national policy of non-alignment
which leads it to retain mem
bership in both the Communist
dominated International Union
of Students (lUS) and the Wes
tern-influenced International Stu
dent Conference (ISC).
