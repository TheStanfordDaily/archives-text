Stanford came up with 9 first
plfeces to Cal's 8 Saturday, but
orfce again lack of depth took
its toll on the Tribe and the
dropped their first Big
Meet since 1961, 76-69.
Athletes on both sides rose to
tlie occasion, as several personal
basts were reached and two
meet Records broken.
Sanford Stars
IATaiV Sanford perhaps turned
inj; the most dramatic perform
ance of the day, winning both
the mile and 2-mile.
After a slow first half in the
mile', lie came back to out-sprint
Bob Price and Larry Houps in
the final 220 and win going
away in 4:07.5. Sanford ran the
last half mile 2:01.5 in improv
iii-ghis best time for the fifth
time this season.

In the 2-mile he and Jim Let
terer ran their best times to
give Stanford a one final chance
at retaining the title. All A 1
needed was a second place in
eight lap event to clinch a vic
tory, and with Bob Price, who
won the event last year, they
seemed to have it in the bag.
But Sanford and Letterer had
different ideas. On the last lap
they sprinted into an ever-wid
ening lead, leaving Price over 8
seconds behind, gasping in their
dust.
Meet Rests on Relay
This left the entire outcome
of the meet resting on the last
event, the mile relay. Cal had
to be the favorite again, as their
time of 3:11.0 was 4 seconds
better than the Indians'.
This time there was no story

book ending. The first three
men, Dave Jones, Jack O'Brien,
and Jim Ward, handed Bud
Walsh a 7 yard deficit. Walsh
pulled even with Cal's anchor
man Paddy McCrary in the
backstretch, but was unable to
sustain it, and Cal won by 3
seconds in 3:11.2.
Ward Takes Two
Jim Ward was also a double
winner for the Tribe. He took
the 440 in 47.7. In the 220 he
won in a photo finish against
Pat Weddle, who was also sec
ond in the quarter. Both run
ners timed in 21.4.
A meet record was broken in
the high jump, as Pete Boyce
upped his school record to 7' 0".
Paddy McCrary set the other
record, running the intermediate
hurdles in 51.2.

Stanford came up with 9 first
plfeces to Cal's 8 Saturday, but
orfce again lack of depth took
its toll on the Tribe and the
dropped their first Big
Meet since 1961, 76-69.
Athletes on both sides rose to
tlie occasion, as several personal
basts were reached and two
meet Records broken.
Sanford Stars
IATaiV Sanford perhaps turned
inj; the most dramatic perform
ance of the day, winning both
the mile and 2-mile.
After a slow first half in the
mile', lie came back to out-sprint
Bob Price and Larry Houps in
the final 220 and win going
away in 4:07.5. Sanford ran the
last half mile 2:01.5 in improv
iii-ghis best time for the fifth
time this season.

In the 2-mile he and Jim Let
terer ran their best times to
give Stanford a one final chance
at retaining the title. All A 1
needed was a second place in
eight lap event to clinch a vic
tory, and with Bob Price, who
won the event last year, they
seemed to have it in the bag.
But Sanford and Letterer had
different ideas. On the last lap
they sprinted into an ever-wid
ening lead, leaving Price over 8
seconds behind, gasping in their
dust.
Meet Rests on Relay
This left the entire outcome
of the meet resting on the last
event, the mile relay. Cal had
to be the favorite again, as their
time of 3:11.0 was 4 seconds
better than the Indians'.
This time there was no story

book ending. The first three
men, Dave Jones, Jack O'Brien,
and Jim Ward, handed Bud
Walsh a 7 yard deficit. Walsh
pulled even with Cal's anchor
man Paddy McCrary in the
backstretch, but was unable to
sustain it, and Cal won by 3
seconds in 3:11.2.
Ward Takes Two
Jim Ward was also a double
winner for the Tribe. He took
the 440 in 47.7. In the 220 he
won in a photo finish against
Pat Weddle, who was also sec
ond in the quarter. Both run
ners timed in 21.4.
A meet record was broken in
the high jump, as Pete Boyce
upped his school record to 7' 0".
Paddy McCrary set the other
record, running the intermediate
hurdles in 51.2.
