The once-threatened ice cream and
cotton candy hawkers are gone from
White Plaza, as are the balloon sellers
and, lamentably, the festive atmo
sphere which pervaded it last week.
Con Home Week, which opened with
the Hydrofillies and ended yesterday
afternoon with a concert in Frost
Amphitheatre, is over for another
year.
What continues, of course, as it has
since 1919, is the work of the Stanford
Children's Convalescent Hospital. Pri
marily because none of its more than
7000 patients has ever been turned
away for financial reasons, the hos
pital counts heavily on donations. Con
Home Week originated from and has
been perpetuated by the desire of
Stanford students to play an active
role in sustaining the work of the
hospital. The Convalescent Hospital
provides long-term rehabilitative care
for children of the community suf
fering from serious chronic disease
or physical disabilities.
Cardinals Board oversees the week's
activities, mainly by encouraging the
various living groups to sponsor a
money-raising event or concession.
The living group which succeeds in
raising the most money during the
week receives the services of several
professors serving as hashers for a
meal. Consequently the week becomes
something of a contest to see which
living group can think of the most
effective way to make parting with
one's money painless. The process
may not be as aesthetically pleasing
as outright donations, but it's a lot
more fun and gets results.
King And Queen
The Con Home King and Queen
contest which ran all week placed
Mary Murphy Freelen, the adopted
daughter of the boys in Stern Hall,
alongside the Delta Chi dog Oscar on
the royal dais. Both the King and
Queen were crowned at the Con Home
Carnival held at Searsville last Fri
day.
Lathrop and Gavilan houses each
sponsored a dance, and the Roble
hashers provided a car to smash at
10 cents a whack. Toyon was the
scene of an all-campus dance held
by the eating clubs on Friday night.
Undoubtedly the most arduous fund
raising event was the Second Annual
Wilbur Bicycle Race held Saturday
afternoon. The winning team from
