HOW TO GET A S
IN ALL YOUR FINAL EXAMS
In today's column, the last of the school year, I don't
intend to be funny. (I have achieved this objective many
times throughout the year, but this time it's on purpose.)
The hour is wrong for levity. Final exams are looming.
Have you got a chance? I say yes! I say America did
not become the world's foremost producer of stove bolts
and cotter pins by running away from a fight!
You will pass your finals! How ? By studying. How ? By
learning mnemonics.
Mnemonics, the science of memory aids, was, as we all
know, invented by the great Greek philosopher Mnemon
in 526 B.C. (This, incidentally, was only one of the inven
tions of this fertile Athenian. He also invented the house
cat, the opposing thumb, and, most important, the stair
case. Before the staircase people were forced willy-nilly
to live out their lives on the ground floor, and many grew
cross as bears. Especially Demosthenes who was elected
Consul of Athens six times but never served because he
was unable to get up to the office of the Commissioner of
Oaths on the third floor to be sworn in. But after Mnemon's
staircase, Demosthenes got to the third floor easy as pie
—to Athens' sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes, his
temper shortened by years of confinement to the ground
floor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of sense
less wars with the Medes, the Persians, and the Los
Angeles Rams. This later became known as the Missouri
Compromise.)

But I digress. We were discussing mnemonics, which
are nothing more than aids to memory-little jingles to
help you remember names, dates, and places. For example:
Columbus sailed the ocean blue
In fourteen hundred ninety two.
See how simple? Make up your own jingles. What, for
instance, came after Columbus's discovery of America?
The Boston Tea Party, of course. Try this:
Samuel Adams fiang the tea
Into the briny Zuyder Zee.
(NOTE: The Zuyder Zee was located in Boston Harbor
until 1801 when Salmon P. Chase traded it to Holland for
Alaska and two line backers.)
But I digress. Let's get back to mnemonics. Like this:
In nineteen hundred sixty seven
Personna Blades make shaving heaven.
I mention Personna because the makers of Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades are the sponsors of this
column. If I may get a little misty in this, the final coiumn
of the school year, may I say it's been a pleasure working
for Personna? May 1 say further that it's been an even
greater pleasure working for you, the undergrads of
America? You've been a most satisfactory audience, and
I'm going to miss you this summer. In fact, I'd ask you
all to come visit me except there is no access to my room.
The makers of Personna, after I missed several deadlines,
walled me in. I have no doors or windows—only a mail slot.
I slip the columns out; they slip in Personnas and such
food as can go through a mail slot. (For the past six
months I've been living on after dinner mints.)
I am only having my little joke. The makers of Personna
have not walled me in, for they are good and true and
gleaming and constant —as good and true and gleaming
and constant as the blades they make—and I wish to state
publicly that I will always hold them in the highest esteem,
no matter how my suit for back wages comes out.
And so, to close the year, I give you one last mnemonic:
Study hard and pass with honors,
And always shave with good Personnors!
