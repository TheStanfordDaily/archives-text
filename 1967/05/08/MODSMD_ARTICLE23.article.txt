# Tribe Explosion Routs Bears
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
The Stanford baseball team,
sparked by the Mutt and-Jeff
battery of Rod Poteete and Mike
Schomaker, clobbered the Cali
fornia Bears on Saturday by the
score of 10-2.
The victory raised the Tribe
conference record to 6-1, and
strengthened their rather pre
carious position atop the Pac-8
heap.
Perfect Relief
Poteete, who stands a Mutt
like 6-7, turned in a nearly per
fect relief job. Staff ace Sandy
Vance started the contest, but
was removed after five innings,
in which he gave up two runs.
Vance's sore arm is still a ques
tion mark, and Coach Fehring
apparently did not want to risk
overworking him.
Poteete came on in the sixth,
and gave up a single to the first
batter he faced. He erased the
runner a moment later by snar
ing a vicious line drive and toss
ing to first baseman Mark Mar
quess for the double play.
Thereafter, the herky-jerky
right-hander allowed no base
runners and only two balls out
of the infieild.
Amazing Control
Poteete's control was amaz
ing. In the four innings he
worked, he threw just fourteen
pitches that were out of the
strike zone. He even punched

out a two-run double in the sixth
to put the game out of reach
and ensure his first victory of
the season.
Schomaker's Homer
Catcher Mike Schomaker, who
stands ten inches shorter than
his battery mate, also had an
excellent day. In the first inning,
he slammed a two-run homer,
and then in the third, missed
another round-tripper by inches,
having to settle for a double.
He also played well defensivly,
shaking off a knuckle-busting
foul tip in the third to throw
out one runner stealing and pick
another off first.
Eight In Last Two
The Indians broke up a tight
2-2 ball game by putting across
eight runs in the last three
innings. Jeff Rohlfing, Bill Holt,
and Russ Tweet all rapped run
producing singles, while Dick
Swan pitched in with a two-run
homer. Bob Leatherwood also
had a four-bagger for the losers.
Stanford has six conference
games remaining, all with what
should be whitemeat. Next
weekend, the Tribe travels north
for back-to-back doubleheaders
with Washington State (2-6) and
Washington (0-7).
The finale is a home-and-home
series with Cal (2-8). Victories
in all of these games would
clinch the Pac-8 crown and earn
a trip to the NCAA playoffs.
