# Card Netters Top Ducks, Ruin Beaver Win Streak
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
regrouped after the state cham
pionships to gain two victories
in Oregon last weekend, blast
ing Oregon 7-2, and Oregon
State 6-3.
Friday, against Oregon, only
number one Brian Leek and
number five Chuck Alloo lost in
singles matches. Craig Baise,
Dean Schlobohm, Dale Wong,
and John McCabe all won in
singles and doubles.
The previously undefeated
Beavers from Oregon State met
the steadily improving Cards
Saturday and could not with
stand the onslaught. Leek again
lost in singles and doubles, and
McCabe also fell in singles.

The key action Saturday came
when Craig Baise fell behind
40-15 while losing 5-2 in the third
set. He then rallied for a 7-5
win to put the Tribe into a de
cisive 4-2 match lead.
