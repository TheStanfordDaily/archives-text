## Sh! 'In-Crowd' At Work 
### Steve Gruber 
Editor Hank Linotype was
worried. "Suppose they find
out?" he asked the rest of The
Daily staffers gathered around
him at the Editorial Board meet
ing.
"They won't," Patrick Hot
type, assistant to the Editorial
Director, answered.
"But they nearly found out
last time," Linotype replied,
"and almost blew our chances
to elect the student body presi
dent."
"Keep cool, boss," Jim Maga
zine told him. "When you're in
with the in-crowd, you're out of
sight."
"That's fine, Jim, but the Elec
tions for Free Students (EFS)
saw us," Linotype reminded the
group. "Next thing they'll find
out about the CIA money that
we get from the Chi Beta house
and the Groove Project."
"We've been getting it for five
years now and nobody has found
out yet," Hot-type said. "So
what?"
"Well, that doesn't really mat
ter, but the EFS better not know
about our next project — and
that's why I called the Editorial
Board meeting today," Linotype
said.
Presidential Project
Maggie McSlander, managing
editoress, suddenly woke up
from her half-slumber. "You
mc?an the Presidential Project,
Chief?"
"That's right. Now that Presi
dent Tarnished has decided to
retire, we have a big job ahead
of us.
"But first, let me tell you

some of the history of this proj
ect. Stanford's next president
won't be the first to be chosen
by The Daily."
"You mean we selected Tar
nished too?" Magazine was as
tonished.
"Better believe it. Not only
that, we picked out David Starr
Israel, Stanford's first presi
dent," Linotype answered.
Impossible?
"Hold it, chief," Miss McSland
er retorted. "How could we have
picked Israel? He was president
before there ever was a Dally.
What's more, he was Leland
Stanford's personal choice. I'm
sorry, Chief, but we couldn't
have possibly chosen Stanford's
first president."
"I wouldn't bet on that if I
were you," Linotype said. He
opened his desk and started
searching through the files, hum
ming the "In-Crowd."
"Catchy little tune you're
humming, boss," Magazine com
mented. "What's its name?"
"Something about a crowd,
two's a crowd or something like
that," Linotype said. "I heard
it on KZSU." Suddenly he pulled
out a file marked "CIA" and laid
it on top of his desk.
"OK, just look at this CIA
file dated September 2, 1890.
Read it to them, Hot-type."
Hot-type started reading, "In
conjunction with The Stanford
Daily (Code Name Dutch Goose)
the Central Intelligence Agency
has paid Senator Leland Stan
ford the sum of $50 million (in
small unmarked bills) to en
courage him to select David

Starr Israel as Stanford's first
president."
The Editorial Board was stun
ned.
"Now do you see why having
The Daily select the student
body president is such a bush
league matter?" Linotype said.
"We do that every year. But
this year we'll have to find a
new University president too."
"How do you want to do it,
boss?" Magazine asked, popping
an LSD-coated sunflower seed
into his mouth.
"We're going to do it differ
ently this year," Linotype said.
"Instead of having the Board of
Trustees vote, we're going to let
the entire student body vote."
"You pays your money, you
takes your choice, right, Chief?"
Miss McSlander added.
"Right. Next fall, instead of
having the red-hot prof contest,
we'll have a red-hot president
contest. We'll send out invita
tions to everybody — you know,
Clark Kerr, John Gardner —
just everybody. Each candidate
will have a chance to lead a yell
at Big Game to prove his leader
ship abilities. And votes will be
a penny each."
"Wait a minute, boss," Maga
zine said. "If votes are a penny
each and if we get our usual
$100 million allottment from the
CIA, the Tlie Daily will have ten
billion votes. And if The Daily
has ten billion votes, nobody
can possible outvote us."
Linotype's only response was
to continue humming that
catchy tune, something about
an in-crowd.
