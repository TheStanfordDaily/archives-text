## 'Goodman's Position Unclear' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have felt compelled to reply
to Mr. Goodman's vitriolic at
tack on various institutions
which I hold dear. In so doing,
I am of course assuming that
"debate" on the Vietnamese
question is still permissible.
This, if only because Goodman's
words can serve only to dis
mantle, disrupt, and destroy. He
has offered us no constructive
alternatives.
Goodman's position is any
thing but clear. Is he calling for
an end to debate? One would
think not, since it is presumed
his letter was intended to com
municate his ideas to others. Is
he proposing action instead of
words? What action, Mr. Good
man? You have described us as
being "a frightened people,
frightened and cowardly." Yet
our nation has acted (to your
chagrin, obviously, but action
nonetheless). Tell us what ac
tion you, who by implication
are not frightened and cowardly,
would propose.
No, I think Mr. Goodman
would more willingly continue
to discuss. His issue lies, most
probably, not with debate as an
institution, but rather with the
characterization of past debate
as "responsible." We do not
speak with "kindness, charity,
or compassion." One need only
read his letter for an example of
the role these noble attributes
are to play in discussion as he
defines it. Thus our Senate is
"emasculated," our President is
"militaristic" — a "quasi-dic
tator;" and we are "a dishonored
people."
Speculation
I don't believe it, Mr. Good
man. Not when you must resort
to speculation, half truth, and
innuendo to state your case.
This is the fabric of your whole
argument. You have suggested
that "almost the whole of the
literate, thoughtful community
in this country" feels as you do
about the war. How have you
been able to determine that?
Are we bound to define "liter
ate" and "thoughtful" as you
do? Are we being asked to be
lieve that the 20-or-so Senators
who see tilings your way are
enlightened, while the other 80
are not?
And granting, for argument's
sake, it is true that 50,000 civil
ians are being killed in S. Viet
nam each year, are we to under
stand that only Americans are
taking lives? Have you consid
ered the hundreds of thousands
who receive shelter and protec
tion at our hands? Must we join
you in conjuring up a casualty
list five times as large? Should
we, too, doubt the existence of
a Tonkin incident because there
were no American injuries?
I don't believe it, Mr. Good
man, despite your assumption
the we alone make and use
napalm. I wonder if beheading,
or dying from infection caused
by a punje stake smeared with
excrement, is more desirable
I wonder if the S. Vietnamese
civilian, killed in a movie thea
ter by a V.C. claymore mine, is
less to be mourned than a guer
illa who falls victim to a frag
mentation bomb. I wonder if you
can produce one documented
case of starvation in S. Vietnam
to justify your concern for the
destruction of crops.
Race War
I especially don't believe that
this is a race war. How does one
explain the participation of the
Koreans, the Filipinos, and the
Thais? Are the S. Vietnamese,
whose forces in the field far out
number our own, also guilty of
genocide? Perhaps we should
never have fought against Ja
pan. Or, using your tortuous
logic, perhaps we should have
let the South secede from the
Union. Racial problems were
certainly more in evidence in
that war than they are in the
present Vietnamese conflict. In
deed, the only element of racism
I have noticed is that, which
stems from suggestions such as
yours.
What do I believe, Mr. Good
man? I believe we are an hon
orable nation. As a private citi
zen and a veteran of the con
flict, I feel no shame for our
actions. I am especially thankful
that debate on our policy is pos
sible. It is possible, Mr. Good

man, whatever you might think
to the contrary.
PETER P. MILLER
• Justifiable —
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Professor No
vak's letter of April 18, I would
like to make some comments.
He claims that "the task of the
university ... is not to scream
out any one position loud and
clear." Then immediately he
states its job is "... to remind
this nation how sticky and
mossy this war in Vietnam is;
above all, how morally contra
dictory it is . . and that we
are ". . . in a war in which our
own nation is in violation of
every relevant law and treaty, in
a war of ambivalent political
purposes." It seems to me that
this statement is awfully one
sided, so it appears that Profes
sor Novak has contradicted him
self.
Professor Novak also claims
that Vietnam is just one coun
try, as evidence that the U.S.
is the "invader.' While technic
ally he may be rights it is
one country, he is ignoring the
facts; that this single nation has
two distinct capitals w h ic h
house two opposing govern
ments with two different rulers
that adopt two opposite ideolo
gies. Logically, Professor Novak
should also classify North and
South Korea, and East and West
Germany as single countries.
He also asserts that he can
find nothing for North Vietnam
to negotiate. For some reason,
he has forgotten the U.S.'s offer
to halt the bombing if North
Vietnam would stop infiltration
of the South. This issue seems
sufficient basis on which to cen
ter negotiations.
Solution
According to Professor No
vak, the solution to Vietnam is
to get out and let the Viet
namese settle their own prob
lems. He feels that "Marxists"
from the N.L.F. should be in
cluded in any future govern
ment, and "perhaps eventually a
Marxist-oriented, reunited North
and South" would be formed. In
stead of using the word "Marx
ist," why not just use the more
accurate term "communist," and
say that there may be a com
munist Vietnam?
But, no matter what happens,
he believes that it "is a problem
for the people of Vietnam to
work out.' Realistically, such a
statement is to say that we
should let the communist North

Vietnamese take over South
Vietnam, because I really don't
think Professor Novak is so
naive as to believe that the
North Vietnamese and the V.C.
would stop their infiltration of
the South if we pulled out. Sure
ly, they would continue virtually
unresisted, and North and South
Vietnam would eventually be
come communist as Novak rec
ognizes may happen.
If Professor Novak admits
that if the U.S. pulls out, North
and South Vietnam might be
come communist, I can't see
how he can then state that he
doesn't think we are fighting
for the freedom of South Viet
nam. Of course, if he feels that
people under a communist re
gime have freedom as we know
it, then his position is under
standable, although I would
think him terribly mistaken.
Religion
Since he is a professor of re
ligion, I wonder if Professor No
vak has ever given any thought
as to what would happen to the
several million devout Catholics
and Buddhists that live in South
Vietnam if it went communist.
I'm sure he is aware of the fact
that communism is totally athe
istic in nature, and that a united,
Communist Vietnam would
never allow religious freedom.
Would he not feel just a little
bit guilty for encouraging his
country to allow these people
to fall into communist hands?
Professor Novak feels that the
the U.S. is wrong and that North
Vietnam is right, and cites our
"terrible" techniques of carry
ing out the war. As is the usual
case of those opposing the war,
he fails to mention anything
wrong about the other side.
What about the V.C. terrorism
in Saigon that usually kills more
innocent civilians than U.S.
soldiers? How about the kid
napping and murdering of
newly-elected representatives?
Of course, we are reminded that
such things are perhaps justifi
able since North Vietnam is car
rying out a "war of liberation"
against the "imperialist United
States."
