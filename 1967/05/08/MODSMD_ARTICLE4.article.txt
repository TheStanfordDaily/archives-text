# Brewster: Student Power Dangerous To Academics
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Kingman Brewster, President of
Yale, yesterday defined and discussed
academic freedom, defending it
against, in his view, threatening
forces such as HUAC and "student
syndicalists."
Delivering this year*! first Harry
Camp Memorial Lecture, "The Aca
demic Process: The Individual" before
a sparse audience in Memorial Audi
torium, Brewster stated, "It is not
fortuitous that the students pay to
learn and the faculty is paid to teach.
The child is not yet father of the
man in terms of complete awareness
of the demands and potentialities of
either the most ancient or the
most speculatively modern fields of
thought."
While arguing for "wide latitude
for individual timing and selection of
particular courses," Brewster noted,
"this is a long, long way from the
vision of student-designed courses
which has been portrayed as the ob
jective of some of the shrill minority
of self-styled syndicalists."
On the right of faculty to make
tenure decisions, an issue which re
cently evoked mass student dissent
at Yale, Brewster said, "It is arrant
nonsense for a faculty to assert that
opinion should be suppressed or ig
nored. But it is even more arrogant
nonsense for students to assert that
their opinions should be determina
tive."
Against Student Power
Differentiating between the place
of student initiative in schools, col
leges, and universities, Brewster
noted, "In the case of a university,
student power to dictate academic
matters whould be wholly destructive
of the enterprise."
Widening the scope of his attack,
Brewster stated that universities also
must be leary, "of catering to corpor
ate or government pleas to solve an
immediate business or official prob
lem."
Brewster began his talk, which was
competing with the Jefferson Air
plane performing in Frost Amphi
theater at the same time, by defining
his philosophical basis for believing
in the primacy of academic freedom.
He said, "There is no human dig

nity without the risk of self-blame
for failure or the risk of self-satis
faction in success." He developed this
idea by saying, "Dignity requires the
fact and the feeling of a large mea
sure of individual self-determina
tion."
Bringing it into the focus of a uni
versity, Brewster lamented, "petulent
table-pounding arrogance, which can
not stand rational debate," saying, it
is "no match for the serenity of a
mind unafraid of serious question
and gleefully scornful of the false
threat of the outlandish."
Function of Academic Freedom
In sum, he said, "The educational
function of academic freedom is to
permit convincing intellectual self
determination."
Brewster pointed out several areas
in which academic freedom becomes
unpopular. "Alumni and boards of
regents and legislators find academic
freedom most discomforting in the
social sciences. But the study of hu
man behavior, of institutions, of the
economy, of the political system it
self would contribute little to social
progress and attract no one of dis
tinction to its pursuit if it were not
fair game to start afresh, question
ing the inherited assumptions, how
ever dearly espoused by established
and powerful groups."
Brewster went on to cite "freedom
to teach as one sees fit" and "freedom
to invite whomever you want to speak
on campus" as other areas where aca
demic freedom plays a central role.
Finally, he reached the area of
threats to intellectual self-determin
ation. On HUAC he said, "When even
a duly constituted legislative body
purports to seek information about
the politics of faculty or students,
as the House Un-American Activities
Committee has done from time to
time, it is clear that every effort
should be made to dissuade the in
quiry or to exhaust constitutional
grounds for resisting it."
Threats From Within
Brewster next turned to threats
that come from within the university.
The first he described as "the inten
tional resort to disruption as a tech
nique of protest and of action." He
claimed that people who use this

tactic should be banished, adding such
banishment should come only after
careful examination and the estab
lishment of "objective proof of the
willfullness of destructive purpose."
An even greater challenge to aca
demic freedom, Brewster said, "is the
widespread resort to disruption as a
technique for calling attention to a
deeply felt sense of injustice."
He explained how, many times, a
disruptive protest is unrelated to the
activity which it seeks to disrupt. He
added, though, that "if the opportun
ity for expression has been thwarted,
then the resort to alternative, dis-

ruptive ways of attracting attention
to an alleged wrong is very hard to
complain about."
Brewster continued by discussing
"student syndicalism" and went on to
say that demands for the topical relev
ance of a curriculum should not be
catered to.
Brewster's next two lectures will be
given in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, one
on Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. and the other
on Thursday at 4:15 p.m. These will
be entitled, "The Academic Process:
The Institution," and"The Academic
Process: The State."
