# Politics In The Experiment: Asset Or Albatross?
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
In the recent controversy that has been
raging over the politico-educational nature of
The Experiment, two of the most heated is
sues have been the diversity or lack of it
within the group and its rights to LASSU
subsidies.
Can the political be separated from the edu
cational? Not according to most Experiment
members. "I see political action as basic to
human life,"- commented Janet Marx, Ex
periment member and former leader of the
OFF movement.
Roger Magnuson of the Committee for Re
sponsible Debate agreed that "if you divorce
politics from The Experiment, it would de
feat its purpose."
Taking an opposing stand are Bob Clark
and John Lucas, officers in Young Republi
cans, who stated, "We don't think that in
giving up its political activities it will neces
sarily lose its educational value."
Dean of Students Joel Smith remarked,
"The political and educational objectives of
The Experiment seem to me to be contradic
tory. Education should be conducted in a cli
mate of free inquiry."
Is The Experiment's single-minded image,
largely a product of the "We Accuse" posters,
the reflection of a single-minded group? No

one inside The Experiment and few outside
who have taken more than a passing interest
in it, deny its diversity.
"There is no complete unanimity of view
point, so nobody expects you to agree with
him," as one Experiment member remarked.
"You have diversity here because there are
no norms, there is no precedent, and you
must expose yourself to all possibilities," com
mented Penny Hartley, another member.
As many members are quick to point out,
the "We Accuse" posters were made by no
more than five per cent of the group, and drew
much criticism from within for both the
means and ends involved.
The members accuse people outside of the
movement of being afraid to look into The
Experiment because they may have views
challenged. As one member said, "We're will
ing to talk with others. They're not willing to
talk with us."

While admitting its diversity, Lucas and
Walker point out that it is not representative,
an important distinction, they believe, in re
gard to its bid for LASSIJ funds. Futhermore,
they maintain, The Experiment does not at
tempt to project a well-balanced image. The
foyer, said one, is covered with "New Left"
posters. "If I had walked into The Expert

ment not knowing anything about it, I would
feel that it was very one-sided."
The members of The Experiment are not
interested in displaying their diversity to the
public, since they do not actively recruit mem
bers. They merely hope than anyone in the
group who does wish to make his beliefs
known can do so.
Experiment Provides Entertainment
Why do people join The Experiment and
what, if anything, do they have in common?
The answers vary widely. Some say it pro
vides entertainment: social functions, discus
sions and poetry readings. Others join simply
to attend seminars on subjects not offered
by the University.
But one of the most frequent and signifi
cant reasons offered is The Experiment com
munity, where people can recreate and study
together. Within this group they feel a "free
dom to juggle ideas without committing one
self to any one of them."
The tolerance for one another's beliefs is
very important to the members, yet the im
age which The Experiment presents is quite
the opposite. The people in The Experiment
attribute this image partly to the fact that
they are not a representative group, but
mostly to the generalizing tendencies of out
siders.

As one member remarked, "I don't see any
'we' or 'they' — it's the people outside who
draw the distinction."
LASSU Subsidies
It is precisely this distinction, especially
on political grounds, on which people base
their objections to LASSU's subsidizing of The
Experiment. Many maintain that, for any
group to justify LASSU support and Uni
versity housing, it must be representative.
Yet The Experiment makes no effort to be
representative and few pretend that it is.
Its members maintain that its openness is
all the justification it needs for being sub
sidizied.
Thus here, as in most central issues of
The Experiment controversy, one senses that
there is no "right" viewpoint; the real dis
pute, usually ignored, is over the premises un
derlying each viewpoint.
Few people interviewed within or without
The Exepriment seem to have examined why
they hold the basic beliefs they do or the
validity of others'. As a result, most remarks
about the other's position miss the point,
since they are argued from different premises.
Lack of Organization
In another example related to finances,
some outsiders object to a lack of organiza
tional structure within The Experiment, on

the grounds that its finances can be controlled
by an active minority. This does not concern
its members, however, who believe that Barry
Greenberg, coordinator of The Experiment, is
capable of making sound financial decisions.
Under the current system, each individual
can act freely and without the majority's con
sent and this, to them, is good. Thus the real
issue is not the soundness of The Experi
ment's structure, but the criteria for judging
soundness.
Some object to financing The Experiment
because of its political use of funds. In fact,
however, none of its winter quarter budget
and only $50 of its $3300 spring quarter bud
get went to political uses other than Resis
tance.
This, like any other political publication by
a campus group, is entitled to University
funds. Thus far Resistance has depended on
membership fees rather the University's Pub
lications Board funds.
No matter which side one takes in the
above issues, it is imperative that he not set
himself so far from the other side as to mis
understand its beliefs. Breakdown of sincere
attempts at self-criticism and communications
will undoubtedly keep The Experiment con
troversy burning with much heat but little
light.

group who does wish to make his beliefs
known can do so.
Experiment Provides Entertainment
Why do people join The Experiment and
what, if anything, do they have in common?
The answers vary widely. Some say it pro
vides entertainment: social functions, discus
sions and poetry readings. Others join simply
to attend seminars on subjects not offered
by the University.
But one of the most frequent and signifi
cant reasons offered is The Experiment com
munity, where people can recreate and study
together. Within this group they feel a "free
dom to juggle ideas without committing one
self to any one of them."
The tolerance for one another's beliefs is
very important to the members, yet the im
age which The Experiment presents is quite
the opposite. The people in The Experiment
attribute this image partly to the fact that
they are not a representative group, but
mostly to the generalizing tendencies of out
siders.

As one member remarked, "I don't see any
'we' or 'they' — it's the people outside who
draw the distinction."
LASSU Subsidies
It is precisely this distinction, especially
on political grounds, on which people base
their objections to LASSU's subsidizing of The
Experiment. Many maintain that, for any
group to justify LASSU support and Uni
versity housing, it must be representative.
Yet The Experiment makes no effort to be
representative and few pretend that it is.
Its members maintain that its openness is
all the justification it needs for being sub
sidizied.
Thus here, as in most central issues of
The Experiment controversy, one senses that
there is no "right" viewpoint; the real dis
pute, usually ignored, is over the premises un
derlying each viewpoint.
Few people interviewed within or without
The Exepriment seem to have examined why
they hold the basic beliefs they do or the
validity of others'. As a result, most remarks
about the other's position miss the point,
since they are argued from different premises.
Lack of Organization
In another example related to finances,
some outsiders object to a lack of organiza
tional structure within The Experiment, on

the grounds that its finances can be controlled
by an active minority. This does not concern
its members, however, who believe that Barry
Greenberg, coordinator of The Experiment, is
capable of making sound financial decisions.
Under the current system, each individual
can act freely and without the majority's con
sent and this, to them, is good. Thus the real
issue is not the soundness of The Experi
ment's structure, but the criteria for judging
soundness.
Some object to financing The Experiment
because of its political use of funds. In fact,
however, none of its winter quarter budget
and only $50 of its $3300 spring quarter bud
get went to political uses other than Resis
tance.
This, like any other political publication by
a campus group, is entitled to University
funds. Thus far Resistance has depended on
membership fees rather the University's Pub
lications Board funds.
No matter which side one takes in the
above issues, it is imperative that he not set
himself so far from the other side as to mis
understand its beliefs. Breakdown of sincere
attempts at self-criticism and communications
will undoubtedly keep The Experiment con
troversy burning with much heat but little
light.
In the recent controversy that has been
raging over the politico-educational nature of
The Experiment, two of the most heated is
sues have been the diversity or lack of it
within the group and its rights to LASSU
subsidies.
Can the political be separated from the edu
cational? Not according to most Experiment
members. "I see political action as basic to
human life,"- commented Janet Marx, Ex
periment member and former leader of the
OFF movement.
Roger Magnuson of the Committee for Re
sponsible Debate agreed that "if you divorce
politics from The Experiment, it would de
feat its purpose."
Taking an opposing stand are Bob Clark
and John Lucas, officers in Young Republi
cans, who stated, "We don't think that in
giving up its political activities it will neces
sarily lose its educational value."
Dean of Students Joel Smith remarked,
"The political and educational objectives of
The Experiment seem to me to be contradic
tory. Education should be conducted in a cli
mate of free inquiry."
Is The Experiment's single-minded image,
largely a product of the "We Accuse" posters,
the reflection of a single-minded group? No

one inside The Experiment and few outside
who have taken more than a passing interest
in it, deny its diversity.
"There is no complete unanimity of view
point, so nobody expects you to agree with
him," as one Experiment member remarked.
"You have diversity here because there are
no norms, there is no precedent, and you
must expose yourself to all possibilities," com
mented Penny Hartley, another member.
As many members are quick to point out,
the "We Accuse" posters were made by no
more than five per cent of the group, and drew
much criticism from within for both the
means and ends involved.
The members accuse people outside of the
movement of being afraid to look into The
Experiment because they may have views
challenged. As one member said, "We're will
ing to talk with others. They're not willing to
talk with us."

While admitting its diversity, Lucas and
Walker point out that it is not representative,

because of its political use of funds. In fact,
however, none of its winter quarter budget
and only $50 of its $3300 spring quarter bud
get went to political uses other than Resis
tance.
This, like any other political publication by
a campus group, is entitled to University
funds. Thus far Resistance has depended on
membership fees rather the University's Pub
lications Board funds.
No matter which side one takes in the
above issues, it is imperative that he not set
himself so far from the other side as to mis
understand its beliefs. Breakdown of sincere
attempts at self-criticism and communications
will undoubtedly keep The Experiment con
troversy burning with much heat but little
light.
In the recent controversy that has been
raging over the politico-educational nature of
The Experiment, two of the most heated is
sues have been the diversity or lack of it
within the group and its rights to LASSU
subsidies.
Can the political be separated from the edu
cational? Not according to most Experiment
members. "I see political action as basic to
human life,"- commented Janet Marx, Ex
periment member and former leader of the
OFF movement.
Roger Magnuson of the Committee for Re
sponsible Debate agreed that "if you divorce
politics from The Experiment, it would de
feat its purpose."
Taking an opposing stand are Bob Clark
and John Lucas, officers in Young Republi
cans, who stated, "We don't think that in
giving up its political activities it will neces
sarily lose its educational value."
Dean of Students Joel Smith remarked,
"The political and educational objectives of
The Experiment seem to me to be contradic
tory. Education should be conducted in a cli
mate of free inquiry."
Is The Experiment's single-minded image,
largely a product of the "We Accuse" posters,
the reflection of a single-minded group? No

one inside The Experiment and few outside
who have taken more than a passing interest
in it, deny its diversity.
"There is no complete unanimity of view
point, so nobody expects you to agree with
him," as one Experiment member remarked.
"You have diversity here because there are
no norms, there is no precedent, and you
must expose yourself to all possibilities," com
mented Penny Hartley, another member.
As many members are quick to point out,
the "We Accuse" posters were made by no
more than five per cent of the group, and drew
much criticism from within for both the
means and ends involved.
The members accuse people outside of the
movement of being afraid to look into The
Experiment because they may have views
challenged. As one member said, "We're will
ing to talk with others. They're not willing to
talk with us."
Lacks lie presentation
While admitting its diversity, Lucas and
Walker point out that it is not representative,
an important distinction, they believe, in re
gard to its bid for LASSIJ funds. Futhermore,
they maintain, The Experiment does not at
tempt to project a well-balanced image. The
foyer, said one, is covered with "New Left"
posters. "If I had walked into The Expert

ment not knowing anything about it, I would
feel that it was very one-sided."
The members of The Experiment are not
interested in displaying their diversity to the
public, since they do not actively recruit mem
bers. They merely hope than anyone in the
group who does wish to make his beliefs
known can do so.
Experiment Provides Entertainment
Why do people join The Experiment and
what, if anything, do they have in common?
The answers vary widely. Some say it pro
vides entertainment: social functions, discus
sions and poetry readings. Others join simply
to attend seminars on subjects not offered
by the University.
But one of the most frequent and signifi
cant reasons offered is The Experiment com
munity, where people can recreate and study
together. Within this group they feel a "free
dom to juggle ideas without committing one
self to any one of them."
The tolerance for one another's beliefs is
very important to the members, yet the im
age which The Experiment presents is quite
the opposite. The people in The Experiment
attribute this image partly to the fact that
they are not a representative group, but
mostly to the generalizing tendencies of out
siders.

As one member remarked, "I don't see any
'we' or 'they' — it's the people outside who
draw the distinction."
LASSU Subsidies
It is precisely this distinction, especially
on political grounds, on which people base
their objections to LASSU's subsidizing of The
Experiment. Many maintain that, for any
group to justify LASSU support and Uni
versity housing, it must be representative.
Yet The Experiment makes no effort to be
representative and few pretend that it is.
Its members maintain that its openness is
all the justification it needs for being sub
sidizied.
Thus here, as in most central issues of
The Experiment controversy, one senses that
there is no "right" viewpoint; the real dis
pute, usually ignored, is over the premises un
derlying each viewpoint.
Few people interviewed within or without
The Exepriment seem to have examined why
they hold the basic beliefs they do or the
validity of others'. As a result, most remarks
about the other's position miss the point,
since they are argued from different premises.
Lack of Organization
In another example related to finances,
some outsiders object to a lack of organiza
tional structure within The Experiment, on

the grounds that its finances can be controlled
by an active minority. This does not concern
its members, however, who believe that Barry
Greenberg, coordinator of The Experiment, is
capable of making sound financial decisions.
Under the current system, each individual
can act freely and without the majority's con
sent and this, to them, is good. Thus the real
issue is not the soundness of The Experi
ment's structure, but the criteria for judging
soundness.
