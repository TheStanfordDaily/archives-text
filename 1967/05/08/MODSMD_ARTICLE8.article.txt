# 'Funny' Casino Royale Traditional Bond Spoof
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Showing at the Guild, Menlo
Park, Casino Royale is a good
value for your money. Feld
man's spoof-on-truth features a
farrago of the ten lan Fleming
novels and the three to date Eon
movies starring Sean Hirsute
Connery as the twentieth cen
tury Odysseus.
For Bond is no more and no
less than every culture's frac
tionally larger than life contem
porary hero. Odysseus, "Ulys
ses" in Rome and Dublin, is
the Homeric parallel.
The Renaissance Orlando saga
features the noble seducer all
over again. Even Don Giovanni
in the Spanish legend is a Bond
hero. It is nice to see Penelope
and Angelique as Miss Money
penny, and Royale hints at all
this and more.
One of the reasons why
American audiences have gen
erally disapproved Casino Roy
ale may, I believe, be found in
the fact that Pox Americana
gets the lash all through it. The
story pokes a constant left
right-left at the Yankee self im
age. A dove flies out of Le Chi
ffre's card trick; but a moment
later he has lost fifty million
at Baccarat — paper money, of
course.
Redskin hoodlums ride out
from some handy buttes and res
cue English Intelligence from
a nefarious plot to explode Bond.
In the ensuing slapstick, (never
far from American T.V. cliches)
all the stars (Woody Allen, Pet
er Sellers, Orson Welles, Ursula
Undress, Peter O'What?) shift
dimensions to Paradise.
Now, in case Creative Writ
ing programs have not made it
plain to the general reader, lan
Fleming is both a spy and a lit
erary talent. Was, rather. The
gambling section in his novel is

indubitably one of the finer
things that the English short
story has produced. There is an
other short story called Quan
tum Of Solace, in the For Your
Eyes Only collection, which
might have been written by
Chekhov.
This literary flavor the film
clearly abandons. Instead you
have a vast parody of the whole
Bond myth; posh brand names,
bustful women, fetishistic sex
symbols and the tender aberra
tions of diplomats.
The source for the spoof, un
acknowledge, is in a little piece
Cyril Connolly composed for the
London Sunday Times many
moons ago. It can be found in
Previous Convictions, under
"Paging Mr. Smartiboots, "Bond
Strikes Camp."
Connolly's spoof sets up M.
as the deviant admirer of 007.
He tells James to dress as a
transvestite woman in order to
out-Profumo a visiting Russian
ambassador who leans that way.
Thing misfires when Miss Bond
trips over Moneypenny as a
real Ponsonby, but cannot hori
zontalize 007 for himself.
It cost twelve million dollars
to make, which is unusual for
a British film. It implies that
breasts and cancer are as much
in fashion at Edinburgh as in
Dallas. What it achieves, and in
this I find its closets parallel
in A Funny Thing Happened On
The Way To The Forum, is a
totally destructive adolescent
good humor drawing on a corp
us of well loved classics.
Lan Fleming is as much a pop
ular classic as the Roman come
dian Plautus. It is encouraging
that such good and entertaining
literary farragos are now being
made. Keep Spartacus and nail
Man And A Women to the bed
in which they were so groany. I
like Unbond.

that such good and entertaining
literary farragos are now being
made. Keep Spartacus and nail
Man And A Women to the bed
in which they were so groany. I
like Unbond.
Showing at the Guild, Menlo
Park, Casino Royale is a good
value for your money. Feld
man's spoof-on-truth features a
farrago of the ten lan Fleming
novels and the three to date Eon
movies starring Sean Hirsute
Connery as the twentieth cen
tury Odysseus.
For Bond is no more and no
less than every culture's frac
tionally larger than life contem
porary hero. Odysseus, "Ulys
ses" in Rome and Dublin, is
the Homeric parallel.
The Renaissance Orlando saga
features the noble seducer all
over again. Even Don Giovanni
in the Spanish legend is a Bond
hero. It is nice to see Penelope
and Angelique as Miss Money
penny, and Royale hints at all
this and more.
One of the reasons why
American audiences have gen
erally disapproved Casino Roy
ale may, I believe, be found in
the fact that Pox Americana
gets the lash all through it. The
story pokes a constant left
right-left at the Yankee self im
age. A dove flies out of Le Chi
ffre's card trick; but a moment
later he has lost fifty million
at Baccarat — paper money, of
course.
Redskin hoodlums ride out
from some handy buttes and res
cue English Intelligence from
a nefarious plot to explode Bond.
In the ensuing slapstick, (never
far from American T.V. cliches)
all the stars (Woody Allen, Pet
er Sellers, Orson Welles, Ursula
Undress, Peter O'What?) shift
dimensions to Paradise.
Now, in case Creative Writ
ing programs have not made it
plain to the general reader, lan
Fleming is both a spy and a lit
erary talent. Was, rather. The
gambling section in his novel is

indubitably one of the finer
things that the English short
story has produced. There is an
other short story called Quan
tum Of Solace, in the For Your
Eyes Only collection, which
might have been written by
Chekhov.
This literary flavor the film
clearly abandons. Instead you
have a vast parody of the whole
Bond myth; posh brand names,
bustful women, fetishistic sex
symbols and the tender aberra
tions of diplomats.
The source for the spoof, un
acknowledge, is in a little piece
Cyril Connolly composed for the
London Sunday Times many
moons ago. It can be found in
Previous Convictions, under
"Paging Mr. Smartiboots, "Bond
Strikes Camp."
Connolly's spoof sets up M.
as the deviant admirer of 007.
He tells James to dress as a
transvestite woman in order to
out-Profumo a visiting Russian
ambassador who leans that way.
Thing misfires when Miss Bond
trips over Moneypenny as a
real Ponsonby, but cannot hori
zontalize 007 for himself.
It cost twelve million dollars
to make, which is unusual for
a British film. It implies that
breasts and cancer are as much
in fashion at Edinburgh as in
Dallas. What it achieves, and in
this I find its closets parallel
in A Funny Thing Happened On
The Way To The Forum, is a
totally destructive adolescent
good humor drawing on a corp
us of well loved classics.
Lan Fleming is as much a pop
ular classic as the Roman come
