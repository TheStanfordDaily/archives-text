# Smokers Disfigure Undergrad Library

"More people feel freer to
light up whenever they want,"
Mr. Warren Kuhn, director of
the Undergraduate Library, said
in regard to the growing smok
ing problem in his building.
Kuhn declined to give a mone
tary estimate of the damage
done to the chairs, carrels, and
floors on the second and third
floors of the library. He said,
however, that he felt much of
the furniture and the floor might
have to be replaced.
Stanford's library is one of
the few in the country that has
any smoking allowed, according
to Kuhn. Though reference li
brarians are encouraged to help
enforce smoking rules, they can
not be everywhere. "We're at
the mercy of all the people who
use the building," said Kuhn.
The director terms the dam
age caused by cigarette burns
"quite serious" on the second
and third floors of the library.
The area in which smoking is
allowed officially includes only
part of the third floor and the
outside reading decks on the
fourtli floor.
"The floor," Mr. Kuhn lament
ed, "is gone" on parts of the
second and third stories, "ami
the library has been open only
four months."
President Wallace Sterling re
cently sent a letter to faculty
and staff expressing concern
over smoking in University
buildings. Sterling in the past
has from time to time written
letters about smoking.
University policy is that smok
ing is prohibited in University
buildings including classrooms.
Smoking is nonetheless allowed
in some seminar rooms.
Frank Fariello, superinten
dent of University maintenance,
told ThÂ«' Daily that Sterling's
letter seems to be "taking some
pffect." He said his staff had
noticed a reduction in the rate
of damage due to smoking in
some places.
The problem is, however, still
acute in areas other than the
Undergraduate Library, accord
ing to Fariello. He cited the tile

in the U-shaped corridors of the
Law School among places that
are especially badly damaged by
cigarette burns.
