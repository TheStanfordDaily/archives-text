# War Posters At Hoo Tower
## 
### 
Recruiting posters designed
both to seduce and cajole, plus
photos from inside the "boot
camps" of 50 years ago, are
among the items now on display
in the lobby of Hoover Tower.
They are part of an exhibit —
"Spring, 1917: The U.S. Enters
World War I" — made up of
graphic materials from the col
lections of the Hoover Institu
tion on War, Revolution, and
Peace.
A number of the posters are
the work of the then highly pop
ular illustrator Howard Chand
ler Christy.
