Removes Shades
Jumping at 7' 1" he missed his
112 ;st two tries. After a brief rest,
he took off his sunglasses and
tried again. This time he sailed
over with room to spare.
Next he asked that the bar
be raised another 2", only Yz"
tt'low John Thomas' American
record, set in 1960 on this same
pit. Again he missed his first
two tries, but he cleared the
bar with daylight beneath him
on his third.
Field Events Strong
The Papooses gained most of
t' eir points in the field events,
where they placed at least two
men in every event, sweeping
the javelin and triple jump.
Jerry Porter and Neil Heller
turned in their best life
time performances in the jave
lin. Porter took first with a toss
i.+ 195' II", and Heller heaved

the spear 195' Dave Arnold

throw of 160' IOV2".

in the triple jump with his best
ever of 45' Chris Gibson
pulled down second place, and
Jack Lasater was third. The
three finished in the same order
in the long jump.
Dave Harper's best lifetime

ed as he took second behind
Johnson. The 5' 9%" athlete
from Piedmont closed in on the
magic mark of one foot over
his head with a 6' 8" leap.
Len Mogno led another 1-2
finish in the shot put with a toss
of 50' 2", also his best lifetime.
