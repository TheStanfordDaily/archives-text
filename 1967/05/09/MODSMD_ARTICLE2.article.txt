# Rally Supports Draft Referendum
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Part of the ASSU election which
will be held today and tomorrow will
be a referendum with male students
voting on the present policy of re
porting class ranking to draft boards
if the student requests the Univer
sity to do so. A Yes vote on this ref
erendum would urge that Stanford
join those universities which have al
ready refused to supply class rank
ings or grades to draft boards.
Yesterday afternoon at a rally in
White Memorial Plaza, Prof. Michael
Novak of the Religion Department
and three students urged that voters
use this opportunity to express dis
satisfaction with the present draft
laws.
One of the organizers of the rally
and a member of the Stanford Anti-
Draft Union, Leonard Siegel, describ
ed what he calls "the levels of ob
jections which would cause a person
to support the referendum."
Objections
The first level of objection would
be to the war itself. A lesser objec
tion, but still reason for supporting
the referendum, would be objection
to the "draft as a whole." A sup
porter might also object to the 11-S
classification.
Another objection held by people
representing a "wide spectrum of

opinion" against reporting class rank
ings are those who feel that a student
"should not be drafted because they
have a low grade point average." The
final opinion would be held by those
who feel that "The draft should have
nothing to do with the university."
"The Executive Committee of the
Academic Council has already taken
action on the issue of class rankings,"
insisted Prof. Novak in listing his
reasons for supporting the referen
dum.
Novak went on to point out that An
tioch College, University of Chicago,
Columbia University, and other col
leges have already refused to send
rankings or grades to the Selective
Service.
Professor's Problem
Of special concern to Novak were
the two problems a university profes
sor faces in regard to the present
draft system. The first of these is
that it "makes it difficult for those
who are teaching to grade a student",
knowing that the grade might be
used as a criteria for induction into
the armed services.
"Nearly every day," Novak contin
ued in listing the second problem,
"students come to teachers asking
for help to fill out conscientious ob
jector forms."
With regard to the referendum it

self, Novak expressed hope that
"Those of you who will support this
referendum will keep the issue of
the draft open. The draft is the one
lever that we have to assure that the
citizens' opinions will be considered
in government decisions."
The final speaker, Paul Rupert, re
minded the audience that 1800 stu
dents had supported the election of
Peter Lyman who had run on a plat
form of not cooperating with the
present draft system.
Rupert stated that his objection to
the reporting of class rankings was
based on the fact that "it makes it
a little bit more difficult for us to
have freedom to express ourselves."
Peter Ware, another member of the
Stanford Anti-Draft Union, went on
to list two reasons why he felt that
students should support the referen
dum.
"The first reason is that most of us
never voted for this war. Most of
us never had the chance to vote for
the present Selective Service System."
Chance To Say No
Ware also felt that the referendum
"Gives us a chance to say no to the
discriminatory system of class rank
ing."

action to attempt to have persons "aid

and a member of the Stanford Anti-
Draft Union, Leonard Siegel, describ
ed what he calls "the levels of ob
jections which would cause a person
to support the referendum."
Objections
The first level of objection would
be to the war itself. A lesser objec
tion, but still reason for supporting
the referendum, would be objection
to the "draft as a whole." A sup
porter might also object to the 11-S
classification.
Another objection held by people
representing a "wide spectrum of

opinion" against reporting class rank
ings are those who feel that a student
"should not be drafted because they
have a low grade point average." The
final opinion would be held by those
who feel that "The draft should have
nothing to do with the university."
"The Executive Committee of the
Academic Council has already taken
action on the issue of class rankings,"
insisted Prof. Novak in listing his
reasons for supporting the referen
dum.
Novak went on to point out that An
tioch College, University of Chicago,
Columbia University, and other col
leges have already refused to send
rankings or grades to the Selective
Service.
Professor's Problem
Of special concern to Novak were
the two problems a university profes
sor faces in regard to the present
draft system. The first of these is
that it "makes it difficult for those
who are teaching to grade a student",
knowing that the grade might be
used as a criteria for induction into
the armed services.
"Nearly every day," Novak contin
ued in listing the second problem,
"students come to teachers asking
for help to fill out conscientious ob
jector forms."
With regard to the referendum it

self, Novak expressed hope that
"Those of you who will support this
referendum will keep the issue of
the draft open. The draft is the one
lever that we have to assure that the
citizens' opinions will be considered
in government decisions."
The final speaker, Paul Rupert, re
minded the audience that 1800 stu
dents had supported the election of
Peter Lyman who had run on a plat
form of not cooperating with the
present draft system.
Rupert stated that his objection to
the reporting of class rankings was
based on the fact that "it makes it
a little bit more difficult for us to
have freedom to express ourselves."
Peter Ware, another member of the
Stanford Anti-Draft Union, went on
to list two reasons why he felt that
students should support the referen
dum.
"The first reason is that most of us
never voted for this war. Most of
us never had the chance to vote for
the present Selective Service System."
Chance To Say No
Ware also felt that the referendum
"Gives us a chance to say no to the
discriminatory system of class rank
ing."
Referring to current Congressional
action to attempt to have persons "aid
ing and abetting others in evasion of
Part of the ASSU election which
will be held today and tomorrow will
be a referendum with male students
voting on the present policy of re
porting class ranking to draft boards
if the student requests the Univer
sity to do so. A Yes vote on this ref
erendum would urge that Stanford
join those universities which have al
ready refused to supply class rank
ings or grades to draft boards.
Yesterday afternoon at a rally in
White Memorial Plaza, Prof. Michael
Novak of the Religion Department
and three students urged that voters
use this opportunity to express dis
satisfaction with the present draft
laws.

and a member of the Stanford Anti-
