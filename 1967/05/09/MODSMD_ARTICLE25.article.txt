# No Class Ranking
## 
### 
Today's ballot will include a referendum
which, if approved, will recommend that Stan
ford cease computing class ranking. The vote
on this question will not be legally binding,
but it may be effective in conveying the feel
ing of a large portion of the student body on
an issue of more burning interest: whether
academic achievement should in any way be
connected with student draft deferments.
At present, the University relies solely on
grades for its own evaluation of student per
formance and class-ranking is computed only
to satisfy draft boards. That the University
should serve as an instrument of draft boards
or any other organizations is inconsistent with
its purposes; and that it should supply boards
with class ranking implies tacit acceptance of a
principle which seriously needs to be chal
lenged.
Two problems are tied together in this ques
tion: should academic achievement be a con
sideration for the draft and, if so, does class
ranking provide an accurate picture of a stu
dent's scholastic accomplishments? We believe
the answer to both is no.
Class-standing is based on grades, which have
never been the most reliable yardsticks of stu
dent achievement. Particularly the fact that
pressures such as the draft are being brought
to bear on grading has detracted from the
value of grades as indications of someone's
ability. On one hand, students are faced with
the prospect of cutting short their education
because of military obligations; the stakes
are so high that they cannot help but com
promise their intellectual interests so as to
be sure to obtain grade point averages (and
class standings) that will assure them safety
from their draft board. They will inevitably
take easier courses and, in doing so, will con
centrate on obtaining a high grade, a goal
hot necessarily concurrent with that of deriving
the maximum benefit from an education.
And on the other hand there is the professor
who suddenly realizes that he is no longer only

evaluating a student's performance in a particu
lar class, but that he might also be playing a
part in determining that student's future. In
short, it imposes on him external pressures
which will jeopardize his effectiveness as a
teacher and will place with him the responsi
bility for decisions which are not his to make.
The net result of these conflicts is that even
greater inequities will result, for there will be
some students and teachers who will succumb
to these pressures more than others, thereby
eliminating any uniformity in the grading sys
tem. And there will also be inconsistencies
among universites: a student ranked low in a
first-class institution might well ronk high in a
junior college.
But even if grades could be reliable measures
of student achievement, there is no reason
that any correlation should exist between
scholarship and eligibility for the draft. As long
as military service is based on the principle
that all Americans should serve equally, it is
incongruous to establish an elite from which
few are inducted, leaving the major burden
of military service with those whose perfom
ance in college was perhaps only average.
The University can be legally coerced into
turning in class ranking only if it compiles
these statistics; the only way it can evade this
obligation is not to compute them in the first
place.
At present, most draft boards assume that
a student whose class ranking has not been re
ported is at the bottom of his class. This
should change, for a growing number of uni
versities are abolishing class ranking. The best
known examples are Antioch, Chicago, Colum
bia, Haverford, Reed, and Wayne State. If
Stanford is the leader it claims to be, it should
join these institutions in rejecting class ranking.
The faculty has done its part: the Execu
tive Committee of the Academic Council has
unanimously recommended that Stanford not
supply class rank to draft boards. Today the
students have their chance to uphold the faculty
on this question.

that any correlation should exist between
scholarship and eligibility for the draft. As long
as military service is based on the principle
that all Americans should serve equally, it is
incongruous to establish an elite from which
few are inducted, leaving the major burden
of military service with those whose perfom
ance in college was perhaps only average.
The University can be legally coerced into
turning in class ranking only if it compiles
these statistics; the only way it can evade this
obligation is not to compute them in the first
place.
At present, most draft boards assume that
a student whose class ranking has not been re
ported is at the bottom of his class. This
should change, for a growing number of uni
versities are abolishing class ranking. The best
known examples are Antioch, Chicago, Colum
bia, Haverford, Reed, and Wayne State. If
Stanford is the leader it claims to be, it should
join these institutions in rejecting class ranking.
The faculty has done its part: the Execu
tive Committee of the Academic Council has
unanimously recommended that Stanford not
supply class rank to draft boards. Today the
students have their chance to uphold the faculty
on this question.
Today's ballot will include a referendum
which, if approved, will recommend that Stan
ford cease computing class ranking. The vote
on this question will not be legally binding,
but it may be effective in conveying the feel
ing of a large portion of the student body on
an issue of more burning interest: whether
academic achievement should in any way be
connected with student draft deferments.
At present, the University relies solely on
grades for its own evaluation of student per
formance and class-ranking is computed only
to satisfy draft boards. That the University
should serve as an instrument of draft boards
or any other organizations is inconsistent with
its purposes; and that it should supply boards
with class ranking implies tacit acceptance of a
principle which seriously needs to be chal
lenged.
Two problems are tied together in this ques
tion: should academic achievement be a con
sideration for the draft and, if so, does class
ranking provide an accurate picture of a stu
dent's scholastic accomplishments? We believe
the answer to both is no.
Class-standing is based on grades, which have
never been the most reliable yardsticks of stu
dent achievement. Particularly the fact that
pressures such as the draft are being brought
to bear on grading has detracted from the
value of grades as indications of someone's
ability. On one hand, students are faced with
the prospect of cutting short their education
because of military obligations; the stakes
are so high that they cannot help but com
promise their intellectual interests so as to
be sure to obtain grade point averages (and
class standings) that will assure them safety
from their draft board. They will inevitably
take easier courses and, in doing so, will con
centrate on obtaining a high grade, a goal
hot necessarily concurrent with that of deriving
the maximum benefit from an education.
And on the other hand there is the professor
who suddenly realizes that he is no longer only

evaluating a student's performance in a particu
lar class, but that he might also be playing a
part in determining that student's future. In
short, it imposes on him external pressures
which will jeopardize his effectiveness as a
teacher and will place with him the responsi
bility for decisions which are not his to make.
The net result of these conflicts is that even
greater inequities will result, for there will be
some students and teachers who will succumb
to these pressures more than others, thereby
eliminating any uniformity in the grading sys
tem. And there will also be inconsistencies
among universites: a student ranked low in a
first-class institution might well ronk high in a
junior college.
But even if grades could be reliable measures
of student achievement, there is no reason
that any correlation should exist between
scholarship and eligibility for the draft. As long
as military service is based on the principle
that all Americans should serve equally, it is
incongruous to establish an elite from which
