# Foreign Campuses Seek News
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The students of France XIV
take a great interest in the af
fairs of the home campus, but
it is difficult to keep up with
events because of the erratic
and slow arrival of The Daily,
which is our only source of in
formation other than personal
letters. We were disappointed
with the amount of information
we received concerning the can
didates in the recent primary
elections. Some of the candidates
sent their platforms and asked
individuals to support their cam
paigns; but not all the candi
dates for the ASSU Presidency,
very few of the candidates for
the Senior Class Presidency,
and none of the candidates for
NSA Representatives sent mate
rial about themselves or their
platforms. Considering that the
Overseas Campuses include
four hundred Stanford students,
we feel that it is not unreason
able to ask the ASSU Election
Commission to make available
to these students as much infor
mation as is possible, and to
make this information available
as soon as possible.
We know that much of the
discussion and debate concern
ing the candidates takes place in
the last few days before the

election, but even short biogra
phies which include class, ma
jor, previous student offices,
and so forth would be helpful
to us, as would information con
cerning the nature of such offi
ces as NSA Representatives.
We would hope that before the
final election takes place you
could send each Overseas Cam
pus a body of information about
the candidates and their plat
forms, as well as information
on the upcoming referenda. If
such information could include
articles, columns, or letters
from The Daily, even if it con
cerns the primary campaign, it
would be helpful. We would also
suggest that all the candidates
be encouraged to send addition
al material as they wish.
We hope that you will con
sider these requests seriously,
for our purpose is a construc
tive one. Although there seems
to be much debate at the mo
ment concerning the relative ef
fectiveness of student govern
ment, we at the Overseas Cam
puses would like to have as
much of a chance as possible to

have an equal and informed
voice in that government.

â€¢ Rabble-rousing
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to briefly answer
Mr. Goodman who attacks Pro
fessor Otis' call for reasoned
debate on the Vietnam war. If
Mr. Goodman and those like
him are sincerely interested in
bringing about peace, what do
they hope to accomplish by all
the name-calling and rabble
rousing? To use one of their
favorite arguments, just as the
bombing of North Vietnam tends
to solidify the North Vietna
mese behind Ho, so does the
verbal bombardment of Presi
dent Johnson by the dissenters
tend to solidify the majority of
the American people behind the
President and his policies.
