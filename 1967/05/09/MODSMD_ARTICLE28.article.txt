# 'Objectivity' Not Infallible
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In Monday's Daily, Mr. Rick
Hanson attacked Professor No
vak's "awfully one-sided" ap
proach to the moral and politi
cal issues of the war in Vietnam.
He seems to rely on the quite
dubious assertion that a bal
anced viewpoint will inevitably
result in knowledge of the truth.
But he fails to understand that
"objectivity" is not an infallible
standard; it. is no more than a
tool of analysis. It is quite in
capable of answering the ques
tions of morality that Professor
Novak is asking. His "one-sided"
opinions can conceivably be
based on a thorough study of
the best available information.
I wonder if Mr. Hanson's are.
Objectivity, however, is not
without value. Indeed, it may be
that Mr. Hanson would have
been well advised to take some
of his own medicine. He could
also stand to do a little reading.
1) Negotiations. Mr. Hanson
feels that our offers to stop the
bombing in return for the cessa
tion of infiltration from the
North is a valid basis for negoti
ation, and it is obvious that the
two actions are not even remote
ly reciprocal. For us, the cessa
tion of the bombing would in
volve only a slight reduction in
our war effort; for Hanoi, it
would mean total disengage
ment. Our offer now is no more
than an offer to accept Hanoi's
surrender.
A truly reciprocal gesture on
our part would be an offer to
withdraw all our troops from
South Vietnam. Until we are pre
pared to do this, all negoiation
is a farce. For those with an im
plicit faith in our government's
sincerity, I would recommend
Franz Schurman's short book
"The Politics of Escalation in
Vietnam." Schurman thoroughly
documents how each of our of
fers to "negotiate" has been fol
lowed within days by our uni
lateral escalation of the war, ac
tions which must have been
planned before the "offers" were
made. If our government count
ed on these offers to fail, how
sincerely can we maintain they
were made?
2) "Freedom as we know it."
Mr. Hanson fears that a U.S.
withdrawal from South Vietnam
would deprive the people of the
wonderful freedom we are help
ing them fight for. We are fight
ing there, he implies, to pre
serve "freedom as we know it."
This is extremely naive. Actual

ly, the South Vietnamese people
have no more freedom, and in
some ways, less freedom than
their northern brethern. Is this
inconceivable, Mr. Hanson? No
doubt. Then read Mary Mc-
Carthy's recent reports on Viet
nam in the New York Review
of Books about the "freedoms"
we are establishing for those
lucky people.
If a significant segment (more
than 5%) of the South Vietna
mese people enjoyed even one
of the freedoms guaranteed by
our Bill of Rights, then there
might possibly be a reason for
the U.S. to be in Vietnam. But
the truth is that they don't, and
they never have. Moreover, Mr.
Hanson has obviously never
been in a Communist country,
or he would not make silly state
ments about atheistic commu
nism. It is true that religious
observance is not encouraged,
but in most Communist coun
tries, including North Vietnam,
it is tolerated.
3) The Viet Cong Atrocities.
Mr. Hanson feels that the cri
tics of our war effort do not
condemn the VC for their vio
lence as they do for our napalm.
Of course, we kill as many Viet
namese in one year (50,000 ac
cording to the AP) as the VC
have killed and kidnapped in
nine years (according to General
Westmoreland). As Professor
Otis has pointed out, we are all
guilty, but this misses the point:
we are more responsible and
thus more guilty for the na
palm than for the VC. We can
not control the VC except by
killing them, of course, but in
theory we can exercise some in
fluence over our own govern
ment, for which wo are directly
responsible. Try reading The
Question of German Guilt by
Karl Jaspers for more thoughts
on this subject.
In the long run, the moral
issue is not reducible to the
number of Vietnamese we have
killed in comparison to the VC.
Nor do we need moral reasons
for withdrawing; plenty of
sound political reasons are avail
able. The moral question which
Mr. Hanson evades is what we
are doing to ourselves as hu
man beings when we claim to
defend "freedom as we know it"
for a nation of oppressed peas
ants. With enough blood, money,
and patience, we can probably
win this messy war, but at what
cost to our integrity?
