# New SES Proposal For Trustees
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Concrete proposals for a new kind
of dormitory living have been drawn
up and are now ready for presentation
to the Board of Trustees.
According to the proposed plan, four
demonstration houses would be set up,
two in Wilbur and two in Stern. Each
of these houses would include men and
women, both upperclass and freshmen,
and would be centered around an aca
demic theme. Furthermore, Branner
would be coed freshman.
The proposals stemmed from action
taken by the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) on the report of the
ASSU Housing Commission. SES
Steering Committee Chairman Herbert
Packer referred the report to the Resi
dence Policies Committee, headed by
History Professor Lewis Spitz, with
directions to work out the details.
Original Plan
The original plan put forth by the
Residence Committee, which would
have limited the experiment to Wilbur,
met protests from the residents of
Stern Hall. The plan was then revised
to include two Stern houses following
the approval of the executor of the es
tate of Lucie Stern, which had estab
lished Stern Hall originally as a men's
residence.
The Grove Project, now in the Phi
Delta Theta house, would move into
Larkin House in Stern. It would be
made up of 33 upperclassmen and 32
freshmen, with a male-female ration
of about 3 to 1.
Serra House would have 56 upper
classmen and 33 freshmen, also with
a 3-1 ratio. The academic theme would
be centered on the topic of life styles.
According to Bob Freelen, faculty resi

dent of Serra, the subject would be ap
proached from two angles.
The first would be an "examination
and assessment of various life styles
in the United States." The other would
be the problem of mobilities, or alter
natives to people in these life styles.
The projected program for Serra, as
now conceived, would involve the stu
dents there in core seminars and field
work. Freelen and his wife, who have
been developing the program together,
envision a "total living experience, all
somewhat related to the central
theme."
The two Wilbur houses included in
the proposal, Arroyo and Otero, have
about the same ratios of men to women
and upper to lowerclassmen as Serra.

The academic themes, however, are
unique to each one.
One of them, developed by John
Chowning, now faculty resident of Soto
House, would be centered around the
subject of creativity. "A core discus
sion, led by Dr. Chowning, would dis
cuss with the whole group the topic of
creativity â€” what it is, where we see
it, what modes it takes."
The theme for the other Wilbur
house would be International Affairs,
"described as broadly as possible, thus
having a greater appeal to a broader
spectrum of good students."
Residents for these houses would be
selected at random from lists of stu
dents expressing interest .
