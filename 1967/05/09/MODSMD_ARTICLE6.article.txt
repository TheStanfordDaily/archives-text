# Brewster Encourages Abolition Of Student Draft Deferments
## 
### 
Students should be allowed to get
off "the grinding academic escalator"
for a year or two, especially between
high school and college, President
Kingman Brewster Jr. of Yale Univer
sity said yesterday here.
At a news conference, held in con
junction with his delivery of the
Harry Camp Memorial lectures, Brew
ster said student draft deferments
should be abolished.
He labeled fears that this would re
duce the number going to college or
completing their education as "poppy
cock."

Experience with the G.I. Bill show
ed that two years of non-academic
life before college "is likely to en
hance motivation for higher educa
tion, not smother it."
Keep Grad Deferments
A member of the President's Com
mission on Selective Service, Brew
ster criticized Senator .Richard Rus
sell's proposals to continue undergrad
uate student deferments but abolish
those for graduate work.
"This might seriously impair edu
cational motivation," he warned. "The
time for interruption is before col
lege, not after."
Brewster termed the impact of the
draft on students "terrible." "It casts
a shadow of uncertainty over the
entire age group. Unfortunately, it ap
pears to many that the motivation
for education may be corrupted by
the draft," with some students decid
ing to continue their education simply
to maintain their deferments.
He backed the majority of the Pres
idential Commission in advocating a
lottery of 18-year-olds which would
let students and other- know of their
commitment for two years' service,
providing opportunities for them to
fulfill this obligation before age 25.
This might be difficult to administer,

he admitted, but it is the fairest al
ternative.
He called the use of class rankings
as a basis for deferment by local
boards "dreadful," but said the prac
tice of maintaining rankings should
not be abolished by colleges and uni
versities. Using class standing as an
automatic index of student perform
ance is "completely irrational," he
said, calling local administration of
this provision by 4,000 boards "whim
sical, uneven, and erratic."
Use of class rankings for draft, de
ferment introduces "a very coercive
element" in the relationships between
student and faculty, he said.
But rankings themselves should not
be abolished because they are needed
for academic purposes by profession
al and graduate schools. In addition,
he said, "the institution does not have
the right to intrude between the stu
dent and his government."
Brewster said students ought to be
able to leave college for a year or
two to perform public service, if they
so desire, but this action should not
involve academic credit.
"To stay on the ever-grinding aca
demic escalator is not the way to de
velop full human character and per
sonality," he declared.

those for graduate work.
"This might seriously impair edu
cational motivation," he warned. "The
time for interruption is before col
lege, not after."
Brewster termed the impact of the
draft on students "terrible." "It casts
a shadow of uncertainty over the
entire age group. Unfortunately, it ap
pears to many that the motivation
for education may be corrupted by
the draft," with some students decid
ing to continue their education simply
to maintain their deferments.
He backed the majority of the Pres
idential Commission in advocating a
lottery of 18-year-olds which would
let students and other- know of their
commitment for two years' service,
providing opportunities for them to
fulfill this obligation before age 25.
This might be difficult to administer,

he admitted, but it is the fairest al
ternative.
He called the use of class rankings
as a basis for deferment by local
boards "dreadful," but said the prac
tice of maintaining rankings should
not be abolished by colleges and uni
versities. Using class standing as an
automatic index of student perform
ance is "completely irrational," he
said, calling local administration of
this provision by 4,000 boards "whim
sical, uneven, and erratic."
Use of class rankings for draft, de
ferment introduces "a very coercive
element" in the relationships between
student and faculty, he said.
But rankings themselves should not
be abolished because they are needed
for academic purposes by profession
al and graduate schools. In addition,
he said, "the institution does not have
the right to intrude between the stu
dent and his government."
Brewster said students ought to be
able to leave college for a year or
two to perform public service, if they
so desire, but this action should not
involve academic credit.
"To stay on the ever-grinding aca
demic escalator is not the way to de
velop full human character and per
sonality," he declared.
Students should be allowed to get
off "the grinding academic escalator"
for a year or two, especially between
high school and college, President
Kingman Brewster Jr. of Yale Univer
sity said yesterday here.
At a news conference, held in con
junction with his delivery of the
Harry Camp Memorial lectures, Brew
ster said student draft deferments
should be abolished.
He labeled fears that this would re
duce the number going to college or
completing their education as "poppy
cock."

Experience with the G.I. Bill show
ed that two years of non-academic
life before college "is likely to en
hance motivation for higher educa
tion, not smother it."
Keep Grad Deferments
