# Faculty Committee Urges Review Of Class Ranking
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Professor Ernest R. Hilgard, head
of the Executive Committee of the
Academic Council and Professor of
Psychology, revealed yesterday that
his committee had sent an "advisory
letter to President Sterling two
months ago" on the subject of Uni
versity compliance with draft board's
requests for grades and class rank
ings.
The issue was raised earlier this
week by two members of the Stan
ford Anti-Draft Union. Peter Ware
and Leonard Siegel stated that "in
formed sources" had told them of the
Executive Committee's action.
Prof. Hilgard refered to the action
as a "recommendation that the Uni
versity reconsider the supplying of
ranking to draft boards for the pur
pose of deciding who should be
drafted."
President Sterling, when contacted
by The Daily, stated he had heard
nothing about recent Academic Coun-

the draft" tried in court, Ware stated,
"I challenge the Justice Department
to try to shut up the Anti-Draft
Unions across the country."
Ware went on to urge students to
continue sit-ins in President Sterling's
office and draft board offices to ob
tain the objective of abolishing the
draft. He invited students to join
others from Stanford, San Francisco
State College, and several Bay Area
high schools who later picketed the
McAllister Street draft board in San
Francisco yesterday.
After they had picketed the draft
board for about 20 minutes, the group
grew from 30 to about 100. At that
time 20 protesters entered the build
ing and obstructed the draft board's
normal business by demanding that
various communications be sent to
their local hometown boards.
Five students refused to leave at
closing time and were carried out by
police who did not arrest them. Next
time, Ware said, "We'll make it hard
er for them to get off without arrest
ing anybody."

the subject of class rankings.
While Sterling does attend Aca
demic Council meetings, no members
of the administration attend the Ex
ecutive Committee meetings.
The Academic Council first took
action on the subject of the draft last
June. At that time the group listed
four specific proposals of action which
they felt should be taken.
The first recommendation was that
the University continue to notify local
draft boards of a student's academic
standing if the student so requested.
The group also proposed that the
University continue making facilities
available for selective service exams.
Relevant Information
The third proposal was that Stan
ford's National Service Office, as a
university facility, should provide "all
relevant information to students af
fected by selective service, including
information as to the status of con
scientious objection."
If the students acting through
their governing bodies, take the initi
ative in ascertaining student views to
ward selective service, these should be

given "substantial weight in shaping
university practices," the Council in
sisted in its fourth proposal.
A member of the Executive Com
mittee added yesterday that he felt
that "students really haven't made too
much fuss about the draft so far."

However, in reference to the com
mittee's latest action, students at the
noon rally yesterday supporting an
ASSU referendum, called on students
to follow the Executive Council's ac
tion and show their dissatisfaction
with the draft.
Hilgard pointed out that the issue
of the draft has been on his com
mittee's agenda several times, but
that, except for the action two months
ago, no real decisions have been made
on the subject outside of agreeing
to discuss it at another time.
The Executive Committee and the
Advisory Council are meeting in a
joint-session this afternoon. The pur
pose of this meeting will be to iron
out differences on a final tenure pro
posal. This action will delay any fur
ther proposals about the draft until
at least next week.

The Academic Council first took
action on the subject of the draft last
June. At that time the group listed
four specific proposals of action which
they felt should be taken.
The first recommendation was that
the University continue to notify local
draft boards of a student's academic
standing if the student so requested.
The group also proposed that the
University continue making facilities
available for selective service exams.

university facility, should provide "all
relevant information to students af

information as to the status of con

Professor Ernest R. Hilgard, head
of the Executive Committee of the
Academic Council and Professor of
Psychology, revealed yesterday that
his committee had sent an "advisory
letter to President Sterling two
months ago" on the subject of Uni
versity compliance with draft board's
requests for grades and class rank
ings.
The issue was raised earlier this
week by two members of the Stan
ford Anti-Draft Union. Peter Ware
and Leonard Siegel stated that "in
formed sources" had told them of the
Executive Committee's action.
Prof. Hilgard refered to the action
as a "recommendation that the Uni
versity reconsider the supplying of
ranking to draft boards for the pur
pose of deciding who should be
drafted."
President Sterling, when contacted
by The Daily, stated he had heard
nothing about recent Academic Coun-

the draft" tried in court, Ware stated,
"I challenge the Justice Department
to try to shut up the Anti-Draft
Unions across the country."
Ware went on to urge students to
continue sit-ins in President Sterling's
office and draft board offices to ob
tain the objective of abolishing the
draft. He invited students to join
others from Stanford, San Francisco
State College, and several Bay Area
high schools who later picketed the
McAllister Street draft board in San
Francisco yesterday.
