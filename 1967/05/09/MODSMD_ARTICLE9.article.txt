## 
### KIRK HANSON 
The ASSU Judicial Council last night
held over for consideration three al
leged fundamental standard violations
arising from last week's ASSU pri
mary election. The trials will be held
next Monday evening.
All other accusations of election
violations were dropped by those mak
ing the allegations. Last night's in
formal meeting to discuss all allega
tions was attended by all five candi
dates for ASSU President.
All three charges to be tried con
cern the "in-crowd" leaflets distrib
uted last Wednesday morning during
the primary election. The leaflets
claimed a conspiracy involving Beta
Chi Fraternity, the Grove House, and
The Stanford Daily to take over ASSU
politics through the election of Peter
Lyman. The leaflets were at first un
signed but later were stamped by

"Students for a Free Election."
The first charge is brought by Tom
Forstenzer, Speaker of LASSU, Henry
Muller, Editor of The Daily, and Joel
Kugelmass against Joe Reich, and
Jeff Kane, candidates for ASSU Presi
dent and Vice President, for distrib
uting the leaflets, which the charge
describes as "defamatory and untrue."
Joe Reich brought the second charge
against Christopher Harte, campaign
manager for Peter Lyman, Tom Fors
tenzer, Paul Rupert, Joel Kugelmass,
and Peter Lyman for coercing Jeff
Kane to write a statement concerning
his part in the distribution of the leaf
lets.

The third charge is against The
Daily for misrepresenting the state
ment by Jeff Kane concerning his
part. Kirk Hanen of KZSU, who is
making the charge, claims The Daily
participated in what amounts to libel
against Joe Reich and Jeff Kane by
printing the statement.
In action affecting today's final
ASSU election, the Council ordered
Bill Berry to hire student police to
man the polls. Berry yesterday after
noon asked Mark Fogelman and
Soleng Tom, Jr., candidates for Senior
Class President, to have their sup
porters man the polls, each for half
the time.

launch ammunition across a football
field to wash out enemy raters. The
wea|ion is the product of an engineer
ing design course in which Barkley,
David Bardsley, and Robert Parsons
made it their project.
