# MaFiA Gets Away With Murder
## 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
Chekhov and Brecht are a chal
lenge to any theatrical company,
even the Midnight Mafia. For
their Saturday night caper at
the Nitery, they attacked Chek
hov's The Harmlessne.ss of
Smoking Tobacco and Brechts
The Jewish Wife.
The delicate half-humor of
Chekhov's monologue is a good
curtain-raiser. Sheldon Feldner
who played "the husband of his
wife" is to deliver a lecture on
the evils of smoking tobacco. He
can't get started and begins a
long digression about his wife,
his daughters and his dreams.
Though Mr. Feldner has a
sense of humor and looks fun
ny, he failed to find the proper
tone for the wanderings of the
absent-minded professor. He was

inclined to become hammy,
which is all right in improvisa
tions but hardly worthy of
Chekhov.
Because he lacked discipline,
the transitions from the absurd
to the poetic were ineffectual.
Feldner's acting is over con
scious and unsynchronized.
The comic person is invisible
to himself. As every actor
knows, hands have expressive
potential. These, however, when
not coupled with the lines, lose
their voice. Digest your lines,
Mr. Feldner, don't just chew
them.
Like Chekhov himself, this
man wants to run, to drift, to
flee from vulgarity. "If only I
could find a field, I would stand
there like a tree and watch the
bright moon. How it would be
not to remember anything."
Startlingly beautiful lines.
Chekhov's vision is profound
ly modern. His romantic dream
ers, like his Three Sisters and
Uucle Vanya, share the same
poetic inertia as Beckett's intel
lectual tramps, who spend all
their time trying to move.

The Mafia doesn't lack move
ment. In a few minutes, "doing
one of the things they do best,"
they changed the stage flats.
Refreshments and improvisa
tions were served.
Lucille Medal is was Breacht's
Jewess. Her interpretation of a
very difficult role was flat.
With a timid voice, hardly
audible at times, and too sweet
for Brecht, Miss Medalis showed
that she had not artistically
mastered the predicament fac
ing the Jewish wife, who, be
cause of the color of her hair
and the shape of her nose, could
no longer be herself.
The situation is neither tragic
nor pathetic. It is starkly gro
tesque. The structure of the
play is the simple vehicle of
Verfremdung (alienation) for
the author's ironic statement.
In the long opening telephone
conversation, a bitter, question
ing woman informs her friends
and family that she is leaving
for "not less than three weeks."
Any telephone conversation on
stage is technically difficult to
simulate. Partly because she

was nervous, Miss Medalis fail
ed to allow enough time to lapse
between her lines on the tele
phone. Once she missed a line
and took revenge on the phone
by shaking it. Isn't it better to
let a mistake slip by without
emphasizing it?
This would aeem to be minor
criticism. It does, however, lead
to my next point. Because one
couldn't imagine anyone on the
other end of the line, the whole
idea of the telephone good byes
was lost.
The disembodied voices on the
phone are impervious to her
flight. She does all the talking,
though, as she says, "Talking
is useless." Even her husband
doesn't understand.
Miss Medalis shone briefly at
this point, correctly actin as if
her husband weren't present.
What her performance lacked
was an intelligent build-up to
this anti-climatic moment. It
would perhaps have been better
to forget about the Jewish ac
cent, which only detracted as it
was pasted on and unconvincing.

tone for the wanderings of the

inclined to become hammy,

Chekhov.
Because he lacked discipline,
the transitions from the absurd

Feldner's acting is over con
scious and unsynchronized.
The comic person is invisible
to himself. As every actor
knows, hands have expressive
potential. These, however, when
not coupled with the lines, lose
their voice. Digest your lines,
Mr. Feldner, don't just chew
them.
Like Chekhov himself, this
man wants to run, to drift, to
flee from vulgarity. "If only I
could find a field, I would stand
there like a tree and watch the
bright moon. How it would be
not to remember anything."
Startlingly beautiful lines.
Chekhov's vision is profound
ly modern. His romantic dream
ers, like his Three Sisters and
Uucle Vanya, share the same
poetic inertia as Beckett's intel
lectual tramps, who spend all
their time trying to move.

The Mafia doesn't lack move

Lucille Medal is was Breacht's
Jewess. Her interpretation of a
very difficult role was flat.
With a timid voice, hardly
audible at times, and too sweet
for Brecht, Miss Medalis showed
that she had not artistically
mastered the predicament fac
ing the Jewish wife, who, be
cause of the color of her hair
and the shape of her nose, could
no longer be herself.
The situation is neither tragic
nor pathetic. It is starkly gro
tesque. The structure of the
play is the simple vehicle of
Verfremdung (alienation) for
the author's ironic statement.
In the long opening telephone
conversation, a bitter, question
ing woman informs her friends
and family that she is leaving
for "not less than three weeks."
Any telephone conversation on
stage is technically difficult to
simulate. Partly because she

was nervous, Miss Medalis fail
ed to allow enough time to lapse
between her lines on the tele
phone. Once she missed a line
and took revenge on the phone
by shaking it. Isn't it better to
let a mistake slip by without
emphasizing it?
This would aeem to be minor
criticism. It does, however, lead
to my next point. Because one
couldn't imagine anyone on the
other end of the line, the whole
idea of the telephone good byes
was lost.
The disembodied voices on the
phone are impervious to her
flight. She does all the talking,
though, as she says, "Talking
is useless." Even her husband
doesn't understand.
Miss Medalis shone briefly at
this point, correctly actin as if
her husband weren't present.
What her performance lacked
was an intelligent build-up to
this anti-climatic moment. It
would perhaps have been better
to forget about the Jewish ac
cent, which only detracted as it
was pasted on and unconvincing.
Chekhov and Brecht are a chal

their Saturday night caper at
the Nitery, they attacked Chek
hov's The Harmlessne.ss of
Smoking Tobacco and Brechts
The Jewish Wife.
The delicate half-humor of
Chekhov's monologue is a good
