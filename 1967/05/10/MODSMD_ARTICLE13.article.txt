# Journal Reveals No Consensus In Saigon
## 
### HOLT RUFFIN (First of Two Parts) 
The goulash that follows
comes from my journal and
memory. It's the product of
twelve weeks spent working for
International Voluntary Ser
vices in Vietnam. Anybody in
terested in IVS, to my mind the
organization doing the best com
munity work in South Vietnam,
should write its head office at
1555 Connecticut Ave., N. W.,
Washington, D.C. 20036.
"I tell you frankly," the old
man said, leaning forward and
tapping his knee after a long
silence, "il n'a pas de politique."
I had met the white-headed gen
tleman, a yoga adept as it hap
pened, at the home of Mr.
Chuong on my first Sunday in
Saigon. Both Vietnamese, Mr.
Chuong and the elder were em
ployees of BGI, a large French

bottling company. A 1 Williams
and I were seated around four
beers and a small table which
was bed, dining, and living room
at one time. The old man was
speaking of Johnson.
"He sends us young Ameri
cans, healthy young Americans,
to lose their lives in a useless
war. You cannot win. The VC
are invisible, you Americans are
evident everywhere. Moreover
the VC will starve, they will suf
fer acutely, but they will con
tinue the war. To add one hun
dred thousand more Americans
is futile, you cannot budge the
VC."
I asked about the desirability
of a communist South Vietnam.
"As for myself, I am not a
communist. I was an officer in
the Viet Minh in the late forties,
but since the French left I have
withdrawn from politics and

public life. I do not like, to be
sure, the government of Nguyen
Cao Ky, but at ihe same time I
think communist societies are
too regimented. Yet, while com
munist societies may be too reg
imented, at least with them
comes the guarantee of peace
and social order."
A Social Question
"You know,"he said, slightly
sententiously, "the question in
Vietnam is a social question."
To this appraisal the normal
ly taciturn Mr. Chuong nodded
his head in vigorous assent, re
peating, "Oui, c'est une question
soeiale."
The old man continued, now
more passionate. "Just look out
side. Our people defecate in the
streets; thieves, prostitutes, and
embezzlers rule the city. In re
cent years it has been rare that
I leave my room."

"Now in communist cities
there are no nightclubs and the
boulevards are clean, the people
honest. That is why the poor
like communism."
We talked generally about
governments, racism in the
Urited States, religions, and
yoga in particular. The old man
viewed the war as the Vietna
mese people's karma, their des
tiny and just deserts for their
historic conquest of southern
Indochina and their expulsion
am. 1 subjugation of the Khmer
and Cham.
"The past sins of the Vietna
mese people are great ..." the
old man was saying when Mr.
Chuong interrupted: "Mais on
a psiye cher deja."
Delightful Candor
We had been talking for three
hours and A 1 Williams and I
were due back at our lodgings

on the outskirts of Saigon. The
old man, seeing us prepare to
take leave of him, begged for
giveness for anything he might
have said which was offensive;
but we only protested our de
light at his candor. Thus spur
red perhaps, he bade us fare
well with this final admonish
ment ;
"When you return to the
United States, go tell your
friends, tell your friends that
in Vietnam you met un grand
fon, a great fool — the kind of
man for whom nationalism
meant little, an old man who
loved peace more than war, who
sought truth instead of profit.
Yes, I am a great fool. But
Nguyen Cao Ky, Nguyen Van
Thieu, and all their cohorts . . .
they are little fools."
We rose, thanking both men
for their honesty and hospital

ity, and left, elated by the con
versation. Together with five
other Stanford students in Viet
nam for a summer work proj
ect, A 1 and I nad been in Sai
gon only a couple of days and
were happy and gratified to find
a person who would speak to us
with such fearlessness in a
country where mere advocacy
of peace or neutralism was
grounds for severe punishment,
where listening to Hanoi on
one's private radio brought the
risk of arrest, where any Amer
ican not dressed in fatigues was
suspected of working for the
CIA.
Unfortunately, as the summer
passed, I was to find that our
feeling of satisfaction of that
first Sunday in Saigon would
rarely repeat itself. For the Viet
namese I was to meet in the
course of my stay, when not so
guarded as to refuse to answer
or just to say "yes" to every
query, often were plainly unin
formed or misinformed.
Censorship
That censorship and govern
ment control of the press and
other media poison public opin
ion was a truth that grew more
profound in its import as I
talked to more and more Viet
namese. Not totally unlike the
pate de foie gras producers in
Strasbourg who force-feed their
geese to inflame and disease
their livers, the Vietnamese and
American powers in Saigon im
pose distortions and half truths

Kuffin spent 12 weeks in South Vietnam last summer under the
auspices of the International Volunteer Service. He was the team
leader of seven Stanford students working in Vietnam. Presently
he is associate director of Volunteers In Asia, which was organized
last year on the Stanford campus. He is also now completing his
undergraduate work in Social Thought.
Parts of this article consist of entries in his journal of last sum

two will appear tomorrow.

on the public mind to the point
of mass misunderstanding and
distrust.
In addition to the perverse in
fluence of the media, which re
quired me to qualify and evalu
ate carefully the substance of
conversations with Vietnamese
friends, there were other ca
veats, more biographical in na
ture. Most of the Vietnamese I
could communicate with at Dis
trict Right were university grad
uates; many came from relative
ly well-to-do backgrounds, were
emigres from the North in 1954,
Catholics, and on the payroll of
the Government of South Viet
nam.
These factors conditioned,

though to be sure did not ex
plain, their subscription to an
essentially "aggression • from -
without" view of the Viet Cong
and their reluctance to ascribe
any possible benefits to commu
nist rule of South Vietnam.
There were cases, moreover, of
friends whose families had suf
fered at the hands of the Viet
Minh in the North and who
rightly feared acts of reprisal
from the Viet Cong in the South.
Conversations
Such qualifications and limi
tations notwithstanding, I learn
ed a great deal from conversa
tions with my working associ
ates. Their thinking always
showed subtlety, and some
times objectivity. I recall ask
ing a friend what would happen
if the South were to liberate the
North, as Ky has threatened.
My friend had seen the Viet
Minh bind his father, drive nails
up his nostrils, and float him
down the Red River, but he was
objective enough to say that po
litical reprisals would be as
much of a danger if the North
"went free" as if the South
went Communist.
Eventually I came to accent
comments of Vietnamese friends
in Saigon, whenever they ex
ceeded the substance of simple
life experience, for what they
usually were: hearsay. Behind
all my questioning had been an
almost bull-headed desire to find
a total consensus among Viet
namese which was plainly not

there. Apart from a great war
weariness and a general sense
of alienation from Americans,
there were few other apparent
outlooks or beliefs shared uni
formly by the Vietnamese! I
knew.
So I learned to give up search
ing for easy and rapid interpre
tations and to continue to
questions, to remain interested,
even if — indeed especially
since — I knew that few ans
wers I received would justify
generalizations or lend them
selves to interpretation. I real
ized that I would probably ltfarn
as much from what I saw dur
ing the summer as from what I
heard. "
