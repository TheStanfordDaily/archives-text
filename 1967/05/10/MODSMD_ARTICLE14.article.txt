# Macau: Study In Cultural Contrast
## 
### BILL KELSO 
I can still vividly remember
alighting from the hydrofoil and
setting foot for the first time in
the Portuguese colony of Macau.
Along with two other Stanford
students, I had arrived in Macau
as part of a group called the
Volunteers in Asia, to work part
time for a Catholic welfare cen
ter and to teach school.
On shore waiting for our ar
rival was Father Patrick
Shaules, an American Jesuit,
who was to assist us in becom
ing adjusted to and acquainted
with the people and problems of
Macau. Father Shaules, who is
a story in himself, is a very
large, husky man, with a weath
er-beaten face, finely combed
grey hair and a slight but jovial
smile always on his lips.
I can remember that this trace
of a smile soon expanded into
a broad grin when he greeted
us by saying "Welcome every
one to Macau, the hotspot of
Asia." He then offered one of
us a ride into the colony on the
back of his recently purchased
Honda 150. While Father's hy
perbole at first struck us as fun
ny, we were to read six months

later that his greeting was more
descriptive of Macau than we
first thought.
Entering The Town
But at that time with only
the drowsy dock workers and
the slow plodding Portuguese
officials to go by, we laughed
and proceeded to enter the town.
Since I was the biggest of the
new arrivals and the taxicabs
could more accurately be called
"petite" cabs, I was nominated
to take the first "priestly" trip
into the colony.
Because Macau has a fine two
lane highway by the oceanside
to accommodate its Grand Prix
race in the winter, Father
Shaules managed to speed up
my arrival to the province by
opening the throttle on his
motorcycle full blast. What
would they say back home, I
remember thinking, as this man
of the cloth in his white flowing
robes and I, a lanky 6'3", leaned
into the curves and sped over a
short hill into the colony like
old "pro" bike riders.
My bizarre entrance into the
province, however, was matched
by the city itself. As I went over
the ridge by the water front I
could see the whole peninsula,

slightly bent in the middle,
.spread out before me. Looming
largo in the background was
Red China, whose hills seemed
to dominate and cast their shad
ows over the placid dwellings
of the town. Only a single thread
of water separated Macau's
western shore from its large
neighbor, and the constant

movement of junks, patrol boats
and fishing vessels between
these land areas seemed to pull
the two living spaces even
closer together.
Separate And Distinct
But once we were in the midst
of the colony, Macau became
completely separate and uniqu
ely distinct. For this colony,
which is only a stone's throw
from Mao's homeland, appeared

misplaced in Asia and better
suited for a European country
side. Certainly the majority of
the people were Chinese—9s per
cent in fact, and as I walked
down the street I could hear the
constant chatter of the Chinese
language—the ascending and
descending tones repeated over
and over again.
Every person, it seemed, was
a high-pitched rock-and-roll sing
er not content to just talk to his
friends, but forced by the inner
structure of his language to sing
to those he met in the streets.
The notion of harmony existing
between people, I thought, must
certa inly be more true, in a lit
eral sense, of the Chinese peo
ple than it is of the monotone
speaking Westerners.
When in the course of my
summer stay, I realized I could
never master the various tones
of the Chinese language, I would
try speaking Chinese by raising
and lowering my eyebrows in
the hope that my facial move
ment would compensate for the
flatness of my tones.
liuropean Appearance
Despite this language factor
and niy experiences with it, the
town of Macau was European
and riot Oriental in appearance.
From the cobbled winding
streets, to the balconied two
story buildings, to the majestic
minia:ure castle of the Bishop
and the large, yet worn and
tired 112 ort of the Portuguese sol
diers, the mark of Europe was
present everywhere.
But this mark of European in
fluence like the architectural
conditions of the fort seemed
worn out, belonging to a past
age, tolerated in the present but
perhaps destined to oblivion in
the future. As I came to know
the pi ovince better, I began to
notice the incongruous combin
ation of Portuguese, Catholic,
and Communist elements that
existed side by side in the col
ony. F'or the Catholic Church
ran most of the schools, and the
Communists operated most of
the businesses (and were, ironic
ally enough, the best capitalists
around), and the Portuguese
ostensibly governed the colony,
all significantly influencing the
life of the community.
Maybe my experiences had
been limited and my capacity
to imagine restricted, but living
in this city affected me in a way
quite di Terently than I imagined
it would. When I boarded the
boat for Macau, learned the
greeting word, "Nehoma" (said
with raised eyebrows), I felt I
was coming to Asia, to live and
teach avid learn from the Chi
nese ancl come to some apprecia
tion of their culture and outlook
towards life.
East-West Mix
But in Macau I met and felt
intimately close to a people for
whom the label "Chinese"
seemed inappropriat \ for the
word concealed more than it re
vealed. 1 n terms of race the
people I met were definitely Chi
nese, but in terms of their atti
tudes and outlooks they were
a curious mixture of Western
and Eastern influence.

Because I was acquainted only
with students, I do not know if
their parents, who bore the hard
ships of a different history, still
viewed the world in the light of
traditional Chinese attitudes.
But their children, because of
political circumstances, exhib
ited traits of two different cul
tures.
In coming to know these stu
dents, however, there were
many obstacles I had to over
come, one of which was the
formality of their school system.
To illustrate: when I entered my
very first school class, with my
stomach aflutter and my nerves
on edge, the students automatic
ally stood up and said in a
cheery chorus "Good morning,
sir!". Since I had been called
many things in my life but
never "sir," I was naturally em
barrassed by this procedure. To
prevent its recurrence I insisted
that the class call me Bill from
then on. But to my chagrin all
my students had a penchant for
transforming "sir" into a sur
name and consequently they
called me "Bill Sir" throughout
the summer.
Despite this formal pupil
teacher relationship I feel I
came to know some of my stu
dents well. Many had left, the
mainland as children wh-n the
Communists took over the coun
try in 1949, but as they had be
come 16 and 17 years old, I de
tected on their part a strong
desire to identify with their
country and to be proud of its
achievements. But these very
kids, because of the realities of
their situation, were enrolled in
English speaking schools, learn
ing Western history and cus
toms, and practicing a Western
religion, Catholicism.
Appreciate The Situation
I'm not sure I ever learned to
fully appreciate their situation,
but I often try to imagine what
it would be like if I lived in San
Francisco, a Portuguese colony,
and studied at. a Chinese school
to "get ahead" because I could
not return to the rest of the
United States for political rea
sons.
But as I sit here writing this
article six months after setting
foot in Macau, I read in the
papers that conditions are not
the same in the colony as they
were when 1 left them. With
the advent of the Christmas
season there have been violent
riots in the Macau streets and
eight Chinese now lie dead
along with a Portuguese soldier.
The Communists, it seems,
armed with the thoughts of Mao
Tse-Tung, appear intent on re
fashioning the colony by reduc
ing or perhaps eliminating Por
tuguese influence and power.
As a consequence, Father
Shaules's smile which accomp
anied his greeting to the hot
spot of Asia may prove to be
more prophetic than sardonic.
And if it is prophetic, then the
Father's smile will be a source
of sadness to me, for I feel a
close attachment to my stu
dents whose homes lie neither in
Portuguese Macau nor Com
munist China.
