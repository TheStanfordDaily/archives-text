# Peace Corpsman Describes Orientation, Work In Colombia
## 
### STEPHEN B. BERGREN 
A week after I graduated
from Stanford I registered for
Peace Corps training at Bran
deis University in Waltham,
Mass. My training group started
out with 125 people, including
eleven from Cal. I was the only
one from Stanford.
My training group included
those going into secondary and
university education, education
al television and adult literacy.
I was also within a smaller
group of six engineers, the only
ones going into university edu
cation. We had Spanish courses
which were fairly intensive, but
which should have been more so,
and we received instruction in
the history, geography, culture,
customs, and problems of Col
ombia.
After ten days at home trying
to explain that we weren't go
ing to live in mud huts and eat
bananas, we flew to Bogata, the
capital city. When we landed I
looked around at my group of,
now, only 80, and was pleased to
see not one person with stars in
his eyes. I think the stereotype
of the young American idealist
out to solve the world's prob
lems ought to be eliminated.
Orientation
We had a five-day orientation
period in Bogota, when we heard
short speeches given by what
must have been every American
in the capital. During this period
we got our first taste of what it
is like to be a real focal point
of attention—not so much of
ihe average Bogotano, who sees

a fair number of Americans—
but of the efficient army of Bo
gota's con men.
After orientation in Bogota,
the five other engineers and I
came here to the Universidad
Technologica in Pereira, and be
gan further orientation.
The Universidad Technologica
is a five year school, and though
the quality of professors and of
students isn't as high as at Stan
ford, I found that the quantity
of material presented is at least
as great as at Stanford.
The university found families
for us, and we tried to fit into
the flow of things. We have
"GRINGO" branded on our fore
heads, though, and we aren't as
incognito as we would like.
Three of my conpanedos left
several weeks ago for the city
of Bucaramanga, leaving here
in Pereira one engineer for each
of the three departments—in
dustrial, electrical, and mechan
ical engineering. I find the in
dustrial engineering department
very enjoyable, perhaps more
so because there is another PCV
industrial engineer here. And
what's more, he has his B.S. and
M.S. from Stanford.
Special Projects
Since we arrived in the middle
of a semester, we have no
courses to teach, but instead
have been working on various
special projects. I have spent
a considerable amount of time
working on a curriculum project
for the industrial engineering
department, but have also done
some busy work correcting

homework assignments and
proctoring exams I have had
(he opportunity to give several
lectures .in computer science
and engineering economy, and
have found out that it takes a
lot of concentration to speak
entirely in Spanish.
Colombians (or rather Pereir
anos) seem to be much more
provincial than Americans,
many of them never having
gone more than a hundred miles
from their birthplace. The only
people who have ever been
someplace besides Colombia are
the very wealthy, and even for
them the world outside is sel
dom more than Miami, or maybe
New York.
Class Distinctions
The very small upper class,
with which I have had a fair
amount of contact, seems to
have developed (through years
of careful breeding) a healthy
dislike for work of any type.
Columbia lacks much of the
material affluence that exists in
the U.S., but if you can get away
from a United States' frame of
reference, you find that very few
people are desperately poor. Cer
tainly they need help to increase
their health and education
levels, but a picture of desper
ate souls crying out from their
"misery" would certainly be an
inaccurate one. Here a man may
work to buy a second shirt in
stead of a second television set,
but if h<> is happier with his sec
ond shirt that! his counterpart
with litis second television set. . .
