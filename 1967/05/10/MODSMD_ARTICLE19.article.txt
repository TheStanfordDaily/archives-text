# Anti-Draft Signers Deserve Support

Editor, The Daily:
Almost a year ago, I sent the
following letter to President
Johnson:
"Dear Mr. President:
At the present time, I am a
consultant to the Agency for
International Development (US
OM in Korea), and I am an oc
casional consultant to the Sec
retary of the Treasury. Today I
have written to Dr. David Bell
and to Mr. Henry Fowler ask
ing that my contracts with them
'>e terminated.
"I have requested this because
I can no longer associate my
self, directly or indirectly, with
our government's Vietnam poli
cies. I consider these policies to
be outrageous and barbarous.
The costs that we are willing
to pay in human suffering are
beyond belief; and all in pursuit
of goals that cannot possibly be
attained by such violence and de
struction.
"For these reasons, my con
science will not permit me any
longer to serve my govern
ment."
I do not see how anyone, who
is at all aware of what is going
on, can any longer remain silent.
What I did a year ago did not
cost me very much. But what
more than 160 Stanford young
sters did last week, in pledging
that they would not be drafted
or, if drafted, would not serve in
Vietnam—that they would not
directly contribute to this im
moral and senseless war—this
may cost them quite a bit. I
applaud them for their coura
geous act and hope that their
elders will take a moment out
from their government-spons
ored research to give these
young men the moral and fi
nancial support they have asked
for and deserve.

• A Suggestion
Editor, The Daily:
I just read the March-April
edition of Stanford Review, and
would like to suggest that any
one, who is involved in the Viet
nam debates, read the editorial
on page 32 entitled "McCarthy
ism 1967." Mr. Endsley has a
profound message for both
sides of the Vietnam contro
versy, or for that matter, of
any controversy.

• Flying High
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to offer my own
review of the Jefferson Airplane
in protest to the inadequate and
inaccurate one published in
Tuesday's Daily:
This Sunday a group which
the M.C. pointed out to the au
dience had recently gained na
tional recognition bombed at
Frost Amphitheater. After 10
minutes of warming up its en
gines with some really nice,
hard-driving rock, The Jefferson
Airplane feathered its impellers
and to the appropriate tune of
"You're Bringing Me Down"
taxied back to the hanger. The
flight was cancelled due to un
favorable weather conditions in
the Bowl which was filled with
a clammy, grey grud William
Burroughs has called "American
Drag". The grud appeared to
congeal from the breath of the
semi-comatose spectators lining
the bowl. A few joined hands
and did a Sun dance in an at
tempt to dispel the grud, but to
no avail.
Despite recent signs of life
such as the sit-ins, The Experi
ment and changed attitudes
toward student government,
Stanford students, if not so
many Jack-the-Bears, appear to
be Straight-arrows. Perhaps a
liquor ration issued at the gate
would liberate Stanford fore
brains for a sufficient period.
Our congratulations to who
ever set up the sound system
as he appeared to have solved
the problem presented by such

an outdoor concert, at least from
the viewpoint of the $2.50 seats.
Among the highlights of the
performance were "Fat Angel"
and a beautiful instrumental
number which the Airplane
played for itself after giving up.
It is clear that Jazz is having
an increasingly larger influence
on rock and not only in the
blues bag.
The audience stank.

• Help!
Editor, The Daily:
Why is Tresidder food even
more expensive than it was last
year, and even less tasty? Why
is there a smaller selection of
fodders than there used to be?
Why was the short-order area
designed to promote chaos?
Is there any better place on
campus for a grad student to
eat? If so, I would like to know?
(Sorry, Encina doesn't qualify.)

• Contrary To Merry
Editor, The Daily:
I share one view with Bruce
Merry, author of " 'Funny' Ca
sino Royale Traditional Bond
Spoor', and that is that the
film is a great one. But this is
not enough, in my view, to jus
tify Merry's unadulterated gar
bage, which passes as a Film
Review. He fails to distinguish
the book from the film, a danger
which can only lead to the mud
dled irrelevancy which has flow
ed so freely from Mr. Merry's
pen.
Furthermore, if Mr. Merry is
trying to impress upon us all
his eclectic education, (please

use the word "medley" instead
of "farrago", no one is impress
ed by the fact that you own a
Roget's Thesaurus), I would
rather he didn't do it at the ex
pense of the best film out this
year.
And one last word, it is pos
sible to enjoy both A Man and A
Woman and Casino Royale at
the same time. Since I have
been here at Stanford I have
found that the T.A.'s have the
worst taste in movies and the
worst reasons for liking the few
they do. Mr. Merry, T.A. in Ital
ian, has only reinforced this im
pression.

• Danger Ahead
Editor, The Daily:
A serious, and, I think, dan
gerous step has been taken in
the attitude toward free inquiry
on this campus. It seems now
that the liberal American ideo
logy of free speech and inquiry
is becoming an argument
against political activism, and
an instrument toward the sup
pression of political controver
sey and the repression of ser
ious ideological inquiry.
We are told by Dean Smith:
"The political and educational
objectives of The Experiment
seem to me to be contradictory.
Education should be conducted
in a climate of free inquiry."
The assumption guiding such a
remark is simply that the truth
is so obscure and life so totally
out of our control that to form
judgments and act accordingly
is a breach of free inquiry. That
freedom of inquiry has no value

in an atmosphere where there
is no outlet for action. If the
gap between the two is sus
tained, ultimately free inquiry
ceases to exist except in any
formal way (e.g.: Humphrey)
and then ceases to exist at all.
Further, this community is
both politically and education
ally organized. There is an ideo
logy which permits Arbuckle of
the Business School to say that
there is no reason that working
for the Defense Department
creates a danger to the univer
sity. He is correct. The univer
sity operates in a political en
vironment that allows, no, de
mands, an academic institution
to contribute heavily to the
status quo. For the good Dean,
what is, is true; after all, it de
livers the goods. And the much
abused idea of free inquiry, the
free inquiry that Humphrey
will defend, is a part of what is.
But there must be someone
to challenge the ideology of the
university itself. To label that
kind of dissent as treasonous is
one thing; that can be countered.
To label it a danger to free dis
cussion is another and far more
dangerous accusation. Freedom
of speech and discussion can
and are being invoked against
those who dissent from the
status quo.
The notion "freedom" be
comes repressive when an ef
fort to use that freedom is
labeled a danger to freedom. To
act for a meaningful change in
the institutions in which we
exist is the most sacred ground
of freedom. It is a most serious
violation of freedom to presume
that only the truth of things
as they are can be known, and
then challenge those who act as
dangerous to freedom because

they are dangerous to things as
they are. That would only be
true if we were fully free in our
present structures. But we are
not fully free as long as politi
cal and social repression exist,
and it is possible, and perfectly
logical, to maintain that "that
which is cannot be true." (Ed
nest Bloch).
Those who are now attacking
the left, and specifically The Ex
periment, and that includes Dean
Smith, for violating free dis
cussion on the campus are doing
the greatest damage to the tra
dition they defend.
