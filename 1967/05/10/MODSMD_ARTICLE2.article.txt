# Voting Continues
## Potential Election Complications Settled 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Today is the final day of balloting
in this year's ASSU elections, and
complications which almost prevented
voting from taking place yesterday
* ave finally been settled.
The runoff elections are for the
positions of Senior Class President
and Vice President, and National Stu
dent Association representative. Also
">n the ballot is a referendum on the
question of whether the practice of
computing class rankings should be
" ontinued.

The problems with yesterday's vot
ing began last week when Elections
Commissioner Bill Berry began to
look for volunteers to man the polling
places. By the weekend he had been
unsuccessful in finding any.
Over the weekend, he reports, he
tried to contact the Senior Class Pres
idential candidates, Mark Fogelman
and Soleng Tom, to ask them to
supply volunteers from among their
own supporters. These people would
have worked in pairs, one from each
camp.
Monday afternoon, when Tom was

ifinally reached, he said he could
provide several dozen poll watchers.
Contacted at dinner time, Fogelman
said he could not provide workers on
such short notice and said further that
the polls should be manned by non
partisan volunteers.
At a Judicial Council meeting Mon
day night, which had been called orig
inally to consider other matters, Fog
elman repeated his objections and
Tom concurred with them. The Judi
cial Council suggested that Berry
hire student policemen and offered

to appropriate funds to pay their sal
aries.
Berry was unable late Monday
night to hire student poilce for yes
terday's voting, but at the last min
ute, he found enough volunteers to
man the polls yesterday. These in
cluded people recruited by Tom, Berry
and The Daily. Student police have
been hired to supervise the polling
places today.
Judicial Council Chairman Martin
Gerry suggested yesterday that
LASSU be responsible for getting
people to act as poll watchers. He
said LASSU might establish "some
kind of labor pool" for this kind of
work.
Berry said yesterday that the "basic
problem is not having a commission
per se . . . , not having people to work
with me." He added that he was ap

pointed to the post last fall, rather
than the previous spring when this
year's ASSU officers were elected.
He had had no previous experience
and was given minimal training when
he took the job, he said.
LASSU is expected to certify the
vote count of the primary and run
off elections at its regular meeting
tomorrow evening. The routine ac
tion will precede consideration of
three fundamental standard violation
charges arising from last week's elec
tion. These charges will be taken up
at a hearing of the Judicial Council
next Monday. If they are upheld,
they could invalidate the election.
