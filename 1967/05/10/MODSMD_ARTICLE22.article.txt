## Ending Ranking Denies Choice 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
How can a University, or
rather a group within a Uni
versity depriving its members
of an opportunity (as distin
guished from the "right") to
complete their undergraduate
education? Unfortunately most
local draft boards do not under
stand the moral crises of college
and university students (and
faculty committees). They mere
ly try to perform as equitable
a job as possible under the pres
ent arrangement. The Selective
Service System is a legal sanc
tion which individuals can
choose to adhere to or dissent
from. It is an individual choice
which is easy to perpetrate—if
you don't want your draft board
to receive your class ranking in
dicate this choice to the National
Service Office, but don't elimin
ate this opportunity to choose
for all of us. No matter what
the Anti-Draft Union may claim,
the idiosyncrasies of local draft
boards and the ambiguities of
the Selective Service System
make the class-ranking refer
endum on the ASSU ballot a
direct denial of the Stanford
male's right to choose how he
will react to war and the Selec
tive Service.

Editor, The Daily:
Again, I feel I must clarify
a statement printed in yester
day's Daily. While I am fairly
sure that we will not lose our
right to free speech by a sus
pension of the First Amend
ment, I find myself a bit more
hesitant each day to say any
thing when a Daily reporter is
around. Letters of clarification
are both annoying and inadequ
ate, but seem frequent and nec
essary of late.
In Michael Kuhl's front-page
article on the noon rally about
the ranking referendum my re
marks were seriously mis-rep
resented. My statement about
Peter Lyman's election was that
1800 people had voted for a plat
form which stressed three
things: the necessity of the uni
versity maintaining itself as a
critical agent, apart from the
unnecessary political strictures
of society; the importance of
real choice in how one lives his
life as a student; and the irrele
vance of grades to anything.
I went on to say that from
these principles I found it advis
able to support the anti-rank
ing referendum. Peter Lyman
did not say anywhere in his ex
tensive campaign literature or
in his frequent speeches that he
was running "on a platform of
not co-operating with the pres
ent draft system."
My deductions and my objec
tions to ranking are my own. I
would ask, however, that Daily
reporters in the future either
check their story and facts with
the speaker when he has finish
ed, or forget that he has spoken.

• Class Rankings
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to the statement

Registrar Harvey Hall advises
that class rankings are not

These rankings also are used
in conjunction with applications
to graduate and professional
schools when requested by stu

Grades are somewhat arbi
trary but they satisfy the de
mands of a complex educational
system better than any alterna
tive. Few would contend that
the difference between a C+ and
B- performance was measurable.
Yet as we all know that line
must be drawn somewhere.
Grades now, however, are being
used by an organization out
side of the system that assigns
them and in doing so under
stands what they are. The draft
boards are sorting out students
in a very exacting manner.
Males in the Class of 1967 with
above a 3.167 are permitted to
go on, the residual % is not.
The impact of this sorting is
not restricted to draft eligible
males. If it became precisely
evident GPA's do determine a
student's future struggling for
grades would intensify. Some
would probably derive a better
education for themselves, others
might join the ROTC or badger
teachers more about last quar
ter's marks. I feel though that
the net will be bad; personal
relationships will be further
strained and the development of
intellectual attitudes weakened.
Therefore, I will vote for the
proposal in today's election ask

Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to Mr. Kugelmass'
emotional reference to the "In-
Crowd" paper as a "typical hate
sheet befitting Southern racist
attempts," we consider the
S.F.E. statements a demonstra
tion of concern for the Stanford
community. Perhaps Grove
House and Beta Chi should not
have been implicated, but the
basic contention of S.F.E. was
that The Daily has been using
"editorial bias in the guise of
objective newswriting," as was
emphasized in the second leaf
let of S.F.E.
We believe that news manage
ment by The Daily was the real
issue in this election, not the
candidates' platforms. This
should not have been the case,
but The Daily obscured the real
issues in the election through
de-emphasizing and misrepre
senting the contentions of var
ious candidates — for documen
tation one need only read The
Daily campaign coverage over
the last two weeks.
Two clear points emerge from
this election: 1) There was in

The Daily staff, as S.F.E. con
tended, a concentration of loyal
ties to the winning candidate. 2)
The Daily's quality of coverage
was far below that which is re
quired in a one-newspaper com
munity.
If The Daily is not to be right
fully accused of biased and ir
responsible news coverage, it
must take precautions necessary
to insure its objectivity.
Were S.F.E.'s contentions a
"combination of paranoia and
irresponsibility" as The Daily
maintains? We urge the Stan
ford community to make that
decision on the basis of adequ
ate information. ("The 'In-
Crowd'," "Rebuttal to the Stan
ford Daily," the May 3 KZSU
editorial, reprinted by S.F.E.,
and the Daily's concern with
that campaign.)
This year's election is over,
but The Daily is still our domi
nant source of news. Our con
cern should then be a continu
ous concern, a concern over the
quality and objectivity of the
news we read.

• Man 9 s World
Editor, The Daily:
Granted, there are only 2,582
women undergraduates at Stan
ford. There are 8,729 men. As
every Stanford man can tell
you, women are in the minority
here. It's a man's world and if
you have any doubts, check out
the sports page of your trusty
copy of The Stanford Daily
What do you see? Flashy head
lines and photos proclaim the
physical prowess of the Stan
ford Male.
Look closely, check the fine
print, and if its the right day
(your odds are 1 in 5) you may
glimpse an undernourished col
umn entitled Broadside, a new
comer to The Daily's pages this
year. If your typical Stanford
mind is clicking, you may asso
ciate the column with women's
sports. So far so good.
But don't get too excited.
You'll rarely see a photo of a
female athlete (we do have
them), or get much more infor
mation than a few dry, dull,
and perhaps meaningless scores.
This type of discrimination hits
not only women's sports but
also the many coeducational ac
tivities sponsored by WRA,
ranging from co-rec tennis,
bowling, and folk dancing to
more predominately male sports
such as riflery. The fewer peo
ple (and especially if they are
women) involved in a sport, the
closer it comes to sinking into
the damning oblivion of being
totally ignoral by The Daily.
Take the Rifle Team for ex
ample, (yes, Stanford has one,
complete with four girls). Last
weekend they shot at Reno in
the Nevada Invitational, a major
event including 14 schools from
western states. A good sized
article was turned into The
Daily for Broadside. After sur
gery, one sentence appeared in
Friday's column. The miracu
lous article on Stanford's hew
range two weeks ago was the
only publicity the team and peo
ple interested in shooting have
gotten all year.
In effect, The Daily discrimi

nates against the "minor lea
gue" activities as well as wom
en's sports in general. What can
be done? Our recommendation is
that an editor of women's sports
be appointed to act as a laison
between The Daily and WRA.
It is time for The Daily sports
page to oavercome its "big lea
gue" complex, realize that there
really is a vital segment of the
Stanford community interested
in the less glamorous sports,
and see to it that these activi
ties are publicized. At risk of
using a much overworked term,
LASSU isn't the only institution
at Stanford which should be
more representative.

• On The Edge?
Editor, The Daiiy:
I simply cannot understand
how Stanford students can talk
so cheerfully about their school
achieving greatness. The quality
of a school generally follows its
endowment, and as of last year
Stanford ranked only about 30th
nationally in endowment per stu
dent. At Harvard, a school with
which Stanford often compares,
more than twice as much of the
cost for educating each student
is derived from endowment.
And the gap is going to get
worse, not better. Only 10% of
last year's graduating class gave
to Stanford. For Harvard and
Princeton the comparable fig
ures were 71% and 56%.
At Stanford, as at most East
ern schools, tuition covers less
than one-half the cost of educat
ing a student. At these Eastern
schools there is a feeling of re
sponsibility among seniors to re
pay this other half after gradu
ating, but Stanford students ap
parently have little such feeling.
Stanford has made remark
able progress the past 10 years
through an unprecedented num
ber of annual gifts. However, be
cause of the limited endowment,
these gifts must be increased
even further in coming years
just to maintain current pro
grams. And this will never be
done when less than 10% of
the seniors, and 25% of the
alumni, care enough to give.
In education, as in most other
things, you get what you pay
for. And most Stanford students
are not willing to pay for great
ness.

Those of us who are concerned

Editor, The Daiiy:
I simply cannot understand
how Stanford students can talk
so cheerfully about their school
achieving greatness. The quality
of a school generally follows its
endowment, and as of last year
Stanford ranked only about 30th
nationally in endowment per stu
dent. At Harvard, a school with
which Stanford often compares,
more than twice as much of the
cost for educating each student
is derived from endowment.
And the gap is going to get
worse, not better. Only 10% of
last year's graduating class gave
to Stanford. For Harvard and
Princeton the comparable fig
ures were 71% and 56%.
At Stanford, as at most East

than one-half the cost of educat
ing a student. At these Eastern
schools there is a feeling of re
sponsibility among seniors to re
pay this other half after gradu
ating, but Stanford students ap
parently have little such feeling.
Stanford has made remark
able progress the past 10 years
through an unprecedented num
ber of annual gifts. However, be
cause of the limited endowment,
these gifts must be increased
even further in coming years
just to maintain current pro
grams. And this will never be
done when less than 10% of
the seniors, and 25% of the

In education, as in most other

a statement printed in yester

In Michael Kuhl's front-page

Peter Lyman's election was that
1800 people had voted for a plat

real choice in how one lives his

I went on to say that from

• Class Rankings
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to the statement
made in your editorial Tuesday,
Registrar Harvey Hall advises
that class rankings are not

to graduate and professional

Editor, The Daily:
Grades are somewhat arbi
trary but they satisfy the de
mands of a complex educational
system better than any alterna
tive. Few would contend that
the difference between a C+ and
B- performance was measurable.
Yet as we all know that line
must be drawn somewhere.
Grades now, however, are being
used by an organization out
side of the system that assigns
them and in doing so under
stands what they are. The draft
boards are sorting out students
in a very exacting manner.
Males in the Class of 1967 with
above a 3.167 are permitted to
go on, the residual % is not.
The impact of this sorting is
not restricted to draft eligible
males. If it became precisely
evident GPA's do determine a
student's future struggling for
grades would intensify. Some
would probably derive a better
education for themselves, others
might join the ROTC or badger
teachers more about last quar
ter's marks. I feel though that
the net will be bad; personal
relationships will be further
strained and the development of
intellectual attitudes weakened.
Therefore, I will vote for the
proposal in today's election ask

tinue the policy of giving class
rankings to the Selective Ser

• Dilly-Dally?
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to Mr. Kugelmass'
emotional reference to the "In-
Crowd" paper as a "typical hate
sheet befitting Southern racist
attempts," we consider the
S.F.E. statements a demonstra
tion of concern for the Stanford
community. Perhaps Grove
House and Beta Chi should not
have been implicated, but the
basic contention of S.F.E. was
that The Daily has been using
"editorial bias in the guise of
objective newswriting," as was
emphasized in the second leaf
let of S.F.E.
We believe that news manage
ment by The Daily was the real
issue in this election, not the
candidates' platforms. This
should not have been the case,
but The Daily obscured the real
issues in the election through
de-emphasizing and misrepre
senting the contentions of var
ious candidates — for documen
tation one need only read The
Daily campaign coverage over
the last two weeks.
Two clear points emerge from
this election: 1) There was in

The Daily staff, as S.F.E. con
tended, a concentration of loyal
ties to the winning candidate. 2)
The Daily's quality of coverage
was far below that which is re
quired in a one-newspaper com
munity.
If The Daily is not to be right
fully accused of biased and ir
responsible news coverage, it
must take precautions necessary
to insure its objectivity.
Were S.F.E.'s contentions a
"combination of paranoia and
irresponsibility" as The Daily
maintains? We urge the Stan
ford community to make that
decision on the basis of adequ
ate information. ("The 'In-
Crowd'," "Rebuttal to the Stan
ford Daily," the May 3 KZSU
editorial, reprinted by S.F.E.,
and the Daily's concern with
that campaign.)
This year's election is over,
but The Daily is still our domi
nant source of news. Our con
cern should then be a continu
ous concern, a concern over the
quality and objectivity of the
news we read.

• Class Rankings
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to the statement
made in your editorial Tuesday,
Registrar Harvey Hall advises
that class rankings are not
"computed only to satisfy local
draft boards."
These rankings also are used
in conjunction with applications
to graduate and professional
schools when requested by stu

Grades are somewhat arbi
trary but they satisfy the de
mands of a complex educational
system better than any alterna
tive. Few would contend that
the difference between a C+ and
B- performance was measurable.
Yet as we all know that line
must be drawn somewhere.
Grades now, however, are being
used by an organization out
side of the system that assigns
them and in doing so under
stands what they are. The draft
boards are sorting out students
in a very exacting manner.
Males in the Class of 1967 with
above a 3.167 are permitted to
go on, the residual % is not.
The impact of this sorting is
not restricted to draft eligible
males. If it became precisely
evident GPA's do determine a
student's future struggling for
grades would intensify. Some
would probably derive a better
education for themselves, others
might join the ROTC or badger
teachers more about last quar
ter's marks. I feel though that
the net will be bad; personal
relationships will be further
strained and the development of
intellectual attitudes weakened.
Therefore, I will vote for the
proposal in today's election ask
ing our University to discon
tinue the policy of giving class
rankings to the Selective Ser
vice system.

Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to Mr. Kugelmass'
emotional reference to the "In-
Crowd" paper as a "typical hate
sheet befitting Southern racist
attempts," we consider the
S.F.E. statements a demonstra
tion of concern for the Stanford
community. Perhaps Grove
House and Beta Chi should not
have been implicated, but the
basic contention of S.F.E. was
that The Daily has been using
"editorial bias in the guise of
objective newswriting," as was
emphasized in the second leaf
let of S.F.E.
We believe that news manage
ment by The Daily was the real
issue in this election, not the
candidates' platforms. This
should not have been the case,
but The Daily obscured the real
issues in the election through
de-emphasizing and misrepre
senting the contentions of var
ious candidates — for documen
tation one need only read The
Daily campaign coverage over
the last two weeks.
Two clear points emerge from
this election: 1) There was in

The Daily staff, as S.F.E. con
tended, a concentration of loyal
ties to the winning candidate. 2)
The Daily's quality of coverage
was far below that which is re
quired in a one-newspaper com
munity.
If The Daily is not to be right
fully accused of biased and ir
responsible news coverage, it
must take precautions necessary
to insure its objectivity.
Were S.F.E.'s contentions a
"combination of paranoia and
irresponsibility" as The Daily
maintains? We urge the Stan
ford community to make that
decision on the basis of adequ
ate information. ("The 'In-
Crowd'," "Rebuttal to the Stan
ford Daily," the May 3 KZSU
editorial, reprinted by S.F.E.,
and the Daily's concern with
that campaign.)
This year's election is over,
but The Daily is still our domi
nant source of news. Our con
cern should then be a continu
ous concern, a concern over the
quality and objectivity of the

Editor, The Daily:
Granted, there are only 2,582
women undergraduates at Stan
ford. There are 8,729 men. As
every Stanford man can tell
you, women are in the minority
here. It's a man's world and if
you have any doubts, check out
the sports page of your trusty
copy of The Stanford Daily
What do you see? Flashy head
lines and photos proclaim the
physical prowess of the Stan
ford Male.
Look closely, check the fine
print, and if its the right day
(your odds are 1 in 5) you may
glimpse an undernourished col
umn entitled Broadside, a new
comer to The Daily's pages this
year. If your typical Stanford
mind is clicking, you may asso
ciate the column with women's
sports. So far so good.
But don't get too excited.
You'll rarely see a photo of a
female athlete (we do have
them), or get much more infor
mation than a few dry, dull,
and perhaps meaningless scores.
This type of discrimination hits
not only women's sports but
also the many coeducational ac
tivities sponsored by WRA,
ranging from co-rec tennis,
bowling, and folk dancing to
more predominately male sports
such as riflery. The fewer peo
ple (and especially if they are
women) involved in a sport, the
closer it comes to sinking into
the damning oblivion of being
totally ignoral by The Daily.
Take the Rifle Team for ex
ample, (yes, Stanford has one,
complete with four girls). Last
weekend they shot at Reno in
the Nevada Invitational, a major
event including 14 schools from
western states. A good sized
article was turned into The
Daily for Broadside. After sur
gery, one sentence appeared in
Friday's column. The miracu
lous article on Stanford's hew
range two weeks ago was the
only publicity the team and peo
ple interested in shooting have
gotten all year.
In effect, The Daily discrimi

nates against the "minor lea
gue" activities as well as wom
en's sports in general. What can
be done? Our recommendation is
that an editor of women's sports
be appointed to act as a laison

• On The Edge?
Editor, The Daiiy:
I simply cannot understand
how Stanford students can talk
so cheerfully about their school
achieving greatness. The quality
of a school generally follows its
endowment, and as of last year
Stanford ranked only about 30th
nationally in endowment per stu
dent. At Harvard, a school with
which Stanford often compares,
more than twice as much of the
cost for educating each student
is derived from endowment.
And the gap is going to get
worse, not better. Only 10% of
last year's graduating class gave
to Stanford. For Harvard and
Princeton the comparable fig
ures were 71% and 56%.
At Stanford, as at most East
ern schools, tuition covers less
than one-half the cost of educat
ing a student. At these Eastern
schools there is a feeling of re
sponsibility among seniors to re
pay this other half after gradu
ating, but Stanford students ap
parently have little such feeling.
Stanford has made remark
able progress the past 10 years
through an unprecedented num
ber of annual gifts. However, be
cause of the limited endowment,
these gifts must be increased
even further in coming years
just to maintain current pro
grams. And this will never be
done when less than 10% of
the seniors, and 25% of the
alumni, care enough to give.
In education, as in most other
things, you get what you pay
for. And most Stanford students
are not willing to pay for great
ness.

Those of us who are concerned
about the war in Vietnam are
unwilling to resign ourselves to
the consequences of the admini
stration's go-for-broke policy.
But we face a dilemma: how can
we make known our concern
without creating the image of
a fringe group. I have a sug
gestion. Starting Memorial Day
drive with the lights of your
car on at all times to signify
your opposition to the war. The
idea is that of a friend, Mr. Kent

MICHAEL MXJRPHY
Law School
Editor, The Daily:
How can a University, or
rather a group within a Uni
versity depriving its members
of an opportunity (as distin
guished from the "right") to
complete their undergraduate
education? Unfortunately most
local draft boards do not under
stand the moral crises of college
and university students (and
faculty committees). They mere
ly try to perform as equitable
a job as possible under the pres
ent arrangement. The Selective
Service System is a legal sanc
tion which individuals can
choose to adhere to or dissent
from. It is an individual choice
which is easy to perpetrate—if
you don't want your draft board
to receive your class ranking in
dicate this choice to the National
Service Office, but don't elimin
ate this opportunity to choose
for all of us. No matter what
the Anti-Draft Union may claim,
the idiosyncrasies of local draft
boards and the ambiguities of
the Selective Service System
make the class-ranking refer
endum on the ASSU ballot a
direct denial of the Stanford
male's right to choose how he
will react to war and the Selec
tive Service.

• Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
Again, I feel I must clarify
a statement printed in yester
day's Daily. While I am fairly
sure that we will not lose our
right to free speech by a sus
pension of the First Amend
ment, I find myself a bit more
hesitant each day to say any
thing when a Daily reporter is
around. Letters of clarification
are both annoying and inadequ
ate, but seem frequent and nec
essary of late.
In Michael Kuhl's front-page
article on the noon rally about
the ranking referendum my re
marks were seriously mis-rep
resented. My statement about
Peter Lyman's election was that
1800 people had voted for a plat
form which stressed three
things: the necessity of the uni
versity maintaining itself as a
critical agent, apart from the
unnecessary political strictures
of society; the importance of
real choice in how one lives his
life as a student; and the irrele
vance of grades to anything.
I went on to say that from
these principles I found it advis
able to support the anti-rank
ing referendum. Peter Lyman
did not say anywhere in his ex
tensive campaign literature or
in his frequent speeches that he
was running "on a platform of
not co-operating with the pres
ent draft system."
My deductions and my objec
tions to ranking are my own. I
would ask, however, that Daily
reporters in the future either
check their story and facts with
the speaker when he has finish
ed, or forget that he has spoken.

Peter Lyman's election was that
1800 people had voted for a plat

unnecessary political strictures
of society; the importance of
real choice in how one lives his

Contrary to Mr. Kugelmass'
emotional reference to the "In-

sheet befitting Southern racist
attempts," we consider the
S.F.E. statements a demonstra
tion of concern for the Stanford
community. Perhaps Grove
House and Beta Chi should not
have been implicated, but the
basic contention of S.F.E. was
that The Daily has been using
"editorial bias in the guise of
objective newswriting," as was
emphasized in the second leaf
let of S.F.E.
We believe that news manage
ment by The Daily was the real
issue in this election, not the
candidates' platforms. This
should not have been the case,
but The Daily obscured the real
issues in the election through
de-emphasizing and misrepre
senting the contentions of var
ious candidates — for documen
tation one need only read The
Daily campaign coverage over
the last two weeks.
Two clear points emerge from
this election: 1) There was in

The Daily staff, as S.F.E. con
tended, a concentration of loyal
ties to the winning candidate. 2)
The Daily's quality of coverage
was far below that which is re
quired in a one-newspaper com
munity.
If The Daily is not to be right
fully accused of biased and ir
responsible news coverage, it
must take precautions necessary
to insure its objectivity.
Were S.F.E.'s contentions a
"combination of paranoia and
irresponsibility" as The Daily
maintains? We urge the Stan
ford community to make that
decision on the basis of adequ
ate information. ("The 'In-
Crowd'," "Rebuttal to the Stan
ford Daily," the May 3 KZSU
editorial, reprinted by S.F.E.,
and the Daily's concern with
that campaign.)
This year's election is over,
but The Daily is still our domi

quality and objectivity of the

• Man 9 s World
Editor, The Daily:
Granted, there are only 2,582
women undergraduates at Stan
ford. There are 8,729 men. As
every Stanford man can tell
you, women are in the minority
here. It's a man's world and if
you have any doubts, check out
the sports page of your trusty
copy of The Stanford Daily
What do you see? Flashy head
lines and photos proclaim the
physical prowess of the Stan
ford Male.
Look closely, check the fine
print, and if its the right day
(your odds are 1 in 5) you may
glimpse an undernourished col
umn entitled Broadside, a new
comer to The Daily's pages this
year. If your typical Stanford
mind is clicking, you may asso
ciate the column with women's
sports. So far so good.
But don't get too excited.
You'll rarely see a photo of a
female athlete (we do have
them), or get much more infor
mation than a few dry, dull,
and perhaps meaningless scores.
This type of discrimination hits
not only women's sports but
also the many coeducational ac
tivities sponsored by WRA,
ranging from co-rec tennis,
bowling, and folk dancing to
more predominately male sports
such as riflery. The fewer peo
ple (and especially if they are
women) involved in a sport, the
closer it comes to sinking into
the damning oblivion of being
totally ignoral by The Daily.
Take the Rifle Team for ex
ample, (yes, Stanford has one,
complete with four girls). Last
weekend they shot at Reno in
the Nevada Invitational, a major
event including 14 schools from
western states. A good sized
article was turned into The
Daily for Broadside. After sur
gery, one sentence appeared in
Friday's column. The miracu
lous article on Stanford's hew
range two weeks ago was the
only publicity the team and peo
ple interested in shooting have
gotten all year.
In effect, The Daily discrimi

nates against the "minor lea
gue" activities as well as wom
en's sports in general. What can
be done? Our recommendation is
that an editor of women's sports
be appointed to act as a laison
between The Daily and WRA.
It is time for The Daily sports
page to oavercome its "big lea
gue" complex, realize that there
really is a vital segment of the
Stanford community interested
in the less glamorous sports,
and see to it that these activi
ties are publicized. At risk of
using a much overworked term,
LASSU isn't the only institution
at Stanford which should be
more representative.

• On The Edge?
Editor, The Daiiy:
I simply cannot understand
how Stanford students can talk
so cheerfully about their school
achieving greatness. The quality
of a school generally follows its
endowment, and as of last year
Stanford ranked only about 30th
nationally in endowment per stu
dent. At Harvard, a school with
which Stanford often compares,
more than twice as much of the
cost for educating each student
is derived from endowment.
And the gap is going to get
worse, not better. Only 10% of
last year's graduating class gave
to Stanford. For Harvard and
Princeton the comparable fig
ures were 71% and 56%.
At Stanford, as at most East
ern schools, tuition covers less
than one-half the cost of educat
ing a student. At these Eastern
schools there is a feeling of re
sponsibility among seniors to re
pay this other half after gradu
ating, but Stanford students ap
parently have little such feeling.
Stanford has made remark
able progress the past 10 years
through an unprecedented num
ber of annual gifts. However, be
cause of the limited endowment,
these gifts must be increased
even further in coming years
just to maintain current pro
grams. And this will never be

Granted, there are only 2,582
women undergraduates at Stan
ford. There are 8,729 men. As
every Stanford man can tell
you, women are in the minority
here. It's a man's world and if
you have any doubts, check out
the sports page of your trusty

What do you see? Flashy head
lines and photos proclaim the

Look closely, check the fine

year. If your typical Stanford
mind is clicking, you may asso
ciate the column with women's
sports. So far so good.
But don't get too excited.
You'll rarely see a photo of a
female athlete (we do have
them), or get much more infor

and perhaps meaningless scores.
This type of discrimination hits
not only women's sports but
also the many coeducational ac

ranging from co-rec tennis,
bowling, and folk dancing to
more predominately male sports
such as riflery. The fewer peo
ple (and especially if they are
women) involved in a sport, the
closer it comes to sinking into
the damning oblivion of being
totally ignoral by The Daily.
Take the Rifle Team for ex

complete with four girls). Last
weekend they shot at Reno in
the Nevada Invitational, a major

gery, one sentence appeared in

lous article on Stanford's hew

only publicity the team and peo

In effect, The Daily discrimi

Editor, The Daiiy:
I simply cannot understand
how Stanford students can talk
so cheerfully about their school
achieving greatness. The quality
of a school generally follows its
endowment, and as of last year
Stanford ranked only about 30th
nationally in endowment per stu
dent. At Harvard, a school with
which Stanford often compares,
more than twice as much of the
cost for educating each student
is derived from endowment.
And the gap is going to get
worse, not better. Only 10% of
last year's graduating class gave
to Stanford. For Harvard and
Princeton the comparable fig
ures were 71% and 56%.
At Stanford, as at most East
ern schools, tuition covers less
than one-half the cost of educat
ing a student. At these Eastern
schools there is a feeling of re
sponsibility among seniors to re
pay this other half after gradu
ating, but Stanford students ap
parently have little such feeling.
Stanford has made remark
able progress the past 10 years
through an unprecedented num
ber of annual gifts. However, be
cause of the limited endowment,
these gifts must be increased
even further in coming years
just to maintain current pro
grams. And this will never be
done when less than 10% of
the seniors, and 25% of the
alumni, care enough to give.
In education, as in most other

are not willing to pay for great

• Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
Again, I feel I must clarify
a statement printed in yester
day's Daily. While I am fairly
sure that we will not lose our
right to free speech by a sus
pension of the First Amend
ment, I find myself a bit more
hesitant each day to say any
thing when a Daily reporter is
around. Letters of clarification
are both annoying and inadequ
ate, but seem frequent and nec
essary of late.
In Michael Kuhl's front-page
article on the noon rally about
the ranking referendum my re
marks were seriously mis-rep
resented. My statement about
Peter Lyman's election was that
1800 people had voted for a plat
form which stressed three
things: the necessity of the uni
versity maintaining itself as a
critical agent, apart from the
unnecessary political strictures
of society; the importance of
real choice in how one lives his
life as a student; and the irrele
vance of grades to anything.
I went on to say that from
these principles I found it advis
able to support the anti-rank
ing referendum. Peter Lyman
did not say anywhere in his ex
tensive campaign literature or
in his frequent speeches that he
was running "on a platform of
not co-operating with the pres
ent draft system."
My deductions and my objec
tions to ranking are my own. I
would ask, however, that Daily
reporters in the future either
check their story and facts with
the speaker when he has finish

• Class Rankings
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to the statement
made in your editorial Tuesday,

that class rankings are not

Editor, The Daily:
Grades are somewhat arbi
trary but they satisfy the de
mands of a complex educational
system better than any alterna
tive. Few would contend that
the difference between a C+ and
B- performance was measurable.
Yet as we all know that line
must be drawn somewhere.
Grades now, however, are being
used by an organization out
side of the system that assigns
them and in doing so under
stands what they are. The draft
boards are sorting out students
in a very exacting manner.
Males in the Class of 1967 with
above a 3.167 are permitted to
go on, the residual % is not.
The impact of this sorting is
not restricted to draft eligible
males. If it became precisely
evident GPA's do determine a
student's future struggling for
grades would intensify. Some
would probably derive a better
education for themselves, others
might join the ROTC or badger
teachers more about last quar
ter's marks. I feel though that
the net will be bad; personal
relationships will be further
strained and the development of
intellectual attitudes weakened.
Therefore, I will vote for the
proposal in today's election ask

tinue the policy of giving class
rankings to the Selective Ser

• Dilly-Dally?
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to Mr. Kugelmass'
emotional reference to the "In-
Crowd" paper as a "typical hate
sheet befitting Southern racist
attempts," we consider the
S.F.E. statements a demonstra
tion of concern for the Stanford
community. Perhaps Grove
House and Beta Chi should not
have been implicated, but the
basic contention of S.F.E. was
that The Daily has been using
"editorial bias in the guise of
objective newswriting," as was
emphasized in the second leaf
let of S.F.E.
We believe that news manage
ment by The Daily was the real
issue in this election, not the
candidates' platforms. This
should not have been the case,
but The Daily obscured the real
issues in the election through
de-emphasizing and misrepre
senting the contentions of var
ious candidates — for documen
tation one need only read The
Daily campaign coverage over
the last two weeks.
Two clear points emerge from
this election: 1) There was in

The Daily staff, as S.F.E. con
tended, a concentration of loyal
ties to the winning candidate. 2)
The Daily's quality of coverage
was far below that which is re
quired in a one-newspaper com
munity.
If The Daily is not to be right
fully accused of biased and ir
responsible news coverage, it
must take precautions necessary

thing when a Daily reporter is
around. Letters of clarification
are both annoying and inadequ
ate, but seem frequent and nec
essary of late.
In Michael Kuhl's front-page
article on the noon rally about
the ranking referendum my re
marks were seriously mis-rep
resented. My statement about
Peter Lyman's election was that
1800 people had voted for a plat
form which stressed three
things: the necessity of the uni
versity maintaining itself as a
critical agent, apart from the
unnecessary political strictures
of society; the importance of
real choice in how one lives his
life as a student; and the irrele
vance of grades to anything.
I went on to say that from
these principles I found it advis
able to support the anti-rank
ing referendum. Peter Lyman
did not say anywhere in his ex
tensive campaign literature or
in his frequent speeches that he
was running "on a platform of
not co-operating with the pres
ent draft system."
My deductions and my objec
tions to ranking are my own. I
would ask, however, that Daily
reporters in the future either
check their story and facts with
the speaker when he has finish
ed, or forget that he has spoken.

It is interesting that campus
police were sent onto Quad to
tear down "End Ranking" pos

• Class Rankings
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to the statement
made in your editorial Tuesday,
Registrar Harvey Hall advises
that class rankings are not
"computed only to satisfy local
draft boards."
These rankings also are used
in conjunction with applications
to graduate and professional
schools when requested by stu
dents.

• Arbitrary
Editor, The Daily:
Grades are somewhat arbi
trary but they satisfy the de
mands of a complex educational
system better than any alterna
tive. Few would contend that
the difference between a C+ and
B- performance was measurable.
Yet as we all know that line
must be drawn somewhere.
Grades now, however, are being
used by an organization out
side of the system that assigns
them and in doing so under
stands what they are. The draft
boards are sorting out students
in a very exacting manner.
Males in the Class of 1967 with
above a 3.167 are permitted to
go on, the residual % is not.
The impact of this sorting is
not restricted to draft eligible
males. If it became precisely
evident GPA's do determine a
student's future struggling for
grades would intensify. Some
would probably derive a better
education for themselves, others
might join the ROTC or badger
teachers more about last quar
ter's marks. I feel though that
the net will be bad; personal
relationships will be further
strained and the development of
intellectual attitudes weakened.
Therefore, I will vote for the
proposal in today's election ask
ing our University to discon
tinue the policy of giving class
rankings to the Selective Ser
vice system.

• Dilly-Dally?
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to Mr. Kugelmass'
emotional reference to the "In-
Crowd" paper as a "typical hate
sheet befitting Southern racist
attempts," we consider the
S.F.E. statements a demonstra
tion of concern for the Stanford
community. Perhaps Grove
House and Beta Chi should not
have been implicated, but the
basic contention of S.F.E. was
that The Daily has been using
"editorial bias in the guise of
objective newswriting," as was
emphasized in the second leaf
let of S.F.E.
We believe that news manage
ment by The Daily was the real
issue in this election, not the
candidates' platforms. This
should not have been the case,
but The Daily obscured the real
issues in the election through
de-emphasizing and misrepre
senting the contentions of var
ious candidates — for documen
tation one need only read The
Daily campaign coverage over
the last two weeks.
Two clear points emerge from
this election: 1) There was in

The Daily staff, as S.F.E. con
tended, a concentration of loyal
ties to the winning candidate. 2)
The Daily's quality of coverage
was far below that which is re
quired in a one-newspaper com
munity.
If The Daily is not to be right
fully accused of biased and ir
responsible news coverage, it
must take precautions necessary
to insure its objectivity.
Were S.F.E.'s contentions a
"combination of paranoia and
irresponsibility" as The Daily
maintains? We urge the Stan
ford community to make that
decision on the basis of adequ
ate information. ("The 'In-
Crowd'," "Rebuttal to the Stan
ford Daily," the May 3 KZSU
editorial, reprinted by S.F.E.,
and the Daily's concern with
that campaign.)
This year's election is over,
but The Daily is still our domi
nant source of news. Our con
cern should then be a continu
ous concern, a concern over the
quality and objectivity of the
news we read.

• Man 9 s World
Editor, The Daily:
Granted, there are only 2,582
women undergraduates at Stan
ford. There are 8,729 men. As
every Stanford man can tell
you, women are in the minority
here. It's a man's world and if
you have any doubts, check out
the sports page of your trusty
copy of The Stanford Daily
What do you see? Flashy head
lines and photos proclaim the
physical prowess of the Stan
ford Male.
Look closely, check the fine
print, and if its the right day
(your odds are 1 in 5) you may
glimpse an undernourished col
umn entitled Broadside, a new
comer to The Daily's pages this
year. If your typical Stanford
mind is clicking, you may asso
ciate the column with women's
sports. So far so good.
But don't get too excited.
You'll rarely see a photo of a
female athlete (we do have
them), or get much more infor
mation than a few dry, dull,
and perhaps meaningless scores.
This type of discrimination hits
not only women's sports but
also the many coeducational ac
tivities sponsored by WRA,
ranging from co-rec tennis,
bowling, and folk dancing to
more predominately male sports
such as riflery. The fewer peo
ple (and especially if they are
women) involved in a sport, the
closer it comes to sinking into
the damning oblivion of being
totally ignoral by The Daily.
Take the Rifle Team for ex
ample, (yes, Stanford has one,
complete with four girls). Last
weekend they shot at Reno in
the Nevada Invitational, a major
event including 14 schools from
western states. A good sized
article was turned into The
Daily for Broadside. After sur
gery, one sentence appeared in
Friday's column. The miracu
lous article on Stanford's hew
range two weeks ago was the
only publicity the team and peo
ple interested in shooting have
gotten all year.
In effect, The Daily discrimi

nates against the "minor lea
gue" activities as well as wom
en's sports in general. What can
be done? Our recommendation is
that an editor of women's sports
be appointed to act as a laison
between The Daily and WRA.
It is time for The Daily sports
page to oavercome its "big lea
gue" complex, realize that there
really is a vital segment of the
Stanford community interested
in the less glamorous sports,
and see to it that these activi
ties are publicized. At risk of
using a much overworked term,
LASSU isn't the only institution
at Stanford which should be
more representative.

• On The Edge?
Editor, The Daiiy:
I simply cannot understand
how Stanford students can talk
so cheerfully about their school
achieving greatness. The quality
of a school generally follows its
endowment, and as of last year
Stanford ranked only about 30th
nationally in endowment per stu
dent. At Harvard, a school with
which Stanford often compares,
more than twice as much of the
cost for educating each student
is derived from endowment.
And the gap is going to get
worse, not better. Only 10% of
last year's graduating class gave
to Stanford. For Harvard and
Princeton the comparable fig
ures were 71% and 56%.
At Stanford, as at most East
ern schools, tuition covers less
than one-half the cost of educat
ing a student. At these Eastern
schools there is a feeling of re
sponsibility among seniors to re
pay this other half after gradu
ating, but Stanford students ap
parently have little such feeling.
Stanford has made remark
able progress the past 10 years
through an unprecedented num
ber of annual gifts. However, be
cause of the limited endowment,
these gifts must be increased
even further in coming years
just to maintain current pro
grams. And this will never be
done when less than 10% of
the seniors, and 25% of the
alumni, care enough to give.
In education, as in most other
things, you get what you pay
for. And most Stanford students
are not willing to pay for great
ness.

• Light Up!
Editor, The Daily:
Those of us who are concerned
about the war in Vietnam are
unwilling to resign ourselves to
the consequences of the admini
stration's go-for-broke policy.
But we face a dilemma: how can
we make known our concern
without creating the image of
a fringe group. I have a sug
gestion. Starting Memorial Day
drive with the lights of your
car on at all times to signify
your opposition to the war. The
idea is that of a friend, Mr. Kent
Bach of Atherton, and we are
planning various activities on
campus and throughout the Bay
Area in the hope that it will
gain momentum.
