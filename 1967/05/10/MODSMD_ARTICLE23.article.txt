## Will Lyman Direct A Student Comedy? 
### Kirk Hanson 
The ASSU primary last week
was another episode in the com
edy of student life. Some stu
dents voting at Engineering Cor
ner were surprised to find Fritz
Sehaefer, candidate for ASSU
President, tending the polls and
handing out ballots. A few feet
away stood Cesare Massarenti,
candidate for ASSU Vice Presi

dent, trying to look nonchalant
while he eyed Schaefer's move
ments.
But now that comedy is over
and Peter Lyman has won. He
will be head of a student organi
zation deeply rooted in the hier
archical concept of university
government. The Board of Trus
tees has granted certain peri
pheral affairs to student gov
ernment as its proper domain.
However, any real influence
over what might be called edu
cation is sorrowfully lacking.
Evidently students may play
in their sandbox but should not
question whether education can
take place in a sandbox. They
can run dances, buy canoe pad
dles, allocate a hundred thous
and dollars a year, and conduct
advisory studies. However, stu
dents do not participate except
at the arbitrary discretion of the
University in determining social
regulations, housing arrange
ments, academic requirements,
or other matters concerning
their education.
Another Comedy?
Will Peter Lyman then baby
sit and administer an organiza
tion that only perpetuates the
myth that student government
is indeed "government"? Will
his administration be the next
episode in the comedy of stu
dent life? It will be if he does
not seek radical changes in the
form of university government.
Students do not have all the
answers, but they do have infor
mation and opinions that must
be heard and their judgments
must be part of the decision
making. Their education must
be fitted to their own experience
and their knowledge of their
own needs.
They bring not only an under
standing of their own needs but
a certain prophetic vision that
is essential if the University is
to progress and innovate. The
administration is all too apt to
make decisions behind closed
doors and then announce them
to the students, stating that
these decisions are best for their
education.
Expertise Of Administrators
Administrators, as profession
al educators, have an expertise
in the history and methods of
education. They have an over
view that is absolutely essential
to the development of education
at Stanford. To say that stu
dents should decide all educa
tional issues unilaterally is a
perversion equal to the present
situation where students are
consulted only at the whim of
the administration.
But to say that the students
should participate only when di
rected by the administration is
to deny their experience, vision,
and the effectiveness of a Stan
ford education to provide one
with the ability and responsi
bility to choose and govern.
Peter Lyman's call is to im
press upon the whole University
the vision and expertise that is
uniquely the student's. He must
strive to represent intelligently,
responsibly, and effectively the
insight and power the students
have.
Student Power Isolated
Experience has shown that
situations do arise when it will
be necessary to use that power
or the threat of it. However,
it will be essential that the con
cept of student power not be
isolated as it sometimes was
under David Harris. The narrow
power of the student constitu
ency must not be looked upon
as the only force for educational
change. The faculty and the
open elements within the ad
ministration must not be
ignored when seeking change.
Without an appeal to the co
operation of all constituencies,
the student voice becomes hol
low and ineffective.
But if next year no progress
is made toward allowing the
ASSU to atrophy in the wake of
growing community govern
ment, then Peter Lyman's ad
ministration will be but another
act in the comedy of student
life.
