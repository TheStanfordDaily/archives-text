Policies for disengagement in Viet
nam and suggestions for concerted
action will be discussed in "Toward
disengagement," a program to bo
held in Memorial Auditorium on May
16th.
According to David Ransom, one of
the program's organizers, this is not
second "teach-in" but "a community
meeting out of which action should
come." It is hoped that the different
opposed to the Administra
tion's policy will agree on a stand
and thereby be able to speak with a
stronger voice, he said.
"Many of us think that debate be
,veen the administration and those
who in one way or another are op
nosed to its policy is a good deal less
./nportant than arriving at an agree
ment about what must be done in
order to disengage from the war,"
Ransom explained. "To do this we
need to arrive at a common position
bout disengagement."
"Toward Disengagement" will be in
f'vo parts, with debate on alternative
/ational policies in the afternoon and
discussion of possible local porgrams
in the evening. Groups and individuals
are encouraged to formulate positions
to be mimeographed for distribution
t the meeting.
"We hope living groups will discuss
?nd present position papers," Ran
dom said. "This will help build interest

for the program as well as get posi
tions out to be discussed."
Participation in "Vietnam Summer"
is one of the suggestions for action
that will be presented, Ransom said.
"Vietnam Summer" is a program sug
gested by Rev. Martin Luther King,
Jr., and being effected by the Ameri
can Friends Service Committee (AF
SC). It is rumored that Sen. Robert
Kennedy is granting $700,000 to King
to use in this program, Ransom
added. AFSC will discuss "Vietnam
Summer" at an open meeting in San
Francisco at 1:30 today.
Groups sponsoring "Toward Disen
gagement" are Stanford Community
Concerned About Vietnam, Stanford
Faculty-Staff Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, and Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS).
The program will not include state
ments of support for the administra
tion's policy in Vietnam, Ransom
said. He added that he does not ex
pect many supporters of the war to
attend the program. It will be a meet
ing of those who believe that disen
gagement is necessary and want to
work out a compromise position
which will give them effectiveness.
Speakers' opinions will probably fall
somewhere between the enclave
theory and unilateral withdrawal, he
said.
SDS plans to participate in a proj
ect in Palo Alto this summer, Ran

som said. Students will discuss issues
with residents and try to build in
terest in a referendum.
Ransom stressed the importance of
students talking to "the people back
home" this summer. Peace marches in
