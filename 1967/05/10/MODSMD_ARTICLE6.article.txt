# Brewster Advocates Differentiation Of Administration, Faculty Roles

### CICELY BATES 
The best method to govern an aca
demic enterprise that allows for the
greatest degree of individual aca
demic freedom is "collective self-deter
mination" of the faculty, advised
President Kingman Brewster of Yale
last night as he spoke on "The Aca
demic Process: The Institution" in his
second Harry Camp Memorial Lec
ture.
Self-government is best, he went on
to say, because it is easier to carry
out programs in the faculty that have
been created by the same faculty.
However, he warned, it is important
to keep its directives pure and make
its evaluations and judgments by ob
jective evidence.
Brewster asserted that the faculty
wants a dominant voice. They don't
want to teach subjects that don't in
terest them nor do they want to be
prohibited from teaching subjects

that they feel are necessary to the
academic process. Brewster added
that he felt that faculty members
have a bias against authority. But,
"if a university at its best is a com
munity of truly self-determined in
tellects, the bias against authority
and planning is not only natural but
essential." In an academic commu
nity it would be best if no one was in
charge or next best that no one knew
who was in charge.
While the faculty is concerned by
the intellectual "inner directedness"
of the university, matters of "things
and money" do not concern them.
These concerns should be handled
by the "administration". It is their
job to decide between an "associate
professor of theology and air condi
tioning for the Art Gallery." Much of
the effort to obtain capital starts with
the administration. It should also be
an ally to the foundation market

from which comes much of its finan
cial support. It should be the role of
the administration to persuade fac
ulty to try out new "experimental pro
grams."
Emphasis on Progress
In the relationship between the ad
ministration and faculty, the two
powers do not work together in a
business or political sense. Unlike bus
iness, the main emphasis is on the
process, not the program. "The re
lease, not the direction, of responsible
energy is the objective." Politically,
one cannot think of the administra
tion as the executive, and the faculty
as the legislature, because the facul
ty does not have party discipline nor
does it have to feel worried about
running for re-election.
Both relationships leave out an im
portant part of academic government
— the trustees. Although the trustees
have ultimate legal authority on all

matters, ideally their actions will be
mostly "anticipatory compliances"
with the other two forces. It is instead
the role of the trustees to exercise
authority on those matters that in
volve "the legal commitments of the
institution to outsiders." It is impor
tant that the trustees avoid clashes
with the faculty, who prize their dom
inant voice in academic matters. How
ever, the trustees should always have
the right to question the doings of
the faculty, Brewster added.
Assuring that the faculty and
trustees do have a common purpose
is one of the roles of the university's
president. He should make both fac
tions aware that each is carrying on
the same job. Both should be making
sure that the university is a place of
learning and that the highest learn
ing to be stressed is discovery. A
mutual confidence between the three
forces is necessary if "harmonious
resonance" is to prevail.
Pressure On Trustees
Since the trustees play a role simi
lar to the Supreme Court, it is impor
tant that the trustees are not pres
sured by outside forces, Brewster em
phasized. The trustees are not repre
sentatives of any force. They should
use their own personal judgments
on how best to serve the academic
community. All too often, elected trus
tees tend to give their allegiance to
the alumni that elected them and
those appointed by governors or legi
slative committees tend to succumb
to political pressures from those who
appointed them.
Therefore, it is easier for a private
institution that runs on "voluntary"
contributions to have trustees free
from partisan pressures than the state
institution that relies on taxes for
its existence.
Brewster concluded his lecture by
summarizing the qualifications of a
great university, A great university
has individual independence of its
scholars, collective self determination
of its faculty, and trustees who are
insulated from all pressures so that
they can serve the best interests of
the institution.

charge or next best that no one knew
who was in charge.
While the faculty is concerned by
the intellectual "inner directedness"
of the university, matters of "things
and money" do not concern them.
These concerns should be handled
by the "administration". It is their
job to decide between an "associate
professor of theology and air condi
tioning for the Art Gallery." Much of
the effort to obtain capital starts with
the administration. It should also be
an ally to the foundation market

from which comes much of its finan
cial support. It should be the role of
the administration to persuade fac
ulty to try out new "experimental pro
grams."
Emphasis on Progress
In the relationship between the ad
ministration and faculty, the two
powers do not work together in a
business or political sense. Unlike bus
iness, the main emphasis is on the
process, not the program. "The re
lease, not the direction, of responsible
energy is the objective." Politically,
one cannot think of the administra
tion as the executive, and the faculty
as the legislature, because the facul
ty does not have party discipline nor
does it have to feel worried about
running for re-election.
Both relationships leave out an im
portant part of academic government
— the trustees. Although the trustees
have ultimate legal authority on all

matters, ideally their actions will be
mostly "anticipatory compliances"
with the other two forces. It is instead
the role of the trustees to exercise
authority on those matters that in
volve "the legal commitments of the
institution to outsiders." It is impor
tant that the trustees avoid clashes
with the faculty, who prize their dom
inant voice in academic matters. How
ever, the trustees should always have
the right to question the doings of
the faculty, Brewster added.
Assuring that the faculty and
trustees do have a common purpose
is one of the roles of the university's
president. He should make both fac
tions aware that each is carrying on
the same job. Both should be making
sure that the university is a place of
learning and that the highest learn
ing to be stressed is discovery. A
mutual confidence between the three
forces is necessary if "harmonious
resonance" is to prevail.
Pressure On Trustees
Since the trustees play a role simi
lar to the Supreme Court, it is impor
tant that the trustees are not pres
sured by outside forces, Brewster em
phasized. The trustees are not repre
sentatives of any force. They should
use their own personal judgments
on how best to serve the academic
community. All too often, elected trus
tees tend to give their allegiance to
the alumni that elected them and
those appointed by governors or legi
slative committees tend to succumb
to political pressures from those who
appointed them.
Therefore, it is easier for a private
institution that runs on "voluntary"
contributions to have trustees free
from partisan pressures than the state
institution that relies on taxes for
its existence.
Brewster concluded his lecture by
summarizing the qualifications of a
great university, A great university
has individual independence of its
scholars, collective self determination
of its faculty, and trustees who are
insulated from all pressures so that
they can serve the best interests of
the institution.
The best method to govern an aca
demic enterprise that allows for the
greatest degree of individual aca
demic freedom is "collective self-deter
mination" of the faculty, advised
President Kingman Brewster of Yale
last night as he spoke on "The Aca
demic Process: The Institution" in his
second Harry Camp Memorial Lec
ture.
Self-government is best, he went on
to say, because it is easier to carry
out programs in the faculty that have
been created by the same faculty.
However, he warned, it is important
to keep its directives pure and make
its evaluations and judgments by ob
jective evidence.
Brewster asserted that the faculty
wants a dominant voice. They don't
want to teach subjects that don't in
terest them nor do they want to be
prohibited from teaching subjects

that they feel are necessary to the
academic process. Brewster added
that he felt that faculty members
have a bias against authority. But,
"if a university at its best is a com
munity of truly self-determined in
tellects, the bias against authority
and planning is not only natural but
essential." In an academic commu
nity it would be best if no one was in
charge or next best that no one knew
who was in charge.
