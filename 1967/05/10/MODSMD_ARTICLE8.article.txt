# Lyman Links Education With Political Theory
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
A few ASSU presidential campaign posters
are left around campus, scattered on kiosks
,and lavatory doors. As a result of the record
breaking primary voting, Peter Lyman is the
President-elect.
Though many read his white papers and
heard him speak at rallies and living groups,
the majority of students and professors have
lever met Lyman or talked informally with
him.
He describes himself as a frustrated oil
painter, a James Joyce fanatic, a political
scientist "interested in political philosophy,
existentialism, and modern social theory."
His room is plastered with Fillmore posters,
and his music tastes range from blues and
■ ock and roll to Schonberg and Mahler.
Biography
Lyman, 26, was born in San Francisco and
attended junior high school in Oregon and
later in Hawaii. He returned to Oregon for
high school which he completed in Rome fol
lowing his family's move to Italy. He received
his B.A. degree in philosophy at Stanford and
/lis masters degree in political theory at
Berkeley. After a year of studying languages
»n Paris and Heidelberg, he came back to
.Stanford and is now in the process of com

pleting his doctorate in political science.
Lyman explained that he has formulated a
set of political questions about the concepts
of authority and community which he feels
transcend disciplinary barriers. "I use sour
ces where I find them . . . whatever seems to
contribute to my understanding of the sub
ject," he commented.
Effective T.A.
Charles Drekmeier, whom Lyman calls his
"friend, mentor, and leader," praised Lyman
as one of the most effective teaching assis
tants in the department. "Undergraduates de
scribe him as always sympathetic, willing to
be of assistance, and able to make abstract
concepts intelligible," Drekmeier said. "I
have known him since he was an undergradu
ate when he showed an unusual sophistica
tion. In the papers he's written he has evolved
from elaborate discussions of the authoritar
ian personality to a theory of conceptions of
space and time in Machiavellian thought."
Lyman has taught sections in Political
Science 20, comparative politics, and Political
Science 150, history of political thought. He
led a freshman seminar with Bob Rosen on
The Radical in History and an undergraduate
special with Barry Greenberg on Politics and
Existentialism.

His students describe Lyman as "quietly
brilliant," "perceptive and sincere," "humble
and responsive." "He's really amazing," stated
one enthusiastic sophomore, "he quietly
spouts beautiful words. He ambles into class
and you expect him to be vague, but he ar
ticulates more than systems and methodo
logy. He stresses Eric Ericson's psychological
approach to history and political charisma."
As a tutor in the Grove Project, Lyman
conducts a seminar based on such works as
Marcuse's One Dimensial Man and Ideology
and Utopia, by Mannheim. "We are explor
ing the ultimate absurdity of ideology. We
are looking into present society and discover
ing the potentialities which can be developed
through action."
Possible Utopia
He continued, "My idea of Utopia is not
something which is unachievable, but what is
possible given the existing limits. This is how
I approach everything, in fact. As much as
I'd like to start completely over, we must deal
with actual potentialities."
A girl in Lyman's Grove seminar explained
that the assigned readings are on the "fron
tier of new social thought. Peter calls them
'five-year books' because they take time to
understand completely. He is exposing us to
work we wouldn't normally get as undergrad

uates. We are gaining a way of approaching
and dealing with ideas."
"It's hard to talk about him as a teacher,"
said another Grove resident. "He doesn't
talk down to us, he participates. I appreciate
his quietness ... he never talks unless he has
something to say. He's really an empathetic
friend."
On Education
Lyman explained that his interest in educa
tion is directly related to his interest in po
litical theory. He feels that society is suffer
ing from a moral and ethical decline which
has resulted in a loss of political values and
individualism. He emphasized that education
is a way to revitalize society.
"A real educated person is also independ
ent and may be unpredictable in terms of the
needs of one system. Education should be de
signed to fulfill the needs of that individual
rather than a social system," he explained.
"My concept of democracy is based on an
independent, self-defining, self-regulating in
dividual."
With respect to Stanford, Lyman said that
entering classes are among the country's
best, but they display a passive attitude tow
ard education. "It's been too easy — a series
of repetitions and memorizations. Most of
them can get by without strain, without ex

panding their minds. Society can't afford not
to have the best minds develop their poten
tialities."
Free Exploration
He added that the undergraduate years are
the students' only chance "to freely explore
who they are and what they can be. Too often
students defend systems that deny education
because they don't know what a real educa
tion can be. They come here ready for any
thing, but often we give them more mech
anical education."
According to Lyman, the individual ulti
mately must educate himself, but not alone.
"The university should provide good teachers
and an exciting environment to maximize the
opportunities for self-exploration. Students
shouldn't be able to fulfill the exterior re
quirements without any interior action. Re
quirements should be a stimulus not the sub
stance."
Lyman has continually emphasized that h£
cannot instigate any changes in education of
student government alone. His success or
failure as ASSU President will depend on the
participation and interest of students, faculty,
and administrators.
In his soft-spoken, philosophic way, Lyman
will attempt to aid the "community of schol
ars" to identify and develop its potentialities.

Marcuse's One Dimensial Man and Ideology
and Utopia, by Mannheim. "We are explor
ing the ultimate absurdity of ideology. We
are looking into present society and discover
ing the potentialities which can be developed
through action."
Possible Utopia
He continued, "My idea of Utopia is not
something which is unachievable, but what is
possible given the existing limits. This is how
I approach everything, in fact. As much as
I'd like to start completely over, we must deal
with actual potentialities."
A girl in Lyman's Grove seminar explained
that the assigned readings are on the "fron
tier of new social thought. Peter calls them
'five-year books' because they take time to
understand completely. He is exposing us to
work we wouldn't normally get as undergrad

uates. We are gaining a way of approaching
and dealing with ideas."
"It's hard to talk about him as a teacher,"
said another Grove resident. "He doesn't
talk down to us, he participates. I appreciate
his quietness ... he never talks unless he has
something to say. He's really an empathetic
friend."
On Education
Lyman explained that his interest in educa
tion is directly related to his interest in po
litical theory. He feels that society is suffer
ing from a moral and ethical decline which
has resulted in a loss of political values and
individualism. He emphasized that education
is a way to revitalize society.
"A real educated person is also independ
ent and may be unpredictable in terms of the
needs of one system. Education should be de
signed to fulfill the needs of that individual
rather than a social system," he explained.
"My concept of democracy is based on an
independent, self-defining, self-regulating in
dividual."
With respect to Stanford, Lyman said that
entering classes are among the country's
best, but they display a passive attitude tow
ard education. "It's been too easy — a series
of repetitions and memorizations. Most of
them can get by without strain, without ex

panding their minds. Society can't afford not
to have the best minds develop their poten
tialities."
Free Exploration
He added that the undergraduate years are
the students' only chance "to freely explore
who they are and what they can be. Too often
students defend systems that deny education
because they don't know what a real educa
tion can be. They come here ready for any
thing, but often we give them more mech
anical education."
According to Lyman, the individual ulti
mately must educate himself, but not alone.
"The university should provide good teachers
and an exciting environment to maximize the
opportunities for self-exploration. Students
shouldn't be able to fulfill the exterior re
quirements without any interior action. Re
quirements should be a stimulus not the sub
stance."
Lyman has continually emphasized that h£
cannot instigate any changes in education of
student government alone. His success or
failure as ASSU President will depend on the
participation and interest of students, faculty,
and administrators.
In his soft-spoken, philosophic way, Lyman
will attempt to aid the "community of schol
ars" to identify and develop its potentialities.
A few ASSU presidential campaign posters
are left around campus, scattered on kiosks
,and lavatory doors. As a result of the record
breaking primary voting, Peter Lyman is the
President-elect.
Though many read his white papers and
heard him speak at rallies and living groups,
the majority of students and professors have
lever met Lyman or talked informally with
him.
He describes himself as a frustrated oil
painter, a James Joyce fanatic, a political
scientist "interested in political philosophy,
existentialism, and modern social theory."
His room is plastered with Fillmore posters,
and his music tastes range from blues and
■ ock and roll to Schonberg and Mahler.
Biography
Lyman, 26, was born in San Francisco and
attended junior high school in Oregon and
later in Hawaii. He returned to Oregon for
high school which he completed in Rome fol
lowing his family's move to Italy. He received
his B.A. degree in philosophy at Stanford and
/lis masters degree in political theory at
Berkeley. After a year of studying languages
»n Paris and Heidelberg, he came back to
.Stanford and is now in the process of com

pleting his doctorate in political science.
Lyman explained that he has formulated a
set of political questions about the concepts
of authority and community which he feels
transcend disciplinary barriers. "I use sour
ces where I find them . . . whatever seems to
contribute to my understanding of the sub
ject," he commented.
Effective T.A.
Charles Drekmeier, whom Lyman calls his
"friend, mentor, and leader," praised Lyman
as one of the most effective teaching assis
tants in the department. "Undergraduates de
scribe him as always sympathetic, willing to
be of assistance, and able to make abstract
concepts intelligible," Drekmeier said. "I
have known him since he was an undergradu
ate when he showed an unusual sophistica
tion. In the papers he's written he has evolved
from elaborate discussions of the authoritar
ian personality to a theory of conceptions of
space and time in Machiavellian thought."
Lyman has taught sections in Political
Science 20, comparative politics, and Political
Science 150, history of political thought. He
led a freshman seminar with Bob Rosen on
The Radical in History and an undergraduate
special with Barry Greenberg on Politics and
Existentialism.

His students describe Lyman as "quietly
brilliant," "perceptive and sincere," "humble
and responsive." "He's really amazing," stated
one enthusiastic sophomore, "he quietly
spouts beautiful words. He ambles into class
and you expect him to be vague, but he ar
ticulates more than systems and methodo
logy. He stresses Eric Ericson's psychological
approach to history and political charisma."

Biography
Lyman, 26, was born in San Francisco and
attended junior high school in Oregon and
later in Hawaii. He returned to Oregon for
high school which he completed in Rome fol
lowing his family's move to Italy. He received
his B.A. degree in philosophy at Stanford and
/lis masters degree in political theory at
Berkeley. After a year of studying languages
»n Paris and Heidelberg, he came back to
.Stanford and is now in the process of com

pleting his doctorate in political science.
Lyman explained that he has formulated a
set of political questions about the concepts
of authority and community which he feels
transcend disciplinary barriers. "I use sour
ces where I find them . . . whatever seems to
contribute to my understanding of the sub
ject," he commented.
Effective T.A.
Charles Drekmeier, whom Lyman calls his
"friend, mentor, and leader," praised Lyman
as one of the most effective teaching assis
tants in the department. "Undergraduates de
scribe him as always sympathetic, willing to
be of assistance, and able to make abstract
concepts intelligible," Drekmeier said. "I
have known him since he was an undergradu
ate when he showed an unusual sophistica
tion. In the papers he's written he has evolved
from elaborate discussions of the authoritar
ian personality to a theory of conceptions of
space and time in Machiavellian thought."
Lyman has taught sections in Political
Science 20, comparative politics, and Political
Science 150, history of political thought. He
led a freshman seminar with Bob Rosen on
The Radical in History and an undergraduate
special with Barry Greenberg on Politics and
Existentialism.

His students describe Lyman as "quietly
brilliant," "perceptive and sincere," "humble
and responsive." "He's really amazing," stated
one enthusiastic sophomore, "he quietly
spouts beautiful words. He ambles into class
and you expect him to be vague, but he ar
ticulates more than systems and methodo
logy. He stresses Eric Ericson's psychological
approach to history and political charisma."
As a tutor in the Grove Project, Lyman
conducts a seminar based on such works as
Marcuse's One Dimensial Man and Ideology
and Utopia, by Mannheim. "We are explor
ing the ultimate absurdity of ideology. We
are looking into present society and discover
ing the potentialities which can be developed
through action."
Possible Utopia
He continued, "My idea of Utopia is not
something which is unachievable, but what is
possible given the existing limits. This is how
I approach everything, in fact. As much as
I'd like to start completely over, we must deal
with actual potentialities."
A girl in Lyman's Grove seminar explained
that the assigned readings are on the "fron
tier of new social thought. Peter calls them
'five-year books' because they take time to
understand completely. He is exposing us to
work we wouldn't normally get as undergrad

uates. We are gaining a way of approaching
and dealing with ideas."
"It's hard to talk about him as a teacher,"
said another Grove resident. "He doesn't
talk down to us, he participates. I appreciate
his quietness ... he never talks unless he has
something to say. He's really an empathetic
friend."
On Education
Lyman explained that his interest in educa
tion is directly related to his interest in po
litical theory. He feels that society is suffer
ing from a moral and ethical decline which
has resulted in a loss of political values and
individualism. He emphasized that education
is a way to revitalize society.
"A real educated person is also independ
ent and may be unpredictable in terms of the
needs of one system. Education should be de
signed to fulfill the needs of that individual
rather than a social system," he explained.
"My concept of democracy is based on an
independent, self-defining, self-regulating in
dividual."
With respect to Stanford, Lyman said that
entering classes are among the country's
best, but they display a passive attitude tow
ard education. "It's been too easy — a series
of repetitions and memorizations. Most of
them can get by without strain, without ex

panding their minds. Society can't afford not
to have the best minds develop their poten
tialities."
Free Exploration
He added that the undergraduate years are
the students' only chance "to freely explore
who they are and what they can be. Too often
students defend systems that deny education
because they don't know what a real educa
tion can be. They come here ready for any
thing, but often we give them more mech
anical education."
According to Lyman, the individual ulti
mately must educate himself, but not alone.
"The university should provide good teachers
and an exciting environment to maximize the
opportunities for self-exploration. Students
shouldn't be able to fulfill the exterior re
quirements without any interior action. Re
quirements should be a stimulus not the sub
stance."
