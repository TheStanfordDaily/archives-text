They're Forever Prest! The crisp, slim lines of these slacks are locked
in for keeps. Great new blend of Dacron" Polyester and Avril Hopsack,
trim-tailored by Haggar. Just pop in the washing machine, dry —
and they're ready for another round of good times . . . and good looks!
P. S Grodins low price even includes colorful striped belt!
