initiated three years ago by
John Gardner and David Rocke
feller and financed by the Car
negie Institute. It is now a part
of the civil service. Its purpose
is two-fold, to bring the per

spectives and ideas of people
outside Washington into the
White House, and allow them
to take their experience with
the Government back to the
community.
The Commission on White
House Fellows is headed by
Douglas Dillon, former Secre
tary of the Treasury. Its mem
bers include two Stanford aum
ni: John Gardner, Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare,
and Ernest Arbuckle, Dean of
the Graduate School of Busi
ness. Of the 46 fellows to date,
Timothy Wirth is the fifth Stan
ford student to be selected.
