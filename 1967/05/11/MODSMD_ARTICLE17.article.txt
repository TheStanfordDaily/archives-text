# First Things First

### PAUL RUPERT 
One of the problems of a for
um on grades is that its content
is largely predictable. A unani
mous assumption will be that
grades are not very accurate in
dicators of how much one
learns, retains, applies, or grows
—but they're almost the best
thing we have that is suitable
for a Big University.
Someone will mention soci
ety's need for An Indicator
which, depending on the au
thor's age and position, we must
accept or reject.
Noted psychologists and learn
ing theorists might speak of the
need for an incentive, positive
re-inforcement, stimulus or a
threat—backed up by surveys of
grading and non-grading schools
which prove many things.
Repressive
And oppressed and depressed
students shall say that grades
are repressive—and they will
ask for pass-fail.
But when all is said and done,
we will be left the perennial
question: what would you do,
you sly undergraduate, if there
were no stick over your lazy
head, huh?
In the firm belief that all
these problems are secondary
trivia I should like to try
another approach—if only for
the sake of variety.
One Solution
Pass-fail affords one solution,
and in its very apologetic na
ture, might give insights into
a greater problem and a more
fundamental solution to it.
Pass-fail is a minor improve
ment, and may ease the normal
pressures of grading and com
petition. There might well be
more of it.
But the problem of the com
petitive drive at Stanford and
the inadequacy of our education
will not be eliminated by super
ficial measures.
My Own Experience
Daring a personal note, I must
say that my two pass-fail

courses yielded me two "plus-es"
and no critiques—and were also
bad courses with incoherent lec
tures, mediocre reading, and ter
rible exams.
Oddly enough, the present un
graded courses have not yielded,
and an expansion of them may
not yield: any substantive
changes in courses; a noticeable
alteration in professors' lectur
ing or teaching ability: any
greater concern on the part of
graders to give full and compet
ent critiques; a reduction in
class size; a new freedom to read
books of your choice in the place
of dull assigned texts (doomed,
since pass-fail exams remain as
specific as usual and as petty
as hell); and any change in the
mid - term - paper - final whirl
wind which characterizes the
ten-week quarter, so neatly di
vided into work-and-play periods
of a pressure-cooker intensity
and a crippling quality.
Straight-Jacket
As well, all these non-changes
have taken place within the
strait-jacket of majors and Gen
eral Studies requirements, and
in the pleasant surroundings of
UGLY and our collective sterile
residences. How free we have
become!
But halt! What have I to
offer? Am I another in a series
of antagonistic critics with no
solution?
My intention is not to abolish
pass-fail, any more than it is to
abolish grades tomorrow. Neith
er would speak to the fact that
when one is bored to death with
a mediocre education, one must
concentrate on changing the
real nature of that education.
"Years Of Experience"
To hope for pass-fail is fine,
but there are many, many fac
ulty members and administrat
ors who know"from years of
experience" the lazy and devious
nature of frollicking students.
Perhaps it is these same peo
ple who have given us the dull
requirements and the innocuous

lectures that have lead us to
plead for pass-fail.
They will refuse that pass-fail
as they have refused to create
a decent university.
Stop Quibbling
I suggest that we concentrate
our energies on changing the
university, and stop quibbling
about grades. As things stand
now, we are only defeating our
selves. Let's demand smaller
classes, no more mid-terms,
teaching as a factor in promo
tion, the end of anachronistic
General Studies courses, and bet
ter housing.
While not forgetting the fight
against grades, let us realize
that they will wither away when
the state of learning at Stanford
has changed.
What we must do is demand
more of ourselves, and far more
of the university.
To avoid that responsibility
and settle for pass-fail alone is
to admit our own lack of con
cern about our vocation as stu
dents. If we are willing to do
that, we deserve the education
we are getting.

What we must do is demand
more of ourselves, and far more
of the university.
To avoid that responsibility
and settle for pass-fail alone is
to admit our own lack of con
cern about our vocation as stu
dents. If we are willing to do
that, we deserve the education
we are getting.

One of the problems of a for
um on grades is that its content
is largely predictable. A unani
mous assumption will be that
grades are not very accurate in
dicators of how much one
learns, retains, applies, or grows
—but they're almost the best
thing we have that is suitable
for a Big University.
Someone will mention soci
ety's need for An Indicator
which, depending on the au
thor's age and position, we must
accept or reject.
Noted psychologists and learn
ing theorists might speak of the
need for an incentive, positive
re-inforcement, stimulus or a
threat—backed up by surveys of
grading and non-grading schools
which prove many things.
Repressive
And oppressed and depressed
students shall say that grades
are repressive—and they will
ask for pass-fail.
But when all is said and done,
we will be left the perennial
question: what would you do,
you sly undergraduate, if there
were no stick over your lazy
head, huh?
In the firm belief that all
these problems are secondary
trivia I should like to try
another approach—if only for
the sake of variety.
One Solution
Pass-fail affords one solution,
and in its very apologetic na
ture, might give insights into
a greater problem and a more
fundamental solution to it.
Pass-fail is a minor improve
ment, and may ease the normal
pressures of grading and com
petition. There might well be
more of it.
But the problem of the com
petitive drive at Stanford and
the inadequacy of our education
will not be eliminated by super
ficial measures.
My Own Experience
Daring a personal note, I must
say that my two pass-fail

courses yielded me two "plus-es"
and no critiques—and were also
bad courses with incoherent lec
tures, mediocre reading, and ter
rible exams.
Oddly enough, the present un
graded courses have not yielded,
and an expansion of them may
not yield: any substantive
changes in courses; a noticeable
alteration in professors' lectur
ing or teaching ability: any
greater concern on the part of
graders to give full and compet
ent critiques; a reduction in
class size; a new freedom to read
books of your choice in the place
of dull assigned texts (doomed,
since pass-fail exams remain as
specific as usual and as petty
as hell); and any change in the
mid - term - paper - final whirl
wind which characterizes the
ten-week quarter, so neatly di
vided into work-and-play periods
of a pressure-cooker intensity
and a crippling quality.
Straight-Jacket
As well, all these non-changes
have taken place within the
strait-jacket of majors and Gen
eral Studies requirements, and
in the pleasant surroundings of
UGLY and our collective sterile
residences. How free we have
become!
But halt! What have I to
offer? Am I another in a series
of antagonistic critics with no
solution?
My intention is not to abolish
pass-fail, any more than it is to
abolish grades tomorrow. Neith
er would speak to the fact that
when one is bored to death with
a mediocre education, one must
concentrate on changing the
real nature of that education.
"Years Of Experience"
To hope for pass-fail is fine,
but there are many, many fac
ulty members and administrat
ors who know"from years of
experience" the lazy and devious
nature of frollicking students.
Perhaps it is these same peo
ple who have given us the dull
requirements and the innocuous

lectures that have lead us to
plead for pass-fail.
They will refuse that pass-fail
as they have refused to create
a decent university.
Stop Quibbling
I suggest that we concentrate
our energies on changing the
university, and stop quibbling
about grades. As things stand
now, we are only defeating our
selves. Let's demand smaller
classes, no more mid-terms,
teaching as a factor in promo
tion, the end of anachronistic
General Studies courses, and bet
ter housing.
While not forgetting the fight
against grades, let us realize
that they will wither away when
the state of learning at Stanford
has changed.

classes, no more mid-terms,
teaching as a factor in promo
tion, the end of anachronistic
General Studies courses, and bet
ter housing.
While not forgetting the fight
against grades, let us realize
that they will wither away when
the state of learning at Stanford
has changed.
What we must do is demand
more of ourselves, and far more
of the university.
To avoid that responsibility
and settle for pass-fail alone is
to admit our own lack of con
cern about our vocation as stu
dents. If we are willing to do
that, we deserve the education
we are getting.
