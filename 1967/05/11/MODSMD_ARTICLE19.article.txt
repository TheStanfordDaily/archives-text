# Examine Grading, Not Grades
## 
### RICHARD W. LYMAN 
Reform of the grading sys
tem is a hardy perennial of aca
demic debate. This does not
mean that further pursuit of
the subject is pointless, but it
may suggest caution in imagin
ing that one is likely to say any
thing really new about it.
The traditional case against
grades begins with their alleged
unreliability as a measure of
educational achievement.
Grades, it is argued, reflect
skills that are only a part of
intellectual achievement, or are
actually extraneous to it, such
as quick recall of factual infor
mation, a knack for the occa
sional telling phrase that wakes
the weary bluebook-reader and
makes him take (favorable) no
tice. (The more cynical would
add at this point the importance
of fidelity to the instructor's
known opinions.)
Unfair, In Part
It follows, say the critics, that
the grading system is unfair to
those students whose education
al achievement, no matter how
considerable otherwise, does not
happen to include these particu
lar skills.
Furthermore, the importance

attributed to grades is said to
have an unfortunate impact on
the whole educational process,
skewing it towards those as
pects of a subject that are most
readily tested and evaluated.
Rote learning is valued over
painstaking analysis, and both
are preferred to original think
ing. Grading also increases the
competitiveness of student life;
the G.P.A. tends to take prece
dence over learning.
Ornamented Argument
Of course these arguments
are commonly embellished with
a variety of rhetorical orna
ment; competitiveness sounds
more obnoxious if called "the
rat race."
And a potent myth flourishes
around the allegedly widespread
existence of students whose
real brilliance goes unrecog
nized because they either cannot
or will not accommodate them
selves to the demands of the
standard mid-term-and-final rou
tine.
Even sober behavioral scien
tists have sometimes become ob
sessed with the problem of the
"over-achiever," or have adopted
the view — without pausing to
amass evidence — that academic

"under-achievers" are more like
ly to make notable contribu
tions to society than people who
get good grades.
Lack of Conclusive Correlation
In fact, conclusive evidence
about correlations, either posi
tive or negative, between aca
demic grades and later useful
ness to society (however de
fined) is not available, and per
haps not likely to be.
For more limited purposes,
such as help in the screening
of applicants for graduate
school, grades are useful.
They are a kind of shorthand
by which an instructor conveys
his impression of a student's
achievement.
More detailed statements, such
as letters of recommendation,
are of course crucial to an ad
mission committee's final deci
sion; transcripts serve mainly
to identify those applicants
whose recommendations will re
quire intensive study.
Why not study all applicants'
records intensively? Simply be
cause life is short, deadlines fre
quent, and grades are not that
misleading, especially when (as
is usual) weight is given to the

general quality of the institu
tion that gave the grades.
Were the History Department,
e.g., to be confronted with all
400-odd of its graduate admis
sion applications in the style of
Goddard College — no grades,
but miniature letters of recom
mendation for each course -
the task of winnowing would be
nearly impossible, and the re
sults might well be no better
than those we have at present.
"C" Average Genius
As for the myth of the "C"
average genius, like all genu
ine myths it has some validation
in fact.
But inveterate "C" students,
alas, usually turn out on closer
inspection to have either less
ability or less industry, or both,
than most inveterate "A" stu
dents.
Competitiveness present? a
more serious problem, especial
ly in relation to the G.P.A. The
latter is a faulty index, if only
because five A's and five C's
come out as ten B's.
Ranking Insignificant
Ranking of G.P.A.'s, except
in the broadest terms, gives a
misplaced emphasis to insignifi
cant differentials (3.57 vs.
or 3.7 vs. 3.4 for that matter).
A further avoidable evil is
the frequency with which test
ing and evaluation take place.
More deferred grades, fewer
mid-terms, more comprehensive
examinations that require syn
thesis and thought rather than
memorization — along such
lines much progress is surely
conceivable, even far short of a
gradeless Utopia.
To sum up, grades seem to me
neither as overridingiy import
ant nor as malignant as is often
maintained. Any system for
comparing and sorting human
achievements has its limitations
and its risks.
But the removal of grades
would not magically remove the
need for such a system, in a
large and complex society. Ac
ceptance of the need for grades,
however, ought not to be con
fused with consecration of the
present system of evaluating
academic performance.
A grade, after all, has mean
ing only in terms of what goes
into it.
Evaluation System Change
It is entirely possible that the
evaluation system could change
significantly yet retain grades
as the end product. Shorthand
notations are only as useful as
they are valid and reliable.
Thus the way in which the
criteria for grading are deter
mined seems to me at least as
important as the question of
grades per se.
