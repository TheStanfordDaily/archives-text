# Clebsch Comments
## Faculty Asks Admissions Variety 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
, Stanford was urged to seek more
*ariety in its student body in a re
»rt to the Humanities and Sciences
laculty presented at a meeting on
Monday.
By voice vote, the group requested
the committee continue its work to
develop recommendations for ob
taining greater diversity in admis
sions.
The special committee was headed
by Prof. William A. Clebsch of the
Religion Department. Referring to
the committee's factual description of
admissions policy and procedures
Clebsch noted;
Complex Criteria
"The present (admissions) policy
and its execution tend to evaluate all
applicants in terms of the same com
plex criteria. It tends to filter out stu
dents with special competence or ex
cellence or other idiosyncracies."
The problem which exists with the
admissions policy is that a "consid
ered deliberation" on the subject has
not been made since the Academic
Council approved the ten-point scale
applicant evaluation in 1958.
"Lots of water has gone over
the dam since then," Clebsch stated.
"The staff has changed; the role of
education in American society has

changed; the roles assigned by the
alumni and administration have
changed; and the expectations of stu
dents have changed. The one thing
which hasn't changed is the admis
sion policy.
"The members of the committee,"
Clebsch continued, "recognize the
devilish job which the Admissions
Office has before them."
The faults of the present system
are more a direct reflection on the
faculty and its failure to study and
redefine the admissions policy than
of the admissions office, Clebsch said.
He pointed out that the responsive
ness of the admission office to faculty
suggestions can be seen by "minor
changes put in effect by the Under
graduate Admissions Committee of
the Academic Council last year."
The most surprising information
for most of the Humanities and
Sciences faculty was the fact that
"personal ratings are found to be
rated more heavily than academic
ratings.
"The 7:3 ratio of academic to per
sonal factors specified by the Aca
demic Council (in its 1958 policy rec
ommendation) is not applied rigidly
and not required to be so applied," the
committee's report noted.
As a result, in Monday's meeting
there was a great deal of what
Clebsch called "restrained, serious,

very concerned debate." Profs. Bo
Anderson and Bernard Cohen of the
Sociology Department both empha
sized the need for the committee to
explore more specific criteria for the
personal evaluation of candidates.
Two Alternatives
Along this line, the report stated,
"The faculty may want to consider
whether explicit criteria on which
these judgments are based need to be
formulated or whether the judgments
can be left subjective and global as
they are at the present, relying on
the experience and knowledge of the
admissions staff."
If the latter course is chosen,
Clebsch said, "Either one or the other
of the following courses could be
taken by the faculty.
"Either faculty opinion should es
tablish very clear guidelines for selec

tion of the admissions office staff, or
they should have very close super
vision over the admissions office."
Instead of evaluating all competi
tive candidates by the same criteria,
the committee suggested that sev
eral distinct categories for admis
sion might be established — provid
ing for selection of a limited number
of students who excel in mathematics,
for example.
In a further attempt to obtain what
Clebsch calls "plurifying the cri
teria," there was an additional sug
gestion raised that teachers' ratings
of high school students should be
given greater weight than those of
counselors.
Resolutions on admissions policy
will be considered at the next Human
ities and Sciences and faculty meet
ing May 22.
