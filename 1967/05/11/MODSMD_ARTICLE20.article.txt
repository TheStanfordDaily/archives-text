# An A-B-C System
## Straighten Up The Curve 
### JOHN D. BLACK 
It seems patently obvious that
the recommended "normal
curve" distribution of grades is
utterly irrational at an institu
tion which selects its students
from a tiny segment of the dis
tributions of ability, prior
achievement, and academic mo
tivation.
Furthermore, it is becoming
increasingly clear that many
Stanford students suffer in con
sequence of our grading prac
tices when they seek admission
to graduate or professional
schools.
While "everybody knows a
Stanford C means more than a
C almost anywhere else," every
one doesn't know how much
more is required to compile a
high GPA here.
Pass-Fail Limitations
Despite its merits, pass-fail
grading has three serious limita
tions for Stanford:
• When restricted to a few
courses, it may enable a student
to risk a course he could not
otherwise afford, but it is vir
tually impossible for him to put
as much time and effort into it—
even if he becomes fascinated—

as he must in his graded
courses.
• To grant the importance of
cultivating the intrinsic satis
factions in learning does not
mean that all extrinsic rewards
are base and should be elimin
ated. Recognition or praise for
a job well done can be a power
ful motivating force in most
human endeavors.
• The standard objection to
pass-fail systems is the difficulty
it imposes on graduate schools
in deciding which students to
admit. If enough faculty knew
each student well enough to
write meaningful recommenda
tions, this objection would be
less telling, but I fear that mil
lenium is a long way off.
Proposal
I should like to propose the
following grading system for
consideration:
Grades given would be con
fined to A, B, C, -112, and Inc.,
with pluses or minuses available
for the letter grades. Any writ
ten work, including tests and
examinations, which were not
considered worthy of a C would
be returned to the student un
graded, with appropriate oral or

written suggestions and com
ments.
A student failing to complete
a course satisfactorily would re
ceive an "Inc." Students receiv
ing "Inc." would have one year,
as at present, to complete the
course successfully. If they fail
ed to do so, the course would be?
removed from their transcript
and no longer counted in their
GPA.
If necessary, some limitation
could be placed on the number
of quarters an undergraduate
could be enrolled or some mini
mum number of succesfully
completed units could be re
quired for any year.
It seems to me this system
has several advantages:
1. It emphasizes positive
rather than negative reinforce
ment; a considerable body of re
search shows that reward tends
to be a more effective reinforcer
than punishment.
2. It provides the student with
greater freedom to attempt diffi
cult courses or to concentrate
his interest and effort in particu
lar courses without the fear that
reduced attention to another
course will irreparably damage
his academic career.

3. It encourages more feed
back to the student who is not
performing satisfactorily since
the return of an unacceptable
paper or exam tends to encour
age the instructor to analyze
the student's failure and discuss
it with him.
No Threat To Achievement
I realize that many faculty
members and perhaps some stu
dents still feel that achievement
would suffer if students didn't
fear D's and F's. I submit that
at Stanford today there is no
evidence to support this assump
tion.
Indeed, for most of the stu
dents we enroll, C is a punishing
grade both in terms of their
past experience and their future
aspirations.
The proposed system would
be an explicit statement to our
students that we have, indeed,
admitted them to the company
of scholars, that we regard them
as possessing the appropriate
competencies, motivation, and
maturity for such membership
—and that they will be judged,
as we all arc, by their perform
ances, but we will not try to
frighten them into achievement
by wielding a club.
