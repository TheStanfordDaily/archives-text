# Some Reflections On Defenses Of Grading
## 
### THOMAS GRISSOM 
For my critics, let me say in advance that I
am aware that this essay contains no "construc
tive alternatives or proposals".
My hope Ls to convince some people, who ap
parently make a living In this way, to stop
justifying themselves and their points of view
on each question directed at them by others,
and begin to confront their unspoken ideologies
and assumptions systematically. To do more
than this requires more space than I was
allowed.

In American education, we tend to think of
the grading system apart from any integrated
philosophy of education.
Thus, all types of reasonable, but largely ir
relevant, arguments can be mustered to justify
almost any position. Historical perspective can
be used to support or attack grading.
The necessity of grades for the equitable and
efficient differentiation of talents may be either
good or bad. depending on your point of view.
Neutral Consideration
The use of grades for motivating students is
also a neutral consideration until you adopt it
as a justification or an indefensible evil.
I am suggesting that we consider grades as

an integral part of a much larger process called
education. To realize this means that tension
and anxiety generated within that process will
not cease just because grades are abolished
or given less emphasis.
Until we demand of ourselves that our aca
demic tutors a complete re-examination of
America's educational assumptions, social ob
jectives, the world view as reflected in its
schools, no amount of "special problem" solv
ing is going to be meaningful.
No Satisfaction In ABC
I can take no satisfaction in an A-B-C grad
ing system (now considered "safe" and pos
sible) just because it is defended with empirical
data derived from a battery of tests and scores
that indicate any student entering Stanford is
capable of at least some modicum of success
and, therefore, doesn't need unsatisfactory or
failing grades.
This whole argument is predicated upon a
mechanistic theory of learning that has no
measure for creativity and yet allows the cir
cular use of definition and criteria for determ
ining levels of "achievement".
A defense of the present system because it
insures a "meritocracy" (Clark Kerr's term for
the process whereby the most qualified people

get the most important jobs) is a tunnel-vision
of reality that has no value standard for de
termining the important jobs and is blind to
the principles of the system when put to prac
tice.
A's and A's
For instance, A's in physics are more import
ant than A's in history because we have to get
to the moon.
Or, in another case, Bank of America and
Transamerica are probably more likely to hire
a C student from Stanford than a B student
from, say, San Jose State.
The two paragraphs above are simple ex
amples of our ability to make isolated, stop gap
responses to important questions appear as
well lubricated arguments.
No Coherent Philosophy
To hold either of these positions is to admit
to no coherent philosophy of education or to
swear disguised allegiance to the more subtle
American Philosophy of Education.
The American Philosophy of Fklucation is
a complex process of indirect fear and coer
cion and grades play no little part in this
grandly efficient design.
In Why Children Fail, John Holt calls the pro

cess, "a pat on the head and a smile from
teacher in exchange for the 'right' answer".
Ernest Becker has called it the educational
realization of freedom as defined and neces
sarily limited by the ideology of democracy.
Jules Henry describes this philosophy as neces
sarily making anger obsolete in favor of guilt.
Or as a government publication of the Selec
tive Scrvice has put it: "We do indirectly
(through channeling and deferment priority)
what other countries do directly with the use
of force".
Graduate schools of education call this "the
socializing function of education" or better yet,
"meeting the expectations of others". None of
this. I suppose is too insidious until you realize
that the "others," the giver of pats and smiles,
and the holder of the ideology also give the
grades.
Refined Functionalism
This is keenly refined functionalism that Is
no longer able (if it ever was) to question what
it functions for. And while you might be able to
argue that basically the system functions for
good, I want to suggest that its goal is anti
human. Consider Nevitt Sanford's finding that
85 per cent of the college students are "out to
beat the system".

I can think of no greater testimony to the
success of the American Philosophy of Indura
tion: eight-gve per cent of America's college
students disagreeing with what they are do
ing, but doing it any how because it is the
best way to function in America.
If you abolished grades in college, students
would stop working, the system would fall
apart, because the chief device of fear and re
prisal, upon which the system is founded, is
taken aviy.
Drop-Out Or Push Out
If you can think of the high school "drop out"
as a victim of "push out" then you can begin
to consider the "failures" of American school
ing in a different way.
The "drop out" is just more honest than those
of us in the 85 per cent. We play the game be
cause the system has successfully managed to
create in us the felt need to go to college, to get
as much education as possible, while at the
same time constructing a rewards system in
society that justifies the sacrifice.
And so we continue to go forward, blindly
treating the problem of grades, defining the
"residence university," rearranging depart
mental requirements, and choose to call it pro
gross or innovation.
