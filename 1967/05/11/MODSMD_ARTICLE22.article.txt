# OEO Gives Legal Service To Poor
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Z Earl Johnson, director of the
- Legal Services Program of the
* Office of Economic Opportunity
- (OEO), will deliver the main
Z address this evening at the an-
Z nual banquet of the Stanford
» Legal Aid Society, to be held at
Z the Villa Hotel in San Mateo.
Through Johnson's OEO pro-
Z gram federal funds have been
" used throughout the country to
" supplement local attempts to
Z provide legal services for the
*• poor. OEO has set up four offi-
Z ces in San Mateo county, includ
* ing one in East Palo Alto.
The East Palo Alto effort is
Z further supplemented by a $45,-
- 000 grant from the American
Z Association of Law Schools. Un
- der this grant the Stanford Law
Z School has hired a teaching fel
" low, Roy Schmidt, who handles
- cases in the OEO office in East
z Palo Alto. Schmidt, a former as
- sociate editor of The Daily, also
_ .tp«rhf»s a seminar on the Legal
Problems of the Poor, under the
supervision of Prof. Jack Fried
enthal of the Law School.

In addition, Schmidt super
vises a group of about twenty
law school students who donate
their time and effort to OEO at
torneys in the East Palo Alto
office. Most of the cases involve
bankruptcy, domestic relations,
or debtor-creditor problems. The
students draft pleadings, take
affidavits, draft letters, make
calls on creditors and investi
gate points of law.
According to Read Ambler,
president elect of the Stanford
Legal Aid Society, student help
makes it possible for OEO at
torneys to handle more cases
for the poor. "As a practical
matter, the law can't provide
equal protection to a person un
less that person has an attor
ney," stated Ambler in an inter
view.
"Right now, many indigents
can't avail themselves of the
protection of the law because
they can't afford to hire an at
torney. If the poor are going
to be told to make it on their
own in society, they've got to

be given the same opportunity
to be served by the law as men
of means. That's what the Legal
Aid Society is for — to help
provide legal services to those
who couldn't otherwise afford
it."
Ambler added that another
purpose of student involvement
is to motivate law students to
come back after graduation to
serve the poor. Legal aid only
does part of the job. What is
needed are more lawyers who
want to set up practice in low
income areas.
The East Palo Alto project,
which will be headed next year
by second year law student John
Williams, is part of the Legal
Aid Society's civil branch. Also
working under newly elected
Civil Coordinator John Gillis is
Dave Duncan, who will be in
charge of providing student as
sistance to OEO offices which
are scheduled to open in Santa
Clara county this spring.
The Legal Aid Society is also
involved in several projects in
the area of criminal law under
the overall direction of Crim
inal Coordinator Bill Cottrell
and Assistant Criminal Coordi
nator Jeff Jennings. Working
under Cottrell will be A 1 Sherry
and Lloyd Hicks, co-chairmen
of the San Mateo Assistant De
fenders.
In this program, which was
initiated last fall, student re
sources are employed in behalf
of indigent criminals. Under the
present system in San Mateo,
court appointed attorneys may
call upon law school students to
interview defendants and wit
nesses, investigate cases, re
search legal problems, and draft
motions and jury instructions.

According to Robert Fastov,
outgoing president of the Le
gal Aid Society and founder of
the Assistant Defenders, "the
program is designed to provide
effective assistance under a
court appointment system. In
either case, students can do
much of the leg work and re
search. This allows the attorney
to do, in effect, more work on
behalf of the defendant who
could not otherwise afford le
gal counsel."
Law students can assist at
torneys in many ways but can
not, under existing California
law, appear formally in court.
Thirteen other states, however,
do permit law students to ap
pear in court, and Stanford has
been selected by the California
Conference of Law Schools to
coordinate efforts to draft a re
vision to the California Business
and Professions Code which
would allow student law prac
tice in order to help satisfy the
legal needs of the indigent.
This effort is being directed
by Bill Cottrell. A proposed
draft of the new law, following
extensive research this summer,
is expected to be ready by Sep
tember.
A group under the direction
of Earl Potter has begun to in
vestigate the possibility of ex
panding the Assistant Defender
concept to the areas of juve
nile court and mental committ
ment proceedings. At present,
numbers of persons are com
mitted to mental institutions
without advice of counsel.
Another group, headed by
Barry Price, is investigating pos
sible uses of law students in
the criminal appeals process. At
present, the constitutional right

to counsel in criminal cases ex
tends only to the first appeal.
After the first appeal the in
digent criminal must obtain
funds to hire an attorney or
forego further appeal.
Rand Shulman will head the
bail bond project next year. Un
der this project law students
and some undergraduates have
interviewed indigent defendants
as a preliminary to release by
the court without requiring
bond.
An Education and Reform
Committee led by Owen O'Don
nell is attempting to develop
ways of helping the courts
which do not fall within the tra
ditional, ambit of legal aid, such
as public education in the legal
processes. Such education may
help the poor to believe that
the law need not be a one way
street; legal aid, bolstered by
OEO funds and the efforts of
the Legal Aid Society, is in
tended to make this belief a
reality.

According to Robert Fastov,

the Assistant Defenders, "the
program is designed to provide
effective assistance under a

either case, students can do
much of the leg work and re

call upon law school students to
interview defendants and wit
nesses, investigate cases, re
search legal problems, and draft
motions and jury instructions.

According to Robert Fastov,
outgoing president of the Le
gal Aid Society and founder of
the Assistant Defenders, "the
program is designed to provide
effective assistance under a
court appointment system. In
either case, students can do
much of the leg work and re
search. This allows the attorney
to do, in effect, more work on
behalf of the defendant who
could not otherwise afford le
gal counsel."
Law students can assist at
torneys in many ways but can
not, under existing California
law, appear formally in court.
Thirteen other states, however,
do permit law students to ap
pear in court, and Stanford has
been selected by the California
Conference of Law Schools to
coordinate efforts to draft a re
vision to the California Business
and Professions Code which
would allow student law prac
tice in order to help satisfy the
legal needs of the indigent.
This effort is being directed
by Bill Cottrell. A proposed
draft of the new law, following
extensive research this summer,
is expected to be ready by Sep
tember.
A group under the direction
of Earl Potter has begun to in
vestigate the possibility of ex
panding the Assistant Defender
concept to the areas of juve
nile court and mental committ
ment proceedings. At present,
numbers of persons are com
mitted to mental institutions
without advice of counsel.
Another group, headed by
Barry Price, is investigating pos
sible uses of law students in
the criminal appeals process. At
present, the constitutional right

to counsel in criminal cases ex
tends only to the first appeal.
After the first appeal the in
digent criminal must obtain
funds to hire an attorney or
forego further appeal.
Rand Shulman will head the
bail bond project next year. Un
der this project law students
and some undergraduates have
interviewed indigent defendants
as a preliminary to release by
the court without requiring
bond.
An Education and Reform
Committee led by Owen O'Don
nell is attempting to develop
ways of helping the courts
which do not fall within the tra
ditional, ambit of legal aid, such
as public education in the legal
processes. Such education may
help the poor to believe that
the law need not be a one way
street; legal aid, bolstered by
OEO funds and the efforts of
the Legal Aid Society, is in
tended to make this belief a
reality.
Z Earl Johnson, director of the
- Legal Services Program of the
* Office of Economic Opportunity
- (OEO), will deliver the main
Z address this evening at the an-
Z nual banquet of the Stanford
» Legal Aid Society, to be held at
Z the Villa Hotel in San Mateo.
Through Johnson's OEO pro-
Z gram federal funds have been
" used throughout the country to
" supplement local attempts to
Z provide legal services for the
*• poor. OEO has set up four offi-
Z ces in San Mateo county, includ
* ing one in East Palo Alto.
The East Palo Alto effort is
Z further supplemented by a $45,-
- 000 grant from the American
Z Association of Law Schools. Un
- der this grant the Stanford Law
Z School has hired a teaching fel
" low, Roy Schmidt, who handles
- cases in the OEO office in East
z Palo Alto. Schmidt, a former as
- sociate editor of The Daily, also
_ .tp«rhf»s a seminar on the Legal
Problems of the Poor, under the
supervision of Prof. Jack Fried
enthal of the Law School.

In addition, Schmidt super
vises a group of about twenty
law school students who donate
their time and effort to OEO at
torneys in the East Palo Alto
office. Most of the cases involve
bankruptcy, domestic relations,
or debtor-creditor problems. The
students draft pleadings, take
affidavits, draft letters, make
calls on creditors and investi
gate points of law.
According to Read Ambler,
president elect of the Stanford
Legal Aid Society, student help
makes it possible for OEO at
torneys to handle more cases
for the poor. "As a practical
matter, the law can't provide
equal protection to a person un
less that person has an attor
ney," stated Ambler in an inter
view.
"Right now, many indigents
can't avail themselves of the
protection of the law because
they can't afford to hire an at
torney. If the poor are going
to be told to make it on their
own in society, they've got to

be given the same opportunity
to be served by the law as men
of means. That's what the Legal
Aid Society is for — to help
provide legal services to those
who couldn't otherwise afford
it."
Ambler added that another
purpose of student involvement
is to motivate law students to
come back after graduation to
serve the poor. Legal aid only
does part of the job. What is
needed are more lawyers who
want to set up practice in low
income areas.
The East Palo Alto project,
which will be headed next year
by second year law student John
Williams, is part of the Legal
Aid Society's civil branch. Also
working under newly elected
Civil Coordinator John Gillis is
Dave Duncan, who will be in
charge of providing student as
sistance to OEO offices which
are scheduled to open in Santa
Clara county this spring.
The Legal Aid Society is also
involved in several projects in
the area of criminal law under
the overall direction of Crim
inal Coordinator Bill Cottrell
and Assistant Criminal Coordi
nator Jeff Jennings. Working
under Cottrell will be A 1 Sherry
and Lloyd Hicks, co-chairmen
