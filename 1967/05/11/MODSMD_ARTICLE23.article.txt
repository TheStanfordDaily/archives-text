## Sade Film Greatest 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The Fine Arts, in California,
seems to be uncompromisingly
intellectual in its choice of
movie. Marat/Sade is showing
to a mere handful of people but
they're not taking it off in favor
of some full-house frolic like
Georgy Girl.
The Loved One, perhaps the
finest movie around, had a brief
stay at Palo Alto. It stayed
longer at a discriminating thea
ter in Los Altos, a village which
does not, as far as I know, house
a university of several thousand
potential movie-goers.
Thus The Loved One stayed
on there while Palo Alto thea
ters continued to show 'box
office' movies night after night:
Georgy Girl, for example, and A
Man And A Woman, which is
O.K. if you like that kind of
thing.
Then there was the Fahrehelt
farrago ('medley', to placate Mr.
Jolis, a Freshman who appears
to object to the movie tastes of
non-existent Stanford T.A.s)
outstayed even its Freshman
welcome.
What about Marat/Sade,
then? Despite the insultingly
small audience near Stanford (it
figures) this is one of the really
great screen presentations of a
play. Peter Weiss' demoniacally
powerful script is preserved
with the same fidelity that
Strick awarded his Ulysses.
Very few people realize that
Sade was more than a sexual
pervert. He was a philosopher,
scientist and universal writer
who rotted in gaol by order of

Boney. Weiss imagines his meet
ing with Marat, a scrofulous
luminary of the New Regime
who (in Carlisle's French Revo
lution) gets less inches than
Robespierre.
Sade stages Marat's murder
on behalf of the prison govern
or's wife and daughter, who in
the movie get raped at the cli
max of the show. Weiss has a
soberer ending, but the film cor
responds to the play in most
other respects.
The film is brilliant in concep
tion and execution. Perhaps
Peter Brook's company of Strat
ford professionals are a shade
too sane, a shade too studied in
their silence and malicious grim
aces. Surely the essence of life
in an early nineteenth century
asylum Is spontaneity, unre
hearsed bedlam . . . neverthe
less, the Shakespearean actors
give a histrionic and often hor
rifying version of Sade's behind
bars presentation.
We are in a white and pastel
chamber, separated by bars
from a complacent audience in
modern dress, of whom we only
see the black silhouette of the
nuque. A rather persuasive ar
rangement of sunken cubicles
with wooden lids gives life to
the lack of stage directions in
Weiss.
Wigs and costumes are much
too studied to suggest the strait
jacket and the padded cell. Also,
the nuns, who were the only
charitable visitors to asylums
until the time of Charles Dick
ens, were almost indistinguish
able in their angiush from the
inmates.
