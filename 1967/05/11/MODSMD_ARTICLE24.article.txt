# Faulty Organ Hinders Student Performers
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Three very talented under
graduate students of the organ
gave a recital in the Memorial
Church Tuesday evening. Each
chose an ambitious program and
they were hampered as much
by the defects of their instru
ment as by the empty sonority
of the church in bringing it off.
It is a disgrace that a univer
sity which spends so much
money paying for graduates to
fly to medicine interviews, and
wasting millions on a library
that hardly has any books in
it, should not purchase an organ
to replace the 1900 a.d. pipes
at present available.
After registering this protest,
it is easier to explain why Sam
uel Swartz, David Johnson, and
William Schleiter failed to im
press their own personality on
the pieces which they perform
ed. Choice of program was also

oddly conservative for students,
who could presumably try some
Liszt, Brahms, Poulenc, St.
Saens, etc.
Swartz was best in his Hinde
mith Sonata, an evocative folk
song piece, into which he in
jected a pastoral melancholy
and oceans of gentleness. David
Johnson followed with Bach's
Prelude and Fugue in D Major;
a spiritual rendering in which
some dotted notes and rubato
occasionally seemed to be miss
ing.
William Schleiter's highlight
was Bach's Choral Prelude, (S.
662), which he interpreted with
the solemn slowness of Albert
Schweitzer. The great difficulty
in any rendering of this lovely
piece with its rich warm sweet
ness, is to coax out of the pipes
a harmony and peace that stays
out of sentimentality. This, with
the present Stanford organ, even
God could not do.
