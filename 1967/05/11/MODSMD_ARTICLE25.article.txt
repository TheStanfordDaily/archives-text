# City Is Tired
## Saigon Changed From 'Paris' 
### HOLT RUFFIN 
From my journal:
"Saigon has become tired,"
Don Luce, IVS Chief-of-Party
and veteran of eight years in
Vietnam, told me when I asked
him how the city had changed
since he had lived in it.
In the past, Saigon was called
the Paris of Asia. Used book
stalls lined Le Loi, the capital's
Champs Elysees. Through the
warm delta evenings slight Viet
namese girls strolled, their gos
samer ao dais floating only
inches off the street behind
them. Amber children sold bou
quets of sugar cane chunks on
bamboo spears to the passers
by, and in the morning crisp
loaves of French bread were to
be had at most any corner. Now,
with thirty thousand Americans
in the city, the corner hawk
ers are peddling candy, cigaret
tes, whiskey, and condoms in
stead. What is more, the girls
are afraid to walk in the city at
night, and not for fear of the
Viet Cong.
Saigon's streets are breath
lessly congested, what with the
great influx of military and
official vehicles. The municipal
transit system is moribund, so
most people have fallen back
upon bicycles, the cheapest,
"most reliable, and fastest means
of transportation available. Dur
ing rush hours these converge
on all streets to form a great
river of bobbing, twisting shapes
occasionally cleaved by honk
ing, speeding army trucks. At
the intersections bicycles, cy
clopousses, trucks, and horse
carts weave, buzz, rumble, and
trot every which way, defining
traffic lanes only as the moment
demands.
The confusion below is match
ed by the cacophony above. Over
head, the caterwaul of turbines
and din of combustion engines
from swarming choppers and
a multitude of other aircraft
shatter daily the Saigon skies.
There is no running water in
all of District Right. For that
small fraction of its 150,000 peo
ple that insists on water that at
leasts looks pure, water trucks
provide it at the cost of two and
one half piastres to the liter...
a high price. The water trucks
are owned by private individ
uals â€” Chinese, the Vietnamese
say. But I don't know whether
to believe this. The Vietnamese,
-almost to a man, attribute all
basic economic ills to the Chi
nese, who, they say, have a
ruthless stranghold on the econ
omy.
Happily, it's the rainy season
now and our cisterns are usual
ly full of water. I wash up in
the morning in our frankly sep
tic bathroom with plastic dishes.

The room I share with two to
six other people (they all have
homes in Saigon, where most
usually spend their nights),

above the offices of the develop
ment center, is bare and ugly.
Paint has peeled off the cracked
walls in large, damp patches
and the tile floors, by all appear
ances, have not been swept or
washed since they were laid. My
cot, thankfully, has a mosquito
net over it. Dr. Ho Van Minh,
director of the Development
Program, sent upstairs a small
table and chest for my scanty
gear. Albeit the simplest sort of
furniture, it is ostentatious in
these surroundings and I am
a little embarrassed by it. The
red-tiled roof of a great Chinese
warehouse and textile factory
dominates the view from my
window. At night I must leave
the window open because of the
heat, despite the rain or bats
that occasionally sweep into the
room. The clatter of looms next
door continues late into the
night. Close at hand whines the
radio of the development cadre.
From the distance sounds the
muffled sock of guns against

the darkness: usually artillery,
but sometimes mortar. I don't
sleep well on my cot; there's
always the noise, often dwarfed

by a screaming jet overhead,
and the heat, the humidity, or
an aching stomach.
At about eight in the morning
I awaken, sweating. My job, as
it was explained to me in a let
ter, is to work with students on

slum clearance. In fact, the stu
dents who work for the Eighth
District Development Program
don't do manual labor alongside
the Vietnamese, but rather act
as supervisors. Furthermore,
their labor is not a total dona
tion; it has its price, though
certainly not a high one. I have
found that where the actual con
struction work is occurring I
have neither the skills nor the
language to be of much help,
and sheer labor is in no short
supply. So after a couple of days
learning this at the Hung Phu
self-help housing project, I have
decided to look for other ave
nues for my efforts. Dr. Minh,
Mr. Liem, and others are eager
for me to try obtaining supplies
for them. Iron reinforcing rods,
cement, sand, bricks, and lum
ber are all in short supply in the

Eighth District, indeed all over
South Vietnam. They think my
nationality alone will be an open
sesame to the vast Army and
AID warehouses in Saigon. This
is clearly not the case, however,
my first investigations prove.
Pointing to a mammoth stack
of crates, which only partially
hide the marmoreal glow within,
the manager of the Cholon
Army warehouse explains in a
soft Georgia accent that his only
surplus is in toilets. As to who
ordered them, he has no idea;
but ten years, he is sure, won't
see their disappearance from
his warehouse. I'm welcome to
as many as I want.
I thank him but turn down
the offer, explaining that porce
lain toilet bowls don't figure
prominently in the needs of
the people of District Eight.

Ruffln spent 12 weeks in South Vletnajn last summer under the
auspices of the International Volunteer Service. He was the team
leader of seven Stanford students working in Vietnam. Presently
he is associate director of Volunteers in Asia, which was organized
last year on the Stanford campus. He is also now completing his
undergraduate work in Social Thought.
Parts of this article consist of entries in his journal of last sum
mer; other parts are recollections he recorded late last year. Part
three will appear tomorrow.
