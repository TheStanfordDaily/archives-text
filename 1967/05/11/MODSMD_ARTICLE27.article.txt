## More Music And Fun: Pleas Destined To Fall On Deaf Ears 
### Tim Haight 
(Editor's Not*': This article
was supposed to be a plug 1 for
"Gianni Schioei," the Stanford
Student Opera Guild's first
presentation, which is playing
in Dinkelspiel this Friday, Sat
urday, and Sunday. Instead, the
columnist (one of our more
tempermental) sent this letter.
It is self-explanatory.)
Dear Henry:
My wife will probably kill
me, but I can write the pre for
"Gianni Schicchi." Stanford stu
dents are all boobies and would
only go to an opera if they
couldn't get into a laundromat
to watch the machines.
I thought about appending
words like "Shifazz" or "Renais
sance RF" or even "Psychede
lic" to various descriptions of
the thing to stir up interest,
but it was all phony. Somehow
that seemed necessary. The fact
that it's a very funny produc
tion with beautiful singing and
some good acting, wouldn't be
enough.
On Deaf Ears
Even the further benefits that
it is a short opera and only
costs a dollar for students
promises to be ignored. Around
here it either has to be against
the war, capable of producing
halucinations, or guaranteed to
improve one's Playboy or Play
mate image.
I even thought about stress
ing the troubles the company
has had, especially with the
Music Department, but also in
cluding Joel Smith and LASSU.
But the truth is that even
though this production was not
given the department's support,

Joel and LASSU have been most
helpful. In a way, it would have
been better for sales if Joel had
turned them down. Then it
would be a cause celebre, and
on page one — instead of buried
among the Honda ads and Hip
po coupons.
Damn it, though, what this
place needs is more music and
fun. Somebody once asked John
Lennon when the Beatles were
going to do an anti-war song,
and he replied, "All our songs
are anti-war." It's the same way
with Puccini. Somehow I just
can't see old Gianni the swind
ler charging up hill 881 North.
How To Succeed . . .
That sly old The plot is
really funny. It should be tit
led. "How to Succeed in Univer
sity Administration ..." An old
guy dies and leaves his large
estate to the church. All the rel
atives, greedy vultures, want
their cut. So Gianni imperson
ates the dead man and plays
the perfect mediator-initiator —
grabbing most of the swag him
self.
But somehow opera is asso
ciated with Wagner, and fat old
ladies singing with winged hel
mets on their heads for hours
about every geist known to Ger
manic culture. It's the kind of
thing that Maggie does while
Jiggs goes to Dinty's. It is in
the "genteel tradition" and
therefore not studly or "in" or
even rebellious.
So Stanford will get what it
deserves. The nay-sayers in the
Music Department will feel
smug and happy as the Opera
plays to a three-quarters-or
more empty house, the cast will

try to ignore the echoes in the
hall, and everybody will go back
to musicology until the next
bunch of idealists come along.
So that's what Stanford is all
about. Herb Caen sometimes
calls San Francisco "Hicktown",
as when the Grey Line tours of
Haight-Ashbury started. Well
here we are. I wonder what
those lively, proud, people who
wrote operas would think now—
when the backbone of their sup
port comes'from the blue-haired
ladies of Palo Alto and the stu
dents go get stoned.
I hope I'm wrong.
Yours for anticounterderevi
sionism,
