## Suggestions For Spring 
### Joel Kugelmass 
It being Spring, the time of
rebirth and renewal at the Uni
versity, it is time too to remem
ber the small inadequacies, in
dignities, and absurities that de
velop here. To a certain extent,
some are inevitable for a large,
urban institution with rural
heritages. But also are reflected
the frivolity of an institution
which refuses to state its pur
poses, and that caters to a so
ciety full of resentment for
the Intellect, full of craving
for Intelligence. Stanford, com
pulsively active, has perhaps
overlooked some suggestions
for tasks commensurate to the
hollow forms students are asked
so often to fill. So ...
Spring things to do.
Instead of signing out, call
the Board of Trustees and tell
them you are safe.
Turn in the Administration
for turning in a false fire alarm
in their attempt to find out at
Roble who is obeying social reg
ulations.
Try to find a Jew or a New
Yorker in the undergraduate
classes to invite for lunch.
Tip the hashers at Tresidder
to help out with their deficit.
Sterling, Mayb<>?
Donate silver bullets to the
Stanford Police Department for
their nice, new guns.
Come and climb the new $70,-
000 scaffold at the I-Center pa
tio and pretend you are at the
Eiffel Tower, and find out other
neat ways to spend 70 grand.
Find out about professors
who are working to flunk pass
fail students.
Try to persuade the Business
Office to pave the cactus gar
dens.
Count the professional anti

communists at Hoover on both
hands, both feet, and those of
your friends.
Make a cat's cradle of the
military-industrial complex at
Stanford.
Every What?
Buy yourself a beer for every
Democrat on the Board of Trus
tees and go to bed sober.
Buy yourself a beer for every
Board member who is not in the
military-industrial complex on
the same night.
Ask your favorite campus
theologian if he is going to be
able to stay here.
Donate a book to the under
graduate library.
Ask the telephone operators
at Lag and Branner if they
should be the conscience and
proctor of women here.
Find out why the Stanford
student is admitted more on
high school activities and per
sonality than on academic quali
fications.
A New Kind of Ix>an
Since Engineering is the
only undergraduate department
which can hire new faculty next
year, ask them if they would not
loan the Humanities some teach
ers.
See if psychiatrists' offices in
Cowell Health Center were not
disguised in official blueprints.
Demand that the President of
Shell International be invited
back to give another graduation
speech.
Ask why the faculty are hav
ing only token say in the selec
tion of a new University Presi
dent.
Ask financial aids for a schol
arship to get a haircut at the
Stanford barbershop.
Ask freshmen if they are to-

tally satisfied with the Western
Civilization courses.
Mourn the loss of the Voice
Project.
Request that the part time
CIA man who works at Stanford
be given student status.
Figure out why 17 units of
General Studies science are re
quired, 10 units of social science,
and only six units of humanities.
Go ask Alice.
Think about expiring 11-S de
ferments.
Remember: The life you live
can be your own.
