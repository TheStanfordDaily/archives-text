# LASSU To Vote On Exp't. Funds
## 
### 
LASSU will meet tonight at 7:30 in
Room 320. Included in the agenda
for the meeting or a number of reso
lutions calling for changes in the
ASSU Constitution.
Part of the business left over from
last week when LASSU didn't meet
will concern ratification of recent
ASSU elections. There is also a re
quest for $200 to cover operating ex
penses of the Legislature.
Also up for final action is a reso
lution requesting there be no further
ASSU appropriations to the Experi
ment until the group agrees to use
no more of its money for political
activities.
Up for referral action by the Legis
lature tonight are a number of reso
lutions. The first of these urges
amending the by-laws of the Aca
demic Committee to provide a chan
nel for communication and action be
tween different departments in the
school.
The lIR intends to submit a new
constitution. Another resolution calls
for requiring LASSU members to at
tend at least one-half of the meetings,

as opposed to one-third currently re
quired.
There are two amendments con
cerning elections. The first requests
that the Elections Commission pro
vide, by air mail packet, information
concerning campaigns and candidates
along with the primary and general
election ballots.
The second requests that IBM cards
be handed out in the Spring Registra
tion packets listing all of the candi
dates names for ASSU offices and
other issues to be voted on. These
cards would be filled out by the stu
dents and "have to be handed in by
the second Friday of the quarter be
fore the student would be considered
registered.
A further amendment requests that
the social regulations and open hous
ing will be removed from the ASSU
by-laws.
A number of committees might be
abolished. Among these are the ASSU
Concert Commission, the Stanford
Volunteers, and Stanford Community
Aid Agency.
The final proposal calls for revis
ing ASSU by-laws concerning finan
cial procedure.
