## True Education Requires Open Minds, Closed Mouths 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We've finally reached that
point: we have stopped think
ing and started talking. Not
that we didn't talk before, but
we used to think when we did.
By thinking I mean looking at
an issue from all sides, keeping
an open mind to some extent at
least, and listening to what
other people say. But now we
have relieved ourselves of that
burden of thinking.
Take a look at the New Left;
take a look at the Old Right.
When the two meet one would
expect some meaningful discus
sion. Instead, what comes out
is propaganda and one-sided
views. They have forgotten that
a discussion is supposed to dis
cover what is true. Each side is
convinced that they are right;
they have the answer. But
could it be possible that the
other person might be right in
some degree also? Or does one
side have a monopoly on truth?
I don't know if Stanford is
on the "edge of greatness" or
not; but if Stanford is close, if
Stanford really wants to make
itself a great educational insti
tution and we want to learn,
then we ought to open our
minds more — and perhaps our
mouths a little less.

• Price Is Right
Editor, The Daily:
In response to questions
about the Union:
1. As far as the design goes,
the Tresidder eating area was
laid out to handle 2,000 people
a day; it now handles 6,000. So
far, efforts to get an addition
to the Union (that would in
clude a restaurant and Rathskel

ler) put on any kind of priority
at the University have failed.
We at the Union have been try
ing to explain the urgent need
for years to those that make
these decisions and allocations.
Everyone's help is needed to do
this.
2. As far as the prices go,
that is due to the inflation caus
ed by the war. We have manag
ed to keep our price increases
below the average rise in prices,
but as long as the war continues
there is no let-up in sight. I am
afraid I can't suggest to whom
you can complain; I have been
trying for years, but haven't
gotten much of a response.

• Quiz Of The Day
Editor, The Daily:
Recently at a rally in White
Plaza I made the point that
many Americans were stagger
ing blindly through the great
moral crisis of our time, and
that one of the reasons for this
was that there are so few good
newspapers to give them the
facts that will enable them to
deal with the distortions and
lies spewed out by the govern
ment every day. I said that
there is no first-class newspaper
in this area, and that if the
Stanford community wanted to
find out how much difference
this could make, they might try
reading the New York Times
for a week. (Why is it that the
shop in the Union carries so
few copies of the Times that
it is sold out almost immediate
ly?) The Times has four able
reporters in Vietnam (most
papers don't have as much as
one), and it has editors like
Harrison Salisbury, who has

told us all that we know about
the bombing of Hanoi.
May I suggest to the faculty
that it allow 15 minutes of class
time this week for the short
exam that follows:
1) How many troops does the
U.S. have in Vietnam? How
many Viet Cong troops are in
South Vietnam?
2) Who is the premier of
South Vietnam? What is his
profession? Who has he taken
as his model? From what class
does he come?
3) What reason does Wash
ington give for bombing North
Vietnam? For refusing to allow
another pause in the bombing?
4) What is the role of China
in the war?
5) What is the first Amend
ment? Who, in the American
Congress has suggested that we
"forget about" it? Why?
6) Who are the Viet Cong;
from where do they come?
7) What is the "pacification"
program? has it accom
plished?
8) What are the Geneva Ac
cords of 1954? What significant
action did our government take,
in 1956, with reference to them?
~9) What is the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution? What happened in
the Tonkin Gulf?
10) What is napalm? What
is its effect?
11) If you score less than
50% on this exam, do you feel
that you are entitled to an opin
ion on the war
I will be glad to supply the
correct answers. They can also
be found in any one of six or
seven books on Vietnam. They
are already known by any regu
lar reader of a first-class news
paper.
