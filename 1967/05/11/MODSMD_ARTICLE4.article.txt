# Braden Discusses 'Black Power'
## 
### ROGER La BRUCHERIE 
Carl Braden, executive director of
the Southern Conference Education
Fund (SCEF), last night described
'the evolution of the Black Power
movement as the response of con
cerned Negroes to the paternalism
which political organizations have
long accorded to the Southern black
man.
In his presentation, "A White
Southerner Talks About Black
Power," Braden stressed the need for
the coalition of black power and

white power if the power of political
decision-making is to be wrested from
the grip of the small, economically
dominant groups which control South
ern communities. Braden feels that
the failure of the poor whites and
Negroes to organize and the ability
of the large industrialists and land
owners to coerce the white middle
class are the factors which have en
abled the white power structure to
continue denying basic human rights.
Further, Braden stated that the con
trol of the "sheriff's office and tax
assessor's office" have enabled the
industrialists and landowners to
"make a wad of money" while people
are paid starvation wages.
SCEF and other groups in the
South are attempting to remedy this
situation by organizing the poor
whites and Negroes to take control
of the political sphere.
The Black Power movement,
Braden stated, is an attempt to or
ganize this potential political strength.

He commented that the usual picture
painted in the press of the Black
Power movement as "a diabolical plot
to take over the country by killing
off the white people" has no link to
the correct meaning of Black Power.
Rather, Black Power involves "inde
pendent political action and dissent";
it is based on the interpretation of the
word "power" as "strength," mean
ing oplitical strength on a democratic
basis.
That the Black Power movement
has sprung up is testimony to the fail
ure of groups seeking to organize the
South to include the Negro on an
equal basis, Braden commented. Both
the Populist and the Socialist move
ments enjoyed only limited successes
because they continued to regard the
Negro from a paternalistic attitude.
Because they treated the Negro on
this basis they failed to enlist his
support in these movements, Braden
told his audience.
The Black Power movement, then,

was the natural outgrowth of this
failure to include the Negro in these
political movements and the growth
of political awareness in Negroes
after the Second World War. Braden
commented that the reaction of white
people to the Black Power movement
is one of both fright—owing to mis
conceptions as to its methods—and of
taking offense that blacks should want
to have an independent voice in the
political sphere.
Must Combine Blacks And Whites
Braden feels, however, that the
answer to the problem of human
rights and economic progress for the
poor people of the South lies in com
bining the strength of blacks and
whites. He commented that this was
the view of SNCC and other civil
rights groups as well, and that this
prospect was likely to become reality
in the near future. "The choice is pa
ternalism or democracy," Braden
summed it up, "and it's going to be
democracy."

assessor's office" have enabled the
industrialists and landowners to
"make a wad of money" while people
are paid starvation wages.
SCEF and other groups in the
South are attempting to remedy this
situation by organizing the poor
whites and Negroes to take control
of the political sphere.
The Black Power movement,
Braden stated, is an attempt to or
ganize this potential political strength.

He commented that the usual picture
painted in the press of the Black
Power movement as "a diabolical plot
to take over the country by killing
off the white people" has no link to
the correct meaning of Black Power.
Rather, Black Power involves "inde
pendent political action and dissent";
it is based on the interpretation of the
word "power" as "strength," mean
ing oplitical strength on a democratic
basis.
That the Black Power movement
has sprung up is testimony to the fail
ure of groups seeking to organize the
South to include the Negro on an
equal basis, Braden commented. Both
the Populist and the Socialist move
ments enjoyed only limited successes
because they continued to regard the
Negro from a paternalistic attitude.
Because they treated the Negro on
this basis they failed to enlist his
support in these movements, Braden
told his audience.
The Black Power movement, then,

was the natural outgrowth of this
failure to include the Negro in these
political movements and the growth
of political awareness in Negroes
after the Second World War. Braden
commented that the reaction of white
people to the Black Power movement
is one of both fright—owing to mis
conceptions as to its methods—and of
taking offense that blacks should want
to have an independent voice in the
political sphere.
Must Combine Blacks And Whites
Braden feels, however, that the
answer to the problem of human
rights and economic progress for the
poor people of the South lies in com
bining the strength of blacks and
whites. He commented that this was
the view of SNCC and other civil
rights groups as well, and that this
prospect was likely to become reality
in the near future. "The choice is pa
ternalism or democracy," Braden
summed it up, "and it's going to be
democracy."
Carl Braden, executive director of
the Southern Conference Education
Fund (SCEF), last night described
'the evolution of the Black Power
movement as the response of con
cerned Negroes to the paternalism
which political organizations have
long accorded to the Southern black
man.
In his presentation, "A White
Southerner Talks About Black
Power," Braden stressed the need for
the coalition of black power and

white power if the power of political
decision-making is to be wrested from
the grip of the small, economically
dominant groups which control South
ern communities. Braden feels that
the failure of the poor whites and
Negroes to organize and the ability
of the large industrialists and land
owners to coerce the white middle
class are the factors which have en
abled the white power structure to
continue denying basic human rights.
Further, Braden stated that the con
trol of the "sheriff's office and tax
assessor's office" have enabled the
industrialists and landowners to
"make a wad of money" while people
are paid starvation wages.
