# Tom, Horwitz, Brooks In; Class Rank Vote Passes
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Stanford men yesterday approved
a referendum calling for the Univers
ity to cease supplying academic stand
ing to draft boards.
In ASSU runoffs Soleng Tom and
and Jere Horwitz were chosen Senior
Class President and Vice President.
Bob Brooks defeated Gregg Murphy
for NSA Representative at large.
The 59 per cent affirmative vote for
the class ranking referendum was less
than had been anticipated. Some at
tributed this to the poor wording of
the resolution. TTie referendum's

wording was adopted by LASSU after
lengthy debate two weeks ago.
High 'No' Vote
ASSU President Mike Collins said
last night: "I understand the poor
wording of the referendum created
quite a bit of confusion at the polls.
I am partially to blame for this prob
lem and hope that the disproportion
ately high 'no' vote will not hurt the
faculty-student movement to neutral
ize the University's involvement with
the draft."
The approval of the referendum is
a recommendation to President Ster
ling and the Board of Trustees. The
Executive Committee of the Academic
Council two months ago sent an "ad
visory letter" to President Sterling
calling for the University to "recon
sider the supplying of ranking to draft
boards for the purpose of deciding
who should be drafted."
The Executive Committee's action
followed specific proposals adopted by
the entire Academic Council last June.
At that time the Academic Council
recommended that the University con
tinue to notify local draft boards of
a student's academic standing if the
student so requested. They have not
considered the issue since then.
Tom And Horwitz
Soleng Tom and Jere Horwitz, offi
cers for next year's Senior Class, are
both members of El Cuadro Eating
Club. Tom, a psychology major, and
Horwitz, an economics major, origin
ally filed as running mates but Elec
tions Commissioner later ruled that
candidates for Senior Class officers
had to run independently. Both sub
sequently survived the primary and
yesterday were elected.
Tom and Horwitz campaigned for
a rating booklet of graduate schools
to be produced with the aid of Coun

seling and Testing office. They also
propose a twelve to 24 hour beach
party next spring quarter. Their plat
form included panel discussions,
symposiums, and Senior sponsorship
of big name entertainment on campus.
NSA winner Bob Brooks is a junior
psychology major. He will attend the
NSA Conference in late summer, as
will Gail Kitaji, Stanford's other rep
resentative at large. Miss Kitaji was
elected in the primary last week.
Other ASSU officers will also attend.
The election was completed yester
day with volunteers manning the polls
and student police guarding the poll
ing areas. Controversy developed dur
ing the first day of voting when Tom
and his opponent, Mark Fogelman, re
fused to allow their supoprters to man
the polls.
Only 1627 voted in the ASSU final.
Over 4500 voted last year in the run
off between David Harris and Bob
Klein.
