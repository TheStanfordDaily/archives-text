# Brewster Talks About Defense Research, Considers Problems Of Drugs On Campus
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
"I think it would be better for so
ciety if more college presidents were
less inhibited about stating personal
views." To prove his point, Kingman
Brewster, President of Yale, proceed
ed to comment on issues ranging
from Vietnam to the use of LSD.
Sitting on the deck of the Faculty
Club yesterday morning, Brewster
began by talking about Vietnam. "If
I were President of the United States
tomorrow morning, I don't know what
I'd do. I hate the war, and I think
President Johnson hates it too. But
I really can't offer any solution. I
haven't had time to figure out a bet
ter policy."
Brewster, who had bravely ven
tured out onto the deck in search of
some sun from a cloud-spotted sky,
expanded his initial thoughts on the
role of a college President as a pub
lic spokesman. "It is a mistake for a
president to sound off on every issue
of public concern. It's better to ra
tion your shots. But I do think a col
lege president has a public spokes
manship he ought to use."
"We're not faceless men, as some
students believe, or clearing houses
for that matter. We do face the dilem
ma of being sure that over-eagerness
to speak our own mind won't under
mine the confidence of our faculty.
But that doesn't mean we have to
submerge our own convictions."
Drug: Problem
As he gazed out over the rear plaza
of Tresidder Union, Brewster com
mented on drugs in universities. "I
think it's absurd that harmless and
harmful drugs should be treated in
the same manner by society. Basical
ly, it should be a medical problem
rather than a problem for the law.
I can easily understand why students
lose respect for the law when, in a
case such as this, the law is so irra
tional."
"But until the law is changed you
can't expect the authorities not to
play it straight. If they cut corners

here and there, they would lose con
trol."
With a chilly, sorrowful moan,
Brewster shook his head at the gray
sky and suggested a move into the
President's Suite, the plush, three
room guest quarters of the club.
Brewster settled into a comfortable
easy chair and turned to the question
of defense contracts in universities.
He said, "I insist, for any research
at Yale, that three points be present:
it be unclassified, it be research ini
tiated by the researcher and not the
sponsor, and the source of support
be made public."
War Research Efforts
The next question was more speci
fic: "Would you prohibit open re
search work directed towards helping
further some aspect of the Vietnam
war? For example, research to de
velop a more destructive type of na
palm."
Brewster answered, "I think that's
an unrealistic question because any
real dirty work such as that would
be classified. I really can't think of
a specific case of the type you sug
gest. My feeling, in general, is that
research mustn't be halted simply be
cause, in some cases, it produces by
products that are used by the mili
tary."

The discussion turned here to the
question of whether modern univer
sities were preparing students to
enter an increasingly impersonal
world. "Facetiously, I'd say the best
thing we can do, in that case, is make
universities more impersonal. But
seriously, I think we must be sure
that universities maintain a sensi
tivity to personal and human con
cerns. I'm afraid we've done better
on organization of life than personal
ization in the last fifty years. I'm
anti-bigness myself. How else could
I be a professor of anti-trust law?"
At this point Mrs. Brewster enter
ed the room and the conversation
turned toward comparing Stanford
and Yale. Brewster was unwilling to
make any subjective remarks, but
did note that he thought Yale had
greater curricular flexibility and not
as many ties to big-time research as
Stanford. He also pointed out that
Yale has no Business School.
On student trends, he remarked
that they were very similar at Yale
and Stanford. Mentioning a discus
sion he had at Grove House the eve
ning before, Brewster said that stu
dents at Yale also express strong
feelings about their undergraduate
education, voicing great discontent.
He added, "From what I can see,
Yale is more cohesive than Stanford.

We're in a city and we're not as
spread out as you are." In a side
issue, he noted that Yale and New
Haven have "great relations".
Brewster next compared student
government at the two institutions.
"We don't have an elaborate system
such as yours. In fact, we really
don't have any government. We rely
on the leadership of extra-curricular
activities, and to a growing extent,
on the Senior Advisory Board, a
group of seniors representing the dif
ferent colleges."
Mrs. Brewster, who had been pa
tiently listening to her husband, add
ed a personal note to the exchange.
Brewster had just responded to a
question asking what being Presi
dent means to family life. He had
said, "I was a bad family man before."
Mrs. Brewster quickly said with an
amused look, "And it hasn't changed
at all."
Brewster explained that he was
traveling five or six days a month. At
this, Mrs. Brewster declared, "Come
on, think of all your trips to New
York. Away is away."
As if in response, there was a
knock at the door and Herbert Pack
er entered to escort Brewster to lunch
with the Steering Committee of the
Study of Education at Stanford.
