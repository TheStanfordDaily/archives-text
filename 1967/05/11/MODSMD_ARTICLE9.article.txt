# 76 Med Students Sign Pledge Not To Fight In Vietnam War
## 
### 
Seventy-six of the 303 students en
rolled in the Stanford Medical School
have joined more than 150 other stu
dents at medical schools around the
nation in signing statements in which

they refuse to serve with the armed
forces in Vietnam.
It was disclosed yesterday that 45
of the 475 students at the University
of California Medical Center in San
Francisco had signed the statement.
More than 80 faculty members at the
two schools signed statements in sup
port of the students.
The student statement, which em
phasized their desire to serve their
profession "with conscience and dig
nity," pledged that they would "seek
means to serve (our) country and
humanity which are compatible with
the preservation and enrichment of
life... In the name of freedom, the
U.S. Ls waging an unjustified war in
Vietnam and is causing incalculable
suffering."
"It is the goal of the medical pro
fession to prevent and relieve human
suffering," the statement continued.
"Our effort to pursue this goal is
meaningless in the context of war."
Among students signing the pledge
were 16 students at Harvard and 17
at Western Reserve University. Johns
Hopkins, Columbia, Temple, Pennsy
lvania, Chicago, Southern California,
Northwestern, Wayne State, Boston,
Georgetown, UCLA, and Yale are
among institutions at which medical
students have signed the statement.
Michael Smith of Stanford and
Arthur Zelman of the UC Medical
Center, who are spokesmen for those
signing, emphasized that their work
had no ties with any political group

or medical organizations and that
signers spoke for themselves as in
dividuals only.
The two stated, "Each signer must
develop his own course of action in
fulfilling the commitment" not to
serve with the military in Vietnam.
Alternatives include service in the
Public Health Service, service as a
conscientious objector with alterna
tive medical programs, service with
the armed forces except in Vietnam,
or non-cooperation with the selective
service system on constitutional
grounds.
The statement of support of more
than 50 Stanford Medical School fac
ulty said, "We admire the initiative
and courage of these students who
have made a personal commitment
to a cause in which they believe
strongly. We intend to support them
and their position in whatever way
becomes necessary and appropriate."
