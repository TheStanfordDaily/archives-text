# Draft And The C.O.
## Implications Of C.O. Discussed By Lawyer, Professor, Lecturer 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
Lloyd Mac Murray, a San Francisco
attorney, Paul Seaver, Assistant Pro
fessor of History, Jay Neugeboren,
lecturer in English, and Peter Ware,
former Business School student and
Anti-Draft Union spokesman, partici
pated in a question and answer meet
ing on the draft in the Junipero
lounge last night.
Seaver described the Selective Ser
vice conscientious objector (C.0.)
classification system.
"Claim for exemption as l-O, or
1-A-O has to be based on religious
training and belief," Seaver explained.
l-O status holders can substitute two
years of civilian service, such as in a
mental hospital. 1-A-O status holders
perform non-combatant service in the
Army, usually as medics.
Belief In Supreme Being
"First, the Supreme Court has held
that a strong belief in a Supreme Be
ing need not be a belief in God, but
must hold the same position as a be
lief in God would for an "obvious"
God-based C.O. Second, the objection
to war must be an objection to war
in any form," continued Seaver.
Seaver warned, "Ideally, one applies
for 1-0 or 1-A-O status at age 18.
Legally, one can request the form
until one has been sent a notice of
induction. But appeals boards find it
more difficult to believe those who
apply later."
Mac Murray discussed the case of
the man who becomes a C.O. after he
has been inducted into the Army. He
described the "likely" course of a
refusal to obey orders which would
lead to courtmartial, prison, and a dis
honorable discharge.
Organization Needed
He suggested, "Without organiza
tion, you stand as an individual with
the Army arrayed against you. With
organization, money can be raised,

and you can fight in the courts."
He continued, "The Secretary of de
fense in 1962 announced exemption of
C.O.s from military service. One may
apply for a C.O. discharge. If your
application is turned down without
reason, you can then use habeas cor
pus in the courts."
But, observed Mac Murray, "No one
has yet been able to make this work."
Neugeboren stressed the decision
of conscience is personal, even when
society has sanctioned a war through
democratic institutions.
For the man who feels he does not
fit C.O. categories, and does not want
to go to jail, Peter Ware suggested,
"People do get 1-Y deferments. Gen

erally, it means you've made so much
trouble with the government that they
don't want to touch you."
Seaver, a non-cooperator, described
his experience, "I was given a light
sentence of 18 months. Then I was
tried and convicted again, but only
given a one day sentence. The Justice
Department did not prosecute me a
third time."
Seaver said that he knew of no real
difficulties because of his prison rec
ord, although his Fulbright Fellow
ship application was not considered
because of his prison record.
Mac Murray noted, "In California,
people have been admitted to the bar
who have been convicted of felonies."
