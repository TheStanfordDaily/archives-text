# 'Toward Disengagement' Explores Anti-War Policies
## 
### 
Organizers of next Tuesday's
"Toward Disengagement," a
"community meeting of those
concerned about the Vietnam
War," announced yesterday that
a number of groups and indivi
duals have volunteered to pro
sent possible policies toward dis
engagement and suggestions
for community action. The sug
gestions for action, however,
are far more varied than for
policies.
One of the organizers, David
Ransom, a teaching-assistant in
English, said that most of those
who have volunteered support
"some sort of withdrawal." He
said that he hoped that other
alternative policies would Ik?
presented, "such as the Gavin
proposal for withdrawal into en
claves," because he thinks "that
position is held by a significant

part of the Stanford commu
nity."
Ransom said that suggestions
to be made at Tuesday's session
wilj probably include proposals
[for a national committee of
professors "to look into the pos
sibilities of disengagement," po
litical action within the present
political parties, participation in
the Viet Summer program (with
potential movement toward "a
third political force"), and civil
disobedience.
So far potential participants
include Brooks Otis, Stuart Mc-
Lean, Michael Novak, George
Leppert, Jay Neugeboren, the
Stanford Community Concerned
About Vietnam, SDS, Grove
House, and others.
Hansom said that no members
of the University Administra
tion had yet volunteered to pre
sent positions, but added he hop
ed they would.
