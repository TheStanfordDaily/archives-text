## SRT Spoofs Hollywood Scene 
### BRUCE MERRY 
In yesterday's Daily magazine
three SRT actors said, amongst
other things, that they thought
Once In A Lifetime was shaping
well. It opened last night in
Memorial Auditorium and
proved them right.
This Kaufman-Hart collabora
tion is basically a script which
ridicules the vacuous hypo
crisy of the the Hollywood scene
at a time when movies were
just going talkie (A 1 Jolson's
The Jazz Singer, 1927).
Three impecunious actors en
train from New York to Holly
wood (which gives them some
very amusing scenes with Paul
Winfield as the wise-guy colored
carriage attendant). They go be
cause they want to cash in on
the advent of talkies by setting
up an elocution school.
Slow Start
The trio starts at the hotel
room, a scene which really mis
fires. Despite snappy lines like:
"What's a four-letter word for
acting?" Answer: "Don't", Jos
eph Medalis, Miss Leversee and
Morgan Sterne never quite get
under way until the train scene.
Jane Hoffman is on the same
train, as an omnipotent movie
columnist with outrageous
clothes and few brains called
Helen Hobart. I always sense
vulgarity in her characteriza
tions and I'm not quite sure that
it fits for a journalist as shrewd
as she is popular.
The third scene is the first in
a series of spectacular colorful
extravaganzas. It stank of
money but so did Hollywood in
the early 30's. Waiters, porters
and cigarette girls go through
the most incredible gyrations to
impress the circumnavigating
great ones of the screen.
From the hotel reception, at
which the speech teachers estab
lish the validity of their idea, we
move to the reception office of
the fantastic Glogauer studio.
Ruth Hunt is effective as the
fatuous secretary who changes
her hair from black to yellow to
orange. Gilbert Green is snorty
and bull-eyed as Glogauer the
divine.
In the studio we have Gerald
Hiken; ("He was one of a ship
ment of 16 playwrights") He has
no work to do, can't get to see
God and finally goes mad
through leisure. Hiken has silent

indignation and spluttering
neurosis, but beyond these two
mannerisms he refuses, or can
not, let his part take him.
Meanwhile the speech school
collapse and Joe Medalis man
ages by sheer incompetence to
rise in Glogauer's organization.
Wonderful clowning and an ex
cellent rubber face make Me
dalis (as usual) the star of an
SRT show; Wednesday night he
couldn't put a foot wrong. His
mere appearance in flying kit
was hilarious.
Humorous Parody
He makes the wrong film. He
uses a hopeless actress. He or
ders several hundred aircraft to
secure one free plane. And all
the time the servants go into
ecstatic poses aroung the great
one and lines like: "She had the
most beautiful legs in America."
"Yes, but legs don't talk." nail
humor into the parody.
The Glogauer set, with Shel
don Feldner playing the gurg
ling ecclesiastic who weds the
stars at the end of the wrong
script, is phenomenal. Extraor
dinary stage movements, com
plex lighting and up to twenty
people on stage at once seem
to cause SRT no trouble.
On the set Jerome Raphel is
rather convincing as the Ger

man producer with a Himmel
und Gott for every crisis. Edel
man also comes over well in a
variety of roles; his fluency and
comedy have something of
Sellers in Strangelove.
Everything fades to the train
trip back to New York, with
Winfield now teasing Leversee
for abandoning her "California
here-I-come" exuberance. The
disastrous script is a hit; Me
dalis takes over Glogauer and
has his picture light up over
revery office door in the organi
zation.
Spirited Production
The spirit of the whole eve
ning is fast and light. A big
show with no pretensions at pro
foundness, most of its defects
can be traced to a script which
is not nearly as funny as it could
be.
The actors are to be credited
for raising laughter as often as
they did with material never
more funny than: "That's the
way we do things out here. No
time wasted on thinking." Ed
Parone came specially to direct
the show before going on to the
Festival Di Due Mondl at Spo
leto, Italy. He has brought down
the curtain on SRT's last pro
duction this season and also
made it into the best.

trip back to New York, with
Winfield now teasing Leversee
for abandoning her "California
here-I-come" exuberance. The
disastrous script is a hit; Me
dalis takes over Glogauer and
has his picture light up over
revery office door in the organi
zation.
Spirited Production
The spirit of the whole eve
ning is fast and light. A big
show with no pretensions at pro
foundness, most of its defects
can be traced to a script which
is not nearly as funny as it could
be.
The actors are to be credited
for raising laughter as often as
they did with material never
more funny than: "That's the
way we do things out here. No
time wasted on thinking." Ed
Parone came specially to direct
the show before going on to the
Festival Di Due Mondl at Spo
leto, Italy. He has brought down
the curtain on SRT's last pro
duction this season and also
made it into the best.
In yesterday's Daily magazine
three SRT actors said, amongst
other things, that they thought
Once In A Lifetime was shaping
well. It opened last night in
Memorial Auditorium and
proved them right.
This Kaufman-Hart collabora
tion is basically a script which
ridicules the vacuous hypo
crisy of the the Hollywood scene
at a time when movies were
just going talkie (A 1 Jolson's
The Jazz Singer, 1927).
Three impecunious actors en
train from New York to Holly
wood (which gives them some
very amusing scenes with Paul
Winfield as the wise-guy colored
carriage attendant). They go be
cause they want to cash in on
the advent of talkies by setting
up an elocution school.
Slow Start
The trio starts at the hotel
room, a scene which really mis
fires. Despite snappy lines like:
"What's a four-letter word for
acting?" Answer: "Don't", Jos
eph Medalis, Miss Leversee and
Morgan Sterne never quite get
under way until the train scene.
Jane Hoffman is on the same
train, as an omnipotent movie
columnist with outrageous
clothes and few brains called
Helen Hobart. I always sense
vulgarity in her characteriza
tions and I'm not quite sure that
it fits for a journalist as shrewd
as she is popular.
The third scene is the first in
a series of spectacular colorful
extravaganzas. It stank of
money but so did Hollywood in
the early 30's. Waiters, porters
and cigarette girls go through
the most incredible gyrations to
impress the circumnavigating
great ones of the screen.
From the hotel reception, at
which the speech teachers estab
lish the validity of their idea, we
move to the reception office of
the fantastic Glogauer studio.
Ruth Hunt is effective as the
fatuous secretary who changes
her hair from black to yellow to
orange. Gilbert Green is snorty
and bull-eyed as Glogauer the
divine.
In the studio we have Gerald
Hiken; ("He was one of a ship
ment of 16 playwrights") He has
no work to do, can't get to see
God and finally goes mad
through leisure. Hiken has silent

indignation and spluttering
neurosis, but beyond these two
mannerisms he refuses, or can
not, let his part take him.
Meanwhile the speech school
collapse and Joe Medalis man
ages by sheer incompetence to
rise in Glogauer's organization.
Wonderful clowning and an ex
cellent rubber face make Me
dalis (as usual) the star of an
SRT show; Wednesday night he
couldn't put a foot wrong. His
mere appearance in flying kit
was hilarious.
Humorous Parody
He makes the wrong film. He
uses a hopeless actress. He or
ders several hundred aircraft to
secure one free plane. And all
the time the servants go into
ecstatic poses aroung the great
one and lines like: "She had the
most beautiful legs in America."
"Yes, but legs don't talk." nail
humor into the parody.
The Glogauer set, with Shel
don Feldner playing the gurg
ling ecclesiastic who weds the
stars at the end of the wrong
script, is phenomenal. Extraor
dinary stage movements, com
plex lighting and up to twenty
people on stage at once seem
to cause SRT no trouble.
On the set Jerome Raphel is
rather convincing as the Ger

man producer with a Himmel
und Gott for every crisis. Edel
man also comes over well in a
variety of roles; his fluency and
comedy have something of
Sellers in Strangelove.

was hilarious.
Humorous Parody
He makes the wrong film. He
uses a hopeless actress. He or
ders several hundred aircraft to
secure one free plane. And all
the time the servants go into
ecstatic poses aroung the great
one and lines like: "She had the
most beautiful legs in America."
"Yes, but legs don't talk." nail
humor into the parody.
The Glogauer set, with Shel
don Feldner playing the gurg
ling ecclesiastic who weds the
stars at the end of the wrong
script, is phenomenal. Extraor
dinary stage movements, com
plex lighting and up to twenty
people on stage at once seem
to cause SRT no trouble.
On the set Jerome Raphel is
rather convincing as the Ger

man producer with a Himmel
und Gott for every crisis. Edel
man also comes over well in a
variety of roles; his fluency and
comedy have something of
Sellers in Strangelove.
Everything fades to the train
trip back to New York, with
Winfield now teasing Leversee
for abandoning her "California
here-I-come" exuberance. The
disastrous script is a hit; Me
dalis takes over Glogauer and
has his picture light up over
revery office door in the organi
zation.
Spirited Production
The spirit of the whole eve
ning is fast and light. A big
show with no pretensions at pro
foundness, most of its defects
can be traced to a script which
is not nearly as funny as it could
be.
The actors are to be credited
for raising laughter as often as
they did with material never
more funny than: "That's the
way we do things out here. No
time wasted on thinking." Ed
Parone came specially to direct
the show before going on to the
Festival Di Due Mondl at Spo
leto, Italy. He has brought down
the curtain on SRT's last pro
duction this season and also
made it into the best.
