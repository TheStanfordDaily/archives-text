## Opera To Open 
### BRUCE MERRY 
A splendid performance of
Gianni Schicchi is being re
hearsed and prepared at the
moment by The Stanford Opera
Guild. It is in English.
It is high time Stanford did
something to improve its vain
and absurd strivings after Eur
opeanism. The whole music de
partment failed to cooperate of
ficially with what promises to
be one of the few interesting
evenings on Campus this year.
Then let the Music Faculty
go to hell. That music students
should have to mount so diffi
cult a show without either finan
cing or advice from their aca
demic superiors could only hap
pen at a provincial relic like
Stanford Spoonfeed.
What does the Music Faculty
think it is doing? Where are the
masses and quartets that would
justify their ignoring the first
opera on Campus for four
years?
Performances are tonight, to
morrow and Sunday in Dinkel
spiel at 8:30 p.m. You, students,
are being hit one buck for at
tendance. The hideous challenge
of putting up with a 50-minute
opera is great for you, I know.
Carriek Patterson will sing
the male lead; Donald Andrews,
who heads the intrepid new op
erates, also sings, with Susan
Baker and Wendy Haight in the
two main female roles.
One last word. The Campus
Ministry (I refer more speci
fically to Novak) liked the "sex
ual" message of The Beard.
That show hit you two and a
half dollars for an hour of trifl
ing drivel. Why doesn't Profes
sor Novak pack up his pulpit
and take it to Dink, instead?
