# El Toro Runners Capture IM First In Team Victory
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Without winning a single run
ning event, and taking only one
first in the field events, El Toro
scored 45 V6 points to win the
intramural track meet this week.
El Toro's win resulted from
a team effort, with points com
ing from second and third places
in the 880, third and fourth
places in the mile, a second and
a fifth in the 440, and a third in
the mile relay.
Bill Callison, running for the
Ketchum House, set a new rec

of a second at 4:36.1. The Delt
880 relay team of Blunt, Pierose,
Duffy, and Harris set a new
record of 1.34.8. A third record

came from fleet John Guillory,
who sped the 100 in 10.0.
The lone freshman winner in
the meet was Bob Spanner of
Rinconada, who jumped out
quickly in the 440 and held on
to win in 51.4.
The closets races of the Wed
nesday afternoon action were
the hurdles races. Lee Coles of
Kappa Sig was just a step ahead
of Gary Maes from Trancos and
just a tenth second off the IM
record in the 120 lows at 13.7.
Jim Marlar of S.A.E. took a
close 70 highs race in 9.1.
Dave Duncan, an unattached
entry, won the 220 race in 23.0
