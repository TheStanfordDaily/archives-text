# Indian Cricket Wicket Swings, Chirps Merry

### BRUCE MERRY 
Stanford has a cricket side. I
know, because I play for it. It
is run by a communist Indian,
who feels that the game should
be run as a front for center of
left and right politics.
Cricket, however, is just damn
good fun. Chaps get together to
have a jolly afternoon. The sun
pours down, maybe you don't
touch the pill all day. Still, sun
worshippers like myself eat it
up. The game of cricket is basic
ally unvulgarized baseball.
Cricket was brought to Califor
nia by the celebrated Donner
Party.
The Donner Party's starvation
and eating of themselves caused
the transformation into base
ball, and incidentally Califor
niati politics, according to Cali
fornian democrats.
Life in England is slow, mild
and pleasant, the opposite of
life on a pro football, or of
death on a baseball field. On a
cricket pitch you saunter around
knocking up a half century or
trying to bowl out your oppon
ents.
The wiaket-keeper crouches
behind the stumps, and tells the
skipper if the ball is swinging

in or out. At The Daily, the ball
is definitely swinging IN. The
Stanford cricket side, though it
is composed of neo-colonials and
tradesmen, is nevertheless good
for a laugh.
That laugh has led to a two
years running victory in the
North California cricket league.
This season we have already
chewed up a couple of sides,
and I think next Sunday we'll
follow a Stanford tradition and
do the same.
