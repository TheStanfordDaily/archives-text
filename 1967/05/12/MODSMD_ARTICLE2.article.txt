# Brewster: Greater Government Support Needed For Education
## 
### WYNNE FURTH 
The federal government should
make it possible for any college stu
dent to pay for his education by bor
rowing against his future earnings.
Yale President Kingman Brewster
suggested yesterday, that this would
be the "most efficient and economical
way for government to give needed
support to higher education," without
jeopardizing the "fact and sense of
intellectual self-determination which
is the essence of the acadcmic proc
ess."
In the third and final Harry Camp
Memorial lecture on "The Academic
Process: The Individual, the Institu
tion, and the State," Brewster stressed
the need for government support for

higher education and the inadequacies
of present forms of government sub
sidy.
Focus On Projects
"Federal education programs have
been target-oriented, focused on proj
ects . . . faculty support has been
in the form of research grants and
contracts." However, government
agencies have come to see that "at
the highest level of academic work,
it is the self-determined quest, not
the preordained result, which is worth
supporting."
After experience with agencies
such as the National Science Foun
dation and the National Institutes of
Health, and "despite some misadven
tures by the Department of the Army
and the exuberance for telling people
what to do by the space agency," fears
of control and dictation have diminish
ed. Much of the objectionable harass
ment is simply red tape.
However, Brewster continued, more
fundamental damage is wrought by
federal research support through the
contribution it makes to the personal
income of scientists and the general
resources of the university.
Corruption
"It might be taken amiss if this
were called academic corruption,
since no sinister individual motiva
tion is involved. But dependence . . .
is corrupting, indeed, of that indivi
dual and institutional 'inner directed
ness' which is the essence of the uni
versity's quality and purpose.
"These practices have become so
locked into the pattern of govern
ment-university relationships that
they are a backhanded form of gen
eral educational support which no in
stitution can afford to forego. The
only thing which would be worse for
the country would be if this channel
of support were to dry up."
Brewster discussed briefly the Bri
tish system of extensive endowment
of universities, which has long seemed

ideal but has weaknesses that would
be exaggerated in the United States.
"The political urge to give a public
auditor the power to inspect . . .
the universities becomes irresistible
in the course of time."
Equilibrium Upset
"And "even in the most minimal
inquiry . . . there is no way to in
vestigate academic expenditure with
out inquiring into its academic value."
There is also the probability that the
equilibrium between faculty and ad
ministration will be upset, with more
power going to the admistration.
He concluded that "this rather
dismal recitation of American experi
ence with the project research ap
proach as an indirect technique and
dismal forebodings about the 'bloc
grant' approach leads immediately to
the subsidy of the student as an alter
native approach."
Broad Program
Brewster suggested a very broad
program of loans handled like those
of the G.I. bill, which allowed veter
ans to attend any school and take
any courses that they desired. In
Brewster's plan, however, repayment
would be in the form of a percentage
of the student's annual earnings
throughout his career.
"It would not impose a hardship
on those receiving assistance which
was disproportionate to personal bene
fits ... it would not be resorted to
except by those who needed it, be
cause of the increased tax liability...
it would not cost more over the span
of a generation than the society re
ceived in return for its investment."
With this sort of financing avail
able, universities could charge tui
tions much closer to actual costs than
at present. Brewster suggested that
an income tax surcharge of one per
cent per $3000 borrowed would make
the program self-liquidating over a
generation.
