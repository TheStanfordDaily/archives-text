# Cards Clutch AAWU Lead
## Batters Up...In Washington 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Ranked number one national
ly, the Stanford baseball team
will pack up their prestige and
their Pac-8 title hopes and go
north this weekend.
The Indians will face a tough
Washington State squad in a
doubleheader today and a medi
ocre Washington team in Sat
urday's twin bill.
Tuesday, the Tribe massacred
San Francisco State, 17-8. Hope
fully, the batting success will
carry over to the games this
weekend.
Vance, Poteete Fire
Sandy Vance and Rod Poteete
will be the pitchers against
WSU. Vance's sore arm should
be better but if it isn't Don
Rose will be ready to take over.
Poteete who has been unscored
upon hi nine innings of league
play has emerged as a real hero
on the found in the last few
weeks.
Senior Daro Quiring will
throw against Washington and
probably Pete Hamm. Hamm
looked good throwing four
scoreless innings against San
Francisco State, Tuesday.

Catcher Mike Schomaker has
been the steadiest of the Tribe's
sluggers and has moved up to
.379 in league. Jeff Rohlfing is
the only other starter on the
team hitting over .300 in lea
gue. He is batting .333.
Cougars No Pushover
WSU will be no pushover for
Stanford. Earlier in the season,
they beat USC, 2-1, and barely
lost to the Trojans, 3-2.
USC and UCLA will also be
in the north, at Oregon and
Oregon State. Oregon is cur
rently in second place in lea
gue, but after meeting the Tro
jans and the Bruins they will
have at least three more losses
if not four.
Next weekend Stanford plays
Cal twice and USC plays UCLA
twice. The Trojans will most
likely win all the rest of their
games and end up with a 13-2-1
record.
If Stanford loses one of their
remaining games they will end
up 11-2-1, and USC will go to
the Collegiate World Series in
Omaha. If Stanford is victorious
in the rest of the games, their
record will be 12-1-1 and good
enough for a ticket to Omaha.
