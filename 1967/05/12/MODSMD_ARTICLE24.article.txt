## 
### JOHN HOTSON 
The Stanford crew takes on
the California Bears Saturday in
the Indians last race before the
Western Sprints.
At the sprints all the west
coast crews will meet to determ
ine who is the best and who will
compete against the eastern
crews in June.
Presently both California and
Stanford have a 6-2 win-loss rec
ord with both teams falling to
UCLA and the University of
Washington.
Against the Huskies, however,

the Indians could not send a
complete first boat due to the
Medical Admissions test being
held at the same time.
The Bears have the largest
crew on the coast averaging
6'4W in height and 197 pounds.
In comparison Stanford is much
smaller averaging about 6'2"
and 185 pounds.
Important Preview
Concerning this weekend
Coach Will Condon stated, "The
Cal race is quite important to
us as a preview to the sprints."
"We hope to have improved
enough to be able to beat UCLA
and Washington,"he added.
Both teams beat Stanford by
two lengths.
In an attempt to pick up these
two lengths and more, Condon
is stressing long, hard rowing
at a low stroke in comparison
to only short sprints.
