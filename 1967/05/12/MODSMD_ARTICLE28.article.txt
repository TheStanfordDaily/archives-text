# The 						Real Issue
## 
### 
The fate of what began as the ASSU Hous
ing Commission's Wilbur Experiment and is
now known as SES's Demonstration Houses
will be decided by the Board of Trustees at
their meeting next week. It has become a well
known fact that the Board does not share the
faculty's and the students' enthusiasm for this
innovation and that its approval may well be
stymied by their failure to understand fully
the educational benefits of integrated, coedu
cational housing with an academic theme.
In drawing up a proposal for the trustees,
President Sterling faces a dilemma. On one
hand, he must consider the pressures within
the University in favor of the Demonstration
Houses and on the other he must take account
of the political reality inherent in the trustees'
reservations. He therefore cannot base his judg
ment only on his own evaluation of the Wilbur
Experiment or on that of those who have
studied the question thoroughly; he also must
be tactful vis-a-vis the trustees.
Many outside the University, including the
Board, are worried that students have lost all
respect for law and order, as evidenced by their
blatant failure to observe social regulations.
They point to this as a demonstration of the
immaturity of students and suggest that per
haps they do not "deserve" to have integrated,
coeducational housing in Wilbur and Stern
next year.
But it is not a question of students "deserv
ing" anything. The purpose of the Demonstra
tion Houses is to take substantial steps toward
improving the sorry state of the University's

residences and at the same time elevate Stan
ford's educational condition. The implementa
tion of a housing experiment next year should
not be viewed as a concession to students 1 or
anyone else, but rather as one of the best op
portunities to bring Stanford closer to the ideal
of the residence university.
The connection between the lack of en
forcement of social regulations and the possible
implementation of Demonstration Houses is not
what some would have us believe. To suggest
that lawlessness will become more rampant in
integrated, coeducational dormitories is ab
surd. On the contrary, the establishment of
decent housing options on this campus may
well be the beginning of a reversal in the stu
dent attitude which some find so disturbing.
The present lawlessness is very much a func
tion of the form which housing presently takes
and it is not unlikely that the residential en
vironment provided by integrated, coeduca
tional housing will provide what some would
call a more mature attitude toward social reg
ulations.
If lawlessness really is the central issue, we
hope President Sterling will point out to the
trustees that this problem may be solved in
the Demonstration Houses. But we prefer if
he would insist that education is the real issue
and that Stanford cannot afford to pass up
such an opportunity.
The President must make a bold recommen
dation despite the reservations of the trustees.
We hope the Board will trust him if he does,
for nothing should stand in the way of the
Demonstration Houses.

innovation and that its approval may well be
stymied by their failure to understand fully
the educational benefits of integrated, coedu
cational housing with an academic theme.
In drawing up a proposal for the trustees,
President Sterling faces a dilemma. On one
hand, he must consider the pressures within
the University in favor of the Demonstration
Houses and on the other he must take account
of the political reality inherent in the trustees'
reservations. He therefore cannot base his judg
ment only on his own evaluation of the Wilbur
Experiment or on that of those who have
studied the question thoroughly; he also must
be tactful vis-a-vis the trustees.
Many outside the University, including the
Board, are worried that students have lost all
respect for law and order, as evidenced by their
blatant failure to observe social regulations.
They point to this as a demonstration of the
immaturity of students and suggest that per
haps they do not "deserve" to have integrated,
coeducational housing in Wilbur and Stern
next year.
But it is not a question of students "deserv
ing" anything. The purpose of the Demonstra
tion Houses is to take substantial steps toward
improving the sorry state of the University's

residences and at the same time elevate Stan
ford's educational condition. The implementa
tion of a housing experiment next year should
not be viewed as a concession to students 1 or
anyone else, but rather as one of the best op
portunities to bring Stanford closer to the ideal
of the residence university.
The connection between the lack of en
forcement of social regulations and the possible
implementation of Demonstration Houses is not
what some would have us believe. To suggest
that lawlessness will become more rampant in
integrated, coeducational dormitories is ab
surd. On the contrary, the establishment of
decent housing options on this campus may
well be the beginning of a reversal in the stu
dent attitude which some find so disturbing.
The present lawlessness is very much a func
tion of the form which housing presently takes
and it is not unlikely that the residential en
vironment provided by integrated, coeduca
tional housing will provide what some would
call a more mature attitude toward social reg
ulations.
If lawlessness really is the central issue, we
hope President Sterling will point out to the
trustees that this problem may be solved in
the Demonstration Houses. But we prefer if
he would insist that education is the real issue
and that Stanford cannot afford to pass up
such an opportunity.
The President must make a bold recommen
dation despite the reservations of the trustees.
We hope the Board will trust him if he does,
for nothing should stand in the way of the
Demonstration Houses.
The fate of what began as the ASSU Hous
ing Commission's Wilbur Experiment and is
now known as SES's Demonstration Houses
will be decided by the Board of Trustees at
their meeting next week. It has become a well
known fact that the Board does not share the
faculty's and the students' enthusiasm for this
innovation and that its approval may well be
stymied by their failure to understand fully
the educational benefits of integrated, coedu
cational housing with an academic theme.
