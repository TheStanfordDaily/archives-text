# Two Minutes of Haight
## Beware The Enemy: Go Underground 
### Tim Haight 
"A bit of free advice. Well tell
it to you now.
If you've got some habit, some
people won't allow.
Be cool. Be clean, if you know
what I mean."
—The Mamas and the Papas
Chiggers, gang. De jig is up.
Too many of you have been
telling Mommy, Daddy, alumni,
and the Trustees that nobody
is really paying any attention to
social regulations.
Now we're in trouble. The
Trustees will probably feel that
they have to institute some new
provisions for enforcement of
the regs before they permit
things like, say, the new co-ed
Demonstration Houses to be
established.
We've been telling you to
never trust anybody over thirty.
, They do not understand that we
can get along without the rules.
Honest. They are all very up

tight and making some nice ad
ministrators sweat like horses
after the Derby.
Why did you blow your cool?
Couldn't you have just kept the
bit to yourselves? Why did peo
ple among you like Bob Stone
have to write articles about all
the girls living off campus? The
next thing we know, you'll all
be bringing your stashes to
class, or dropping acid in Mem
Chu.
Learn To Lie
To get along smoothly in the
Search for Truth, you've got to
learn how to lie. Accept it. This
University is built upon the
money that people of another
generation give. Responsible ac
tion is to realize that and go
underground. That way, we get
what we want at the very small
cost of remembering that non
students, sponsors, RA's, tutors,
Dorm Directors, or "proctors"

(you'll hear that term again),
are The Enemy.
Being honest doesn't work.
Unless, of course, you honestly
accept the value of social regu
lations, honestly obey them, and
honestly turn in anybody whom
you see disobeying. But that is
not expected of us. The Admini
stration has given up really try
ing to justify social regs; now
they want only our compliance.
This may sound a bit strong.
But consider the fate of the
long, reasoned, negotiations that
led to the Committee of Fifteen
recommendation on Open House
hours, which has been approved
by LASSU and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council, but which has sat in
President Sterling's office for,
10, these four months.
Against the reasoning in that
report, and in the as yet still
private report of the Committee

of Student Affairs and Services
which was completed last June,
the Administration has offered
nothing. Many individuals in the
Administration have privately
questioned the value of social
regs, as well.
Make A Deal
But they have not acted, be
cause they realize the monetary
and Trustee-political conse
quences. So they are now ask
ing us to make a deal—accept
enforcement and obey the regs,
and they'll permit some living
group experimentation.
So let's do it. Let's realize that
all that discussion was futile.
Let's go underground and never,
never, never come back. Rus
sian students do it well enough.
They have a term for it—to be
a "radish", red on the outside
but white on the inside. Let's
forget about molding the Uni
versity into a consistent insti-

tution. Accept that while most
of it is the Groves of Academe,
a little of it is Stalag 17.
Yes, Virginia, there is a gen
eration gap. Accept it as part
of your identity. To continue
negotiations with these people
who at base are interested in
the financial success of the insti
tution more than in changing
American consciousness is a
necessity, but remember that
you're different. You don't need
a weatherman to tell which way
the wind blows. When they can't
win an argument on its merits,
they make deals. Quid pro quo.
The marketplace of morality.
Or, in the words of the afore
mentioned prophets—
"We've all got our ups; we've
all got our downs.
Some of us are careless, and
we've been lying round.
Be neat, discreet, and keep
your ear to the ground."
"A bit of free advice. Well tell
it to you now.
If you've got some habit, some
people won't allow.
Be cool. Be clean, if you know
what I mean."

generation give. Responsible ac
tion is to realize that and go
underground. That way, we get
what we want at the very small
cost of remembering that non
students, sponsors, RA's, tutors,
Dorm Directors, or "proctors"

(you'll hear that term again),
are The Enemy.
Being honest doesn't work.
Unless, of course, you honestly
accept the value of social regu
lations, honestly obey them, and
honestly turn in anybody whom
you see disobeying. But that is
not expected of us. The Admini
stration has given up really try
ing to justify social regs; now
they want only our compliance.
This may sound a bit strong.
But consider the fate of the
long, reasoned, negotiations that
led to the Committee of Fifteen
recommendation on Open House
hours, which has been approved
by LASSU and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council, but which has sat in
President Sterling's office for,
10, these four months.
Against the reasoning in that
report, and in the as yet still
private report of the Committee

of Student Affairs and Services
which was completed last June,
the Administration has offered
nothing. Many individuals in the
Administration have privately
questioned the value of social
regs, as well.
Make A Deal
But they have not acted, be
cause they realize the monetary
and Trustee-political conse
quences. So they are now ask
ing us to make a deal—accept
enforcement and obey the regs,
and they'll permit some living
group experimentation.
So let's do it. Let's realize that
all that discussion was futile.
Let's go underground and never,
never, never come back. Rus
sian students do it well enough.
They have a term for it—to be
a "radish", red on the outside
but white on the inside. Let's
forget about molding the Uni
versity into a consistent insti-

tution. Accept that while most
of it is the Groves of Academe,
a little of it is Stalag 17.
Yes, Virginia, there is a gen
eration gap. Accept it as part
of your identity. To continue
negotiations with these people
who at base are interested in
the financial success of the insti
tution more than in changing
American consciousness is a
necessity, but remember that
you're different. You don't need
a weatherman to tell which way
the wind blows. When they can't
win an argument on its merits,
they make deals. Quid pro quo.
The marketplace of morality.
Or, in the words of the afore
mentioned prophets—
"We've all got our ups; we've
all got our downs.
Some of us are careless, and
we've been lying round.
Be neat, discreet, and keep
your ear to the ground."
"A bit of free advice. Well tell
it to you now.
If you've got some habit, some
people won't allow.
Be cool. Be clean, if you know
what I mean."
—The Mamas and the Papas
Chiggers, gang. De jig is up.
Too many of you have been
telling Mommy, Daddy, alumni,
and the Trustees that nobody
is really paying any attention to
social regulations.
Now we're in trouble. The
Trustees will probably feel that
they have to institute some new
provisions for enforcement of
the regs before they permit
things like, say, the new co-ed
Demonstration Houses to be
established.
We've been telling you to
never trust anybody over thirty.
, They do not understand that we
can get along without the rules.
Honest. They are all very up

tight and making some nice ad
ministrators sweat like horses
after the Derby.
Why did you blow your cool?
Couldn't you have just kept the
bit to yourselves? Why did peo
ple among you like Bob Stone
have to write articles about all
the girls living off campus? The
next thing we know, you'll all
be bringing your stashes to
class, or dropping acid in Mem
Chu.

To get along smoothly in the
Search for Truth, you've got to
learn how to lie. Accept it. This
