## What Has Grove Proved? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday the Stanford daily
magazine asked "What has the
Grove House proved?" The an
swer to this question is—essen
tially nothing. It is called an
experiment, but in fact it is not
an experiment at all, because
it cannot be reproduced on a
large scale as many people have
frequently assumed.
There are several reasons for
this. First, its members come
from a liberal and intellectual
minority. Secondly, its faculty
resident and associate programs
could never work on a large
scale there just aren't enough
interested faculty members. Ac
cording to the report there are
problems of participation even
with this single hand-picked
group of faculty members.
Third, I am told, although I
cannot back this up, that some
subsidy has been necessary to
keep up higher standards (wine
at meals, less paying residents)
at the same cost. Such subsidy
would be impossible in an at
tempt to reproduce the Grove
project on a large scale.
Finally, and most important,
the Grove house members are
constantly aware that they are
being watched. Any respectable
social scientist can tell you that
it is impossible to run a good
experiment if the participants
know they are being observed
and evaluated.
What then has the Grove
House project proved? It has
proved that if you take a hand
picked group of students, lavish
on them practically all of the
faculty's potential for participa
tion in student affairs, subsidize
them financially, and make them
aware that their every move
is being carefully watched, you
can almost make this form of
living work, except that people
still don't do their housework.

• Naive Analysis
Editor, The Daily:
After every election comes
a period of interpretation. And,
in form, the ranking referen
dum brought the analysis that
the 59.4% against ranking did
not clearly indicate that stu
dents don't like the present sys
tem, and that the reason that
the victory was so "slight" was
the wording on the ballot. This
view is dangerously naive.
Similar votes at other schools
have resulted in fifty-fifty splits.
One must realize that every
where there is a residual body
of students who, for "selfish"
reasons, want to be ranked. To
say that those Who voted no did
so because they misunderstood

the question does them a great
service.
Most of - the people that I
talked to who voted no did so
although they felt that ranking
was unfair. They did not want
to risk losing their 11-S defer
ments. Considering the conse
quences of what they felt a yes
victory would bring, this is not
surprising. What is surprising,
though, is that under our pres
ent prevailing value systems,
more did not put self above jus
tice.
Considering the above, the low
turnout of graduate and off-cam
pus students, and denial of fe
male suffrage, the sixty-forty
split is significant. I only hope
that the hasty interpretation, of
fered from a vacuum has not
damaged the future of the fight
against ranking at Stanford.

Editor, The Daily:
In answer to L. Mill's letter
(May 10) about a good place
for a grad student to eat on

him and anyone else in his pre

are not very well known at

• Dastardly!
Editor, The Daily:
The time has come to take
positive action to correct the
unconscionable bias shown by
the editorial staff of The Daily.
It is evident that so small a
group should never have been
allowed to wield so much power
over the minds of so many.
The Daily played an especially
dastardly role in the recent
campaign for ASSU President;
indeed, they continued to prej
udice the issues even after the
election was over.
No, these crimes against ob
jectivity can no longer be toler
ated. We, the duly selected stu
dents of Stanford University,
must wrest the power of the
press from the hands of a self
seeking "in-group" and restore
responsible journalism to Stan
ford, in the best American tra
dition.
The only equitable way to in
sure fair coverage of the news
is to form a special judiciary
board with the sole responsiblity
of seeing that news coverage is
unslanted in any direction be
sides that of purity. This board
would meet every night at about
about 10:30 to ratify the day's
crop of news.
Perhaps a more practical way

to run The Daily would be to
incorporate the whole paper in
to the biweekly magazine. All
of these proposals can be im
plemented this quarter, if
enough people are truly and
sincerely dedicated to the ideal
of an honest newspaper on the
Farm. We must act now, before
the insidious "In-Crowd" domi
nates the entire University.
Stanford, the truth is within
your grasp.

• Fourth Hand
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday's Daily Forum on
grading came up with some
fine suggestions, but none of
them really go far enough.
Since grading, "a kind of short
hand," is useful, why not apply
it to every effort of "compar
ing and sorting human achieve
ments?" (These quotations were
generously donated by Richard
W. Lyman). If we students were
to begin grading faculty and
administrators, we might even
find some of them getting com
mendable G.P.A.'s. But woe unto
them who flunk out!

Editor, The Daily:
I find it unfortunate that, in
her article on the "Toward Dis
engagement" meeting Wednes
day, Sue Donnelly saw fit to
pass on a rumor which I did
not volunteer and have at fourth
hand. Whether Robert Kennedy
is encouraging "Viet Summer,"
and to what extent financially,
is speculation.

it cannot be reproduced on a
large scale as many people have
frequently assumed.
There are several reasons for
this. First, its members come
from a liberal and intellectual
minority. Secondly, its faculty
resident and associate programs
could never work on a large
scale there just aren't enough
interested faculty members. Ac
cording to the report there are
problems of participation even
with this single hand-picked
group of faculty members.
Third, I am told, although I
cannot back this up, that some
subsidy has been necessary to
keep up higher standards (wine
at meals, less paying residents)
at the same cost. Such subsidy
would be impossible in an at
tempt to reproduce the Grove
project on a large scale.
Finally, and most important,
the Grove house members are
constantly aware that they are
being watched. Any respectable
social scientist can tell you that
it is impossible to run a good
experiment if the participants
know they are being observed
and evaluated.
What then has the Grove
House project proved? It has
proved that if you take a hand
picked group of students, lavish
on them practically all of the
faculty's potential for participa
tion in student affairs, subsidize
them financially, and make them
aware that their every move
is being carefully watched, you
can almost make this form of
living work, except that people
still don't do their housework.

• Naive Analysis
Editor, The Daily:
After every election comes
a period of interpretation. And,
in form, the ranking referen
dum brought the analysis that
the 59.4% against ranking did
not clearly indicate that stu
dents don't like the present sys
tem, and that the reason that
the victory was so "slight" was
the wording on the ballot. This
view is dangerously naive.
Similar votes at other schools
have resulted in fifty-fifty splits.
One must realize that every
where there is a residual body
of students who, for "selfish"
reasons, want to be ranked. To
say that those Who voted no did
so because they misunderstood

the question does them a great
service.
Most of - the people that I
talked to who voted no did so
although they felt that ranking
was unfair. They did not want
to risk losing their 11-S defer
ments. Considering the conse
quences of what they felt a yes
victory would bring, this is not
surprising. What is surprising,
though, is that under our pres
ent prevailing value systems,
more did not put self above jus
tice.
Considering the above, the low
turnout of graduate and off-cam
pus students, and denial of fe
male suffrage, the sixty-forty
split is significant. I only hope
that the hasty interpretation, of
fered from a vacuum has not
damaged the future of the fight
against ranking at Stanford.

scale there just aren't enough
interested faculty members. Ac
cording to the report there are
problems of participation even
with this single hand-picked
group of faculty members.
Third, I am told, although I
cannot back this up, that some
subsidy has been necessary to
keep up higher standards (wine
at meals, less paying residents)
at the same cost. Such subsidy
would be impossible in an at
tempt to reproduce the Grove
project on a large scale.
Finally, and most important,
the Grove house members are
constantly aware that they are
being watched. Any respectable
social scientist can tell you that
it is impossible to run a good
experiment if the participants
know they are being observed
and evaluated.
What then has the Grove
House project proved? It has
proved that if you take a hand
picked group of students, lavish
on them practically all of the
faculty's potential for participa
tion in student affairs, subsidize
them financially, and make them
aware that their every move
is being carefully watched, you
can almost make this form of
living work, except that people
still don't do their housework.

• Naive Analysis
Editor, The Daily:
After every election comes
a period of interpretation. And,
in form, the ranking referen
dum brought the analysis that
the 59.4% against ranking did
not clearly indicate that stu
dents don't like the present sys
tem, and that the reason that
the victory was so "slight" was
the wording on the ballot. This
view is dangerously naive.
Similar votes at other schools
have resulted in fifty-fifty splits.
One must realize that every
where there is a residual body
of students who, for "selfish"
reasons, want to be ranked. To
say that those Who voted no did
so because they misunderstood

the question does them a great
service.
Most of - the people that I
talked to who voted no did so
although they felt that ranking
was unfair. They did not want
to risk losing their 11-S defer
ments. Considering the conse
quences of what they felt a yes
victory would bring, this is not
surprising. What is surprising,
though, is that under our pres
ent prevailing value systems,
more did not put self above jus
tice.
Considering the above, the low
turnout of graduate and off-cam
pus students, and denial of fe
male suffrage, the sixty-forty
split is significant. I only hope
that the hasty interpretation, of
fered from a vacuum has not
damaged the future of the fight
against ranking at Stanford.

• Dastardly!
Editor, The Daily:
The time has come to take
positive action to correct the
unconscionable bias shown by
the editorial staff of The Daily.
It is evident that so small a
group should never have been
allowed to wield so much power
over the minds of so many.
The Daily played an especially
dastardly role in the recent
campaign for ASSU President;
indeed, they continued to prej
udice the issues even after the
election was over.
No, these crimes against ob
jectivity can no longer be toler
ated. We, the duly selected stu
dents of Stanford University,
must wrest the power of the
press from the hands of a self
seeking "in-group" and restore
responsible journalism to Stan
ford, in the best American tra
dition.
The only equitable way to in
sure fair coverage of the news
is to form a special judiciary
board with the sole responsiblity
of seeing that news coverage is
unslanted in any direction be
sides that of purity. This board
would meet every night at about
about 10:30 to ratify the day's
crop of news.
Perhaps a more practical way

to run The Daily would be to
incorporate the whole paper in
to the biweekly magazine. All
of these proposals can be im
plemented this quarter, if
enough people are truly and
sincerely dedicated to the ideal
of an honest newspaper on the

• Fourth Hand
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday's Daily Forum on
grading came up with some
fine suggestions, but none of
them really go far enough.
Since grading, "a kind of short
hand," is useful, why not apply
it to every effort of "compar
ing and sorting human achieve
ments?" (These quotations were
generously donated by Richard
W. Lyman). If we students were
to begin grading faculty and
administrators, we might even
find some of them getting com
mendable G.P.A.'s. But woe unto
them who flunk out!

• Not Far Enough
Editor, The Daily:
I find it unfortunate that, in
her article on the "Toward Dis
engagement" meeting Wednes
day, Sue Donnelly saw fit to
pass on a rumor which I did
not volunteer and have at fourth
hand. Whether Robert Kennedy
is encouraging "Viet Summer,"
and to what extent financially,
is speculation.
DAVID RANSOM
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday the Stanford daily
magazine asked "What has the
Grove House proved?" The an
swer to this question is—essen
tially nothing. It is called an
experiment, but in fact it is not
an experiment at all, because
it cannot be reproduced on a
large scale as many people have
frequently assumed.
There are several reasons for
this. First, its members come
from a liberal and intellectual
minority. Secondly, its faculty
resident and associate programs
could never work on a large
scale there just aren't enough
interested faculty members. Ac
cording to the report there are
