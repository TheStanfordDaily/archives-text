# Flower Festival
## Tribe Gathering Planned For Mother's Day 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
Sunday, May 14, is the day set for
the gathering of the tribes. The
Flower Festival, an event modeled
after the San Francisco Be-In, will be
held from 2 to 8 p.m. in El Camino
Park across from the Stanford Shop
ping Center.
Sponsors of the event will be the
Free University of Palo Alto and the
Experiment. Graham Lewis, a re
searcher at Syntex, and Bruce Fergu
son, a medical student, are its organ
izers.
Ferguson was impressed by the
success of the San Francisco commun
ity gathering and with smaller priv
ate gatherings at places like Muir

Beach, but he felt that the large at
tendance at the San Francisco Be-In
inhibited communication among the
participants. He believes that a small
er meeting will more effectively pro
mote communication among rnid
peninsulans on a "tribal level."
Apolitical Event
The Free University of Palo Alto
had originally planned to sponsor this
event, but political conflicts within
the F.U.P.A. necessitated its postpone
ment. Ferguson failed to gain the sup
port of some of the members of
F.U.P.A. who balked at his proposal
to make the gathering apolitical. As a
result, Ferguson and Lewis assumed
the responsibility of planning the

Flower Festival with the Free Uni
versity and the Experiment providing
the necessary funds.
"Those who come to the Flower
Festival are urged to bring something
to share," said Ferguson. He stressed
that the purpose of the gathering is
to promote inter-personal communica
tion. People are especially urged to
bring flowers and their parents, since
Sunday is Mother's Day.
Communication Needed
Ferguson feels that greater com
munication between children and their
parents is a dire need in today's
troubled times. Like the Be-in, the
Flower Festival should hr!n !o give
parents an understanding and appreci

ation of what wonders are being pro
liferated by the "free-love, hippie"
generation.
While people are busy communicat
ing with one another, entertainment
will be provided by several local
bands and various groups involved in
sensory awareness. One of the fea
tured groups will be The Anonymous
Artists of America, a band made up
mostly of ex-Stanford students. The
Primal Horde and the Good Word will
also play. Also appearing will be
Jewish folksinger and story-teller
Shlomo Carlebach, who appeared rec
ently before a capacity crowd at Tre
sidder, and several area poets, who
will read their own works.
