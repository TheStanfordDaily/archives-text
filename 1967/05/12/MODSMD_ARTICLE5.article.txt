# Faculty-Staff Letters On Vietnam Barred From Inter-Office Mailing
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
The Interdepartmental Mail Office
has refused to deliver copies of a let
ter written by six members of the
faculty and staff to the members of
the Stanford Faculty and Staff
Against the War in Vietnam.
Frederic Glover, executive assistant
to President Sterling, said that al
though he had no knowledge of the
letter, University mails are to be
used for University business. "They
are not open to propaganda causes,"
Glover stated yesterday.
The 300 letters were submitted
Tuesday in unsealed envelopes print
ed with "Stop the war in Vietnam"
on the outside. They contained a re
quest for pledges of participation in
mass civil disobedience to protest the
war. The beginning of the pledge
states:
"Because we believe that the last
chances to stop the war in Vietnam
are rapidly slipping away, and be

cause we believe that primary re
sponsibility for stopping the war lies
with the American people, we, the
undersigned members of the Stan
ford faculty and staff, declare our
willingness to participate in acts of
mass civil disobedience."
Delivery Concern
Jay Neugeboren of the English de
partment, who helped to draft the
letters, said that he became concerned
when they were not delivered after
two days. He contacted Dennis Spell
mire, chief mail clerk, and asked if
the letters had been sent. Spellmire
replied that he didn't know, but would
find out.
Neugeboren explained, "When I
called back he said that they hadn't
been sent. I asked if he could give me
a reason, and he said, 'No.' He finally
said that he had received orders from
Mr. Glover's office. He said that Glov
er didn't give any reason."
However, Glover said he had not
been in his office for the last two
days.
No Special Devision
Spellmire told The Daily that he
had no comment about the letters.
"There was no special decision on that
specific mailing," he said. "The mails
are not to be used by student groups
for social problems." When asked if

there was a specific policy prevent
ing faculty or staff from using the
interdepartmental mail for such pur
poses, Spellmire said he had never
seen a policy book.
Neugeboren said that he had check
ed University Guide to Administra
tive Organization, Policies and Pro
cedures, and there was no statement
about the kind of materials which
could be sent through interdepart
mental mail. He added that Profes
sor Charles Stein had left his name
and phone number when he sub
mitted the letters and had not been
notified that they could not be de
livered.
Questions Ruling
"It's common knowledge that every
thing gets sent through interdepart
mental mail," Neugeboren said. "If
there is a ruling, why weren't we told
and why isn't it written down? I
can't understand why they wouldn't
have sent the letters unless they had
opened them and found something
objectionable."
Professor Stein related that when
he attempted to post a second mail
ing he was informed that the letters
were unacceptable because of ruling
from the President's office.
"I was informed that it was a gen

eral policy, however I was not told
this the first time. The man I spoke
with said that someone in the Presi
dent's office had made the decision for
organizations that are at all contro
versial," Stein explained. "My impres
sion is that the policy is not used
consistently, and it is an unreason
able policy—if it is a policy," he said.
Early Signers
The letters were finally distributed
by Neugeboren and others. He said
that 20 signed pledges had already
been obtained and more were ex
pected. He stated that additional in
formation about the passive resis
tance movement and its supporters
would be released early next week.
The pledge concludes:
"We are fully aware of the risks
such actions involve, and we know
the price many of us may have to
pay. But we believe that unless some
of us are prepared to take such risks
and to pay such a price, we have no
chance whatsoever of actually af
fecting the course of U.S. actions.
We are ready to pay this price, and
we call upon other Americans who
feel as we do — members of the
clergy, of the professions, of the aca
demic community — to pledge them
selves to join us in acts of mass civil
disobedience."
