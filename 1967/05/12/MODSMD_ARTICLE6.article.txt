# Senate Debates Draft Proposals; Law May Hold For Four Years
## 
### 
(AP) — The Senate gave over
whelming approval Thursday night
to a four-year extension of the mili
tary draft to provide the manpower
needed for the Vietnam war and
other defense needs.
Efforts to limit the extension to
two years, to move toward a volun
tary system, to cut the service period

or make other major changes in the
Selective Service System were re
jected by wide margins.
The legislation goes now to the
House where leaders expect to com
plete final action well ahead of the
June 30 expiration of major portions
of the present act.
Alterations Possible
Several of President Johnson's pro
posed alterations in the draft system
would be possible under the Senate
measure which would permit - the
draft director to make various
changes at the request of the Presi
dent.
These include induction of 19- and
20-year-olds first instead of the pres
ent system of calling first the older
registrants in the 18-26 age bracket.
A random selection system, or lot
tery, also may supplant the present
system of letting some 4,000 local
draft boards decide which individuals
must serve.
But the Senate, in a unanmious re
port by its Armed Services Commit
tee, question that this will reduce in
equities. And it urged retention of the
authority of the local boards to regi
ster, to classify and to pass upon
hardship cases.
Lack Of Uniformity
There have many complaints about
lack of uniformity in decisions by
these local boards.
An advisory presidential commis
sion recommended that these unpaid
local and state boards be consolidated
and replaced by more central and
regional systems, manned by Civil
Service employees. The Senate recom
mended a continuation of deferments
for college students until they attain
a degree, reach 24 years, or fail to
maintain college standing. They then
would be placed in draft pools along
with the younger men most liable for
induction. It asked also similar treat

ment for industrial apprentices.
Most of the Senate debate centered
on an effort by Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., to put Congress on record in
favor of an all-volunteer military
force to displace the draft system.
This was defeated 65 to 9.
The nation could well afford this,
Hatfield and a few other senators
contended. Hatfield's resolution de
scribed the draft as a "governmental
invasion of the liberties of America's
young men."
Lowering of Morale
Sen. Richard B .Russel, D-Go., chair
man of the Armed Services Commit
tee and floor manager of the bill,
said this would lower the morale of
fighting men in Vietnam, where 43
per cent are draftees. He argued also
that it would be prohibitively expen
sive.
Another Hatfield proposal, to limit
the extension to two instead of four
years, was defeated 67 to 13.
An effort by Sen. Stephen M.
Young, D-Ohio, to reduce the two-year
service of inductees to 18 months was
beaten 74 to 4. Sen. Ernest Gruening,
D-Alaska, sought to ban service to
inductees in the Vietnam area unless
they volunteered. But only Sen.
Wayne Morse, D-Ore., sided with him
while 75 voted no.
Just before the final vote, Morse
offered three amendments. One would
have established national criteria and
provided for their uniform application
by all boards. It lost 68 to 6. Another
would have given deferment to Peace
Corps volunteers and to Volunteers
in Service to America, VISTA, its
domestic counterpart. This was beat
en 65 to 7.
The third would have permitted
men appealing draft classification to
bring an attorney along when appear
ing before a board. This was rejected
55 to 17.

lack of uniformity in decisions by
these local boards.
An advisory presidential commis
sion recommended that these unpaid
local and state boards be consolidated
and replaced by more central and
regional systems, manned by Civil
Service employees. The Senate recom
mended a continuation of deferments
for college students until they attain
a degree, reach 24 years, or fail to
maintain college standing. They then
would be placed in draft pools along
with the younger men most liable for
induction. It asked also similar treat

ment for industrial apprentices.
Most of the Senate debate centered
on an effort by Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., to put Congress on record in
favor of an all-volunteer military
force to displace the draft system.
This was defeated 65 to 9.
The nation could well afford this,
Hatfield and a few other senators
contended. Hatfield's resolution de
scribed the draft as a "governmental
invasion of the liberties of America's
young men."
Lowering of Morale
Sen. Richard B .Russel, D-Go., chair
man of the Armed Services Commit
tee and floor manager of the bill,
said this would lower the morale of
fighting men in Vietnam, where 43
per cent are draftees. He argued also
that it would be prohibitively expen
sive.
Another Hatfield proposal, to limit
the extension to two instead of four
years, was defeated 67 to 13.
An effort by Sen. Stephen M.
Young, D-Ohio, to reduce the two-year
service of inductees to 18 months was
beaten 74 to 4. Sen. Ernest Gruening,
D-Alaska, sought to ban service to
inductees in the Vietnam area unless
they volunteered. But only Sen.
Wayne Morse, D-Ore., sided with him
while 75 voted no.
Just before the final vote, Morse
offered three amendments. One would
have established national criteria and
provided for their uniform application
by all boards. It lost 68 to 6. Another
would have given deferment to Peace
Corps volunteers and to Volunteers
in Service to America, VISTA, its
domestic counterpart. This was beat
en 65 to 7.
The third would have permitted
men appealing draft classification to
bring an attorney along when appear
ing before a board. This was rejected
55 to 17.
(AP) — The Senate gave over
whelming approval Thursday night
to a four-year extension of the mili
tary draft to provide the manpower
needed for the Vietnam war and
other defense needs.
Efforts to limit the extension to
two years, to move toward a volun
tary system, to cut the service period

or make other major changes in the
Selective Service System were re
jected by wide margins.
The legislation goes now to the
House where leaders expect to com
plete final action well ahead of the
June 30 expiration of major portions
of the present act.
Alterations Possible
Several of President Johnson's pro
posed alterations in the draft system
would be possible under the Senate
measure which would permit - the
draft director to make various
changes at the request of the Presi
dent.
These include induction of 19- and
20-year-olds first instead of the pres
ent system of calling first the older
registrants in the 18-26 age bracket.
A random selection system, or lot
tery, also may supplant the present
system of letting some 4,000 local
draft boards decide which individuals
must serve.
But the Senate, in a unanmious re
port by its Armed Services Commit
tee, question that this will reduce in
equities. And it urged retention of the
authority of the local boards to regi
ster, to classify and to pass upon
hardship cases.
