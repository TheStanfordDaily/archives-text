# LASSU Sets Hearings To Consider NSA Status
## 
### 
A motion calling for Stanford's
withdrawal from NSA was referred
to the Student Affairs Committee
last night at LASSU. This committee
will hold open hearings today at 5:15
p.m. at the Grove House to consider
the following issues.
• whether Stanford should with
draw,
• whether the matter ought to be
decided by LASSU or by student ref
erendum, or
• whether Stanford should remain
affiliated, with NSA but cease sending
representatives to the annual sum
mer conference.
Dick Williams, former NSA coor
dinator at Stanford, supported Stan
ford's remaining in the organization.
LASSU Speaker Tom Forstenzer and
ASSU student body President Mike
Collins favored Stanford's discontinu
ing its affiliations with NSA.
Cost to the ASSU for sending rep
resentatives to the conference is
$1200.
A LASSU commission will soon be
formed to recommend standards to
be followed in ASSU elections. These
standards will be set in order to avoid
alleged procedural and Fundamental
Standards violations.
The Elections Committee will make
its report to the Legislature at next
week's meeting.
LASSU Speaker Forstenzer ruled
out of order a resolution calling for

suspension of LASSU appropriations
to The Experiment "until the coordi
nator of The Experiment shall have
provided the Legislature with satis
factory guarantees that no funds
properly belonging to The Experiment
will again be used for political pur
poses."
LASSU representative Craig Ven
ater last night reported on efforts to
establish a Bay Area student discount
organization. According to Venater, a
letter proposing the idea has been
sent to student body presidents at 10
Bay Area colleges. A second letter
will soon be sent describing the struc
ture of discount outlets.
