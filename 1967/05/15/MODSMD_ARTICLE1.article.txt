# The
						Freshman Year: What Can Be Done?

### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
THOUGH it's not recorded in any hospital or city hall, April 15, 1966
was a momentous birthday. With the arrival of the mailman, Stan
Freshman was born.
To be sure, it wasn't any normal birth. The baby, on first sight, was 17 years
old, weighed approximately 200 lbs. and stood well over 6'2". His exact
origins are veiled in secrecy, but it seems he was conceived by a committee
in Palo Alto and signed into being by Rixford K. Snyder.
Evidence supports claims that he led a life before bir'.h under the alias of
Stan Studley, who, with an iron will and a willing wit, ruled his high school
and led his friends. Some claim this is what stimulated the committee in Palo
Alto, but the committee refused to reveal the facts.
After his birth, Stan Freshman was nourished by supplies sent from the
committee in Palo Alto. In June he received some catalogues that promised
him this and promised him that. Stan was excited. Everyone told him he was
going to a great university in a great climate. But Stan was also nervous. He
worried about everything. What would his roommate be like? Would he
snore? Would he drink? Would he smoke? Would he study until 3:00 A.M.?
And what about all the courses? Could he do the math or the French?
Could he write a decent paper and get a decent grade? And what would his
dorm be like? Comfortable? Even a little like home maybe? And all the people
he wouldn't know. How would he remember their names? And girls' names?
Ah, but the last really didn't bother Stan. He would have no problem with
girls. After all, they couldn't resist Stan.
SO THE SUMMER wore on and Stan couldn't keep his mind off Great
University. He was growing too. The committee kept him well fed and
Stan told all his friends going to State University how much they were
going to miss. Finally the great day arrived. Stan bid a sorrowful farewell to
parents, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends. He gave his two
huge trunks to the porter and silently boarded his plane. He was suddenly
overwhelmed with sorrow. "My God," he thought, "I've just left everyone I
love. M
The plane landed at San Francisco Airport and when Stan stepped off he
frantically looked about for the people wearing red stickers or carrying red
flags. The committee had told him there would be students from Great Uni
versity to greet him and take him to Palo Alto. And there were. They loaded
Stan onto a bus and he sat next to a pretty girl. He asked her where she came
from and what her name was. He couldn't hear the former, but there was no
mistaking the latter. She was Dolly Frosh.
Pretty soon Stan could see the great tower at Great University. He pointed
out the tower to Dolly and then the bus driver announced they were at Wilbur
and Branner Halls.
Stan and Dolly looked at the buildings and looked at each other. There
were many students milling about, most with bewildered expressions. Stan
helped Dolly off the bus and just as he was offering to carry her bag, one of
the students at Great University rushed up and said, "Welcome, Dolly. May
I help you?" Dolly was overcome. Stan was scared. "Come with me," the stu
dent said and he walked off with Dolly. Stan shook his head and walked off
toward Wilbur Hall.
"The book had said Wilbur was a great place," thought Stan. He was really
excited now as he entered the front lobby. He felt proud. He was taking care
of himself for the first time. He received a key, a room assignment, informa
tion sheets and a bill. Stan hadn't expected a bill so soon. He almost panicked.
He didn't have any money and his parents wouldn't send any more for a week.
Stan immediately wired home.
WHEN STAN entered his house, he was greeted by a student from
Great University. The student explained he was Stan's sponsor.
Stan was skeptical. The student had a great long beard and Stan's
parents had told him not to spend time with bearded students. But the spon
sor was friendly and showed Stan his room.
Stan was very depressed when he saw his room. There was only a bed, a
desk, a chair, and a closet. It did not look like home. But the sponsor assured
Stan all would be well: all he needed was a curtain and a rug; Stan mumbled
a "yes", and the sponsor left.
Stan quickly unpacked his trunks and waited for his roommate to arrive.
At last the door flew open and in stepped a well dressed, preppie-looking
boy carrying the New York Times. Stan introduced himself and was very sur

prised when the boy said he was also Stan Freshman. "Funny way to choose
roommates," thought Stan.
At 4 o'clock that afternoon, Stan put on a tie and jacket and went off to
something called Convocation in some place called Frost Amphitheater. All
the members of his class were there and Stan was amazed by the huge size.
"There weren't that many students in my whole home town," surmised Stan.
There were many speakers at the Convocation, but Stan was especially in
terested to hear the President of Great University, I. L. Parentis.
Stan returned to Wilbur when the talks ended and ate his first meal. The
food wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. At dinner, he met Hasty Hasher and his
R.A. Stan wondered what "R.A." meant, but he was afraid to show his ignor
ance by asking. After dinner Stan went to a meeting with all the other mem
bers of his house where he learned he could drink in his room but not in the
hall, and could show his room to a girl. Stan was happy. His mother hadn't
let him show his room to a girl at home.
So for a week Stan met people, heard lectures, read catalogues, fixed his
room and began to enjoy himself. He heard a guy named Napier, who they
said was a minister, but he sure didn't preach like the one back home.
The students at Great University kept Stan so busy he didn't have a mo
ment to rest. At Activities Day he saw a dozen things he wanted to do. Stan
became worried again. How could he do everything? And he hadn't opened
a book yet.
AFTER a week Stan saw more and more students at Great University
arriving. In fact, the day came when Stan had to go to class. He bought
all his books and nearly went broke. He went to class and was inter
ested in what was taught. Before he knew it the weeks were shooting by. Time
had never moved so fast, but Stan guessed it was because he had so much to
do. He was disturbed by one thing. He had never seen Dolly again. He had
learned an important thing at the first big dance. There were 850 other Stan
Freshmans and only 400 Dolly Froshes. So Stan found that when a guy met
a girl, he was ready to go steady after a week to make sure he didn't lose her to
everyone else.
Stan went to all the football games and cheered with the crowd. But Great
University had a lousy team, so Stan went to hear the band and see the pom-

pon girls dance. Then there was Big Game with State University and all the
Stan Freshmans went wild. They built a huge fire and stayed up all night. Was
it all worth it? Stan wondered, especially when he nearly drowned in the
rain.
But Stan was learning. His sponsor told him again and again that Great
University wasn't all great. At first Stan had laughed him off as a spiteful
young rebel, but as the time past, Stan saw he had something to say. He met
a lot of other Stan Freshmans and they sat around and talked. Stan began to
think his dorm wasn't so good. Why wasn't there a more intellectual environ
ment? "We just eat in a wink and then go back to our rooms to work," thought
Stan. "Nobody stays around to talk." And what about all those big parties on
the weekends? His friends got drunk and made a mess. "There must be some
thing basically wrong," hie began to think. And so did others around him.
Stan also began to wonder about some of his courses. He couldn't quite
decipher Civ. It was a funny course, anyway, learning about Plato in a day.
And people stopped coming to class and things got pretty dull. Stan listened
to the ASSU President and thought he made sense, even if he did have a
beard.
EXAMS arrived without notice, and Stan worried about how he would
do. Worry turned to fear and Stan and his friends began to do silly
things such as pretending the library was a gym and concert hall all
rolled into one. He never thought he'd get everything in hand, and what
about taking a test for four hours? Stan's hand nearly fell off, his mind was a
wreck and he still had three hours to go. But at least it was only a week and
then he would go home.
There he was back in his own room talking to his own parents. The whole
house seemed smaller than when he had left. He felt there was something
wrong. What had happened to his parents? Why did they seem so strict and
stuffy and lead such dull lives? Stan told them about Great University and
some of the things he had learned. They seemed to get worried and then one
night he saw them looking through a book on teenage problems. Stan knew
it was time to go back to Great University.
The Winter passed as fast as the Fall, and maybe even faster. Stan felt more
confident on his return, got involved in some activities, and discovered how
much they could improve his life. He heard about a house on the hill named
Grove and went there for dinner and liked it very much. One day he accident
ly walked into a building and saw a lot of people with beards. But Stan didn
flinch, he went and sat down. They told him he was in The Experiment and
Stan stayed for a while. They offered some good courses, so he decided to
come back. And they talked about a place in Asia called Vietnam.
Stan's parents said it was a good place and America was doing well, but
Stan read some books and papers and saw the other side. Some speakers came
to Great University, including the Vice-President of the U.S. Stan heard then,
all, and thought the Vice-President seemed pretty vague. Stan thought aboui
the issue and exchanged ideas with friends. Finally one day, with a look of
commitment, he put on a white arm-band and started to sign lists.
SPRING Quarter came and fraternities entered the scene. Stan went to
see them, but they didn't offer the ideals he sought. They seemed like
extensions of Wilbur, but where else could he live? Great University
didn't seem to be proud of Grove and thought it was radical to try setting up
more than two more. The administrators seemed to feel residences were just
there as a place to sleep. Stan thought it was pretty poor not to give him and
his friends more of a choice.
And Stan also saw the other Stan Freshmans splitting apart. There was no
cohesiveness to his class, and the fraternities only made the schism more
acute. Why didn't Great University try to weld a unit? Maybe they thought
they were doing that when they kept the Stan Freshmans apart from the rest.
But Stan thought it backfired and felt even President I. L. Parentis knew it,
but thought there were more important things he wanted to do, such as
building a pavilion or keeping the peace.
Days grew warm and June came around. He took his finals and prepared
to depart. He said good-bye to his friends and realized they would be living
all over the campus come the Fall. Stan packed his bags and started to leave.
But he paused for a minute to look back at Great University. Why should he
come back? He thought for a while but his views weren't too clear, He felt
he sort of liked the place, even with all its faults. And maybe, just maybe, he
could help it improve.
