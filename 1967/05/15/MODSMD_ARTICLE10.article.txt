# Freshman English
## Students Voice Discontent 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
The successes of Freshman
English's experimental Voice
Project have received much pub
licity lately, with the unintended
but inevitable effect of obscur
ing the conditions of the English
programs to which the majority
of freshmen are confined.
Despite the Voice Project's
success, it may not be renewed
for next year; Freshman En
glish, however, will still be with
us. Its centrality in the academic
freshman year calls for a closer
look at its successes and fail
ures.
Freshman English, by the
handbook, is divided into two
parts: regular and Special. Al
though the most common com
plaints against the Freshman
English program concern the in
structors, many students also
question the method of selection
for Special English. The student
must have a 4 or 5 on the Ad
vanced Placement Test or a 750
on the English half of the SAT
to qualify. But, as one student
noted, "There were only three

people in my class who could
have gotten in on SAT scores.
Most had taken special courses
designed to help them pass AP
tests, and many scored in the
low 600's on SAT's." Other stu
dents in regular sections who
did not take AP tests had much
higher SAT scores.
In addition, students who
qualified by the AP scores are
only required to take two quar
ters of English, while those who
qualified on SAT's must take all
three. This, however, sometimes
backfires in that stud: nts may
want to stay on in a class they
enjoy. To remedy this problem,
some classes, such as Professor
Lucio Ruotolo's, allow these stu
dents to stay in the class under
the English 189 independent
study program.
"My Special class was not
nearly so interesting as my reg
ular class," said one student who
had entered a Special section
winter quarter. "Most of them
got high AP scores in every
thing because they'd been train
ed, and were more interested in

physics than in English." A
freshman who has been in three
sections of English gives a com
parison: "My regular section
was really stimulating but my
Special section was sad. The pro
fessor just didn't communicate
with the students. And we only
wrote one two-page and two one
page papers all quarter. The
professor really makes all the
difference."
Other students echo this senti
ment. "My first professor looked
at everything from a psycho
logical point of view and ex
pected us to have a background
in psychology, which most of us
didn't have. I felt he had ideas
to get across to us and didn't
want us to come up with our
own ideas.
"The professor I have now
has a totally different approach.
He's more sensitive in communi
cating a love and a feeling for
literature. We feel we are dis
covering things for ourselves.
The students in the class are
about the same, but now every
one participates."

Many instructors in the reg
ular sections and some in the
Special sections are described
by their students either as nar
row-minded in interpretation or
as unable to communicate with
their students. Some students
also feel they are being treated
like high school students: "A
typical test in our class is to
take a line of Hamlet and tell
what scene it came from, who
said it, to whom, and the circum
stances. We have tests like that
every week, and half the time
the teacher doesn't catch errors
in my papers and tests that I
know are there."
"We never get to discuss our
reading in class," is another
common complaint. "The pro
fessor just lectures to us three
times a week." Another is,
"We have no choice as to what
we read or write. There's no in
dividual freedom."
Some ideas which the fresh
men agree would help the situ
ation are being tried in a few
sections. A student in Professor
Anne Kostelanetz's class ex
plains: "Our class voted on a
reading list for the quarter. Two
of us disagreed, and she let us
design our own curriculum." A
student in Clive Miller's English
4 creative writing section says,
"He has several alternative
plans of work, so the class can
always change."
Another idea some professors
are trying is dividing the class
into small discussion seminars.
One of Professor Verdel Kolve's
students explains that "we can
have real discussions and gain
an understanding of the litera
ture before we write our
papers." Other students suggest
more independent work and stu
dent-led discussions as ways of
improving classes, and point to
the English creative writing
seminars as an example.
Suggestions such as these in
dicate not only the ability of the
freshman class to recognize its
problems but also a willingness
to construct new approaches. In
many ways, the Freshman En
glish program is outstanding:
with the help of the students, it
can be even better.
