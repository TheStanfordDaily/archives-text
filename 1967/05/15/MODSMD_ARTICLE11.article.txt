# Residence Ideology Creates Polarity In Freshman Class
## 
### H. RENTON ROLPH 
Two quarters of Stanford life,
one in Cedro House in Wilbur
and one in the Grove, were
enough for me to see that this
student body is in frightful dis
union. There is discord here,
and I do not mean mere dis
agreement. There is discord so
consuming, so thoroughly en
vironmental that I am em
harassed when people speak of
Stanford, Harvard, and great
ness (be that what it may) in
the same sentence.
Let's face it: the psychology
of every Stanford person,
though graduates escape the
problem to a certain, small de
gree, is circumscribed by what
can be called residence ideology,
and it has saddened me this
spring to watch this force grip
and devour the freshmap class.
'The Split'
During the months of March
and April, I have watched my
class cleave with cruel preci
sion into the two camps of in
dependent and fraternity men.
The great Stanford split came
off so smoothly this year you
might not have seen it unless
you cared to look.
Swish, and along about April,
whenever I saw an old Wilbur
friend, he was either in this or
out of that for one reason or an
other. And there was a curious
feeling of distance and the death
of a growth process that had
started in September. With sor
row, I watched the Class of '70
join the Stanford residence pa
rade.
And I grew sick. Sick over a
residence university that is not.
Sick over a system that pro
claims education, and instead
of leading us out (which is what
the Romans wanted the word
education to mean), leads every
one of us back into solipsistic
life-niches defined by, of all
things, our residences and their
ideological confines.
You remember, do you, that
warm, satisfying womb? Every
thing (I knew you could) looked
the same and nice. No disagree
ments in those days, in those
places, ehh? Straight... through
the umbilicus, it all came, so
wondrous and facile, like being
curled around the keg.
Yes, I have that rancour in
me too. But I weep these words,
wishing they weren't necessary.
But I sense a Stanford drowned
in self-flattery, denoted by that
current, complacent phrase, Har
vard-of-the-West. And, at those

moments in my conversation
when that expression surfaces,
visions of the lowa State Uni
versity residential parade, trans
ferred to somewhere above
Palo Alto, crowd my conscience.
But have we people ourselves
created this all campus animos
ity that forms a fundamental
layer of the Stanford conscious
ness? No, the Stanford residence
system alone has caused this
schism.
Is the basis of the antipathetic
psychology of this community
(if such can exist in this situa
tion) a student disagreement
over the current War, which
Martin Luth King has called
"this country's greatest moral
crisis since 1860"? No, even de
cisions about this dilemma are
made in the shadow of Stanford
residence ideology. Bravest of
all are those who, in their ideo
logical incarceration, have chos
en for the opposite campus
camp, as it were.
Yale More Cohesive
Kingman Brewster, President
of Yale, in his visit here last
week perceived in our student
body the problem of which I
speak. He said, "From what I
can see, Yale is more cohesive
than Stanford."
Possibly one difference is that
Yale's residential colleges of
300 students each do not elimi
nate communication between dis
similar residences, as does the
present Stanford system. Of
course, rivalries exist among the
colleges but, as a friend at Yale
told me, open intercourse is
maintained at all levels: social,
cultural and intellectual. People
are not cut off from each other
by what here amounts to cages
of ideology. Moreover, the Yale
college microcosms themselves
are inclusive enough to offer
students what they need and
want.
Of late we have thankfully
heard hereabouts of the aspira
tions of some to "a real univer
sity." I submit that we might
shift the emphasis from the ad
jective to the noun. I would like
to live in a university on the
Stanford campus. For it is not
one now.
There is a cohesion, a sense
of oneness, a psychological to
getherness deep in the history
of the true or real university.
What has happened to the
wholeness, the universitas, in
this university? Split, I say to
and by residence ideology.
When I speak of oneness, I

do not, of course, intend or want
intellectual harmony in the com
munity. But, I think, central to
the idea of community is the
need for openness and interac
tion, just the chance to com
municate disagreement.
This means the elimination,
or at least the opening, of
cages. Only in a milieu of open
ness, which I sense to be the
first part of the concept "univer
sity," and now the first need of
this one in particular, can
awareness grow, free from po
litical, spirtual, or residential
ideology.
One day during the last win
ter, mysteriously, almost myth
ically, a sign appeared nailed on
a tree near the Quad end of
Lasuen Street. It warned those
beginning their walk up the
Row: You Are Now Leaving
The Academic Sector.
The unintegrated life-style
represented by the sign's mes
sage evinces to this freshman
a sorrowful failure in this uni
versity's approach to residential
education. (Not the University,
but this university, you and me.)
Through this piece there runs
a current of thought concern

ing Harvard and Yale that
might be miscontrued as pro
vincial favoritism. First, if it
matter, I have lived in San
Francisco since birth. I men
tion the Eastern schools only
because I consider their resi
dence system superior to ours.
I now live at Stanford, and
nowhere else, because I want
to (perhaps we should consider
the difference between going to
and living in a school). I do
feel that the other schools,
though they might be antedilu
vian with regard to social and
political consciousness, might
perhaps help us here as we con
sider possible changes in our
residence institutions.
I would like to see, as I am
seeing to a greater degree each
week, Stanford divide and fight
over the issue of war in Viet
nam. I would like to see, as re
cently I thankfully have to a de
gree, the Stanford campus con
sumed in an enflamed debate
over the important draft issue.
But, as a disappointed fresh
man, nearing the end of my year
here, I deplore the polarization
of Stanford along merely resi
dential criteria.

getherness deep in the history
of the true or real university.
What has happened to the
wholeness, the universitas, in
this university? Split, I say to
and by residence ideology.
When I speak of oneness, I

do not, of course, intend or want
intellectual harmony in the com
munity. But, I think, central to
the idea of community is the
need for openness and interac
tion, just the chance to com
municate disagreement.
This means the elimination,
or at least the opening, of
cages. Only in a milieu of open
ness, which I sense to be the
first part of the concept "univer
sity," and now the first need of
this one in particular, can
awareness grow, free from po
litical, spirtual, or residential
ideology.
One day during the last win
ter, mysteriously, almost myth
ically, a sign appeared nailed on
a tree near the Quad end of
Lasuen Street. It warned those
beginning their walk up the
Row: You Are Now Leaving
The Academic Sector.
The unintegrated life-style
represented by the sign's mes
sage evinces to this freshman
a sorrowful failure in this uni
versity's approach to residential
education. (Not the University,
but this university, you and me.)
Through this piece there runs
a current of thought concern

ing Harvard and Yale that
might be miscontrued as pro
vincial favoritism. First, if it
matter, I have lived in San
Francisco since birth. I men
tion the Eastern schools only
because I consider their resi
dence system superior to ours.
I now live at Stanford, and
nowhere else, because I want
to (perhaps we should consider
the difference between going to
and living in a school). I do
feel that the other schools,
though they might be antedilu
vian with regard to social and
political consciousness, might
perhaps help us here as we con
sider possible changes in our
residence institutions.
I would like to see, as I am
seeing to a greater degree each
week, Stanford divide and fight
over the issue of war in Viet
nam. I would like to see, as re
cently I thankfully have to a de
gree, the Stanford campus con
sumed in an enflamed debate
over the important draft issue.
But, as a disappointed fresh
man, nearing the end of my year
here, I deplore the polarization
of Stanford along merely resi
dential criteria.
Two quarters of Stanford life,
one in Cedro House in Wilbur
and one in the Grove, were
enough for me to see that this
student body is in frightful dis
union. There is discord here,
and I do not mean mere dis
agreement. There is discord so
consuming, so thoroughly en
vironmental that I am em
harassed when people speak of
Stanford, Harvard, and great
ness (be that what it may) in
the same sentence.
Let's face it: the psychology
of every Stanford person,
though graduates escape the
problem to a certain, small de
gree, is circumscribed by what
can be called residence ideology,
and it has saddened me this
spring to watch this force grip
and devour the freshmap class.
'The Split'
During the months of March
and April, I have watched my
class cleave with cruel preci
sion into the two camps of in
dependent and fraternity men.
The great Stanford split came
off so smoothly this year you
might not have seen it unless
you cared to look.
Swish, and along about April,
whenever I saw an old Wilbur
friend, he was either in this or
out of that for one reason or an
other. And there was a curious
feeling of distance and the death
of a growth process that had
started in September. With sor
row, I watched the Class of '70
join the Stanford residence pa
rade.
And I grew sick. Sick over a
residence university that is not.
Sick over a system that pro
claims education, and instead
of leading us out (which is what
the Romans wanted the word
education to mean), leads every
one of us back into solipsistic
life-niches defined by, of all
things, our residences and their
ideological confines.
You remember, do you, that
warm, satisfying womb? Every
thing (I knew you could) looked
the same and nice. No disagree
ments in those days, in those
places, ehh? Straight... through
the umbilicus, it all came, so
wondrous and facile, like being
curled around the keg.
Yes, I have that rancour in
me too. But I weep these words,
wishing they weren't necessary.
But I sense a Stanford drowned
in self-flattery, denoted by that
current, complacent phrase, Har
vard-of-the-West. And, at those

moments in my conversation
when that expression surfaces,
visions of the lowa State Uni
versity residential parade, trans
ferred to somewhere above
Palo Alto, crowd my conscience.
But have we people ourselves
created this all campus animos
ity that forms a fundamental
layer of the Stanford conscious
ness? No, the Stanford residence
system alone has caused this
schism.
Is the basis of the antipathetic
psychology of this community
(if such can exist in this situa
tion) a student disagreement
over the current War, which
Martin Luth King has called
"this country's greatest moral
crisis since 1860"? No, even de
cisions about this dilemma are
made in the shadow of Stanford
residence ideology. Bravest of
all are those who, in their ideo
logical incarceration, have chos
en for the opposite campus
camp, as it were.
Yale More Cohesive
Kingman Brewster, President
of Yale, in his visit here last
week perceived in our student
body the problem of which I
speak. He said, "From what I
can see, Yale is more cohesive
than Stanford."
Possibly one difference is that
Yale's residential colleges of
300 students each do not elimi
nate communication between dis
similar residences, as does the
present Stanford system. Of
course, rivalries exist among the
colleges but, as a friend at Yale
told me, open intercourse is
maintained at all levels: social,
cultural and intellectual. People
are not cut off from each other
by what here amounts to cages
of ideology. Moreover, the Yale
college microcosms themselves
are inclusive enough to offer
students what they need and
want.
Of late we have thankfully
heard hereabouts of the aspira
tions of some to "a real univer
sity." I submit that we might
shift the emphasis from the ad
jective to the noun. I would like
to live in a university on the
Stanford campus. For it is not
one now.

places, ehh? Straight... through
the umbilicus, it all came, so
wondrous and facile, like being
curled around the keg.
Yes, I have that rancour in
me too. But I weep these words,
wishing they weren't necessary.
But I sense a Stanford drowned
in self-flattery, denoted by that
current, complacent phrase, Har
vard-of-the-West. And, at those

moments in my conversation
when that expression surfaces,
visions of the lowa State Uni
versity residential parade, trans
ferred to somewhere above
Palo Alto, crowd my conscience.
But have we people ourselves
created this all campus animos
ity that forms a fundamental
layer of the Stanford conscious
ness? No, the Stanford residence
system alone has caused this
schism.
Is the basis of the antipathetic
psychology of this community
(if such can exist in this situa
tion) a student disagreement
over the current War, which
Martin Luth King has called
"this country's greatest moral
crisis since 1860"? No, even de
cisions about this dilemma are
made in the shadow of Stanford
residence ideology. Bravest of
all are those who, in their ideo
logical incarceration, have chos
en for the opposite campus
camp, as it were.
Yale More Cohesive
Kingman Brewster, President
of Yale, in his visit here last
week perceived in our student
body the problem of which I
speak. He said, "From what I
can see, Yale is more cohesive
than Stanford."
Possibly one difference is that
Yale's residential colleges of
300 students each do not elimi
nate communication between dis
similar residences, as does the
present Stanford system. Of
course, rivalries exist among the
colleges but, as a friend at Yale
told me, open intercourse is
maintained at all levels: social,
cultural and intellectual. People
are not cut off from each other
by what here amounts to cages
of ideology. Moreover, the Yale
college microcosms themselves
are inclusive enough to offer
students what they need and
want.
Of late we have thankfully
heard hereabouts of the aspira
tions of some to "a real univer
sity." I submit that we might
shift the emphasis from the ad
jective to the noun. I would like
to live in a university on the
Stanford campus. For it is not
one now.
There is a cohesion, a sense
of oneness, a psychological to
getherness deep in the history
of the true or real university.
What has happened to the
wholeness, the universitas, in
this university? Split, I say to
and by residence ideology.
When I speak of oneness, I

do not, of course, intend or want
intellectual harmony in the com
munity. But, I think, central to
the idea of community is the
need for openness and interac
tion, just the chance to com
municate disagreement.
This means the elimination,
or at least the opening, of
cages. Only in a milieu of open
ness, which I sense to be the
first part of the concept "univer
sity," and now the first need of
this one in particular, can
awareness grow, free from po
litical, spirtual, or residential
ideology.
One day during the last win
ter, mysteriously, almost myth
ically, a sign appeared nailed on
a tree near the Quad end of
Lasuen Street. It warned those
beginning their walk up the
Row: You Are Now Leaving
The Academic Sector.
The unintegrated life-style
represented by the sign's mes
sage evinces to this freshman
a sorrowful failure in this uni
versity's approach to residential
education. (Not the University,
but this university, you and me.)
Through this piece there runs
a current of thought concern

ing Harvard and Yale that
might be miscontrued as pro
vincial favoritism. First, if it
matter, I have lived in San
Francisco since birth. I men
tion the Eastern schools only
because I consider their resi
dence system superior to ours.
I now live at Stanford, and
nowhere else, because I want
to (perhaps we should consider
the difference between going to
and living in a school). I do
feel that the other schools,
though they might be antedilu
vian with regard to social and
political consciousness, might
perhaps help us here as we con
sider possible changes in our
residence institutions.
I would like to see, as I am
seeing to a greater degree each
week, Stanford divide and fight
over the issue of war in Viet
nam. I would like to see, as re
cently I thankfully have to a de
gree, the Stanford campus con
sumed in an enflamed debate
over the important draft issue.
But, as a disappointed fresh
man, nearing the end of my year
here, I deplore the polarization
of Stanford along merely resi
dential criteria.
Two quarters of Stanford life,
one in Cedro House in Wilbur
and one in the Grove, were
enough for me to see that this
student body is in frightful dis
union. There is discord here,
and I do not mean mere dis
agreement. There is discord so
consuming, so thoroughly en
vironmental that I am em
harassed when people speak of
Stanford, Harvard, and great
ness (be that what it may) in
the same sentence.
Let's face it: the psychology
of every Stanford person,
though graduates escape the
problem to a certain, small de
gree, is circumscribed by what
can be called residence ideology,
and it has saddened me this
spring to watch this force grip
and devour the freshmap class.
'The Split'
During the months of March
and April, I have watched my
class cleave with cruel preci
sion into the two camps of in
dependent and fraternity men.
The great Stanford split came
off so smoothly this year you
might not have seen it unless
you cared to look.
Swish, and along about April,
whenever I saw an old Wilbur
friend, he was either in this or
out of that for one reason or an
other. And there was a curious
feeling of distance and the death
of a growth process that had
started in September. With sor
row, I watched the Class of '70
join the Stanford residence pa
rade.
And I grew sick. Sick over a
residence university that is not.
Sick over a system that pro
claims education, and instead
of leading us out (which is what
the Romans wanted the word
education to mean), leads every
one of us back into solipsistic
life-niches defined by, of all
things, our residences and their
ideological confines.
You remember, do you, that
warm, satisfying womb? Every
thing (I knew you could) looked
the same and nice. No disagree
ments in those days, in those
places, ehh? Straight... through
the umbilicus, it all came, so
wondrous and facile, like being
curled around the keg.

residence institutions.
I would like to see, as I am
seeing to a greater degree each
week, Stanford divide and fight
over the issue of war in Viet
nam. I would like to see, as re
cently I thankfully have to a de
gree, the Stanford campus con
sumed in an enflamed debate
over the important draft issue.
But, as a disappointed fresh
man, nearing the end of my year
here, I deplore the polarization
of Stanford along merely resi
dential criteria.
