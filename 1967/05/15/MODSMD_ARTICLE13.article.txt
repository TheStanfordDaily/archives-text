# 'Stanford Standard'
## Competition Demands Compassion 
### DENISE HOLMES 
There's another standard at
Stanford even more fundament
al than the fundamental one. I
call it, simply for ease in hand
ling, the Stanford Standard. It's
the old ten-point scale, to be
very blunt, and I would hazard
to guess that it exists in every
aspect of our lives as students.
It's what got you into Stanford,
baby; we are a community of
tens.
"It's a dog-eat-dog world," my
old pappy used to say. And, by
and large, we all come from
the neighborhoods with the big
gest dogs. If your read your
Civ., you know about "the basic
premise of a market economy."
Stanford, however, operates un
der a different type of competi
tive system. The ten-point scale
is not a direct confrontation of
dog against dog. Rather, we are
competing with a norm. This
type of standard imposes a
middle-man between you and
your friends. It makes it nice:

fight the curve, not your room
mate; divorce the reality of your
struggle to keep ybur 11-S from
the possibility that your friend
may lose his; and enough, I
think, has already been said
about grad school entrance re
quirements.
The Effects
Let me digress a moment to
clarify a point. I am not argu
ing against the causes of the
Stanford Standard, but against
its effects. And I am not con
cerned with the particulars of
how competition manifests itself
(e.g. is there really a pressure
to get the A?"), nor with how
Stanford competition differs
from any other — be it Berke
ley or the U.S. economy. My pur
pose is to issue a plea: consider,
please, what this Stanford Stan
dard is doing to you as a human
being. On a ten-point scale, how
much of a person are you?
For the most part, we have
established our own standards,
set up our criteria for our own

ten-point scales. Basically, then,
we are competing with our
selves. So what I want to ask
is, how successful — working
within each of our individual
value systems — are we at hon
estly caring about each other?
Have we, in the self-struggles
with which we are all unavoid
ably involved, lost sight of the
real value of treating each other
as human beings, the only real
ly important reality of our
lives?
Imagine yourself in a human
vacuum, and to give it real ap
peal, fill this new world with
all the other things you want
out of life: a Porsche, a "good
education," a challenge, French
cuisine. Now try and live in it.
Go on, try and imagine your
self being happy. Now, bring
yourself back to reality (and
isn't it nice that you can?).
Need to Confide
I woke up a few days ago to
the reality that students leave
Stanford because they are all
mixed up. But why, why in this
huge university — full of peo
ple — was there no one in whom
these confused individuals could
confide? I'm not interested in
Stanford's free professional psy
chiatric consultations; I'm talk
ing about the unbelievably glor
ious realization that somebody
in the next room honestly caresi
Somebody is so glad I am
alive that he can close up Niet
zsche for a few hours and let
me tell him that sometimes I
am afraid.
A "C" in chemistry would

really hurt the old G.P.A.; ulti
mately, one might even lose out
on being swamped with grad
school invites. But jump back
into that vacuum for a moment.
Walk around. Now come out
and think about what it means
to be lonely.
