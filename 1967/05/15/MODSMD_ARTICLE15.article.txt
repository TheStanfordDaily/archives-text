# Freshmen In Daily Forum Discuss State Of Residences
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: A group of
students representing the fresh
man residences participated last
week in a forum on the differ
ences and drawbacks of fresh
man living groups. Represent
ing Branner were Ann Bauer
and Margie Cohn, who moved to
the Grove House this quarter.
From Roble was Caroline Bixby,
from Wilbur, Dave Miller, from
Stern, Steve Berman. Phil Taub
man, DAILY editorial associate,
moderated the discussion.)
Phil Taubma*:: What seems
to you to have been the major
problems and successes of your
residences this past year?
Margie Cohn: Branner is
homogeneously grouped as far
as sex and class go. There is
very little privacy. The Grove
House is an entirely different
situation.
Caroline Bixby: First of all
let me say that I am obviously
approaching this from a per
sonal bias about how I think

a living group should be run.
I don't think Roble is an intel
lectual place at all.
Dave Miller: I think there are
some very good things at Wil
bur. I think the first is the
freedom that is available there.
There is no authoritarian struc
ture and there are no discipli
narians. This is a positive thing.
It causes a lot of trouble along
the way but this is all part of
the learning experience. I have
seen some transformations in
people on my corridor that dem
onstrate that the way you teach
the difference between freedom
and license, and self-control, is
not to try to put in an authori
tarian system and then hope
for osmosis, but rather to put
a person in an environment of
absolute freedom and give him
the chance to develop on his
own.
This falls down a little in
Wilbur, as I think there is not

a real feeling of community in
the houses.
Phil Tauhnian: What about
Stern?
Steve Berman: Stern is sup
posedly an example of integra
tion. I specifically chose Stern
hoping the upperclass men
would help me adjust. Unfortu
nately when I got to Stern I
found a very cyncial attitude
on the part of the upperclass
men as compared with the fresh
men I had met. The sponsors we
have at Stern don't function at
all like the sponsors at Wilbur.
There is a complete separation
between education and residence
living at Stern. Your room be
comes almost a retreat from
the intellectual life at school.
There's not much interaction
between freshmen and upper
classmen in Stern. For the first
two quarters my roommate and
I lived alone on the third floor
among upperclassmen and we
felt rather lonely.
