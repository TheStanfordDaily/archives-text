# Student-Faculty Contact Developed In Seminars
## 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
Every night of the week small
groups of freshmen gather in
homes and in isolated rooms on
campus. Planning a revolution
against the In-Crowd? No!
They're participating in one of
the most exciting programs of
the freshman year, the fresh
man seminar program. The pro
gram offers over 47 different
seminars in 25 departments al
lowing over 300 freshman "the
opportunity to work closely for
two quarters with a faculty
member or advanced teaching
assistant in study engaging their
mutual interests."
The two-year-old Stanford
Freshman Seminar Program
has been well received by fresh
men each year, and has played
a large part in destroying the
image of Stanford as a mono
lith, or a multiversity. Every
student looks forward to close
contact with the faculty. The
seminar program affords this
opportunity to freshmen, hoping
that they will continue this
close interaction all four years.

One of the basic problems of
the program is the lack of
space that is necessary in
order to meet the demand of
each entering class. Applications
are sent out with the catalog
and various other information
booklets, early in the summer.
Students are chosen at random,
though there is an attempt made
to achieve a; co-educational bal
ance. The small groups of no
more than eight students usual
ly meet in the home of the in
structor once a week for two
or three hours.
One amazing aspect of the
program is the variety of the
courses. They range from a
study of the lives of the noble
Grecians and Romans to a
course on the metabolic regula
tion in micro-organisms. How
ever, even more amazing and
exciting is the close affinity that
is developing between 300 Stan
ford freshmen and 47 teachers.
There is a deepening of re
lationships beyond the normal
classroom level that, like other
projects such as the Grove
House, allows the student to en
joy the utmost benefits from an
intellectual community of scho
lars.
