# Sponsors Offer Perspective
## 
### CICELY BATES 
Sponsors, Tutors, and Resi
dent Assistants are the first con
tacts that freshmen have with
Stanford students. Whether they
form an integral part of the
freshman year is a frequently
posed question. This year's
freshman class has, for the most
part, given approval to the role
of their upperclassmen resi
dents.
The role of the sponsor as
officially stated in the Wilbur
House Manual is to "introduce
the freshman to the academic
and extracurricular customs of
the University." Most freshmen
believe the help given by spon
sors goes much beyond this.
"Sponsors should give a sense
of perspective about Stanford
affairs," stated one Wilbur man.
His concept was backed up by
another Wilbur resident who
said that his sponsor was especi
ally helpful in explaining the po
sitions of such controversial fig
ures as ex-Student Body Presi
dent Dave Harris and next
year's Student Body ' President
Peter Lyman.
Challenging Ideas
One trait that Wilbur Spon
sors seem to have most in com
mon is that they make their
freshman charges think. Often
their controversial stands on
such affairs as the draft and
Vietnam make the freshmen
look at both sides of questions
for the first time.
While the challenge of ideas
seemed to be the sponsor's main
success, Wilbur men also indi
cated that sponsors had been
helpful in course and rush ad
vice. They have been an outlet
for feelings of dissatisfaction,
and a help in getting to knew
other upperclassmen.
Across the street, Branner
sponsors play a different role.
They were busiest during the
first few weeks of school giving
course advice and telling their

girls the "best places to go" and
in general what to expect of
college life.
Roble girls gave a similar role
to their sponsors. At the begin
ning of the year, they were a
great help in getting settled and
in general helping the girls re
late to the University.
Sharing responsibilities with
sponsors are tutors. The tutor
should be perceived, states the
Wilbur House Manual "as aid
ing the freshman to meet his
own needs and aspirations."
Wilbur considers this role con
fusing and looks to these stu
dents not as "tutors", but rath
er as stabilizing adult figures
in the house. One Arroyo man
described tutors as "people who
have been through the mill and
can tell you what it's like."

Many others were critical of
tutors because they felt that
they aren't involved in house
activities and help only those
who have the same major.
Stern RA's
In Stern, resident graduate
students have the equally vague
title of Resident Assistant. Stern
freshmen view their RA's as
party givers and spirit promot
ers. They believe RA's are use
ful in "keeping guys from de
stroying things and bothering
each other." Handing out light
bulbs and getting keys for
locked-out freshmen seem to
complete their duties.
Branner and Roble enjoy the
intellectual contact they have
with their tutors but feel they
don't really know their purpose.
In Branner the tutors often ar

range speakers for the dorm and
get tickets to cultural events for
the freshmen. But like the spon
sors, they are viewed by the
girls in both dorms as fellow
students and friends.
Only Sponsors Necessary
While it was generally agreed
that sponsors, tutors and R.A.'s
do have a role in the freshman
year, only the sponsors seem to
be really necessary. It is felt
that sponsors give an older per
spective that is a must as long
as freshmen are segregated
from the rest of the University.
However, many freshmen ex
pressed the hope that the hous
ing would change and integrate
all classes making it then un
necessary to have chosen upper
classmen living with freshmen
under the title of "sponsor."
