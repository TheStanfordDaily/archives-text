# 'Why' Instead Of 'What'
## Regs Unheeded, Unneeded 
### MIKE MORTON 
Why has the University insti
tuted and why does it preserve
a system of social regulation?
The word "regulation" is im
portant, for the question is not
now, "which rule is particularly
aggravating", or "what changes
could best be made", but a seek
ing beyond these inquiries, i.e.,
into the actual theory govern
ing the practice—the "why" of
the matter.
I was surprised at thi> lack of
thought accorded this question
of "why" by students. The gen
eral response ran along the lines
of "why not," "just a matter of
propriety," or something of that
order. By and large, people
seemed satisfied with the social
status quo.
The reason for this satisfac
tion lies not, I believe, in an
approval of the system as it now
exists, but merely in a non
awareness of it. Although fe
male students are certainly in
formed as to the regulations
ostensibly governing their con
duct, any self-respecting coed
can and does, with a bit of in
genuity, ignore the rules and
avoid the consequences. In the
men's dorms the situation is
similar but more opon.
No Guilt
Herein is embodied what I see
as more than a dissatisfaction
with the social regs themselves,
here is implicit opposition to the
theory of social regulation in
the University. Although the
actual question of carrying out
the rules rests almost entirely
on the individual's decision to
uphold or disregard the Funda
mental Standard, the consensus
appears to be embodied by one
freshman— "nobody takes them
seriously around here." Even if
the person is aware of his social
reg violation, there is no feeling
of guilt over such a "crime."
There exists in the University
a sort of double-double standard
with regard to social regs. First,
despite the fact that individuals
go to great lengths to avoid
rules, there is a body of opinion
on campus (of indeterminate
size) that subscribes to the need
for some sort of codified struc
ture, although no one has any
idea of what that structure
should be.

Secondly, there is the discrep
ancy between male and female
regulations, most clearly seen in
the recent OFF! controversy.
Again, despite the near-univers
al outrage at administration ac
tion, no small numb r of stu
dents, notably male, continue
to see a necessity for, or at least
show approval of such a condi
tion—"it just seems natural,"
"the way it's always been."
Control The Pursestrings
From out of the atmosphere
of non-think (or maybe non
care) a number of reasons have
been advanced as explanations
of administration policy on so
cial regulation. These range
from a belief in adult antipathy
wrirc and distrust of youth in
general, to the thought that this
policy emerges primarily as a
result of parental and alumni
pressure, particularly around
the treasury. However, I think
the answer, or at least a clearer
understanding, is to be found by

probing somewhat deeper.
Administrators, by the defini
tive nature of their functions in
the University, are not educa
tors. To properly discharge their
responsibilities, they must bo
concerned with providing the en
vironment in which the educa
tional experience can take place,
not with contributing to the ex
perience itself. Either through
ignorance of the necessary re
sults of their actions or through
bad faith in their funda
mental tasks, our administrat
ors have created, in the form ol
social regulation, a situation
which is diametrically opposed
to the full meaning of educa
tion—the individual's discovery
of himself and his world.
This fact has long been per
ceived by the educators and edu
cated of the University. I do not
believe it an impertinent or ir
relevant request to ask this
same perception by the admini
stration.
