This is the Freshman Edition of The Stanford
Daily. We publish it in the hope that it will be
the last, for the simple existence of a Freshman
Edition epitomizes the whole problem of the
Freshman year â€” it is a year apart from Stan
ford.
We question the validity of the entire con
cept of a freshman year. In the classroom, in
the dorm, on the athletic field, the freshman
class is forced to assume a separateness which
effectively serves to alienate it from the rest of
the University.
From the moment a prospective freshman re
ceives his acceptance notice he is led to believe
that he and his classmates will be a distinct en
tity at Stanford. Pamphlets and handbooks
speak of his coming year in terms of his being
a member of the freshman class rather than a
member of the Stanford community.
Pre-reg week reinforces the freshman's pre
conception of himself. By bringing the freshman
class together to an empty campus, it accentu
ates the feeling of segregation from the rest of
the University.
The freshman moves through the rest of the
year living with freshmen, attending freshman
classes, playing on freshman teams. It is an ac
complishment if he is able to transcend this and
become a member of the comunity at large; if
he does so, it is despite his being a freshman, not
because he is a Stanford student.
That this is a uniquely freshman problem can
be seen in the lack of sophomore class-conscious
ness, a junior residence or required course, or a
Senior Edition of The Daily.
Why can't the three-year integrated educa
tion of the upper classes be expanded to include
the freshman year, thus creating a classless four
year university?
An official University proclamation that the
class system no longer exists, however, would be
insufficient unless it reflected a change in atti
tude on the part of the freshman class. The pro
posals we offer are twofold: we seek both to
create a new attitude among freshmen and to
provide a framework within which that attitude
can be channeled into effective action.
Along with the introduction to the functional
aspects of the University, material sent to the
accepting student should include such items as
the ASSU Housing Commission Report, an ex
planation of the Study of Education at Stanford
and its agenda, the ASSU President's proposals,
and perhaps even today's issue of The Daily.
The present pre-reg week serves only to orient
the freshman to the superficial elements at Stan
ford. We seek less of an introduction to the com
forts of.a country club and more to the challenges
of. a community of scholars. This can only be

done if from the very beginning the freshmen are
introduced to Stanford as a whole. Pre-reg a week
before school starts only reinforces the division
between freshmen and upperclassmen. Some
orientation is necessary, but it should take place
during the first week of school and should em
phasize the total scope of the University rather
than how a freshman can best adjust to his fresh
man status. There should be more discussions
such as the one held last fall in Branner in which
upperclassmen, including the ASSU president,
discussed education at Stanford. We would ex
pand this idea to include discussions between
students and university officials such as Provost
Richard Lyman and members of the SES.
Another step toward achieving a new fresh
man attitude would be to institute a pass-fail
freshman year and make Western Civilization a
regular course in the University. Pass-fail would
alleviate much of the pressure which causes the
freshman class to cling together. It would remove
the need for freshman academic adjustment
which all-freshman classes now attempt to ful
fill.
With fewer pressures of adjustment the fresh
man would be better able to implement these at
titudinal changes. It is only now, at the end of
spring quarter, that most freshmen are beginning
to realize their potential in working toward
change in the University. The right kind of lead
ership at this time could effectively mobilize the
freshmen and replace complaints about the Uni
versity with constructive action. But if the ma
jority of freshmen are ever to have the chance to
join the university community, such realization
must come earlier in the year.
We propose a committee of freshmen and up
perclassmen which would design programs not
intended to tell freshmen what's wrong with
Stanford but to provide a framework within
which they can grasp how Stanford works and
decide for themselves what needs to be done.
Growing out of 'his would be an organizational
structure led at first by a few concerned upper
classmen and sponsors and later by those fresh
man who have shown interest and leadership.
This structure would give the freshmen a collec
tive voice in the University.
To facilitate the establishment of such a com
mittee, we suggest that a group of this year's
freshmen prepare papers on their freshman year
this summer under the auspices of SES. These
papers would point out the problems of the fresh
man year and offer solutions.
Next year's freshman class is waiting in the
wings. We've been through the mill and offer
these proposals in the sincere hope that Stanford
will see their merit and, in adopting them, create
a university for freshman rather than a year.
