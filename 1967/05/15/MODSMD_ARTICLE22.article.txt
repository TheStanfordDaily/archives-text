# A 						Touch Of Gold
## Smash Your Mirrors, Dollies! 
### Nan Goldie 
The preconceived notion of the
role of Stanford women is cap
sulized in the insipid title of
"dollie." Upon arrival at Stan
ford the Freshmen girls are
overwhelmed by the onrush of
"frat" men who valiantly offer
their services to the desperate
girls. Along with the rendered
services come numerous invi
tations to the frosh dollie part
ies. Consequently the Freshmen
girls, at least those who appear
attractive on first sight, are
placed into the category frosh
dollie.
Those girls who are over
looked by the perceptive frat
boys begin to question where
and why they have failed. After
the initial rush for beautiful
girls has subsided the usual
weekend routine is in full gear.
If a girl doesn't have more than
three invitations for both nights
she begins to worry where she
has failed, "Maybe I didn't sit
out on the sun porch long
enough, and my tan is a little
uneven."
My reason for mentioning

these "seemingly" inane ac
counts of the first weeks at
Stanford for Freshmen girls is
that in reality this is really the
way it happens. And not only
does this occur in the beginning
of the year but it continues
throughout, for many girls,
the entire four years. I am not
assuming that it is wrong to
spend four years going to beer
busts and IFC balls, but what I
would like to suggest is a more
open consciousness on the part
of us all. I feel that no one
should be coerced into assum
ing the role of an image. I do
believe that the way in which
Freshman girls are now intro
duced to life at Stanford means
that they unconsciously take a
role to fulfill, and there are no
alternate paths offered to them.
I believe it to be only too ac
curate to say that an existence
composed totally of Frosh dollie
parties, beer busts, and frat
parties is irresponsible. We live
in an age where personal re
sponsibility and commitment are
vital to our survival and effec

tiveness. The life that too many
of us lead is devoid of any in
dividual consciouness or reflec
tion. We all seem to be satisfied
assuming a given role. I beUeve
that the time we allot for our
college years is one during
which we must reflect inward.
We must begin to justify our
being at Stanford, that is, to de
cide what education personally
means to us and how we are
going to attempt to achieve our
goals individually and collective
ly. What I am asking every
Freshman woman to do is to
seriously reflect upon her life
at Stanford. If you are satisfied
with what you are, then I be
lieve that you should leave the
University, for you have no use
for it, and it has no use for you.
Frosh dollies, I make one last
plea — next time you look into
the mirror, which I expect will
be all too soon, ask yourself if
you are satisfied with the life
that you are now leading at
Stanford. And try and imagine
what it would be like if all
the mirrors were destroyed.

she begins to worry where she
has failed, "Maybe I didn't sit
out on the sun porch long
enough, and my tan is a little
uneven."
My reason for mentioning

these "seemingly" inane ac
counts of the first weeks at
Stanford for Freshmen girls is
that in reality this is really the
way it happens. And not only
does this occur in the beginning
of the year but it continues
throughout, for many girls,
the entire four years. I am not
assuming that it is wrong to
spend four years going to beer
busts and IFC balls, but what I
would like to suggest is a more
open consciousness on the part
of us all. I feel that no one
should be coerced into assum
ing the role of an image. I do
believe that the way in which
Freshman girls are now intro
duced to life at Stanford means
that they unconsciously take a
role to fulfill, and there are no
alternate paths offered to them.
I believe it to be only too ac
curate to say that an existence
composed totally of Frosh dollie
parties, beer busts, and frat
parties is irresponsible. We live
in an age where personal re
sponsibility and commitment are
vital to our survival and effec

tiveness. The life that too many
of us lead is devoid of any in
dividual consciouness or reflec
tion. We all seem to be satisfied
assuming a given role. I beUeve
that the time we allot for our
college years is one during
which we must reflect inward.
We must begin to justify our
being at Stanford, that is, to de
cide what education personally
means to us and how we are
going to attempt to achieve our
goals individually and collective
ly. What I am asking every
Freshman woman to do is to
seriously reflect upon her life
at Stanford. If you are satisfied
with what you are, then I be
lieve that you should leave the
University, for you have no use
for it, and it has no use for you.
Frosh dollies, I make one last
plea — next time you look into
the mirror, which I expect will
be all too soon, ask yourself if
you are satisfied with the life
that you are now leading at
Stanford. And try and imagine
what it would be like if all
the mirrors were destroyed.
The preconceived notion of the
role of Stanford women is cap
sulized in the insipid title of
"dollie." Upon arrival at Stan
ford the Freshmen girls are
overwhelmed by the onrush of
"frat" men who valiantly offer
their services to the desperate
girls. Along with the rendered
services come numerous invi
tations to the frosh dollie part
ies. Consequently the Freshmen
girls, at least those who appear
attractive on first sight, are
placed into the category frosh
dollie.
Those girls who are over
looked by the perceptive frat
boys begin to question where
and why they have failed. After
the initial rush for beautiful
girls has subsided the usual
weekend routine is in full gear.
If a girl doesn't have more than
three invitations for both nights
she begins to worry where she
has failed, "Maybe I didn't sit
out on the sun porch long
enough, and my tan is a little
uneven."
