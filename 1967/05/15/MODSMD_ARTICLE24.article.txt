## Frosh: Growing, Changing 
### Maria Mahoney 
A year is a long time, especi
ally a year of college; I look at
myself now and at myself in
September and say, "What hap
pened in those months?" I re
member the day I came, as we
drove down Escondido Road
while I alternately studied the
map and complexes of build
ings: "It doesn't look like Bran
ner." And my father's reaction
to my room: "Just like a cell!"
And how strained and tense we
were during Pre-Reg Week. We
talk about it now, and one theme
runs through every conversa
tion: "I didn't know anybody.
I wanted to go home. I was so
scared."
Essentially that's the differ
ence; I was afraid then, I'm not
afraid now. Partly it's just fa
miliarity with the environment:
the flowers on the Quad, the
class blocks in front of Mem
Chu, the beautiful fields on
Frenchman's Road, the weath
er (to a smog-allergic Los Ange
les resident, nothing short of
miraculous). Partly it is people,
and the memories I have of
them: my sponsor's birthday
party, a Daily Halloween party
where we ended up at Dean
Napier's house singing "Some
where, Over the Rainbow," my
first drink, my freshman semi
nar, the night we sat up until
four a.m. talking to one of our
tutors, walking through San
Francisco in the rain. Mostly it
is simply a faith in myself that
I did not have before I came
to college, the knowledge that I
can cope and can succeed on my
own in a new place.
New Depth
One is supposed to change in
college; I think I have grown
since I came here, more than
at any time in the past five
years, but it is a difficult thing
to explain. It isn't a question of
the near-cliche of the student's
intellectual awakening, or even
of that modern awakening, the
discovering of New Left. My
growth is not something added
to what I know and deal with,
but a depth I did not have be
fore. It's as though I am catch
ing up to something before I
go on again â€” the weight as
well as the height.
This growth, however, is
somewhat negated by certain
personal problems. For me this
has been the first time I have
been able to function easily in
a large group of people; it is
horrifying in a way, but I can
say truthfully of Stanford, as
I did to a friend, "Even the peo
ple here who are least like me
are more like me than anyone
I knew before." It is relieving
to feel this way about a place,
but it is dangerous, too; it is
a type of insulation which pre
vents me from recognizing
things which are obviously
wrong with the university and
with myself. Almost out of grat
itude, I accept things as they
are, and I am just beginning
to come out of this stage. Per
haps when I do, I will be able to
give a less prejudiced and far

better analysis of conditions at
Stanford.
I have a friend who says of
himself, "I am a freshman, and
therefore by definition inherent
ly uninteresting." To some, par
ticularly upperclassmen, this is
a perfectly correct viewpoint.
Freshman year is, above all, a
period of adjustment, and un
less one happens to have a mor
bid fascination with the process,
it is rather disturbing to relive
the details. However, it is also
a period of growth, and as per
sons undergoing growth and
change, freshmen should most
definitely not be uninteresting
to the rest of the University.
Colleges produce growth in all
students; this should not be a
reason for isolation, but a rea
son for closeness. Freshmen and
upperclassmen tend to segre
gate in different groups, each
preoccupied with their own prob
lems. Are the problems actual
ly any different? Aren't they all
part of being human and grow
ing up?

I couldn't tell you precisely
what I've learned this year, ex
cept for one thing: there isn't
anyone who doesn't care, there
isn't anyone who can never un
derstand. All I can say, to this
year's freshmen, next year's
freshmen, and everyone else, is,
think about it:
Is it necessary
To be alone so much,
To meet only strangers?
Does it make you any happier
To see the world
Only for yourself
When you know it's beautiful
And they should, too?
