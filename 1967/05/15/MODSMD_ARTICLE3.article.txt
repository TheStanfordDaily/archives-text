# Freshman Curricula, 'Ghettos' Retard Academic Integration
## 
### LEONARD SIEGEL 
The worst thing about fresh
man year is that it exists for
most freshmen as an entity
thoroughly segregated from the
rest of the academic process.
Freshmen are isolated physi
cally and academically from the
rest of the academic commu
nity. Freshman dorms limit per
spective and encourage primi
tive social behavior, while plac
ing little value on social in
volvement or academic pursuits.
Freshman courses, ostensibly
designed to introduce freshmen
to the type of study done with
in the university, actually make
it difficult for freshmen to be
come assimilated into the uni
versity community.
Frosh Dollies
There is an aura about the
"Wilburness." Wilbur is wild.
Wilbur is not academic. And
there are certain generalizations
about Branner and .Roble girls
frosh dollies — which are
equally discomforting.
The high school mentality
with which most freshmen enter
is reinforced by the conformist
pressures of the frosh ghettos.
Freshmen are rarely exposed
to the attitudes of what Nevitt
Sanford calls a "liberated" stu
dent. The institution of the
frosh sponsor is intended to al
leviate this isolation, but for
malized patronization by a few
is a far cry from integrated
living.
Relearning Process
Frosh General Studies require
ments were introduced with the
aim of providing students with
the skills and background they
will someday need to learn.
Not only is this assumption of
need incorrect, but regardless
of past introduction, most stu
dents must relearn both thought
processes and skills each time
they move to another aspect of
their education. To postpone ed
ucation for a year is ludicrous,
yet this is what the institution
of freshman academic year does.
I don't want to ignore the ar
gument that introductory cour
ses provide freshmen a back
ground against which they can
select the right course of study.
The limited knowledge offered
in survey courses provided an
inadequate and often incorrect
picture from which students
make shallow decisions about
their future.
Specific Studies
I do not claim that deeper
studies will give the freshman a
quicker idea of what he wants
to do. Most likely the freshman
will "waste .time" learning.
However, the probability of a
student finding what he really
likes to do is greater when
specific studies, not general
studies, are offered to him.
I cannot say that the survey
or introduction approaches help

no one. But their supporters
cannot say that such approaches
mislead no one. What they do
however, for most freshmen, is
deny them, for one year, the
opportunity to pursue subjects
in depth — which is the true
cornerstone of university educa
tion.
Frosh Seminars
All is not for the worst, how
ever. The freshman seminar pro
gram is a significant effort to
eliminate the prerequisites
which inhibit in-depth study.
I think that there should be
more freshman seminars, re
placing, for those who wish,
Civ and freshman English, re
quirements which often make
it difficult for freshmen to sche
dule seminars.
But freshman seminars are
far from perfect. They are
courses created for and taught
only to freshmen, and the depth

of inquiry is often very limited.
Much better are courses like
those of the Grove Project
which have permitted a handful
of freshmen to pursue subjects
normally not within their reach,
and as normal students, not spe
cial freshmen.
Rewards
Another rewarding experi
ment would be to remove pre
requisites for some high level
courses. Freshmen, if given the
opportunity,"will prove that they
can learn.
The freshman, in many ways,
knows he is a freshman. He
is treated as a freshman in most
aspects of his campus life. The
freshman is treated as a stu
dent in a one-year university,
not a first-year student in a
four-year university.
This is wrong. The freshman
is perhaps unequal, but by no
means should he be separate.
