# A 						Positive View Of Wilbur
## 
### JIM SPICKARD 
"And for three quarters the
children of Stanford wandered
in the Wilburness and were as
sailed by many evils — the
Monster General Studies with
his boy-wonder Western Civ,
the dearth of 'true education,'
the hoards of Street Meat led
by that infamous scoundrel
Two-to-One, to name a few.
"And the children of Stanford
suffered in these ordeals, were
tortured by loneliness and alien
ation, stifled by pillbox architec
ture. But ever aware and hope
ful of 'God's' grace and infinite
wisdom they looked forward to
the joys and glories of the prom
ised land of next year."
Many people seem to be un
aware of the simple fact that
very little in our society is free,
and that the $3000 we spend
each year will buy us neither
knowledge nor happiness. We
have to add something extra to
get an education, and what we
get is directly proportional to
what we add.
The proponents of the Theory
of Negativity at this university
always manage to forget this,
and their entire outlook is there
by affected. Gentlemen, fresh
man year ain't all that bad!
Admittedly, much could and
should be improved in the Wil
burness. It is not the best living
situation for everyone, but, on
the other hand, none of the op
tions presently available to up
perclassmen is any too good
either.
Meaningful Experience
But Wilbur can be a meaning
ful experience — a very mean
ingful one — if it is approached
with the proper attitude, and
not given up before the effort
is made. Specifically, Wilbur can
provide a marvelous arena for
the study of other human be
ings and thereby oneself.
It is not a limited environ
ment, as are most other resi
dences, and interaction in depth
can occur if one has the desire.
You've got jocks, drunks, intel
lectuals, hippies, schizoid types—

as wide a range of people as
you can find at Stanford (but
that's another subject).
Opportunities are there if you
look for them, but they don't
leap out and assault you if you
make no effort.
Read and Contribute
The same thing can be said
about the General Studies Pro
gram, especially Western Civ.
You get as much out of these
courses as you put in; no more,
no less. As with all courses,
much depends on the quality
and interest of the particular in

structor. But few of them are
incompetent and each has his
worth, which can be found if
the student desires to do so.
Harmful Frustration
With Herr Two-to-One, how
ever, it is much harder to be so
positive. We sort of have to
rtiake the best of a bad situa
tion. One hears many complaints
about the impossibility of real
low-key friendship between the
sexes. On the whole, this com
plaint is a valid one. But I
can't be the only guy on cam
pus with several relationships

in this category. (In fact I
haven't been able to find any
on any other basis!) Either I'm
abnormal or such friendship is
there to be found.
This is what bothers me about
many of the nay-sayers at
Stanford. While there is defi
nitely a need for improvement,
one can develop as an indivi
dual within the framework of
the freshman year as it stands
now, if one is willing to make
the effort. At least I have. And
I reject the Theory of Nega
tivity.
