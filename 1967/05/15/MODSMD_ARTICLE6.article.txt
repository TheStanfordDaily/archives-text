* IKach quarter students shuffle
through the Bulletin of Courses
fitd Degrees to find out what
courses they must take and

they must fulfill before gradua

ment. Natural Science majors
hftve no problem with meeting

as social science or humanities

* ' Theory of Diversity

natural science requirement and

to acquaint the student with
different fields, diversify the stu

Students who take an intro
ductory course in biology, phy
sical science, geology, or logic
are, for the most part, doing
so for the simple reason of ful
filling the natural science re
quirements. In fact, too many
of these particular courses are
General Studies courses in the
most pejoritive sense.
Non-Major Alienation
A course of this nature not
only places emphasis on lectures
and limits the student to a pas

sive role, but stultifies student
interest and alienates those who
were considering that particu
lar field as a major.
This type of course may well
be boring, yet the non-science
major must accept this or, as
an alternative, take the more
analytical courses such as in
troductory chemistry or physics.
It is questionable whether the
aims of these courses corres
pond to the aims or interests
of the social science and human
ities students.
Suggestions
How can the Natural Science
program be expanded or revised
to make the courses more com
patible with the interests of the
non-science majors?
Perhaps a series of seminars
in this field might be the an
swer — seminars that would be
directed towards the particular
tastes and idiosyncrasies of the
humanity or social science stu
dents and even science majors.
Foreseeably a seminar pro
gram in the natural sciences
would develop greater interest
and satisfaction among those
humanity and social science stu
dents taking a science course.
Many could then honestly say
that they were no longer taking
courses in this field just to
satisfy general studies require
ments.
Forcing a ntudent to receive
instruction of a defined nature
is more of a militaristic ap
proach to education rather than
an acceptable solution to the
fulfillment o] the University's
purpose of providing an educa
tion.

Non-Major Alienation
A course of this nature not
only places emphasis on lectures
and limits the student to a pas

sive role, but stultifies student
interest and alienates those who
were considering that particu
lar field as a major.
This type of course may well
be boring, yet the non-science
major must accept this or, as
an alternative, take the more
analytical courses such as in
troductory chemistry or physics.
It is questionable whether the
aims of these courses corres
pond to the aims or interests
of the social science and human
ities students.
Suggestions
How can the Natural Science
program be expanded or revised
to make the courses more com
patible with the interests of the
non-science majors?
Perhaps a series of seminars
in this field might be the an
swer — seminars that would be
directed towards the particular
tastes and idiosyncrasies of the
humanity or social science stu
dents and even science majors.
Foreseeably a seminar pro
gram in the natural sciences
would develop greater interest
and satisfaction among those
humanity and social science stu
dents taking a science course.
Many could then honestly say
that they were no longer taking
courses in this field just to
satisfy general studies require
ments.
