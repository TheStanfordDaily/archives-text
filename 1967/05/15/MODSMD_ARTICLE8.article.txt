# Civ Program Needs Reforms: More Time, Student Analysis
## 
### DAVID MANNHEIMER 
One of the few classroom ex
periences shared by all members
of the Stanford undergraduate
student body is a course label
ed the History of Western Civili
zation. Its stated aim is "to ac
quaint the student with the
background and development of
the Western tradition, to give
him some understanding of the
ideals, struggles, and accomp
lishments of his predecessors,

and to enable him to work out
the meaning of the past."
Western Civ is usually the
Stanford student's first study in
any depth of the intellectual and
social trends of Western society,
and, considering the goal of the
course, it should be a reward
ing and stimulating experience.
And yet there is hardly a fresh
man who, when you talk to him,
doesn't feel some dissatisfac
tion with Western Civ.
Western Man
One of the first complaints
heard deals invariably with a
big paperback, grey and fore
boding, laconically entitled West
ern Man. The idea behind West
ern Man is a good one: to bring
together in one volume most of
the sources which will be need
ed during any one quarter of
Civ.
However, the sources contain
ed in such a book are certainly
open to discussion. Better topics
to be treated and better authors
to be quoted would be the first
order of business in any revision
of Western Man. Parts of the
book were thrown together
hastily, and it shows. A smooth
er continuity from article to
article is needed in many chap
ters.
Though Western Man has its
faults, I think that the main
difficulty with Western Civ lies
in the amount of time available
for the course. For a course
that attempts to cover all of
Western civilization and bring
the students, not only to a
knowledge, but to an under

standing: of the Western tradi
tion, three hours per week of
class time simply does not do
the job.
It becomes the task of the
student to learn what these men
thought and wrote, but nowhere
are students required to think
about these thoughts them
selves. Now knowledge is a fine
thing, but to achieve a true
understanding one needs to be
able to think critically and in
dependently about facts and
philosophies. More students
should receive the opportunity
to use their minds in Civ classes.
Change in Format
Since this kind of critical
thinking about Western civiliza
tion is made tremendously dif
ficult by the rapid rate at which
Western Civ progresses, I would
suggest a basic change in the
format of the course.
Naturally a five-unit course
would be better than a four
unit course, but what about add
ing another quarter to the Civ
series? Less would have to be
digested each quarter, and there
would be more time for the
thinking and real comprehen
sion that is the true aim of the
course.
An expansion of Western Civ
would place an obligation on
the faculty — to make Civ an
interesting and stimulating
course for four quarters; but
I don't think this is impossible.
The potential is there.
But right now Western Civ
stands far from the edge of
greatness, so couldn't we give
it a shove in that direction?

the Western tradition, to give
him some understanding of the
ideals, struggles, and accomp
lishments of his predecessors,

and to enable him to work out
the meaning of the past."
Western Civ is usually the
Stanford student's first study in
any depth of the intellectual and
social trends of Western society,
and, considering the goal of the
course, it should be a reward
ing and stimulating experience.
And yet there is hardly a fresh
man who, when you talk to him,
doesn't feel some dissatisfac
tion with Western Civ.
Western Man
One of the first complaints
heard deals invariably with a
big paperback, grey and fore
boding, laconically entitled West
ern Man. The idea behind West
ern Man is a good one: to bring
together in one volume most of
the sources which will be need
ed during any one quarter of
Civ.
However, the sources contain
ed in such a book are certainly
open to discussion. Better topics
to be treated and better authors
to be quoted would be the first
order of business in any revision
of Western Man. Parts of the
book were thrown together
hastily, and it shows. A smooth
er continuity from article to
article is needed in many chap
ters.
Though Western Man has its
faults, I think that the main
difficulty with Western Civ lies
in the amount of time available
for the course. For a course
that attempts to cover all of
Western civilization and bring
the students, not only to a
knowledge, but to an under

standing: of the Western tradi
tion, three hours per week of
class time simply does not do
the job.
It becomes the task of the
student to learn what these men
thought and wrote, but nowhere
are students required to think
about these thoughts them
selves. Now knowledge is a fine
thing, but to achieve a true
understanding one needs to be
able to think critically and in
dependently about facts and
philosophies. More students
should receive the opportunity
to use their minds in Civ classes.
Change in Format
Since this kind of critical
thinking about Western civiliza
tion is made tremendously dif
ficult by the rapid rate at which
Western Civ progresses, I would
suggest a basic change in the
format of the course.
Naturally a five-unit course
would be better than a four
unit course, but what about add
ing another quarter to the Civ
series? Less would have to be
digested each quarter, and there
would be more time for the
thinking and real comprehen
sion that is the true aim of the
course.
An expansion of Western Civ
would place an obligation on
the faculty — to make Civ an
interesting and stimulating
course for four quarters; but
I don't think this is impossible.
The potential is there.
But right now Western Civ
stands far from the edge of
greatness, so couldn't we give
it a shove in that direction?
One of the few classroom ex
periences shared by all members
of the Stanford undergraduate
student body is a course label
ed the History of Western Civili
zation. Its stated aim is "to ac
quaint the student with the
background and development of
the Western tradition, to give
him some understanding of the
ideals, struggles, and accomp
lishments of his predecessors,

and to enable him to work out
the meaning of the past."
