# General Studies System Remains Relic Of 1956
## 
### CHARLES THIERIOT 
In its present form the Gen
eral Studies Program is thrust
upon all entering students in
the form of a rather sickly green
piece of paper which represents
itself as a kind of Stanford Stu
dent Guide to Education. By the
time an unsuspecting freshman
has read through the Basic Re
quirements, the Area Require
ments, the Additional Require
ments for an A.B. Degree, and
the Sequence Requirements one
begins to wonder whether he is
going to college 01 lost in the
midst of an obstacle course for
Statistics majors.
The concept of a General
Studies Program is felt to be
good; but many people think

that our present system leaves
a great deal to be desired.
Beliind The Times
In 1956 when the General
Studies Program was developed,
the Academic Council put a
golden halo around it, gave it
a Director and several Assist
ants, placed it on a shelf, and
no one has been able to touch
it since. To make maximum use
of a General Studies Program it
must be under constant and
careful revision and re-evalua
tion. To say that everyone must
go through some general pro
gram makes no more sense than
the European system of com
plete specialization at an early
age.
The present system, adequate
in 1956, is now outdated for two
main reasons. First, public
school education then had not
reached the high level which it
occupies today. Second, quality
varied greatly in high schools
from place to place so the Gen
eral Studies program b came a
catch-up, evening-out process.
Two Distinct Strains
Today, on the other hand, we
seem to have two separate
strains of students: those with
a weak high school education
who need all the directive help
this program can offer, and
those with a good background
who find many of the General
Studies courses both uninterest
ing and highly restrictive. There
is no flexibility in the present
system which makes no allow
ance for students with a mature
background in a particular field.
Now, more and more students
come to college with previous
specialization in History or En
glish for example, but the Uni
versity makes no differentiation
between these students.
The immortal green sheet is
not only lengthy and detailed

but confusing to the extent that
many students are not sure
when they have completed their
requirements. Although a stu
dent can check at any time with
the registrar's office concerning
his requirements, often students
in their last term find there is
some rather obscure General
Studies requirement which they
had not yet taken. For a pro
gram which is intended to help
a student, it is far to often a
nuisance and a hindrance.
Out Of Proportion
Not only are the General Stu
dies requirements confusing but
they are grossly out of propor
tion. The new student is in
formed he must take a mini
mum of nine units of English,
twelve units of Western Civili
zation, and sevent'en units of
science thereby implying that
the University feels the import
ance of science outweighs En
glish 2:1 and History 3:2. Also
the degrees of intensity are
somewhat unbalanced. Humani
ties and Social Science course
offerings are diversified and gen
eral enough that they leave the
student of science several op
tions which are extremely broad
in scope.
Courses offered under Natural
Science, however, are both nar
row in scope and burdened with
unnecessary detail. The Humani
ties or Social Science major is
overcome with miniscule facts
instead of. becoming familiar
ized with scientific methodology
and a clear understanding of the
basic problems in science.
Perhaps there should be a
special General Studies science
course designed for non-science
majors. Thus if a student wished
additional information in detail
it would become an offering
instead of a requirement.
Advisers Prove Useless
With the green sheet telling
every freshman what he must
or, at least, should take, the role
of adviser becomes totally re
dundant. Since the advising sys
tem is designed to be helpful
rather than directive, it seems
like an excuse for possible inade
quacies within the system. Bow
ing down to the dictates of the
everpresent "green god" to di
rect your judgment, the adviser
becomes an unnecessary and
quite pointless commodity.
Both the adviser system and
the General Studies Program
are areas of the University
which potentially offer great as
sistance to the student, but un
der the status quo students and
faculty alike are needlessly ex
pending valuable time and en
ergy.
