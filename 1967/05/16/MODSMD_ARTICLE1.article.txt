# Faculty Study Analyzes Admissions Policy
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO (First of Two Parts) 
The climate of study and evaluation has
become dominant on campus this year, per
meating all aspects of Stanford life. The re
port on admission policies and practices pre
sented to the Humanities and Sciences fac
ulty last week is representative of the in
creasing interest in the student body and
how it is selected.
Professor Claude Simpson, chairman of
the executive committee of the Humanities
and Sciences faculty, emphasized this report
is more descriptive than analytical, more
provocative than prescriptive. It points to
certain problems in the current admissions
processes and raises questions as to the role
of the faculty in determining the composition
of student body.
The report begins by summarizing the
current admissions procedures which were
adopted by the Academic Council in 1958.
All applicants must meet certain hig' school
course requirements and score at ' 400
on both the verbal and mathem. ,ical sec
tions of the College Board Scholastic Apti
tude Test. Prospective freshmen are then
rated on a ten-point scale distributed as fol
lows: four points for high scnool grade aver
age; two points for SAT verbal and one point
for the SAT mathematics; and three points
for "personal qualifications."
Sons and daughters of alumni may be ad
mitted if their total rating is not more than

one full point below the cutoff. Sons and
daughters of members of the Board of Trus
tees, the faculty, and the permanent Univer
sity staff may be admitted without regard
to the competitive process provided they
meet the basic course and SAT requirements.
All credentials must be filed by the dead
line date, and the Dean of Admissions in con
sultation with the Committee on Undergradu
ate Admissions may act in "borderline cases."
An applicant whose total rating falls as much
as two points below the cut-off may be clas
sified as "borderline."
Evaluating each applicant's achievements
and recommendations is a monumental task
for the admissions staff. More than half of
the applicants are interviewed on campus or
at their high schools. To facilitate this sort
ing, a computerized formula, based on the
SAT scores, is used to predict the probable
first four semesters of high school grades and
freshman grade point average of each can
didate. Males and females are treated separ
ately and divided into eight groups repre
senting approximately one-half standard de
viation. Each of the eight divisions are furth
er categorized by a I, 11, or 111 ranking.
Personal Rating
The personal rating is determined by one
of the admissions staff. Such factors as activi
ties, leadership qualities, emotional stability
and integrity are considered, although there
are no explicit statements of criteria or
weights set for particular areas. Applicants

are given a subjective rating of A through
E by that member of the admissions staff
who reviews his qualifications. Cutting points
are established by the predicted grade point
average and the personal rating.
After "detailed examination of documen
tary material, discussion with many indivi
duals connected with admissions, and com
mittee observation of the admissions staff
at work," the compilers of this report have
noted certain guidelines which are used in
interpreting the data submitted by each ap
plicant.
The admissions staff has come to know
some of the high school counselors after
visiting schools in connection with recruit
ment and interviewing. "As a result, there
are some counselors whose recommendations
are given greater weight in the evaluation of
candidates from their schools."
The report also states that because high
school grading varies, some reinterpretation
is necessary to make transcripts from schools
with lower college-recommending grades
comparable to transcripts of schools with col
lege-recommending grades of B or better.
"This has its impact particularly with respect
to private preparatory schools ... and appar
ently favors some private school applicants."
Counselor's letter
In addition, "the admissions staff normally
disregards the letter of recommendation from
the reference who is not connected with the
applicant's school, and only in rare cases

makes use of the references from the teach
er who is not the student's counselor."
The ad hoc committee which presented this
report raises several issues to be considered
by the faculty on the basis of the above in
formation. The academic performance rating
(possible seven points) is currently deter
mined by the use of the predict ed-grade-aver
age formula. This formula has been revised
recently because it was found that high school
grades are the most important prediction of
college performance, with a minor contribu
tion from verbal aptitude scores and "essen
tially zero contribution from mathematical
aptitude scores."
It is pointed out that the probable use of
the formula is to determine freshman "sur
vival." Since the academic ability of candi
dates has recently risen significantly, "it is
worth considering whether it is now, or will
long remain, necessary to devote so much
concern to whether students can "survive."
Perhaps the more important issue is whether
there are other criteria of academic achieve
ment for which the student body might be
selected than their ability to swim instead of
sink."
Another Stanford Ratio
Another factor the committee has sub
mitted for consideration is the 7:3 ratio of
academic performance to personal rating. Ac
cording to the report, the current scheme is
more closely described by a division of four
academic points to six personal points. How

ever, it is not possible to define precisely this,
ratio because the discrepancy is partially
caused by "the preference for legacies and
the non-competitive admission of faculty-staff
children (which) may reflect combinations
totally different from the 7:3 ratio." The
two-point "judgment area" for students be
low the cut-off also contributes to this vari
ance.
According to Professor William Clebsch,
chairman of the Humanities and Sciences
committee on admissions, it is important to
remember that since the scholastic ability of
students had become so high, it is to be ex
pected t hat personal factors will weigh more
heavily in admission decisions. The report
asks if the faculty should begin to define and
develop criteria for making these personal
judgments, perhaps based on special tal
ents or interests:
"The present policy and its execution tends
to evaluate all applicants in terms of the
same complex set of criteria. It tends to
filter out students with specialized compe
tence or excellence, or other idiosyncracies.
Its effect is to maximize blandness and homo
genity.... Under the present policy, the stu
dent most likely to be accepted is the one
who has the highest high school grade point
average, the highest test scores, participates
in the most extra-curricular acti\ities, has the
greatest appeal to the high school counselor,
and so on."
