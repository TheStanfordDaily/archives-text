## 'Schicchi': Joy To Ears 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The Stanford Opera Guild was
formed entirely by students last
February. Their intent was to
put opera back on the map of
the campus, and they wisely
chose a short, uncomplicated
number as their first geograph
ical insertion.
Gianni Schicchi was one of
three short one-act operas com
posed by Puccini in 1918. He had
been interested in the viability
of such a form for some time.
His contemporaries generally
disapproved of the idea, and
nowadays you tend to hear only
a couple of arias from Koura
Angelica or the famous Bahhino
Mio Carissinio aria from Schic
chi rather than the full perform
ances.
The Stanford production was
happily excellent. After a few
contretemps with their more
sceptical professors in the Music
Department the amateur operat
ics went ahead, staged the opera
with a full university orchestra,
and broke even financially.
First Taste
Best of all, this Gianni Schic
chi gave a considerable quantity
of students their first taste of
opera. It was attractively staged,
beautifully costumed and above
all most entertainingly pre
sented.
Carrick Patterson, who sang
the baritone part of the hero,
is of course a natural clown.
Begged to do so by the avaric
ious relatives of Buoso Donati,
who has just died leaving his
fortune to the friars, Schicchi
gets into the dead man's bed
and awards himself the lot.
Donald Andrews plays the
part of Rinuccio, who coordin
ates the fraud on behalf of his
cousins. He has an exquisite
tenor with a mellifluous Italian
tone. He was a little forced on
his two highest notes and needs
to spread his voice in different

proportions over the part; in
short a fine voice very much in
need of training.
Calm Contrast
Rinuccio is in love with Schic
chi's daughter Lauretta. Played
by Kitt Ilaight with a charming
air of innocence and calmness,
Lauretta's part made a nice
contrast with the venal buffoon
ery of her father. For a soprano
solo she has relatively little to
sing; where she does hold the
stage completely is in one of
Puccini's most haunting and
melodious arias: Babbino Mio
Ciirissiino.
Her rendering was moving
and accurate, with such an en
dearing involvement in the part
that Mr. Gay, the conductor,
performed her a disservice in
not taking the orchestra back to
the start for a repeat.
The result of her love affair
with Rinuccio is, for a while in
doubt. But when Schicchi has
made over a goodly part of Don
ati's wealth to her in the form of
a dowry she becomes an emin
ently acceptable wife. Her last
love duet with Andrews was
another high point of the show.
Music Too Loud
In general the orchestra
played too loudly. Too loudly,
that is, in relation to untrained
voices and a small hall like
Dinkelspiel. In an opera the or
chestra must adapt their volume
to the singers, not the singers
to the pit.
The chorus was also excellent.
Susan Baker as Zita was the
most malicious of the relatives
with a hooked nose and insinu
ating manner. Vickie Kincaid
and Jenny Schneider belied their
years with crabbed voices and
black swirling costumes. I liked
John Winbigler as Betto, who
needs a bequest to carry on
drinking and rolled about the
stage on the edge of eructation.
It was a splendid performanci

by both cast and musicians. A
Puccini opera has a rhythm and
swell which Verdi does not. It
is a continuous persuasive joy
to the ears and it is most to the
credit of the newly formed guild
that the musical and choral
movement was never lost.

who has just died leaving his
fortune to the friars, Schicchi
gets into the dead man's bed
and awards himself the lot.
Donald Andrews plays the
part of Rinuccio, who coordin
ates the fraud on behalf of his
cousins. He has an exquisite
tenor with a mellifluous Italian
tone. He was a little forced on
his two highest notes and needs
to spread his voice in different

proportions over the part; in
short a fine voice very much in
need of training.
Calm Contrast
Rinuccio is in love with Schic
chi's daughter Lauretta. Played
by Kitt Ilaight with a charming
air of innocence and calmness,
Lauretta's part made a nice
contrast with the venal buffoon
ery of her father. For a soprano
solo she has relatively little to
sing; where she does hold the
stage completely is in one of
Puccini's most haunting and
melodious arias: Babbino Mio
Ciirissiino.
Her rendering was moving
and accurate, with such an en
dearing involvement in the part
that Mr. Gay, the conductor,
performed her a disservice in
not taking the orchestra back to
the start for a repeat.
The result of her love affair
with Rinuccio is, for a while in
doubt. But when Schicchi has
made over a goodly part of Don
ati's wealth to her in the form of
a dowry she becomes an emin
ently acceptable wife. Her last
love duet with Andrews was
another high point of the show.
Music Too Loud
In general the orchestra
played too loudly. Too loudly,
that is, in relation to untrained
voices and a small hall like
Dinkelspiel. In an opera the or
chestra must adapt their volume
to the singers, not the singers
to the pit.
The chorus was also excellent.
Susan Baker as Zita was the
most malicious of the relatives
with a hooked nose and insinu
ating manner. Vickie Kincaid
and Jenny Schneider belied their
years with crabbed voices and
black swirling costumes. I liked
John Winbigler as Betto, who
needs a bequest to carry on
drinking and rolled about the
stage on the edge of eructation.
It was a splendid performanci

by both cast and musicians. A
Puccini opera has a rhythm and
swell which Verdi does not. It
is a continuous persuasive joy
to the ears and it is most to the
credit of the newly formed guild
that the musical and choral
movement was never lost.
The Stanford Opera Guild was
formed entirely by students last
February. Their intent was to
put opera back on the map of
the campus, and they wisely
chose a short, uncomplicated
number as their first geograph
ical insertion.
Gianni Schicchi was one of
three short one-act operas com
posed by Puccini in 1918. He had
been interested in the viability
of such a form for some time.
His contemporaries generally
disapproved of the idea, and
nowadays you tend to hear only
a couple of arias from Koura
Angelica or the famous Bahhino
Mio Carissinio aria from Schic
chi rather than the full perform
ances.
The Stanford production was
happily excellent. After a few
contretemps with their more
sceptical professors in the Music
Department the amateur operat
ics went ahead, staged the opera
with a full university orchestra,
and broke even financially.
First Taste
Best of all, this Gianni Schic
chi gave a considerable quantity
of students their first taste of
opera. It was attractively staged,
beautifully costumed and above
all most entertainingly pre
sented.
Carrick Patterson, who sang
the baritone part of the hero,
is of course a natural clown.
Begged to do so by the avaric
ious relatives of Buoso Donati,
who has just died leaving his
fortune to the friars, Schicchi
gets into the dead man's bed
and awards himself the lot.
