Members of the Community
Concerned about the Vietnam
War will hold a community
meeting today to discuss alter

possible community action for
an end to the war.
Organizers of the meeting say
that those presenting alterna

action will first present their
case and then answer questions
from the floor.
There will be two sessions of
the meeting in Memorial Audi

be discussed at 4:15 and specific
action at 7:30 p.m.
