# Magic Number Is One
## Card Nine Collars Huskies Daily Sports 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Mutt and Jeff led the Stanford
baseball team a big step closer
to the Pacific Eight pennant, as
the Indians swept a double head
er from Washington Saturday.
The victories, reduced to 1 the
magic number for a trip to the
NCAA district playoffs.
Things looked pretty bleak
Friday, when Oregon swept a
pair from USC and rain washed
out the Stanford-Washington
State double header.
But the tired Ducks blew
themselves out of contention the
next day by dropping both
games of a double header.
Poteete's Four Hitter
Mutt, also known as Rod Po
teete, and Jeff, who goes by the
name of Mike Schomaker, pick
ed up right where they left off in
last week's annihilation of Cal.
,The 6-7 Poteete fired a four

hitter for a 7-0 whitewash of the
last place Huskies. He struck
out seven, and again displayed
his precise control by not allow
ing a single walk.
Catcher Schomaker, who
stands 5-9, provided plenty of

offensive support with two dou
bles and a triple.
In the second game, Sandy
Vance, to the great relief of
everyone except opposing hit
ters, demonstrated that his tire
less right arm is healthy again.
Vance stopped the Huskies on
three hits, 3-1. He continued his
strike-out artistry by fanning

eleven in the seven-inning con
test.
The Tribe winds up the con
ference schedule with a home
and-home series against Cal,
here at 3:00 Friday and at 2:00
in Berkeley Saturday. A victory
in either of these games, or a
loss by Oregon, will sew up the
title.
