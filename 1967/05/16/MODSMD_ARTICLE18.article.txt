## The 						Goal Of The Demonstration Houses 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial in last Friday's
Daily states that "education is
the real issue" as concerns
SES's demonstration houses
proposal. The intention of this
statement is to minimize the
importance of any connection
between the proposal and stu
dents' social conduct. Unfortu
nately the rest of the editorial
barely touches on this state
ment, and has the effect of
tying the issues together: "On
the contrary, the establishment
6f decent housing options .. may
well be the beginning of a re
versal in the student attitude
toward social regs . . . etc.
Contrary to almost the en
tire content of a sloppy editori
al, the goal of the demonstra
tion houses is solely to amelior
ate the sorry state of Stanford's
educational process. Its intent
is to end the artificial distinc
tion between a formal educa
tion, on the Quad, and the con
glomerate of everything else
in our lives, everywhere else.
It is not designed with the
expectation that the classroom
will be forced into our dorms
and our private lives It is
hoped that the new houses will
serve to legitimize and enrich
the intellectual content of our
lives, wherever it may naturally
occur, be it in conversation

with the opposite sex, or at the
dinner table, or in the presence
of educators meeting us (and
we them) somewhere besides at
the impersonal and frequently
uncommunicative classroom lec
ture.
The basic problem that the
demonstration houses attempt
to remedy is the fact that arti
ficial distinctions will inevitably
result in artificial or superficial
knowledge (Le., we will never
learn how to tie together what
we learn with how we live).
The fact that we occasionally
talk about books, classes, and
papers — in short, ideas, —
outside of the Quad, indicates
a predilection on our part
against this dichotomy. And for
those who fear, perhaps justi
fiably, a forced over-intellectu
alizaztion of their lives, it should
suffice to point out that the
legitimization and enrichment
mentioned above merely de
scribe a situation intended to
remedy the present one. Our
own natural inclinations to use
our minds probably cannot be
forced against our will. But as
the present condition of uni
versity housing so clearly
proves, these same inclinations
and capabilities can be fettered,
and even without our knowing
so.

• Pure Conjecture?
Editor, The Daily:
In your editorial Friday, "The
Real Issue," you state: "It has
become a well-known fact that
the Board of Trustees does not
share the faculty's and the stu
dent's enthusiasm for this inno
vation (the "Demonstration
Houses") and that its approval
may well be stymied by their
failure to understand fully the
educational benefits of integrat
ed, coeducational housing with
an academic theme."
This is, to my mind, a classic
example of pure conjecture ele
vated to the status of "well
known fact." The Board of Trus
tees has not yet had an oppor
tunity to display "enthusiasm"
(or lack of it) concerning this
proposal; indeed, the proposal
has never been before them. The
Board did approve the Grove
Project without dissent, how
ever, and it did approve the
plans for Moore and Jacks
Houses, which were designed to
achieve precisely those benefits
which you now, three years
later, charge them with failure
to understand.

Re the letter about the Grove

Project in Friday's Daily by
Larry Olson, a senior in political
science from Stern Hall, I am
glad that he concurs with my
views on the matter. In fact he
thinks so nearly the same as I
that his letter was exactly, word
for word, the same as the one
I turned into the Daily on Thurs
day afternoon. It truly warms
my heart to see that all the
Larry Olson's at Stanford feel
exactly the same way about the
Grove Project. Larry Olsons of
the world, unite!

• Who?
Editor, The Daily:
During the course of the aca
demic year and especially dur
ing the past several weeks, it
has become increasingly evident
that the Stanford Daily has a
painful lack of journalistic re
sponsibility. By journalistic re
sponsibility I mean the duty of a
newspaper, especially when it
is the only newspaper serving
a community, to present the
news in a clear, unbiased man
ner. Specifically, all opinion and
interpretation should appear on
the editorial page, or else be
labeled as opinion. Whether in
tentionally or unintentionally,
the Daily has failed to meet this
responsibility.
Near the end of this years'
ASSU presidential campaign
complaints were voiced about
the manner in which the Daily
was presenting campaign cover
age. At that time, because of
the circumstances surrounding
the voicing of those complaints,
the complaints were largely ig
nored. However, it was not too
much to hope that the Daily
would endeavor to improve its
poor standards. Unfortunately,
it hasn't.
Kirk Hanson's front-page ar
ticle on the class-ranking refer
endum (Daily, May 11) makes
this painfully obvious. 59 per
cent of the ballots counted were
in favor of the referendum, 41
per cent were against it. No
more, no less. However, the
article implies, in what can only
be regarded as an insult to the
intelligence of the Stanford com
munity, that the student body is
actually very strongly in favor
of the referendum and that the
41 per cent who voted "no" did
so only because the referendum
was poorly worded. Poorly
worded? The referendum reads:
. . be it resolved that the
University should cease supply
ing for draft boards information
relating to the academic stand
ings of students, such as class
rank or grades." Does Mr. Han
son imply that after two weeks
of debate by LASSU, after the
very determined campaign by
the Anti-Draft Union, after the

number of leaflets and posters
circulated concerning the refer
endum, that after all this the
average Stanford male cannot
understand the meaning of th 1
referendum? Or does he merely
imply that the average Stan
ford male cannot read?
Surely if 589 males took the
trouble to exercise their right
to vote against the referendum
then their 41 per cent should
not be blandly pushed aside and
blamed on "poor wording".
I do not accuse Mr. Hanson
of deliberately attempting to
manipulate public opinion, but
I do accuse the Daily editorial
staff of failing to maintain a
proper standard of objectivity
in its presentation of the news.
Isn't it about time that the
Stanford Daily became a respon
sible member of the academic
community?

More Suggestions for Spring
Spring has arrived; flowers
and the flower children are
blooming. The grass has start
ed to grow and the banana
trees are heavy-laden with
buds. The more industrious
children are cleaning their swim
ming pools with acid. College
seniors are looking forward to
graduation. They are also plan
ning their lives in either the
outside world or graduate
school. It is a time for intro
spection — an evaluation of be
liefs, standards, and that elu
sive beast — reality. To assist
Joel Kugelmass in his self and
environmental appraisal, we
have a few pointers:
Wonder how, in four years
of peaceful, idyllic student exis
tence, one person can become
a bitter megalomaniac.
Find out why, if Stanford stu
dents are mostly admitted on
the basis of high-school activi
ties and personality, you and
your friends were ever admit
ted.
Post "Keep Off the Grass"
signs in and around the Experi
ment.
Determine the feasibility of
trading birch rods for the Po
lice Department's new guns.
Ask your favorite campus
theologican what goes on in
side Mem Chu.
Go to New York to eat lunch
with Jews.
Establish a Rathskellar (beer,
band, lightshow, etc.) on the
third floor of SNUGL (Stanford
New Undergrad Lib.).
Demand that J. Edgar Hoov
er be invited to speak at gradu
ation about traitors and sub
version.
Request that non-student ac
tivists from ADA, SNCC, SDS,
and ADL either register or
leave.
Put a penny in your Happy
Hour fund for every Stanford
student activist, and enjoy a
weekend bender.
When you recover, put in a
penny for every non-student ac
tivist and buy a keg.
When the keg is empty, buy
a case of Alka-Seltzer with pen
nies collected from counting
faculty activists.
Make a cat's cradle with the
cobwebs between your ears.
Get a loan for a haircut be
fore emerging from Stanford's
womb.
Remember, the life you sal
vage may be your own.

This is, to my mind, a classic

has never been before them. The

achieve precisely those benefits

Re the letter about the Grove

Project in Friday's Daily by
Larry Olson, a senior in political
science from Stern Hall, I am
glad that he concurs with my
views on the matter. In fact he
thinks so nearly the same as I
that his letter was exactly, word
for word, the same as the one
I turned into the Daily on Thurs

my heart to see that all the
Larry Olson's at Stanford feel
exactly the same way about the
Grove Project. Larry Olsons of

Editor, The Daily:
During the course of the aca
demic year and especially dur
ing the past several weeks, it
has become increasingly evident
that the Stanford Daily has a
painful lack of journalistic re
sponsibility. By journalistic re
sponsibility I mean the duty of a
newspaper, especially when it
is the only newspaper serving
a community, to present the
news in a clear, unbiased man
ner. Specifically, all opinion and
interpretation should appear on
the editorial page, or else be
labeled as opinion. Whether in
tentionally or unintentionally,
the Daily has failed to meet this
responsibility.
Near the end of this years'
ASSU presidential campaign
complaints were voiced about
the manner in which the Daily
was presenting campaign cover
age. At that time, because of
the circumstances surrounding
the voicing of those complaints,
the complaints were largely ig
nored. However, it was not too
much to hope that the Daily
would endeavor to improve its
poor standards. Unfortunately,
it hasn't.
Kirk Hanson's front-page ar
ticle on the class-ranking refer
endum (Daily, May 11) makes
this painfully obvious. 59 per
cent of the ballots counted were
in favor of the referendum, 41
per cent were against it. No
more, no less. However, the
article implies, in what can only
be regarded as an insult to the
intelligence of the Stanford com
munity, that the student body is
actually very strongly in favor
of the referendum and that the
41 per cent who voted "no" did
so only because the referendum
was poorly worded. Poorly
worded? The referendum reads:
. . be it resolved that the
University should cease supply
ing for draft boards information
relating to the academic stand
ings of students, such as class
rank or grades." Does Mr. Han
son imply that after two weeks
of debate by LASSU, after the
very determined campaign by
the Anti-Draft Union, after the

number of leaflets and posters
circulated concerning the refer
endum, that after all this the
average Stanford male cannot
understand the meaning of th 1
referendum? Or does he merely
imply that the average Stan
ford male cannot read?
Surely if 589 males took the
trouble to exercise their right
to vote against the referendum
then their 41 per cent should
not be blandly pushed aside and
blamed on "poor wording".
I do not accuse Mr. Hanson
of deliberately attempting to
manipulate public opinion, but
I do accuse the Daily editorial
staff of failing to maintain a
proper standard of objectivity
in its presentation of the news.
Isn't it about time that the
Stanford Daily became a respon
sible member of the academic
community?

have a few pointers:
Wonder how, in four years
of peaceful, idyllic student exis

proposal. The intention of this

importance of any connection

tying the issues together: "On

Contrary to almost the en

educational process. Its intent
is to end the artificial distinc

in our lives, everywhere else.
It is not designed with the

hoped that the new houses will
serve to legitimize and enrich
the intellectual content of our

of educators meeting us (and
we them) somewhere besides at

The basic problem that the
demonstration houses attempt
to remedy is the fact that arti

result in artificial or superficial
knowledge (Le., we will never

The fact that we occasionally
talk about books, classes, and
papers — in short, ideas, —
outside of the Quad, indicates
a predilection on our part
against this dichotomy. And for
those who fear, perhaps justi
fiably, a forced over-intellectu
alizaztion of their lives, it should
suffice to point out that the
legitimization and enrichment
mentioned above merely de
scribe a situation intended to
remedy the present one. Our
own natural inclinations to use
our minds probably cannot be

the present condition of uni

the voicing of those complaints,
the complaints were largely ig
nored. However, it was not too
much to hope that the Daily
would endeavor to improve its
poor standards. Unfortunately,
it hasn't.
Kirk Hanson's front-page ar
ticle on the class-ranking refer
endum (Daily, May 11) makes
this painfully obvious. 59 per
cent of the ballots counted were
in favor of the referendum, 41
per cent were against it. No
more, no less. However, the
article implies, in what can only
be regarded as an insult to the
intelligence of the Stanford com
munity, that the student body is
actually very strongly in favor
of the referendum and that the
41 per cent who voted "no" did
so only because the referendum
was poorly worded. Poorly
worded? The referendum reads:
. . be it resolved that the
University should cease supply
ing for draft boards information
relating to the academic stand
ings of students, such as class
rank or grades." Does Mr. Han
son imply that after two weeks
of debate by LASSU, after the
very determined campaign by
the Anti-Draft Union, after the

number of leaflets and posters
circulated concerning the refer
endum, that after all this the
average Stanford male cannot
understand the meaning of th 1
referendum? Or does he merely
imply that the average Stan
ford male cannot read?
Surely if 589 males took the
trouble to exercise their right
to vote against the referendum
then their 41 per cent should
not be blandly pushed aside and
blamed on "poor wording".
I do not accuse Mr. Hanson
of deliberately attempting to
manipulate public opinion, but
I do accuse the Daily editorial
staff of failing to maintain a
proper standard of objectivity
in its presentation of the news.
Isn't it about time that the
Stanford Daily became a respon
sible member of the academic
community?

suffice to point out that the

• Pure Conjecture?
Editor, The Daily:
In your editorial Friday, "The
Real Issue," you state: "It has
become a well-known fact that
the Board of Trustees does not
share the faculty's and the stu
dent's enthusiasm for this inno
vation (the "Demonstration
Houses") and that its approval
may well be stymied by their
failure to understand fully the
educational benefits of integrat
ed, coeducational housing with
an academic theme."
This is, to my mind, a classic
example of pure conjecture ele
vated to the status of "well
known fact." The Board of Trus
tees has not yet had an oppor
tunity to display "enthusiasm"
(or lack of it) concerning this
proposal; indeed, the proposal
has never been before them. The
Board did approve the Grove
Project without dissent, how
ever, and it did approve the
plans for Moore and Jacks
Houses, which were designed to
achieve precisely those benefits
which you now, three years
later, charge them with failure
to understand.

Editor, The Daily:
During the course of the aca

has become increasingly evident
that the Stanford Daily has a
painful lack of journalistic re

sponsibility I mean the duty of a
newspaper, especially when it
is the only newspaper serving
a community, to present the

interpretation should appear on
the editorial page, or else be
labeled as opinion. Whether in
tentionally or unintentionally,
the Daily has failed to meet this

• Pure Conjecture?
Editor, The Daily:
In your editorial Friday, "The
Real Issue," you state: "It has
become a well-known fact that
the Board of Trustees does not
share the faculty's and the stu
dent's enthusiasm for this inno
vation (the "Demonstration
Houses") and that its approval
may well be stymied by their
failure to understand fully the
educational benefits of integrat
ed, coeducational housing with
an academic theme."
This is, to my mind, a classic
example of pure conjecture ele
vated to the status of "well
known fact." The Board of Trus
tees has not yet had an oppor
tunity to display "enthusiasm"
(or lack of it) concerning this
proposal; indeed, the proposal
has never been before them. The
Board did approve the Grove
Project without dissent, how
ever, and it did approve the
plans for Moore and Jacks
Houses, which were designed to
achieve precisely those benefits
which you now, three years
later, charge them with failure
to understand.

Re the letter about the Grove

Project in Friday's Daily by
Larry Olson, a senior in political
science from Stern Hall, I am
glad that he concurs with my
views on the matter. In fact he
thinks so nearly the same as I
that his letter was exactly, word
for word, the same as the one
I turned into the Daily on Thurs
day afternoon. It truly warms
my heart to see that all the
Larry Olson's at Stanford feel
exactly the same way about the
Grove Project. Larry Olsons of

• Who?
Editor, The Daily:
During the course of the aca
demic year and especially dur
ing the past several weeks, it
has become increasingly evident
that the Stanford Daily has a
painful lack of journalistic re
sponsibility. By journalistic re
sponsibility I mean the duty of a
newspaper, especially when it
is the only newspaper serving
a community, to present the
news in a clear, unbiased man
ner. Specifically, all opinion and
interpretation should appear on
the editorial page, or else be
labeled as opinion. Whether in
tentionally or unintentionally,
the Daily has failed to meet this
responsibility.
Near the end of this years'
ASSU presidential campaign
complaints were voiced about
the manner in which the Daily
was presenting campaign cover
age. At that time, because of
the circumstances surrounding
the voicing of those complaints,
the complaints were largely ig
nored. However, it was not too
much to hope that the Daily
would endeavor to improve its
poor standards. Unfortunately,
it hasn't.
Kirk Hanson's front-page ar
ticle on the class-ranking refer
endum (Daily, May 11) makes
this painfully obvious. 59 per
cent of the ballots counted were
in favor of the referendum, 41
per cent were against it. No
more, no less. However, the
article implies, in what can only
be regarded as an insult to the
intelligence of the Stanford com
munity, that the student body is
actually very strongly in favor
of the referendum and that the
41 per cent who voted "no" did
so only because the referendum
was poorly worded. Poorly
worded? The referendum reads:
. . be it resolved that the
University should cease supply
ing for draft boards information
relating to the academic stand
ings of students, such as class
rank or grades." Does Mr. Han
son imply that after two weeks
of debate by LASSU, after the
very determined campaign by
the Anti-Draft Union, after the

number of leaflets and posters
circulated concerning the refer
endum, that after all this the
average Stanford male cannot
understand the meaning of th 1
referendum? Or does he merely
imply that the average Stan
ford male cannot read?
Surely if 589 males took the
trouble to exercise their right
to vote against the referendum
then their 41 per cent should
not be blandly pushed aside and
blamed on "poor wording".
I do not accuse Mr. Hanson
of deliberately attempting to
manipulate public opinion, but
I do accuse the Daily editorial
staff of failing to maintain a
proper standard of objectivity
in its presentation of the news.
Isn't it about time that the
Stanford Daily became a respon
sible member of the academic
community?

dinner table, or in the presence
of educators meeting us (and
we them) somewhere besides at
the impersonal and frequently
uncommunicative classroom lec
ture.
The basic problem that the
demonstration houses attempt
to remedy is the fact that arti
ficial distinctions will inevitably
result in artificial or superficial
knowledge (Le., we will never
learn how to tie together what
we learn with how we live).
The fact that we occasionally
talk about books, classes, and
papers — in short, ideas, —
outside of the Quad, indicates
a predilection on our part
against this dichotomy. And for
those who fear, perhaps justi
fiably, a forced over-intellectu
alizaztion of their lives, it should
suffice to point out that the
legitimization and enrichment
mentioned above merely de
scribe a situation intended to
remedy the present one. Our
own natural inclinations to use
our minds probably cannot be
forced against our will. But as
the present condition of uni
versity housing so clearly
proves, these same inclinations
and capabilities can be fettered,
and even without our knowing
so.

• Pure Conjecture?
Editor, The Daily:
In your editorial Friday, "The
Real Issue," you state: "It has
become a well-known fact that
the Board of Trustees does not
share the faculty's and the stu
dent's enthusiasm for this inno
vation (the "Demonstration
Houses") and that its approval
may well be stymied by their
failure to understand fully the
educational benefits of integrat
ed, coeducational housing with
an academic theme."
This is, to my mind, a classic
example of pure conjecture ele
vated to the status of "well
known fact." The Board of Trus
tees has not yet had an oppor
tunity to display "enthusiasm"
(or lack of it) concerning this
proposal; indeed, the proposal
has never been before them. The
Board did approve the Grove
Project without dissent, how
ever, and it did approve the
plans for Moore and Jacks
Houses, which were designed to
achieve precisely those benefits
which you now, three years
later, charge them with failure
to understand.

• What A Coincidence!
Editor, The Daily:
Re the letter about the Grove

Project in Friday's Daily by
Larry Olson, a senior in political
science from Stern Hall, I am
glad that he concurs with my
views on the matter. In fact he
thinks so nearly the same as I
that his letter was exactly, word
for word, the same as the one
I turned into the Daily on Thurs
day afternoon. It truly warms
my heart to see that all the
Larry Olson's at Stanford feel
exactly the same way about the
Grove Project. Larry Olsons of
the world, unite!

Editor, The Daily:
My congratulations to the
Stanford Student Opera Guild
on an excellent production of
Gianni Schicchi. Those who
missed this opera missed a truly
first rate performance by both
the cast and orchestra.

• Who?
Editor, The Daily:
During the course of the aca
demic year and especially dur
ing the past several weeks, it
has become increasingly evident
that the Stanford Daily has a
painful lack of journalistic re
sponsibility. By journalistic re
sponsibility I mean the duty of a
newspaper, especially when it
is the only newspaper serving
a community, to present the
news in a clear, unbiased man
ner. Specifically, all opinion and
interpretation should appear on
the editorial page, or else be
labeled as opinion. Whether in
tentionally or unintentionally,
the Daily has failed to meet this
responsibility.
Near the end of this years'
ASSU presidential campaign
complaints were voiced about
the manner in which the Daily
was presenting campaign cover
age. At that time, because of
the circumstances surrounding
the voicing of those complaints,
the complaints were largely ig
nored. However, it was not too
much to hope that the Daily
would endeavor to improve its
poor standards. Unfortunately,
it hasn't.
Kirk Hanson's front-page ar
ticle on the class-ranking refer
endum (Daily, May 11) makes
this painfully obvious. 59 per
cent of the ballots counted were
in favor of the referendum, 41
per cent were against it. No
more, no less. However, the
article implies, in what can only
be regarded as an insult to the
intelligence of the Stanford com
munity, that the student body is
actually very strongly in favor
of the referendum and that the
41 per cent who voted "no" did
so only because the referendum
was poorly worded. Poorly
worded? The referendum reads:
. . be it resolved that the
University should cease supply
ing for draft boards information
relating to the academic stand
ings of students, such as class
rank or grades." Does Mr. Han
son imply that after two weeks
of debate by LASSU, after the
very determined campaign by
the Anti-Draft Union, after the

number of leaflets and posters
circulated concerning the refer
endum, that after all this the
average Stanford male cannot
understand the meaning of th 1
referendum? Or does he merely
imply that the average Stan
ford male cannot read?
Surely if 589 males took the
trouble to exercise their right
to vote against the referendum
then their 41 per cent should
not be blandly pushed aside and
blamed on "poor wording".
I do not accuse Mr. Hanson
of deliberately attempting to
manipulate public opinion, but
I do accuse the Daily editorial
staff of failing to maintain a
proper standard of objectivity
in its presentation of the news.
Isn't it about time that the
Stanford Daily became a respon
sible member of the academic
community?

Editor, The Daily:
More Suggestions for Spring
Spring has arrived; flowers
and the flower children are
blooming. The grass has start
ed to grow and the banana
trees are heavy-laden with
buds. The more industrious
children are cleaning their swim
ming pools with acid. College
seniors are looking forward to
graduation. They are also plan
ning their lives in either the
outside world or graduate
school. It is a time for intro
spection — an evaluation of be
liefs, standards, and that elu
sive beast — reality. To assist
Joel Kugelmass in his self and
environmental appraisal, we
have a few pointers:
Wonder how, in four years
of peaceful, idyllic student exis
tence, one person can become
a bitter megalomaniac.
Find out why, if Stanford stu
dents are mostly admitted on
the basis of high-school activi
ties and personality, you and
your friends were ever admit
ted.
Post "Keep Off the Grass"
signs in and around the Experi
ment.
Determine the feasibility of
trading birch rods for the Po
lice Department's new guns.
Ask your favorite campus
theologican what goes on in
side Mem Chu.
Go to New York to eat lunch
with Jews.
Establish a Rathskellar (beer,
band, lightshow, etc.) on the
third floor of SNUGL (Stanford
New Undergrad Lib.).
Demand that J. Edgar Hoov
er be invited to speak at gradu
ation about traitors and sub
version.
Request that non-student ac
tivists from ADA, SNCC, SDS,
and ADL either register or
leave.
Put a penny in your Happy
Hour fund for every Stanford
student activist, and enjoy a
weekend bender.
When you recover, put in a
penny for every non-student ac
tivist and buy a keg.
When the keg is empty, buy
a case of Alka-Seltzer with pen
nies collected from counting
faculty activists.
Make a cat's cradle with the
cobwebs between your ears.
Get a loan for a haircut be
fore emerging from Stanford's
womb.
Remember, the life you sal
vage may be your own.
