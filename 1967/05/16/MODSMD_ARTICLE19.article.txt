## Morality And Professor Newleft: Treason, 'Peacemonger Lies'? 
### Fritz Schaefer 
Despite recent efforts by some
to stamp out the Berkeley im
age, Professor Newleft and his
entourage of anti-Americans
continue to unashamedly rear
their ugly heads. Prof. Newleft
has been especially busy lately
waiting letters to The Daily. In
one letter he pats himself on
the back for enduring so gallant
ly the hardships that his out
spoken views on the War in
Vietnam have brought upon
him. Next he congratulates the
160 traitors who turn their
backs on their military obliga
tion while 500,000 of the men of
our generation risk their lives
in Vietnam for freedom.
Professor Newleft writes in to
say that all teachers should
spend one-third of their class
time explaining to their students
the "evils" of the war in Viet
h'£m. He continues to whine
about the "military-industrial
complex at Stanford." And he
makes up lists of questions
which he seems to think are un
answerable by Americans and
the United States Government.
But mostly, Prof. Newleft just
wails and wails about the "im
moral" war in Vietnam.
I for one am sick and tired
of this talk of the war in Viet
nam being "immoral." The peo
ple who make this charge don't
bother to tell us what morality

they're referring to—they just
assume that we're aware of
their moral superiority. I am
not.
Peace Monger Lies?
The morality of our JUdeo-
Christian heritage says that to
lie is immoral. And yet those
who call our country immoral
have spewed forth one lie after
the next, starting by saying that
the war in Vietnam was an in
ternal struggle (exposed by the
State Department's white paper
of February, 1965) and going
all the way to the "baby-burn
ing" myth (exposed recently by
Dr. Howard A. Rusk of the New
York Times).
When lie after peace monger
lie is revealed, what reason is
there to believe anything that
these people say?
Morality appears to be one of
the weak points of the New Left.
In answer to some of Prof.
Newleft's questions, it is well
known that South Vietnam is
not the world's model for democ
racy and Premier Ky is not a
spotless paragon of virtue. But
this realization does not immedi
ately lead one to the conclusion
that the United States should
pull out its troops and let Ho
Chi Minh with his Soviet and
Chinese-supplied weapons
march into Saigon and set up

another totalitarian Communist
state.
The important point here is
that the Saigon government is
now taking concrete steps to
bring about a democratic form
of government. The very fact
that there is disagreement in
Saigon, for example, between
members of the Constituent As
sembly and Premier Ky, points
to a healthy future. Dissent
doesn't even exist in North Viet
nam—and it's not because all
the people worship Ho Chi Minh.
A strong and free South Viet
nam is a goal worthy of the sup
port of the American people.
Of course, a substantial num
ber of Professor Newleft's ques
tions reflect his pacifist nature
and reluctance to recognize that
the war in Vietnam is of a more
serious character than a game
of tiddlywinks. If I were a Ma
rine, I wouldn't feel terribly sor
ry when the Viet Cong or North
Vietnamese regular, who was
one half mile away and trying
to kill me, had a load of napalm
dumped on him.
American men—stand up and
be counted. If 500,000 guys our
age are over in Vietnam risking
their lives for freedom every
day, the least we at Stanford
can do is stand up and tell Prof.
Newleft and his devotees where
to get off.
