# 'Tribe' Gathers To Share
## 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
Last Sunday, Mother's Day, the
Palo Alto community was witness to
its first Flower Festival. The festival
was designed along the lines of the
famed San Francisco Be-In, as a gath
ering of the "tribe" in the Palo Alto
area, attracting over 500 people.
As a preliminary to the Flower
Festival a small group of 30 adults
and twenty children formed a model
community and attempted to live to
gether from Friday afternoon until
the festival Sunday.
The community was the direct re
sult of a seminar in the practical prob
lems of organizing a community,
given by the Free University of Palo
Alto, co-sponsor of the Flower Festi
val with the Experiment. According
to one participant, the experiment was
a success and laid the groundwork for
the establishment of a permanent
community in the near future.
Presently the Free University is
contracting for a house in the Palo
Alto area to establish a residence uni
versity. Currently classes are taught
mostly in private homes.
All Ages There
The call for a gathering of the
tribes in the area was well received
by the community residents. Though
most of the participants were under
twenty, there were large contingents
from each age group. Hampered at

first by a soccer game, the festival
later provided an opportunity for a
picnic lunch, stimulating conversation,
sun-bathing, or dancing to the sounds
of three folk-rock bands.
The purpose of the Flower Festival
in Palo Alto was to draw the com
munity closer together and provide
a sense of unity to the tribeâ€”a unity
that the San Francisco Be-In was un
able to give because of its enormous
size, estimated at 50,000. The festival
sought to fulfill this purpose by allow
ing members of the community to re
new and extend friendships.
Shared Watermelon
The theme of the gathering was the
concept of sharing. Because of the
extremely hot weather popular items
were watermelons, soft drinks, and
ice cream. Also prevalent were a large
variety of flowers.
The idea was that the performance
of some ritual, such as sharing, would
create an initial bond that would
allow people to begin new friendships.
It gave the festival a very warm and
friendly atmosphere, and allowed peo
ple to readily participate in the group
and its activities.
Those who danced, for example, to
the Fillmore and Avalon type bands
were uninhibited by traditional cus
toms and rules of social etiquette.
The Flower Festival allowed people

to express themselves as freely as
they desired with reference to social
standards, for the idea of sharing lent
itself to the idea of mutual tolerance,
the sharing of freedom.
To those who had questioned the
strength of the "hippie" movement
in this area, the Flower Festival was
a definite assertion of the power and
the unity of this area's tribal com
munity.
It appears that the movement, rath
er than losing appeal, is just begin
ning to gain its full strength. With
the establishment of the Free Uni
versity of Palo Alto and the possible
formation of a permanent living
group, the tribe has found a perman
ent base of operation.
The Festival provided an opportun
ity for increased communication be
tween the community and the "hip
pies", two groups that before Sunday
were often thought of as mutually
exclusive and lacking any ability to
work with each other. Sunday may
have changed many opinions.
