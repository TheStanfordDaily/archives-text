# Rumors Spread But Police Report No Clues In Case Of Missing Axe
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
For the seventh time in its 68 year
history the Stanford Axe has illegally
changed hands. According to the Stan
ford Police Department, the Axe was
removed from its display case in Tres
idder Union at 6:05 a.m. Friday morn
ing.
It has not been seen since.
Immediate campus reaction was var
ied, but those students who cared at
all tended to blame Cal for the theft.
Indications are, however, that Cal was
neither responsible nor involved.
According to the Police Department,
the wooden frame covering the dis
play case was removed allowing the
culprit to open the ease? without break
ing the glass. The case is protected by
an alarm which rings in the fire house,
but the frame is not. The frime is at

tached to the case by soft bolts which
are cut off after being inserted, and
must be bored out for removal.
The intimate knowledge of the work
ings of the case, the apparent cool
ness of the thief, and the inability to
come up with any leads has caused
many Stanfordites to surmise that the
theft was an inside job.
Mike Collins, ASSU President, told
the Daily, "I once planned to steal the
Axe myself. I came up with a plan so
foolproof that I didn't bother. The
method used is almost identical with
my plan. A working knowledge of the
case was a must."
The alternative to the theft being an
inside job is that a third party did the
deed. Many students hope that such
is the case. James Briscoe told the
Daily, "I hope an outsider did it and
we never see the thing again."
Incredible Attack
Some students did not care who did
it, but were visibly upset that the Axe
was gone. Bill Stone, ASSU Vice-
President, said, "This attack would be

inadmissable in any civilized society;
within a university it is incredible."
Terry Murphy, ASSU Student Fi
nancial Manager, said, "Fantastic!
Now we won't have to pay the insur
ance on the thing." One unidentified
student remarked, "I'm glad Cal's got
it. Let them worry about protecting
it."
University officialdom was silent
about the incident. Dean Smith had
said "no comment," and President
Sterling was unavailable. Mr. Glover,
Assistant to President Sterling said,
"No comments on the Axe story will
be given out today." Part of the
Administration's reluctance to com
ment may be the result of an agree
ment between Stanford and Cal which
makes the Axe an official Big Game
Trophy and provides for the suspen
sion of any student who attempts to
steal it.
No Clues
At the moment prospects for re
covering the Axe do not appear bright.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Of
fice have uncovered no clues as to the
identity of the thief. The Immortal 21
have long since departed. Soto House,

this year's active traditionalists have
no idea where to start.
All trails lead nowhere, but those
students who are truly concerned
about the fate of the Axe are still
hopeful. Bill Stone commented, "The
only thing we have that's anything
like the Immortal 21 those days is
probably the Committee of 15. Per
haps this is their big chance for im
mortality."
In any event the Axe is gone. In the
past it has always been located before
Big Game. "It's a long, long time from
now 'til November."

Mike Collins, ASSU President, told
the Daily, "I once planned to steal the
Axe myself. I came up with a plan so
foolproof that I didn't bother. The
method used is almost identical with
my plan. A working knowledge of the
case was a must."
The alternative to the theft being an
inside job is that a third party did the
deed. Many students hope that such
is the case. James Briscoe told the
Daily, "I hope an outsider did it and
we never see the thing again."
Incredible Attack
Some students did not care who did
it, but were visibly upset that the Axe
was gone. Bill Stone, ASSU Vice-
President, said, "This attack would be

inadmissable in any civilized society;
within a university it is incredible."
Terry Murphy, ASSU Student Fi
nancial Manager, said, "Fantastic!
Now we won't have to pay the insur
ance on the thing." One unidentified
student remarked, "I'm glad Cal's got
it. Let them worry about protecting
it."
University officialdom was silent
about the incident. Dean Smith had
said "no comment," and President
Sterling was unavailable. Mr. Glover,
Assistant to President Sterling said,
"No comments on the Axe story will
be given out today." Part of the
Administration's reluctance to com
ment may be the result of an agree
ment between Stanford and Cal which
makes the Axe an official Big Game
Trophy and provides for the suspen
sion of any student who attempts to
steal it.
No Clues
At the moment prospects for re
covering the Axe do not appear bright.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Of
fice have uncovered no clues as to the
identity of the thief. The Immortal 21
have long since departed. Soto House,

this year's active traditionalists have
no idea where to start.
All trails lead nowhere, but those
students who are truly concerned
about the fate of the Axe are still
hopeful. Bill Stone commented, "The
only thing we have that's anything
like the Immortal 21 those days is
probably the Committee of 15. Per
haps this is their big chance for im
mortality."
In any event the Axe is gone. In the
past it has always been located before
Big Game. "It's a long, long time from
now 'til November."
For the seventh time in its 68 year
history the Stanford Axe has illegally
changed hands. According to the Stan
ford Police Department, the Axe was
removed from its display case in Tres
idder Union at 6:05 a.m. Friday morn
ing.
It has not been seen since.
Immediate campus reaction was var
ied, but those students who cared at
all tended to blame Cal for the theft.
Indications are, however, that Cal was
neither responsible nor involved.
According to the Police Department,
the wooden frame covering the dis
play case was removed allowing the
culprit to open the ease? without break
ing the glass. The case is protected by
an alarm which rings in the fire house,
but the frame is not. The frime is at

tached to the case by soft bolts which
are cut off after being inserted, and
must be bored out for removal.
The intimate knowledge of the work
ings of the case, the apparent cool
ness of the thief, and the inability to
come up with any leads has caused
many Stanfordites to surmise that the
theft was an inside job.
