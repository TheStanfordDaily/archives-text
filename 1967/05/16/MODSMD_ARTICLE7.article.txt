# Coeducational Co-op To Combine Living, Community Work Project
## 
### 
A small coeducational cooperative
will be established next year in East
Palo Alto for eight Stanford students.
The project, sponsored by the East
Palo Alto Community House, the
United Campus Christian Ministry,
and the Dean of the Chapel, will com
bine cooperative living and commu
nity social involvement.
The four men and four women in
the co-op will be asked to work about
ten hours a week on East Palo Alto

community projects. They will par
ticipate in a seminar led by Dr. Ken
Pruitt, associate professor of Politi
cal Science at the University of Chi
cago.
Resident Professor
Pruitt and his wife will live with
the eight students while he completes
a study of San Francisco Bay area
city governments. They have spent
the last year and a half in Africa.
The project will be set up this sum

mcr, and the students accepted for
participation will be urged to take
part in the two week summer camps
run by the Community House in July
and August. Those who take part in
the summer service program will be
able to orient the remaining students
to the community in the fall.
According to Andy Horowitz, a
junior who has lived in East Palo
Alto this year and has been working
with the Community House, the co
op will seek to incorporate the stu
dents into the community mind and
will explore the question: what role
can the white man play in the Ne
gro Community?
Troopers Not Leaders
Horowitz says the project should
lead the students to "experience the
frustration of being a trooper and
not a leader." He claims "this is alien
to our experience at Stanford where
we are taught to be a leader in our
middle class communities." Horowitz
criticizcs the view that "East Palo
Alto is a test tube for Stanford stu
dents to play in."
No definite location for the co-op
has yet been chosen, but the spon
sors are planning two adjacent
houses. The details of cooperative
living are to be worked out by the
students selected. Current plans call
for the co-op to operate until June of
1968.
The seminar will center on the
particular involvements of the stu
dents in East Palo Alto and will
also concern the changing Church in
the East Palo Alto community.
Applications are being taken now
for the project and are due tomor
row afternoon. Forms are available
in the lICCM office in the clubhouse,
with interviews being held tomorrow
and Thursday. UCCM minister Stuart
McLean has additional information
All graduate students, undergraduate
men, and ungraduate women eligible
for OFF may apply.

will explore the question: what role
can the white man play in the Ne
gro Community?
Troopers Not Leaders
Horowitz says the project should
lead the students to "experience the
frustration of being a trooper and
not a leader." He claims "this is alien
to our experience at Stanford where
we are taught to be a leader in our
middle class communities." Horowitz
criticizcs the view that "East Palo
Alto is a test tube for Stanford stu
dents to play in."
No definite location for the co-op
has yet been chosen, but the spon
sors are planning two adjacent
houses. The details of cooperative
living are to be worked out by the
students selected. Current plans call
for the co-op to operate until June of
1968.
The seminar will center on the
particular involvements of the stu
dents in East Palo Alto and will
also concern the changing Church in
the East Palo Alto community.
Applications are being taken now
for the project and are due tomor
row afternoon. Forms are available
in the lICCM office in the clubhouse,
with interviews being held tomorrow
and Thursday. UCCM minister Stuart
McLean has additional information
All graduate students, undergraduate
men, and ungraduate women eligible

A small coeducational cooperative
will be established next year in East
Palo Alto for eight Stanford students.
The project, sponsored by the East
Palo Alto Community House, the
United Campus Christian Ministry,
and the Dean of the Chapel, will com
bine cooperative living and commu
nity social involvement.
The four men and four women in
the co-op will be asked to work about
ten hours a week on East Palo Alto

community projects. They will par
ticipate in a seminar led by Dr. Ken
Pruitt, associate professor of Politi
cal Science at the University of Chi
cago.
Resident Professor
Pruitt and his wife will live with
the eight students while he completes
a study of San Francisco Bay area
city governments. They have spent
the last year and a half in Africa.
The project will be set up this sum

mcr, and the students accepted for
participation will be urged to take
part in the two week summer camps
run by the Community House in July
and August. Those who take part in
the summer service program will be
able to orient the remaining students
to the community in the fall.
According to Andy Horowitz, a
junior who has lived in East Palo
Alto this year and has been working
with the Community House, the co
op will seek to incorporate the stu
dents into the community mind and
will explore the question: what role
can the white man play in the Ne
gro Community?
