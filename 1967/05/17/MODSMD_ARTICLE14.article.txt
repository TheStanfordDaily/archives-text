# International Studies Expands
## 
### 
The Ford Foundation has
Riven Stanford a $6 million five
year grant to expand its pro
gram of international studies.
Almost half of the grant ($2.4
million) will be used as partial
endowment for six professor
ships The appointments will be
designed to increase significant
ly the quality of the University's
programs with the guidance and
strength of senior men in Latin
American history, development
economics, European economic
history, the politics of China,
trans-national legal studies, and
population studies. The Uni
versity will seek additional pri
vate support for funding of
$700,000 for each chair.
The recently established Cen

ter for Research in International
Studies will receive another $2
million. These funds will be
used to support current research
and stimulate and develop new
ideas. According to Professor
Carl Spaeth, chairman of the
Committee on International Stu
dies, the new research projects
will focus on comparative de
velopment and social change.
The research will be in this di
rection because "national devel
opment—social, political, and
economic—has emerged as the
central problem of international
studies and is a central interest
in the University," explained
Professor Spaeth.
The remainder of the grant
will be disbursed as follows:
$700,000 will support expanded
library acquisitions, $500,000 will
be used for fellowships, $300,000
will permit additional faculty
support, and $100,000 will be
used for flexible program sup
port.
The grant is the result of care
ful evaluation and development
of priorities by a committee of
senior faculty members who
have sifted through scores of
requests and recommendations
for the past two years. Most
faculty members involved in the
committee are directors of var
ious international programs at
Stanford. These include com
mittees on East Asian, Latin

American, Western European,
Russian and African Studies.
Professor Spaeth expressed
the hope that the grant will help
"prepare our students to under
stand and cope with this world."
This is necessary, he continues,
"because as the world becomes
smaller, its problems appear to
be more complex. Over half of
Stanford's students study at one
of the eight overseas programs
causing Professor Spaeth to
note that "our students are in
creasingly alive to the possi
bilities of a broader world, and
consequently make much great
er demands on the University's
resources." The Ford Founda
tion will be a help in meeting
those demands.
Stanford's major efforts in in
ternational studies have been
going on long before this latest
grant. Since 1901, University ex
penditures have nearly tripled,
rising from $2.(3 million to more
than $7.3 million annually. With
the aid of earlier Ford Founda
tion grants, the University has
raised its total number of pro
fessors with a significant inter
est in international studies from
30 to 70.
Stanford's interest in interna
tional studies has been met with
International interest in Stan
ford. In the past decade, the
number of foreign students at
Stanford has risen from 300 to
more than 900.

those demands.
Stanford's major efforts in in
ternational studies have been
going on long before this latest
grant. Since 1901, University ex
penditures have nearly tripled,
rising from $2.(3 million to more
than $7.3 million annually. With
the aid of earlier Ford Founda
tion grants, the University has
raised its total number of pro
fessors with a significant inter
est in international studies from
30 to 70.
Stanford's interest in interna
tional studies has been met with
International interest in Stan
ford. In the past decade, the
number of foreign students at
Stanford has risen from 300 to
more than 900.
The Ford Foundation has
Riven Stanford a $6 million five
year grant to expand its pro
gram of international studies.
Almost half of the grant ($2.4
million) will be used as partial
endowment for six professor
ships The appointments will be
designed to increase significant
ly the quality of the University's
programs with the guidance and
strength of senior men in Latin
American history, development
economics, European economic
history, the politics of China,
trans-national legal studies, and
population studies. The Uni
versity will seek additional pri
vate support for funding of
$700,000 for each chair.
The recently established Cen

ter for Research in International
Studies will receive another $2
million. These funds will be
used to support current research
and stimulate and develop new
ideas. According to Professor
Carl Spaeth, chairman of the
Committee on International Stu
dies, the new research projects
will focus on comparative de
velopment and social change.
The research will be in this di
rection because "national devel
opment—social, political, and
economic—has emerged as the
central problem of international
studies and is a central interest
in the University," explained
Professor Spaeth.
The remainder of the grant
will be disbursed as follows:
$700,000 will support expanded
library acquisitions, $500,000 will
be used for fellowships, $300,000
will permit additional faculty
support, and $100,000 will be
used for flexible program sup
port.
The grant is the result of care
ful evaluation and development
of priorities by a committee of
senior faculty members who
have sifted through scores of
requests and recommendations
for the past two years. Most
faculty members involved in the
committee are directors of var
ious international programs at
Stanford. These include com
mittees on East Asian, Latin

American, Western European,
Russian and African Studies.
Professor Spaeth expressed
the hope that the grant will help
"prepare our students to under
stand and cope with this world."
This is necessary, he continues,
"because as the world becomes
smaller, its problems appear to
be more complex. Over half of
Stanford's students study at one
of the eight overseas programs
causing Professor Spaeth to
note that "our students are in
creasingly alive to the possi
bilities of a broader world, and
consequently make much great
er demands on the University's
resources." The Ford Founda
tion will be a help in meeting
those demands.
