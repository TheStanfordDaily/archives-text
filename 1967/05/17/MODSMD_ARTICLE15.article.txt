# Disunity At Free University?
## 
### GEORGIA KELLY PAUL BUNDY ROBB CRIST 
The Free University of Palo
Alto is truly like the Holy
Roman Empire. Neither Holy,
Roman, Free, nor a University.
This became apparent at a meet
ing a week ago at the Co-op
Building where major decisions
were definitively decided.
A vestige of former times, the
Free University still defines it
self: "Bound to existing power
structure and handicapped by
modes of thought fostered by
big business, by the military
establishment, by consensus pol
itics, and by the mass media, it
(the American educational sys
tem) is unable to consider freely
and objectively the cultural, eco
nomic and political forces so
rapidly transforming the mod
ern world .... A revolution
in American education is re
quired to meet today's needs and
a new type of university— a
free university—must provide
the impetus for change. "
A motion made at the meeting
that the name be changed from
the "Free" University to the
"Open" University would best
characterize what became evi
dent Sunday. Though this mo
tion was voted down by a large
majority, other motions which
were passed seem to support the
appropriateness of the sug
gested change, e.g., an open cur
riculum which might include
Nazis, John Birchers, Psycho
paths, etc.
Experimental
The Free University decided
to subsidize an "experiment in
communal living" but rejected
a proposal to come out mono
lithically in favor of poly-sexual
ahd poly-pervert free sex experi
ments to provide the backbone
of the community. Vic Lovell,
newly elected coordinator, com
mented that it would be wrong
tft impose this vision on others
'Mf it wasn't their thing."
' A majority voted for the pos
sibility of a political stand but
added enough amendments to
insure the decision's emptiness.
No action was taken as to
whether the "Free" University
as a body would take political
stands on such things as the In
ternational War Crimes Tri
bunal, the Anti-Draft Union, the
recent coup in Greece, etc., and
3 specific motion to give $150.00
to the Anti-Draft Union was re
jected though $100.00 had al
ready been loaned for a "Mo
ther's Day Be-In."
The main issues seemed to re
volve around the majority's total
lack of understanding of the
Present as History, the dialect
ics of Freedom and Liberty.
Freedom was conceived of in a
wholly procedural way and thus
suggestions by some of the
membership that stands be
taken on issues involving sub
stantive freedom were consist
ently avoided. At a time when
fomc felt American Radicals
.■should dedicate themselves to
fighting American Imperialism,
freedom's chief enemy in the
contemporary world, the major
ity could only reiterate plati
tudes on the preeminence of
"the dark night of the soul."
The majority's response to the
demands to support substantive
.issues was a legally incorpor
ated "experiment in communal
living" free of the onerous re

quirements of necessary labour.
Since the political minority
thought that the Free University
should be more than a com
munal womb for some of its
more insecure members, they
withdrew from the organization.
Some observers seem to in
terpret the internal struggle in
the "Free" University as more
a matter of personalities than
principles. In fact, one disen
chanted member was heard mut
tering as he left that coordin
ator "Vic Lovell is little more
than the political arm of Robb
Crist," Stanford's aging guru.

A week ago, at the conclusion
of a marathon five hour general
meeting of the Free University
of Palo Alto, a small group of
perhaps a dozen people, mostly
of a Marxist-Maoist political per
suasion, announced their with
drawal from the organization.
Two of the dissidents, Anatole
Anton and A. also
said that they were withdrawing
their course, "The Theory of
Political Struggle", from the
Free U. It might be more accur
ate, however, to say that they
were withdrawing from their
course, since if the students re
quest it, the Free U. will prob
ably find someone else to teach
the course.
This then is the most recent
result of what is alleged to be
a struggle between hippies and
political radicals for control of
the Free U. However, to regard
the situation in this way, i.e., as
hippies versus radicals, is to
completely misunderstand what
has been going on.
The real situation is this: a
very small group of ultra-leftist

political fanatics, people who for
the most part have been unable
to get along in any organization
they have ever been in, are sim
ply using the influx of new mem
bers in the Free U. to excuse
away their own political and so
cial ineptitude. They want to
justify themselves and so they
say, "The Free U. has changed.
Once it was a force for radical
political action. Now, however,
it has fallen into the hands of
psychedelically entranced hip
pies who prefer Be-ins to Sit-ins,
etc."
Still Political
But in fact there were and still
are a great many politically ac
tive people in the Free U., peo
ple who are willing to partici
pate in political protest but who
wish to use their own judgment
as to the activities in which they
decide to become involved. Thus,
for example, the newly elected
Coordinator, Vic Lovell, as well
as the two Assistant Coordinat
ors, Kathy Kirby and Sotere
Terregian, have endorsed the
view that the Free U. take polit
ical stands, and at the last meet
ing the group voted to help
raise funds for the Anti-Draft
Union. It was, in fact, one of
the so-called hippies that origin
ally invited Anatole Anton to
teach his course on political
struggle.
There is always a danger that
political activism may become
a real cop-out, a way of avoid
ing looking at oneself. Thus the
cry, "Don't you know people are
dying in Vietnam" may become
a way of distracting attention
from the real personal responsi
bility of treating fairly the peo
ple right here in Palo Alto. We
have a certain responsibility for
what our country does, but a
great deal more responsibility
for what we ourselves do in our
everyday dealings with one an
other. It is highly unlikely we
can succeed in doing anything
about the war in Vietnam if we
can't even stop our warring fac
tionalism in Palo Alto.
There is room in the Free U.
for many kinds of activity and
political persuasion. As it says
in the preamble, "The doors of
the Free U. are open to all. . ."
Those doors are still open.

Divisions within the Free Uni
versity of Palo Alto came to a
head recently in the process of
electing a new coordinator. The
following articles were written
by two participants in the con
flict. They represent, as is read
ily apparent, decidedly different
points of view neither of which
should be attributed to The
Daily.

withdrew from the organization.
Some observers seem to in
terpret the internal struggle in
the "Free" University as more
a matter of personalities than
principles. In fact, one disen
chanted member was heard mut
tering as he left that coordin
ator "Vic Lovell is little more
than the political arm of Robb
Crist," Stanford's aging guru.

A week ago, at the conclusion
of a marathon five hour general
meeting of the Free University
of Palo Alto, a small group of
perhaps a dozen people, mostly
of a Marxist-Maoist political per
suasion, announced their with
drawal from the organization.
Two of the dissidents, Anatole
Anton and A. also
said that they were withdrawing
their course, "The Theory of
Political Struggle", from the
Free U. It might be more accur
ate, however, to say that they
were withdrawing from their
course, since if the students re
quest it, the Free U. will prob
ably find someone else to teach
the course.
This then is the most recent
result of what is alleged to be
a struggle between hippies and
political radicals for control of
the Free U. However, to regard
the situation in this way, i.e., as
hippies versus radicals, is to
completely misunderstand what
has been going on.
The real situation is this: a
very small group of ultra-leftist

political fanatics, people who for
the most part have been unable
to get along in any organization
they have ever been in, are sim
ply using the influx of new mem
bers in the Free U. to excuse
away their own political and so
cial ineptitude. They want to
justify themselves and so they
say, "The Free U. has changed.
Once it was a force for radical
political action. Now, however,
it has fallen into the hands of
psychedelically entranced hip
pies who prefer Be-ins to Sit-ins,
etc."
Still Political
But in fact there were and still
are a great many politically ac
tive people in the Free U., peo
ple who are willing to partici
pate in political protest but who
wish to use their own judgment
as to the activities in which they
decide to become involved. Thus,
for example, the newly elected
Coordinator, Vic Lovell, as well
as the two Assistant Coordinat
ors, Kathy Kirby and Sotere
Terregian, have endorsed the
view that the Free U. take polit
ical stands, and at the last meet
ing the group voted to help
raise funds for the Anti-Draft
Union. It was, in fact, one of
the so-called hippies that origin
ally invited Anatole Anton to
teach his course on political
struggle.
There is always a danger that
political activism may become
a real cop-out, a way of avoid
ing looking at oneself. Thus the
cry, "Don't you know people are
dying in Vietnam" may become
a way of distracting attention
from the real personal responsi
bility of treating fairly the peo
ple right here in Palo Alto. We
have a certain responsibility for
what our country does, but a
great deal more responsibility
for what we ourselves do in our
everyday dealings with one an
other. It is highly unlikely we
can succeed in doing anything
about the war in Vietnam if we
can't even stop our warring fac
tionalism in Palo Alto.
There is room in the Free U.
for many kinds of activity and
political persuasion. As it says
in the preamble, "The doors of
the Free U. are open to all. . ."
Those doors are still open.

Divisions within the Free Uni
versity of Palo Alto came to a
head recently in the process of
electing a new coordinator. The
following articles were written
by two participants in the con
flict. They represent, as is read
ily apparent, decidedly different
points of view neither of which
should be attributed to The
Daily.
The Free University of Palo
Alto is truly like the Holy
Roman Empire. Neither Holy,
Roman, Free, nor a University.
This became apparent at a meet
ing a week ago at the Co-op
Building where major decisions
were definitively decided.
A vestige of former times, the
Free University still defines it
self: "Bound to existing power
structure and handicapped by
modes of thought fostered by
big business, by the military
establishment, by consensus pol
itics, and by the mass media, it
(the American educational sys
tem) is unable to consider freely
and objectively the cultural, eco
nomic and political forces so
rapidly transforming the mod
ern world .... A revolution
in American education is re
quired to meet today's needs and
a new type of university— a
free university—must provide
the impetus for change. "
A motion made at the meeting
that the name be changed from
the "Free" University to the
"Open" University would best
characterize what became evi
dent Sunday. Though this mo
tion was voted down by a large
majority, other motions which
were passed seem to support the
appropriateness of the sug
gested change, e.g., an open cur
riculum which might include
Nazis, John Birchers, Psycho
paths, etc.
Experimental
The Free University decided
to subsidize an "experiment in
communal living" but rejected
a proposal to come out mono
lithically in favor of poly-sexual
ahd poly-pervert free sex experi
ments to provide the backbone
of the community. Vic Lovell,
newly elected coordinator, com
mented that it would be wrong
tft impose this vision on others
'Mf it wasn't their thing."
' A majority voted for the pos
sibility of a political stand but
added enough amendments to
insure the decision's emptiness.
No action was taken as to
whether the "Free" University
as a body would take political
stands on such things as the In
ternational War Crimes Tri
bunal, the Anti-Draft Union, the
recent coup in Greece, etc., and
3 specific motion to give $150.00
to the Anti-Draft Union was re
jected though $100.00 had al
ready been loaned for a "Mo
ther's Day Be-In."
The main issues seemed to re
volve around the majority's total
lack of understanding of the
Present as History, the dialect
ics of Freedom and Liberty.
Freedom was conceived of in a
wholly procedural way and thus
suggestions by some of the
membership that stands be
taken on issues involving sub
stantive freedom were consist
ently avoided. At a time when
fomc felt American Radicals
.■should dedicate themselves to
fighting American Imperialism,
freedom's chief enemy in the
contemporary world, the major
ity could only reiterate plati
tudes on the preeminence of
"the dark night of the soul."
The majority's response to the
demands to support substantive
.issues was a legally incorpor
ated "experiment in communal
living" free of the onerous re

quirements of necessary labour.
Since the political minority
thought that the Free University
should be more than a com
munal womb for some of its
more insecure members, they
withdrew from the organization.

can't even stop our warring fac
tionalism in Palo Alto.
There is room in the Free U.
for many kinds of activity and
political persuasion. As it says
in the preamble, "The doors of
the Free U. are open to all. . ."
Those doors are still open.

Divisions within the Free Uni
versity of Palo Alto came to a
head recently in the process of
electing a new coordinator. The
following articles were written
by two participants in the con
flict. They represent, as is read
ily apparent, decidedly different
points of view neither of which
should be attributed to The
Daily.
The Free University of Palo
Alto is truly like the Holy
Roman Empire. Neither Holy,
Roman, Free, nor a University.
This became apparent at a meet
ing a week ago at the Co-op
Building where major decisions
were definitively decided.
A vestige of former times, the
Free University still defines it
self: "Bound to existing power
structure and handicapped by
modes of thought fostered by
big business, by the military
establishment, by consensus pol
itics, and by the mass media, it
(the American educational sys
tem) is unable to consider freely
and objectively the cultural, eco
nomic and political forces so
rapidly transforming the mod
ern world .... A revolution
in American education is re
quired to meet today's needs and
a new type of university— a
free university—must provide
the impetus for change. "
A motion made at the meeting
that the name be changed from
the "Free" University to the
"Open" University would best
characterize what became evi
dent Sunday. Though this mo
tion was voted down by a large
majority, other motions which
were passed seem to support the
appropriateness of the sug
gested change, e.g., an open cur
riculum which might include
Nazis, John Birchers, Psycho
paths, etc.
Experimental
The Free University decided
to subsidize an "experiment in
communal living" but rejected
a proposal to come out mono
lithically in favor of poly-sexual
ahd poly-pervert free sex experi
ments to provide the backbone
of the community. Vic Lovell,
newly elected coordinator, com
mented that it would be wrong
tft impose this vision on others
'Mf it wasn't their thing."
' A majority voted for the pos
sibility of a political stand but
added enough amendments to
insure the decision's emptiness.
No action was taken as to
whether the "Free" University
as a body would take political
stands on such things as the In
ternational War Crimes Tri
bunal, the Anti-Draft Union, the
recent coup in Greece, etc., and
3 specific motion to give $150.00
to the Anti-Draft Union was re
jected though $100.00 had al
ready been loaned for a "Mo
ther's Day Be-In."
The main issues seemed to re
volve around the majority's total
lack of understanding of the
Present as History, the dialect
ics of Freedom and Liberty.
Freedom was conceived of in a
wholly procedural way and thus
suggestions by some of the
membership that stands be
taken on issues involving sub
stantive freedom were consist
ently avoided. At a time when
fomc felt American Radicals
.■should dedicate themselves to
fighting American Imperialism,
freedom's chief enemy in the
contemporary world, the major
ity could only reiterate plati
tudes on the preeminence of
"the dark night of the soul."
The majority's response to the
demands to support substantive
.issues was a legally incorpor
ated "experiment in communal
living" free of the onerous re

quirements of necessary labour.
Since the political minority
thought that the Free University
should be more than a com
munal womb for some of its
more insecure members, they
withdrew from the organization.
Some observers seem to in
terpret the internal struggle in
the "Free" University as more
a matter of personalities than
principles. In fact, one disen
chanted member was heard mut
tering as he left that coordin
ator "Vic Lovell is little more
than the political arm of Robb
Crist," Stanford's aging guru.

A week ago, at the conclusion
of a marathon five hour general
meeting of the Free University
of Palo Alto, a small group of
perhaps a dozen people, mostly
of a Marxist-Maoist political per
suasion, announced their with
drawal from the organization.
Two of the dissidents, Anatole
Anton and A. also
said that they were withdrawing
their course, "The Theory of
Political Struggle", from the
Free U. It might be more accur
ate, however, to say that they
were withdrawing from their
course, since if the students re
quest it, the Free U. will prob
ably find someone else to teach
the course.
This then is the most recent
result of what is alleged to be
a struggle between hippies and
political radicals for control of
the Free U. However, to regard
the situation in this way, i.e., as
hippies versus radicals, is to
completely misunderstand what
has been going on.
The real situation is this: a
very small group of ultra-leftist

political fanatics, people who for
the most part have been unable
to get along in any organization
they have ever been in, are sim
ply using the influx of new mem
bers in the Free U. to excuse
away their own political and so
cial ineptitude. They want to
justify themselves and so they
say, "The Free U. has changed.
Once it was a force for radical
political action. Now, however,
it has fallen into the hands of
psychedelically entranced hip
pies who prefer Be-ins to Sit-ins,
etc."
Still Political
But in fact there were and still
are a great many politically ac
tive people in the Free U., peo
ple who are willing to partici
pate in political protest but who
wish to use their own judgment
as to the activities in which they
decide to become involved. Thus,
for example, the newly elected
Coordinator, Vic Lovell, as well
as the two Assistant Coordinat
ors, Kathy Kirby and Sotere
Terregian, have endorsed the
view that the Free U. take polit
ical stands, and at the last meet
ing the group voted to help
raise funds for the Anti-Draft
Union. It was, in fact, one of
the so-called hippies that origin
ally invited Anatole Anton to
teach his course on political
struggle.
There is always a danger that
political activism may become
a real cop-out, a way of avoid
ing looking at oneself. Thus the
cry, "Don't you know people are
dying in Vietnam" may become
a way of distracting attention
from the real personal responsi
bility of treating fairly the peo
ple right here in Palo Alto. We
have a certain responsibility for
what our country does, but a
great deal more responsibility
for what we ourselves do in our
everyday dealings with one an
other. It is highly unlikely we
can succeed in doing anything
about the war in Vietnam if we
can't even stop our warring fac
tionalism in Palo Alto.

fomc felt American Radicals
.■should dedicate themselves to
fighting American Imperialism,
freedom's chief enemy in the
contemporary world, the major
ity could only reiterate plati
tudes on the preeminence of
"the dark night of the soul."
The majority's response to the
demands to support substantive
.issues was a legally incorpor
ated "experiment in communal
living" free of the onerous re

quirements of necessary labour.
Since the political minority
thought that the Free University
should be more than a com
munal womb for some of its
more insecure members, they
withdrew from the organization.
Some observers seem to in
terpret the internal struggle in
the "Free" University as more
a matter of personalities than
principles. In fact, one disen
chanted member was heard mut
tering as he left that coordin
ator "Vic Lovell is little more
than the political arm of Robb
Crist," Stanford's aging guru.

A week ago, at the conclusion
of a marathon five hour general
meeting of the Free University
of Palo Alto, a small group of
perhaps a dozen people, mostly
of a Marxist-Maoist political per
suasion, announced their with
drawal from the organization.
Two of the dissidents, Anatole
Anton and A. also
said that they were withdrawing
their course, "The Theory of
Political Struggle", from the
Free U. It might be more accur
ate, however, to say that they
were withdrawing from their
course, since if the students re
quest it, the Free U. will prob
ably find someone else to teach
the course.
This then is the most recent
result of what is alleged to be
a struggle between hippies and
political radicals for control of
the Free U. However, to regard
the situation in this way, i.e., as
hippies versus radicals, is to
completely misunderstand what
has been going on.
The real situation is this: a
very small group of ultra-leftist

political fanatics, people who for
the most part have been unable
to get along in any organization
they have ever been in, are sim
ply using the influx of new mem
bers in the Free U. to excuse
away their own political and so
cial ineptitude. They want to
justify themselves and so they
say, "The Free U. has changed.
Once it was a force for radical
political action. Now, however,
it has fallen into the hands of
psychedelically entranced hip
pies who prefer Be-ins to Sit-ins,
etc."
Still Political
But in fact there were and still
are a great many politically ac
tive people in the Free U., peo
ple who are willing to partici
pate in political protest but who
wish to use their own judgment
as to the activities in which they
decide to become involved. Thus,
for example, the newly elected
Coordinator, Vic Lovell, as well
as the two Assistant Coordinat
ors, Kathy Kirby and Sotere
Terregian, have endorsed the
view that the Free U. take polit
ical stands, and at the last meet
ing the group voted to help
raise funds for the Anti-Draft
Union. It was, in fact, one of
the so-called hippies that origin
ally invited Anatole Anton to
teach his course on political
struggle.
There is always a danger that
political activism may become
a real cop-out, a way of avoid
ing looking at oneself. Thus the
cry, "Don't you know people are
dying in Vietnam" may become
a way of distracting attention
from the real personal responsi
bility of treating fairly the peo
ple right here in Palo Alto. We
have a certain responsibility for
what our country does, but a
great deal more responsibility
for what we ourselves do in our
everyday dealings with one an
other. It is highly unlikely we
can succeed in doing anything
about the war in Vietnam if we
can't even stop our warring fac
tionalism in Palo Alto.
There is room in the Free U.
for many kinds of activity and
political persuasion. As it says
in the preamble, "The doors of
the Free U. are open to all. . ."
Those doors are still open.

Divisions within the Free Uni
versity of Palo Alto came to a
head recently in the process of
electing a new coordinator. The
following articles were written
by two participants in the con
flict. They represent, as is read
ily apparent, decidedly different
points of view neither of which
should be attributed to The
Daily.
