# Howard U. Students Boycott
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” Students at Howard
University said today that their
"student power" boycott from
classes was 75 to 80 per cent
effective, despite upcoming
exams.
The boycott was the result
of a recent university policy
statement limiting student pro
tests on campus. The admini
stration issued its statement fol
lowing an April demonstration
against Selective Service Di
rector Lewis Hershey. Hershey
appeared on the Howard cam
pus for a speech, but walked off
the rostrum when a group of
students waved anti-draft signs
and began heckling him.
The student boycott received
unofficial backing from many
faculty members including the
Faculty Forum, a group of
younger faculty members. The
Forum released a statement this
week endorsing the purpose of
the boycott, but did not go so
far as to urge faculty partici
pation.
Other faculty members, ac
cording to one student, told their
classes to "come if you want
to, and I hope you don't."
Several members of the ad
ministration expressed sym
pathy with the students despite
a reported threat to university
President James M. Nabrit, Jr.
University Director of Public
Relations Ernest Goodman said
instructors have been told not
to exercise unusual penalties
against students who are ab
sent from class. Class atten
dance is not required at Howard.
The administration, accord

ing to Goodman, had urged fac
ulty members not to schedule
any important examinations to
day to intimidate students
against the boycott.
The boycott gained support on
May 8 from the Student Senate
and Liberal Arts Student Coun
cil, in a 10-8 vote with four ab
stentions. Students were told of
the decision at a rally of 300
people on May 9.
Students have presented the
administration with six boycott
demands, including a mandate
that no disciplinary action bo
taken against students who par
ticipated in the demonstration
against Hershey and that the re
cent university policy state
ment on student protest be re
scinded.
Boycott leaders deleted two
of the original eight demands
following Pres. Nabrit's agree
ment May 9 to let students work
in a committee to draw up a
student conduct code and to
board to hear grievances against
individual instructors.
Out of approximately 11,000
students at Howard, 800 showed
up at this morning's boycott
rally. The classes which had the
highest attendance, "at the most
12 or 13" according to one stu
dent, were the sciences and the
senior classes. May 12 is the
last day of classes before exams
for many seniors, although un
derclassmen have another week
of classes.
"The participation is better
than expected compared to the
apathetic people here," a mem
ber of the student newspaper,
the HILLTOP, said.
