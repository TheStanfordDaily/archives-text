# US Military' Accidents' Help Write UN Epitaph

### HOLT RUFFIN (Third of Three Parts) 
S Late in the summer I also
pick up an English night class
ai the Xom Cui high school. In
ways this group of stu
dents is the most enjoyable I
have worked with all summer.
I went into the class one eve
ning to help a Vietnamese friend
who was a teacher in the school.
The kids liked the hopyi.l I
taught and asked me back.*-- *
In one of the last classes we
start to talk about the war; I
don't remember who brought it
up, perhaps they did.
I tell the kids how I feel about
the war and am surprised to
sense that I have struck a re
sponsive chord. When I tell
them how much the United
States is spending on the war,
they are shocked and disbeliev
ing, like all Vietnamese upon
hearing the sum's amount. Then
I ask them to put themselves
in my shoes: would they feel
a duty or think it important as
an American to come light the
Communists in Vietnam? Not
one student raises his voice.
Judging from what I saw and
heard this past summer, of the
nations of the world Vietnam
is surely one of those least
able to afford a war which has
already lasted a score of years
The problems facing the coun
try — great to begin with —
have become cumulatively enor
mous and don't promise to suc
cumb to any rapid, sure-fire, or
fragmentary solutions, military
or other. Nor is there cause for

any confidence in either the
suitability or longevity of the
remedies offered by a people
like us, so radically different
from the Vietnamese in psycho
logy, culture, and technology.
In my darker moments I am
convinced that, taken totally,
the record of American "assist
ance" to the Republic of Viet
nam shall bo no more than that
small and broken country's epi
taph.

On July 30 I read an account
in The Vietnam Guardian, Sai
gon's most liberal English lang
uage daily (and since last month
suspended for casting doubt on
the government's version of the
assassination of Tran Van Van),
under the headline: TWO CHIL
DREN KILLED BY ACCI
DENT. The story, as it appear
ed in the newspaper, follows.
"SAIGON, July 29 — Two
children were fatally riddled
with bullets fired by American
MP's at their small boat which
went adrift towards a watch
post on the bank of the Saigon
River at harbour warehouse No.
18, Tan Thaun Dong village,
Nha Be, at around 3.00 this mor
ning. The two were identified as

Do Van T., 12, and his sister Do
Thi Th., 10. According to
THANH BIEN News Service,
the children were sound asleep
when their boat went adrift at
the level of the watch post. The
MP's directed their flash light
on the boat and repeatedly chal
lenged it.
But, receiving no answer as
the silent boat approached their
post, the MP's thought it was
loaded with explosives by the

Viet Cong for sabotage purposes,
they opened several bursts of
gunfire on it until it gradually
sunk a few yards from the post.
When the boat was pulled
ashore, two children were
found killed. They either had
not heard the shouts or had
been too frightened to make
any move to reveal their pres
ence."
This murder might have been
accidental in the sense that if
one were to ask the MP's wheth
er they intended to kill any
children when they fired their
rifles, they would probably say
no. By military logic, however,
the soldiers were correct to fire
the precautionary bursts of bul
lets, no matter how stupid it

was in this specific instance to
shoot a boat mere yards away
suspected of carrying high ex
plosives. Their superior no doubt
explained the incident to the
press as "an unfortunate side
eflfeet of war." For the MP's
however, the superior officer
probably had consoling words
and assurances that their action
was proper, wise.
To our military thinkers, af
ter all, whose paranoia appears
to know no bounds, our ene
mies are vast in number — so

vast that only brute power tho
likes of which the world has
never seen can possibly offset
their threat. Irrelevant that tho
threat at its root is political
and that our counter-measures,
through and through, are mili
tary; fire is fire and water its
extinguisher, no matter if the
fire is one of oil. So we con
tinue day after day to rain de
st ruction on Vietnamese chil
dren and their parents, both
North and South, knowing that
by military law the simple right

to life is often secondary to
other concerns, that so long as
an annihilating act can be term
ed pre-emptive, however, vague
ly or indirectly so, it shall bo
deemed proper and praise
worthy.
The sad fact is that "acci
dents" such as that related
above multiply every day in
Vietnam as the military think
ers continue to gain greater and
greater ascendance over those
committed to peaceful modes of
resolving conflicts.

Ituffin spent 12 weeks in South Vietnam last summer under the
auspices of the International Volunteer Service. He was the team
leader of seven Stanford students working in Vietnam. Presently
he is associate director of Volunteers in Asia, which was organized
last year on the Stanford campus. He is also now completing" his
undergraduate work in Social Thought.
Parts of this article consist of entries in his journal of last sum
mer; other parts are recollection he recorded late last year.
