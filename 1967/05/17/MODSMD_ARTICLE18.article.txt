# Kentucky Code Extends Rights
## 
### 
(CPS) — University of Ken
tucky trustees have unanimous
ly approved what has l>een call
ed one of the most progressive
student rights codes in the na
tion.
Kentucky Gov. Edward Breat
hitt complimented students, fac
ulty, administration, and trus
tees on the code, calling it "a
very responsible action."
The code clearly sets out of
fenses and punishment as well
as devising a system of due
process so that no student can
be punished without a hearing
for an offense he claims not to
have committed.
It also defines the univer
sity's responsibilities to the stu
dent and states that the univer
sity has no right nor obligation
to punish students for civil or
criminal wrongs they commit in
their capacity as citizens.
Interpreted as an important
move away from the "in loco
parentis" concept, the rights
code defines a new university
student relationship in several
areas.
Among the provisions of the
code are:
• A complete definition of ac
tions meriting disciplinary pun
ishment, including 10 disci
plinary and two academic of
fenses ;
• A clear definition of uni
versity and student roles as
landlord and tenant;
• Establishment of a univer
sity judicial board and a uni
versity appeals board;
• Concrete regulations pro
hibiting organizations to dis
criminate against any person

because of color, race, sex, or
religious affiliation.
As defined by the report ac
companying the code, the uni
versity's sole concern is "to pro
vide protection of, and facilities
for, those who seek knowledge."
Today's student is an adult and
"is at the university as a mem
ber of a community of scholars
... and so long as his conduct
in and out of the classroom
does not impinge on the rights
of other scholars, the university
should not use its powers to

either condone or condemn him."
Approval of the code climaxed
15 months' work by the Ad
visory Committee on Student
Affairs to the University Sen
ate. Before the code was sent
to the trustees, it was consider
ed by the Senate in four ses
sions.
During its consideration, the
report endured, in the most part,
attempts by more conservative
faculty members to retain some
aspects of "in loco parentis"
policies.
