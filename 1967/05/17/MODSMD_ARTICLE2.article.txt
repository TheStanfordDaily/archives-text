tion of its other committees, which
will include International Education,
Campus Environment, Libraries and

the committees will be able, once
formed, to add other members of their
own choosing.
Two committees of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) will be
gin open hearings next week, and a
third committee has just been formed.
The purpose of the hearings will

The Steering Committee, headed by
Vice Provost Herbert Packer, will
conduct its proceedings Monday from
4 to 6 p.m. and Tuesday from 7:30

week on Wednesday from 7:30 to 10
p.m. and Thursday from 4 to 6 p.m.

prefer. The hearings will be tape re
corded, as are all SES proceedings,

Admissions and Financial Aid, head
ed by Religion Professor William
Clebsch, will consider these two inter
related areas "as they relate to the
overall purposes of the University
and to make recommendations for
University policy."

Among the questions posed for this
committee in the SES agenda are:
• How well are we doing in select
ing undergraduate students from
those applying?
• Ca"n the number of undergradu
ates who drop out be reduced by re
vising admissions procedures?
• Should we seek a more widely
representative student body?
• Do our present financial aid poli
cies adequately support whatever ob
jectives are agreed to in the above
questions?
Work Begins Next Week

tee would, he hoped, begin work next
week with an organizational meet
ing. Other members include sopho
more Norton Batkin, Psychology Pro
fessor J. Merrill Carlsmith, Socio
