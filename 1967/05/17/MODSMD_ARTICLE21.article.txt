### JOHN HOTSON 
The Stanford crew swept a
ftred-up California team Satur
day to dominate the annual "Big
Row" for the second year in a
row.
The Indians won all three
sprint races with the final vars
ity race being one of the most
exciting in the history of the
rivalry.
The varsity boat, stroked by

sophomore Jim Haley, came
back from a half length down
to battle the Bears stroke for
stroke through most of the race.
It was only at the end of the
race that Stanford was able to
pull ahead with an amazing final
sprint. They finally won by one
second.

Will Condon, Stanford's coach,
stated after the varsity race,

"We would have liked to win by
more, but Cal put up quite a
fight."
The California team felt they
had rowed their best race of the
season against the Indian crew.
Stanford's team captain Bill
Stump commented, "We started
off slow but came back quickly.
Both crews were determined to
win, Stanford was just a little
more determined."
The junior varsity also had to
overcome an early lead by the
Bears before outpowering the
bigger opponents by half :i
length.
The frosh contest was not
so close as the strong Indian
yearlings outdrove California by
four lengths.
Stanford now has a 7-2 season
record.
