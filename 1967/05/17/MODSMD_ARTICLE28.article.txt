| Clay Primrose and Bob Haw
v kins led the Stanford Lacrosse
5 team to its third consecutive win
* Sunday, as the Indians turned
* back the San Francisco Lacrosse
* Club, 7-3.
« The game seemed to be turn
ip ing into a rout, when the teams
S left the field at half-time with
* Stanford ahead by a comfortable
? 4-1 margin.
. But San Francisco came back
with a goal in each of the two
*> final periods to move within
£ range at 4-3.
Cards Pull It Out
» Hawkins then scored his sec
* ond goal and Saxten notched his
2 lone tally, and Stanford went on
£ to move in front again, and
\ Coach Bob Barton emptied the
£ bench for the last five minutes
of play.
The defense cleared very well,
* with Denny McNeely and fleet
J' Willy Eakland passing and run
* ning the ball upfield to the at
tack.
v Starter Nat Benchley played
2 smart defense, shutting out his
J man, while fourth man Buck
3 Wales played his best game of

the season, running several
clears by himself and keeping
his attaekman in check behind
the cage.
The midfield did most of the
scoring, as fine ball control kept
the ball in the offensive end of
the field most of the game.
Hawkins got every face-off from
the highly-touted San Francisco
center mid-fielder, Fred Gau
dern, moving the ball down into
scoring range.
Glenn Thomas played an out
standing game, assisting on
clears and working the ball into
scoring position on offense.
The Indians now stand 4-0 in
league standings, with a 6-1
record over-all. The champion
ship should be decided in the
next two games when the Tribe
faces traditional champion Palo
Alto on consecutive Saturdays.
