# Stanford, Cal Debaters Vie For 73rd 'Joffre' Award
## 
### 
The 73rd annual "Medaille Joffre"
and the seventh annual "American
Issues Tournament" will be presented
by the Stanford Speech Association
this week.
The "Joffre" will be held tonight at
8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel.
It is an annual debate against the
University of California at Berkeley
and is the oldest continuous debate
between two American universities.
The cumulative score to date is in
favor of Stanford.
Sponsored by the French Alliance
of San Francisco, the debate invari
ably deals with some aspect of
French national or international po
litics. This year's topic is "Resolved
that the Entry of England Into the
Common Market Will be Beneficial
to France."
The debate features an individually
competitive format with three de
bators on a team. Each team includes
debators from both schools.
The American Issues Tournament,
set for May 19 and 20, represents a
major effort of the Stanford Speech
Association to give all students the
opportunity to argue their positions
on the Vietnam war within a struc
tured debate situation.
"We hope to firm up some of the
vagueness, emotion, and assertions
so common on college campuses by
providing a critically evaluated forum
which puts a premium on sound
reasoning," explained Professor Ken
neth Mosier, Director of Forensics.
He said previous efforts to hold a
debate between representatives of
ROTC and the New Left proved un
successful when New Leftists backed
out at the last moment.
The focus of the tournament is
"American National and Internation
al Affairs Since 1962." The two major
topic divisions are "Resolved that the
United States Withdraw from Viet

nam" and "Resolved that the United
States Substantially Reduce Its For
eign Policy Commitments."
The debate is open to all students
who may enter singly or in teams and
in either "novice" or "experienced"
divisions. Those with inflexible posi
tions will be permitted to choose the
side they wish to debate. Cross-ex
amination style will be used.
"People have charged that debate
is too academic to be really interest
ing and said we should debate such
topics of concern as free sex and "Re
solved that Johnson is a Warmonger
ing Pig," said Prof. Mosier. "But
Stanford is one of the few schools
that debates topics other than those
chosen for national rebate, like the
recognition of Red China."
The American Issues Tournament
is only one of several ways in which
the Speech Association is encourag
ing interested students and working to
make speech activity more relevant
and viable in a modern context.
Participation in speaking activities
has grown from 40 to 120 students
in the last three years. Well over
one-half are freshmen and about one
third have had no previous experi
ence. "We never turn down anyone
who expresses an interest in speak
ing and is willing to put in the time."
"I've seen what speaking can do for
people, and I look upon it as almost
a missionary project," affirmed Prof.
Mosier.
The Speech Association is one of
few that does not pour its entire de
bate budget to finance one or two
winning teams. Instead various teams
go to different tournaments, in the
belief that debate is primarily an
educational experience. A team may
go to two or three events a quarter.
Almost all teams, many of them
freshman, have reached the elimina
tions in every tournament, and net
ted about 50 trophies this year.

set for May 19 and 20, represents a
major effort of the Stanford Speech
Association to give all students the
opportunity to argue their positions
on the Vietnam war within a struc
tured debate situation.
"We hope to firm up some of the
vagueness, emotion, and assertions
so common on college campuses by
providing a critically evaluated forum
which puts a premium on sound
reasoning," explained Professor Ken
neth Mosier, Director of Forensics.
He said previous efforts to hold a
debate between representatives of
ROTC and the New Left proved un
successful when New Leftists backed
out at the last moment.
The focus of the tournament is
"American National and Internation
al Affairs Since 1962." The two major
topic divisions are "Resolved that the
United States Withdraw from Viet

nam" and "Resolved that the United
States Substantially Reduce Its For
eign Policy Commitments."
The debate is open to all students
who may enter singly or in teams and
in either "novice" or "experienced"
divisions. Those with inflexible posi
tions will be permitted to choose the
side they wish to debate. Cross-ex
amination style will be used.
"People have charged that debate
is too academic to be really interest
ing and said we should debate such
topics of concern as free sex and "Re
solved that Johnson is a Warmonger
ing Pig," said Prof. Mosier. "But
Stanford is one of the few schools
that debates topics other than those
chosen for national rebate, like the
recognition of Red China."
The American Issues Tournament
is only one of several ways in which
the Speech Association is encourag
ing interested students and working to
make speech activity more relevant
and viable in a modern context.
Participation in speaking activities
has grown from 40 to 120 students
in the last three years. Well over
one-half are freshmen and about one
third have had no previous experi
ence. "We never turn down anyone
who expresses an interest in speak
ing and is willing to put in the time."
"I've seen what speaking can do for
people, and I look upon it as almost
a missionary project," affirmed Prof.
Mosier.
The Speech Association is one of
few that does not pour its entire de
bate budget to finance one or two
winning teams. Instead various teams
go to different tournaments, in the
belief that debate is primarily an
educational experience. A team may
go to two or three events a quarter.
Almost all teams, many of them
freshman, have reached the elimina
tions in every tournament, and net
ted about 50 trophies this year.
The 73rd annual "Medaille Joffre"
and the seventh annual "American
Issues Tournament" will be presented
by the Stanford Speech Association
this week.
The "Joffre" will be held tonight at
8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel.
It is an annual debate against the
University of California at Berkeley
and is the oldest continuous debate
between two American universities.
The cumulative score to date is in
favor of Stanford.
Sponsored by the French Alliance
of San Francisco, the debate invari
ably deals with some aspect of
French national or international po
litics. This year's topic is "Resolved
that the Entry of England Into the
Common Market Will be Beneficial
to France."
The debate features an individually
competitive format with three de
bators on a team. Each team includes
debators from both schools.
