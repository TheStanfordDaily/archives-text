More To Come
The racing season is not yet

McCarthy will compete in Bay
regattas through July. The In
dians will sail a 33 foot Rhodes
sloop for the remainder of the
season.
The Sailing Association is the
largest organization on campus
now, citing their membership at
350. It operates full-time sailing
activities on Lake Lagunita with
a fleet of twelve 13 foot Flying

Stanford's entry in the Ken

races, was financed by members
of the crew, donations, and by
SSA funds.
