# Letters To The Editor
## Opera Suceeds Without Assistance 
### 
'Editor, The Daily:
I wish to offer my congratula
tions to the members of the
Stanford Opera Guild and to all
others who helped in their out
standing and entertaining pro
duction of Gianni Schicchi.
I think particular credit
should go to Doug Johnson who
was largely responsible for mak
ing the performance as profes
sional as it was and to Don An
drews whose work and persist
ence helped make the opera a
•eality against overwhelming
odds.
But in offering credits, let us
not confuse or associate this pro
duction with the Stanford De
partment of Music and its head,
Dr. Crosten. It is no mistake
that they were not mentioned
in the acknowledgements on the
jorogram.
It is my understanding that
they refused to offer any assist
ance, financial, advisory or oth
erwise, because they thought
the talent was lacking among
Stanford students to produce an
opera of professional quality,
-and that Dr. Crosten practically
defied Don Andrews to try to

produce one without the aid of
the department.
I don't know what was the
basis for Crosten's evaluation,
but with judgment like that, de
partmental aid would probably
have hindered, not helped. The
standing ovations by very alert
and discriminating audiences
were well deserved. They cer
tainly should have embarrassed
those of the department who
were there.
Finally, it is disgraceful that
the criterion used by the "teach
ers" of the department to offer
their assistance was the pre
judged quality of the produc
tion. It is a shame when so
many students were willing to
dedicate so much of their time
and energy to Gianni Schlcchi,
purely out of a love for and in
terest in opera and music, that
this was not enough in itself
for the Music Department to
want to or even to condescend to
help. It makes one ask what
the goal of the department is. Is
it to insure its own reputation
or is it to serve and help devoted
students seeking an education?

• Student Reluctance
Editor, Tiie Daily:
I have noted with interest
the whining of Daily columnists
Bruce Merry and Tim Haight
over the allegedly heinous fail
ure of the Music Department
to support (he newly-formed
Stanford Opera Guild's produc
tion of Gianni Sehicehi.
That so commonplace an
event as a student production
of an opera should bring about
such vitriolic attacks ( Mr. Merry
told the Music Department to
"go to hell" in his column) was
rather puzzling; I have conclud
ed at last that these actions are
merely symptomatic of the gen
eral poor health of student ar
tistic life at Stanford.
The underlying presumption
of MeSsrs. Merry and Haight,
and I believe it to be one that
is widely held at Stanford, is
that student expression in the
performing arts is always to
be supported, planned, directed,
and perhaps even intiated by
faculty action.
However, in my opinion, it
is this very behavioural norm,
which implies student reluc
tance to act without faculty

leadership, which has led to the
sparseness of student cultural
activity at Stanford and which
has stunted the growth of an
artistically creative community.
It is fashionable in Daily ar
ticles to make comparisons
with Harvard and Yale, and in
observing this custom, 1 find
that on every count, Stanford
points out that Gianni Schicchi
is the first opera at Stanford
in four years, yet I can recall
student - run performances at
Harvard in less than half that
period of Mozart's Cosi Fan
Tutte, Britten's Turn of the
Screw, Verdi's Un Hallo in Mas
chera, and Gilbert and Sulli
van's Mikado and lolanthe, to
name only a few.
Whereas Stanford boasts only
two student-run dramatic groups
to my knowledge, Mafia and
Ram's Head, Yale and Harvard
have student-run theatrical com
panies at the University level,
such as the Yale Dramatic As
sociation and Harvard Drama
Club, at the residential level
(each of the twelve Yale Col
leges and the nine Harvard
Houses has a performing
group >, and even at the gradu
ate school level, such as the

Harvard Law Dramatic Society.
Furthermore, while Stanford
can count only the Mendicants
as a student run singing group,
Yale has at least fifteen, from
the well-known Wiffenpoofs on
the one hand to the well-travel
led Yale Russian Chorus on the
other. If the myriad student
run orchestras, madrigal groups,
literary magazines, choirs, blue
grass bands, and the like, which
abound in New Haven and Cam
bridge, are also considered,
Stanford appears extremely
drab indeed.
The difference, I believe, lies
in the fact that although there
are excellent faculty-run groups,
there are other outlets as well
for student initiative where fac
ulty supervision is not the pre
requisite of a creative under
taking. Not subject to bureau
cratic control or veto, either
from faculty or student gov
ernment (read ASSU), student
creativity has been able to
weave a cultural fabric of a
richness unmatched at Stanford.
I thus congratulate the Stan
ford Opera Guild on their
achievement and hope it augurs
a trend away from cultural bu
reacracy.

This issue presented to the

surpassed in recent memory by

were not insipid to start with
were cut to make them so. For

I hope does not indicate the

pressed with true originality the
freshman situation at Wilbur

entirely, probably due to the

should go to Doug Johnson who
was largely responsible for mak
ing the performance as profes
sional as it was and to Don An
drews whose work and persist
ence helped make the opera a
•eality against overwhelming
odds.
But in offering credits, let us
not confuse or associate this pro
duction with the Stanford De
partment of Music and its head,
Dr. Crosten. It is no mistake
that they were not mentioned
in the acknowledgements on the
jorogram.
It is my understanding that
they refused to offer any assist
ance, financial, advisory or oth
erwise, because they thought
the talent was lacking among
Stanford students to produce an
opera of professional quality,
-and that Dr. Crosten practically
defied Don Andrews to try to

produce one without the aid of
the department.
I don't know what was the
basis for Crosten's evaluation,
but with judgment like that, de
partmental aid would probably
have hindered, not helped. The
standing ovations by very alert
and discriminating audiences
were well deserved. They cer
tainly should have embarrassed
those of the department who
were there.
Finally, it is disgraceful that
the criterion used by the "teach
ers" of the department to offer
their assistance was the pre
judged quality of the produc
tion. It is a shame when so
many students were willing to
dedicate so much of their time
and energy to Gianni Schlcchi,
purely out of a love for and in
terest in opera and music, that
this was not enough in itself
for the Music Department to
want to or even to condescend to
help. It makes one ask what
the goal of the department is. Is
it to insure its own reputation
or is it to serve and help devoted
students seeking an education?

• Student Reluctance
Editor, Tiie Daily:
I have noted with interest
the whining of Daily columnists
Bruce Merry and Tim Haight
over the allegedly heinous fail
ure of the Music Department
to support (he newly-formed
Stanford Opera Guild's produc
tion of Gianni Sehicehi.
That so commonplace an
event as a student production
of an opera should bring about
such vitriolic attacks ( Mr. Merry
told the Music Department to
"go to hell" in his column) was
rather puzzling; I have conclud
ed at last that these actions are
merely symptomatic of the gen
eral poor health of student ar
tistic life at Stanford.
The underlying presumption
of MeSsrs. Merry and Haight,
and I believe it to be one that
is widely held at Stanford, is
that student expression in the
performing arts is always to
be supported, planned, directed,
and perhaps even intiated by
faculty action.
However, in my opinion, it
is this very behavioural norm,
which implies student reluc
tance to act without faculty

leadership, which has led to the
sparseness of student cultural
activity at Stanford and which
has stunted the growth of an
artistically creative community.
It is fashionable in Daily ar
ticles to make comparisons
with Harvard and Yale, and in
observing this custom, 1 find
that on every count, Stanford
points out that Gianni Schicchi
is the first opera at Stanford
in four years, yet I can recall
student - run performances at
Harvard in less than half that
period of Mozart's Cosi Fan
Tutte, Britten's Turn of the
Screw, Verdi's Un Hallo in Mas
chera, and Gilbert and Sulli
van's Mikado and lolanthe, to
name only a few.
Whereas Stanford boasts only
two student-run dramatic groups
to my knowledge, Mafia and
Ram's Head, Yale and Harvard
have student-run theatrical com
panies at the University level,
such as the Yale Dramatic As
sociation and Harvard Drama
Club, at the residential level
(each of the twelve Yale Col
leges and the nine Harvard
Houses has a performing
group >, and even at the gradu
ate school level, such as the

Harvard Law Dramatic Society.
Furthermore, while Stanford
can count only the Mendicants
as a student run singing group,
Yale has at least fifteen, from
the well-known Wiffenpoofs on
the one hand to the well-travel
led Yale Russian Chorus on the
other. If the myriad student
run orchestras, madrigal groups,
literary magazines, choirs, blue
grass bands, and the like, which
abound in New Haven and Cam
bridge, are also considered,
Stanford appears extremely
drab indeed.
The difference, I believe, lies
in the fact that although there
are excellent faculty-run groups,
there are other outlets as well
for student initiative where fac
ulty supervision is not the pre
requisite of a creative under
taking. Not subject to bureau
cratic control or veto, either
from faculty or student gov
ernment (read ASSU), student
creativity has been able to
weave a cultural fabric of a
richness unmatched at Stanford.
I thus congratulate the Stan
ford Opera Guild on their
achievement and hope it augurs
a trend away from cultural bu
reacracy.

not confuse or associate this pro
duction with the Stanford De
partment of Music and its head,
Dr. Crosten. It is no mistake
that they were not mentioned
in the acknowledgements on the
jorogram.
It is my understanding that
they refused to offer any assist
ance, financial, advisory or oth
erwise, because they thought
the talent was lacking among
Stanford students to produce an
opera of professional quality,
-and that Dr. Crosten practically
defied Don Andrews to try to

produce one without the aid of
the department.
I don't know what was the
basis for Crosten's evaluation,
but with judgment like that, de
partmental aid would probably
have hindered, not helped. The
standing ovations by very alert
and discriminating audiences
were well deserved. They cer
tainly should have embarrassed
those of the department who
were there.
Finally, it is disgraceful that
the criterion used by the "teach
ers" of the department to offer
their assistance was the pre
judged quality of the produc
tion. It is a shame when so
many students were willing to
dedicate so much of their time
and energy to Gianni Schlcchi,
purely out of a love for and in
terest in opera and music, that
this was not enough in itself
for the Music Department to
want to or even to condescend to
help. It makes one ask what
the goal of the department is. Is
it to insure its own reputation
or is it to serve and help devoted
students seeking an education?

• Student Reluctance
Editor, Tiie Daily:
I have noted with interest
the whining of Daily columnists
Bruce Merry and Tim Haight
over the allegedly heinous fail
ure of the Music Department
to support (he newly-formed
Stanford Opera Guild's produc
tion of Gianni Sehicehi.
That so commonplace an
event as a student production
of an opera should bring about
such vitriolic attacks ( Mr. Merry
told the Music Department to
"go to hell" in his column) was
rather puzzling; I have conclud
ed at last that these actions are
merely symptomatic of the gen
eral poor health of student ar
tistic life at Stanford.
The underlying presumption
of MeSsrs. Merry and Haight,
and I believe it to be one that
is widely held at Stanford, is
that student expression in the
performing arts is always to
be supported, planned, directed,
and perhaps even intiated by
faculty action.
However, in my opinion, it
is this very behavioural norm,
which implies student reluc
tance to act without faculty

leadership, which has led to the
sparseness of student cultural
activity at Stanford and which
has stunted the growth of an
artistically creative community.
It is fashionable in Daily ar
ticles to make comparisons
with Harvard and Yale, and in
observing this custom, 1 find
that on every count, Stanford
points out that Gianni Schicchi
is the first opera at Stanford
in four years, yet I can recall
student - run performances at
Harvard in less than half that
period of Mozart's Cosi Fan
Tutte, Britten's Turn of the
Screw, Verdi's Un Hallo in Mas
chera, and Gilbert and Sulli
van's Mikado and lolanthe, to
name only a few.
Whereas Stanford boasts only
two student-run dramatic groups
to my knowledge, Mafia and
Ram's Head, Yale and Harvard
have student-run theatrical com
panies at the University level,
such as the Yale Dramatic As
sociation and Harvard Drama
Club, at the residential level
(each of the twelve Yale Col
leges and the nine Harvard
Houses has a performing
group >, and even at the gradu
ate school level, such as the

Harvard Law Dramatic Society.
Furthermore, while Stanford
can count only the Mendicants
as a student run singing group,
Yale has at least fifteen, from
the well-known Wiffenpoofs on
the one hand to the well-travel
led Yale Russian Chorus on the
other. If the myriad student
run orchestras, madrigal groups,
literary magazines, choirs, blue
grass bands, and the like, which
abound in New Haven and Cam
bridge, are also considered,
Stanford appears extremely
drab indeed.
The difference, I believe, lies
in the fact that although there
are excellent faculty-run groups,
there are other outlets as well
for student initiative where fac
ulty supervision is not the pre
requisite of a creative under
taking. Not subject to bureau
cratic control or veto, either
from faculty or student gov
ernment (read ASSU), student
creativity has been able to
weave a cultural fabric of a
richness unmatched at Stanford.
I thus congratulate the Stan
ford Opera Guild on their
achievement and hope it augurs
a trend away from cultural bu
reacracy.
