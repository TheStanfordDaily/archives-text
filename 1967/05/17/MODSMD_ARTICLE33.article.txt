## Hire Students To Work In Administration 
### Carl Schmidt 
It wasn't so very long ago
that Governor Reagan (whisper
that name darkly) proposed
that the budget of the Univer
sity of California be cut by
10%. There was a Great To-Do.
All agreed that it would be
pleasant to spend less money
in the cause of public education,
but none of the proposed alter
natives to the present alloca
tions met with any success.
Governor Reagan proposed
that a tuition be imposed on
students in hitherto tuition-free
state colleges and universities.
Not, perhaps, an unreasonable
proposal considering that most
other states have such tuition.
However, California's indepen
dence from the general custom
in this case constitutes one of
the rare instances of enlighten
ed government in this state.
Not meeting much success
with his tuition proposal, the
Governor attempted a straight
budget cut, leaving the alloca
tion of the reduced funds to the
university. This is a tried and
true governmental means for
reducing the strain on a tight
budget; it has been forestalled
by equally tried and true gov
ernmental means of delay.
The Great Debate
So while we have this little
breathing space and beautiful
summer weather in which to
meditate, while the officials of
the university and the govern
ment are growing a little sleepy,
we can, perhaps, venture into
an aspect of the Great Debate
over university financing which
has so far been forbidden.
The goal is to reduce the cost
of education without decreas
ing either its quality or its
quantity (i.e.: the number of
students that can be accommo
dated). Notice that we are al
ready cheating in adopting this
formulation of the problem.
Governor Reagan and the offi
cials of the University have
been addressing themselves to
the problem of making maxi
mum cuts in the cost of educa
tion while keeping losses in
quality and quantity at a mini
mum. By formulating the prob
lem the way we have we seem
to imply that it is possible to
reduce the cost of education
without impairing education at
all. In fact, it seems to me that
any reduction in the quality or
quantity of education would

render cuts in cost unaccept
able.
So are we back where we
started? Not exactly. We are
told that we must cut the "fat"
out of education. It is interest
ing that while this debate has
been carried on between the
Governor and the officials of the
University (students adding
their mass cry to the bleats of
these officials) no one has ef
fectively pointed out that the
"fat" (such as it may be) is
embodied in the administration
of the institution rather than
in the teachers and students.
When the politicians say
"cut out the fat", the admini
stration threatens to freeze on
admissions, cuts in faculty sal
aries and appointments. These
are precisely those aspects of
the university which should be
most protected; teaching cannot
effectively be abbreviated.
On the other hand, there are
many aspects of the administra
tion of the institutions which
can be reduced and compacted,
if not completely eliminated.
But the bureaucratic jealousies,
allegiances and arguments that
support these institions are ex
tremely complex and resolutely
held. Moreover it is not our
purpose here to assess the rela
tive merits of the numerous
programs and functions which
fall under the heading of ad
ministration, though such an as
sessment is sorely needed.
Instead, I would like to sug
gest a much simpler and
straight - forward alternative
resting on the fact that many,
if not most of the administra
tive functions of the university
could be handled by students at
a reduced cost to the university.
The notion of employing stu
dents part time in the admini
stration of the university is not
new. Stanford has for several
summers supported an intern
ship program functioning under
various Deans and Departments,
and by all indications have been
well pleased by the results.
There are students capable and
willing to serve in positions
ranging from clerical and staff
work to the administration of
specific programs, with or with
out academic credit, for salaries
that are merely tokens to those
currently paid to "professional"
administrators and staff work
ers.
In addition employment of

this kind is a valuable educa
tional device in its own right
apart from the financial bene
fits to the institution and the
students. It enables students to
view the nature and problems
of education from a different
perspective and gives them a
scope and range of action for
their ideas as well as providing
them with a sounder basis for
forming and assessing opinions.
Education is not and should
not be treated as a wholly pas
sive process. It may also be
that such a program will pro
vide better trained administra
tors in the future, more alert
to the essentially educational
nature of the university.
The proposal is feasible and

might help Governor Reagan
out of his financial diffculties
aside from giving him the op
portunity to strike an unexpect
ed blow in the cause of educa
tion. But while we're waiting
for the Governor to see the
light there should be adequate
time for poor, provincial, non
political Stanford to begin put
ting the idea into practice. As
positions become open students
should be hired to fill them, they
might be divided up and students
functions of certain officials
employed to carry them out.
No one would be disappointed
in the results, and I am con
fident enough to predict that
the system would be quickly
expanded.

of education from a different
perspective and gives them a
scope and range of action for
their ideas as well as providing
them with a sounder basis for
forming and assessing opinions.
Education is not and should
not be treated as a wholly pas
sive process. It may also be
that such a program will pro
vide better trained administra
tors in the future, more alert
to the essentially educational
nature of the university.
The proposal is feasible and

might help Governor Reagan
out of his financial diffculties
aside from giving him the op
portunity to strike an unexpect
ed blow in the cause of educa
tion. But while we're waiting
for the Governor to see the
light there should be adequate
time for poor, provincial, non
political Stanford to begin put
ting the idea into practice. As
positions become open students
should be hired to fill them, they
might be divided up and students
functions of certain officials
employed to carry them out.
No one would be disappointed
in the results, and I am con
fident enough to predict that
the system would be quickly
expanded.
It wasn't so very long ago
that Governor Reagan (whisper
that name darkly) proposed
that the budget of the Univer
sity of California be cut by
10%. There was a Great To-Do.
All agreed that it would be
pleasant to spend less money
in the cause of public education,
but none of the proposed alter
natives to the present alloca
tions met with any success.
Governor Reagan proposed
that a tuition be imposed on
students in hitherto tuition-free
state colleges and universities.
Not, perhaps, an unreasonable
proposal considering that most
other states have such tuition.
However, California's indepen
dence from the general custom
in this case constitutes one of
the rare instances of enlighten
ed government in this state.
Not meeting much success
with his tuition proposal, the
Governor attempted a straight
budget cut, leaving the alloca
tion of the reduced funds to the
university. This is a tried and
true governmental means for
reducing the strain on a tight
budget; it has been forestalled
by equally tried and true gov
ernmental means of delay.
The Great Debate
So while we have this little
breathing space and beautiful
summer weather in which to
meditate, while the officials of
the university and the govern
ment are growing a little sleepy,
we can, perhaps, venture into
an aspect of the Great Debate
over university financing which
has so far been forbidden.
The goal is to reduce the cost
of education without decreas
ing either its quality or its
quantity (i.e.: the number of
students that can be accommo
dated). Notice that we are al
ready cheating in adopting this
formulation of the problem.
Governor Reagan and the offi
cials of the University have
been addressing themselves to
the problem of making maxi
mum cuts in the cost of educa
tion while keeping losses in
quality and quantity at a mini
mum. By formulating the prob
lem the way we have we seem
to imply that it is possible to
reduce the cost of education
without impairing education at
all. In fact, it seems to me that
any reduction in the quality or
quantity of education would

render cuts in cost unaccept
able.
So are we back where we
started? Not exactly. We are
told that we must cut the "fat"
out of education. It is interest
ing that while this debate has
been carried on between the
Governor and the officials of the
University (students adding
their mass cry to the bleats of
these officials) no one has ef
fectively pointed out that the
"fat" (such as it may be) is
embodied in the administration
of the institution rather than
in the teachers and students.
When the politicians say
"cut out the fat", the admini
stration threatens to freeze on
admissions, cuts in faculty sal
aries and appointments. These
are precisely those aspects of
the university which should be
most protected; teaching cannot
effectively be abbreviated.
On the other hand, there are
many aspects of the administra
tion of the institutions which
can be reduced and compacted,
if not completely eliminated.
But the bureaucratic jealousies,
allegiances and arguments that
support these institions are ex
tremely complex and resolutely
held. Moreover it is not our
purpose here to assess the rela
tive merits of the numerous
programs and functions which
fall under the heading of ad
ministration, though such an as
sessment is sorely needed.
Instead, I would like to sug
gest a much simpler and
straight - forward alternative
resting on the fact that many,
if not most of the administra
tive functions of the university
could be handled by students at
a reduced cost to the university.
The notion of employing stu
dents part time in the admini
stration of the university is not
new. Stanford has for several
summers supported an intern
ship program functioning under
various Deans and Departments,
and by all indications have been
well pleased by the results.
There are students capable and
willing to serve in positions
ranging from clerical and staff
work to the administration of
specific programs, with or with
out academic credit, for salaries
that are merely tokens to those
currently paid to "professional"
administrators and staff work
ers.
In addition employment of

this kind is a valuable educa
tional device in its own right
apart from the financial bene
fits to the institution and the
students. It enables students to
view the nature and problems
of education from a different
perspective and gives them a
scope and range of action for
their ideas as well as providing
them with a sounder basis for
forming and assessing opinions.

fall under the heading of ad
ministration, though such an as
sessment is sorely needed.
Instead, I would like to sug
gest a much simpler and
straight - forward alternative
resting on the fact that many,
if not most of the administra
tive functions of the university
could be handled by students at
a reduced cost to the university.
The notion of employing stu
dents part time in the admini
stration of the university is not
new. Stanford has for several
summers supported an intern
ship program functioning under
various Deans and Departments,
and by all indications have been
well pleased by the results.
There are students capable and
willing to serve in positions
ranging from clerical and staff
work to the administration of
specific programs, with or with
out academic credit, for salaries
that are merely tokens to those
currently paid to "professional"
administrators and staff work
ers.
In addition employment of

this kind is a valuable educa
tional device in its own right
apart from the financial bene
fits to the institution and the
students. It enables students to
view the nature and problems
of education from a different
perspective and gives them a
scope and range of action for
their ideas as well as providing
them with a sounder basis for
forming and assessing opinions.
Education is not and should
not be treated as a wholly pas
sive process. It may also be
that such a program will pro
vide better trained administra
tors in the future, more alert
to the essentially educational
nature of the university.
The proposal is feasible and

might help Governor Reagan
out of his financial diffculties
aside from giving him the op
portunity to strike an unexpect
ed blow in the cause of educa
tion. But while we're waiting
for the Governor to see the
light there should be adequate
time for poor, provincial, non
political Stanford to begin put
ting the idea into practice. As
positions become open students
should be hired to fill them, they
might be divided up and students
functions of certain officials
employed to carry them out.
No one would be disappointed
in the results, and I am con
fident enough to predict that
the system would be quickly
expanded.
It wasn't so very long ago
that Governor Reagan (whisper
that name darkly) proposed
that the budget of the Univer
sity of California be cut by
10%. There was a Great To-Do.
All agreed that it would be
pleasant to spend less money
in the cause of public education,
but none of the proposed alter
natives to the present alloca
tions met with any success.
Governor Reagan proposed
that a tuition be imposed on
students in hitherto tuition-free
state colleges and universities.
Not, perhaps, an unreasonable
proposal considering that most
other states have such tuition.
However, California's indepen
dence from the general custom
in this case constitutes one of
the rare instances of enlighten
ed government in this state.
Not meeting much success
with his tuition proposal, the
Governor attempted a straight
budget cut, leaving the alloca
tion of the reduced funds to the
university. This is a tried and
true governmental means for
reducing the strain on a tight
budget; it has been forestalled
by equally tried and true gov
ernmental means of delay.
The Great Debate
So while we have this little
breathing space and beautiful
summer weather in which to
meditate, while the officials of
the university and the govern
ment are growing a little sleepy,
we can, perhaps, venture into
an aspect of the Great Debate
over university financing which
has so far been forbidden.
The goal is to reduce the cost
of education without decreas
ing either its quality or its
quantity (i.e.: the number of
students that can be accommo
dated). Notice that we are al
ready cheating in adopting this
formulation of the problem.
Governor Reagan and the offi
cials of the University have
been addressing themselves to
the problem of making maxi
mum cuts in the cost of educa
tion while keeping losses in
quality and quantity at a mini
mum. By formulating the prob
lem the way we have we seem
to imply that it is possible to
reduce the cost of education
without impairing education at
all. In fact, it seems to me that
any reduction in the quality or
quantity of education would

render cuts in cost unaccept
able.
So are we back where we
started? Not exactly. We are
told that we must cut the "fat"
out of education. It is interest
ing that while this debate has
been carried on between the
Governor and the officials of the
University (students adding
their mass cry to the bleats of
these officials) no one has ef
fectively pointed out that the
"fat" (such as it may be) is
embodied in the administration
of the institution rather than
in the teachers and students.
When the politicians say
"cut out the fat", the admini
stration threatens to freeze on
admissions, cuts in faculty sal
aries and appointments. These
are precisely those aspects of
the university which should be
most protected; teaching cannot
effectively be abbreviated.
On the other hand, there are
many aspects of the administra
tion of the institutions which
can be reduced and compacted,
if not completely eliminated.
But the bureaucratic jealousies,
allegiances and arguments that
support these institions are ex
tremely complex and resolutely
held. Moreover it is not our
purpose here to assess the rela
tive merits of the numerous
programs and functions which
fall under the heading of ad
ministration, though such an as
sessment is sorely needed.
