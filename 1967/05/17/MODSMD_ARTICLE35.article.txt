# Judical Travesty
## 
### 
Monday's judicial proceedings were a fitting
sequel to the election disputes which precipi
tated them. They displayed the same farcical
mood and succeeded only in undermining the
respect and credibility of the Judicial Council
and many of those who appeared before it.
The procedural ignorance displayed by the
Council is inexcusable in a community which
loudly claims that students are competent to
exercise greater control over their lives than they
are allowed. Examples of the Council's sloppy
understanding of the cases being considered in
clude:
—uncertainty as to who made the charges in the
Senior Class final election case.
—failure to summon or contact several critical
witnesses in the same case.
—failure to determine originally whether the
entire May 9-10 ballot was invalid or whether

only the Senior Class presidential election would
have to be reconsidered.
—in the Hanen vs. Daily case, uncertainty as to
whether an institution can be accused of a Fun
damental Standard violation and, if so, what
can be done to the institution if it is found guilty.
Also to blame are those who brought the
charges to the Council. The final outcome of the
cases cannot help but make one wonder about
the sincerity of those who claimed that either
the Fundamental Standard or elections proced
ures had been violated.
A travesty has been made of an institution
which badly needs to command the respect of
this community. The lesson to be learned is that
the burden of proving that students can handle
their own affairs still rests with students and that
they will have to do a better job than Monday
night if they want to convince anyone.
