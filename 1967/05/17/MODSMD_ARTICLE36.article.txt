One clear indication of growing maturity, in a
university 110 less than a person, is the casting
aside of childhood toys, of dolls and cards and
axes. So it is that we cannot but draw encourage
ment from the altogether healthy display of
apathy with which the university community
has responded to the theft of the famed axe.
Only a short while ago the cry "THE AXE
IS STOLEN!" would have curdled the blood of
all true "Sons of the Stanford Red." But today
one can wonder with some hope if perhaps the
blood hasn't run a little thin. For, excepting
perhaps Axe Command the boys in Soto House,

the primary reaction to the theft appears to have
been a massive yawn.
Not that we are unalterably opposed to the
past, although most Stanford traditions seem
to hallow those ideals and customs that we hold
most insipid. But an axe is far more appropriate
to a farm than a university. The time has come
(or perhaps is long past) for Stanford to put
aside the games of its infancy. So we suggest
that when (or if) the axe is recovered, it be
hermetically sealed in concrete behind many
layers of glass and placed in the Museum along
with the other relics of the Stanford of yesterday.
