## 'Dialogue' Changes With Time 
### Bob Fishman 
One of the greatest serials
since The Perils of Pauline has
been occupying the ad columns
of the Daily since September.
I am referring, of course, to
the "dialogue" between Robert
Galvin, Chairman of Motorola,
Inc., and various members of
the academic community. The
students complain about grey
flannel suits, ulcers, inadequate
pension plans, poor food in the
company cafeteria and other
crucial problems besetting busi
ness. Mr. Galvin either denies
all these evils or attributes them
to his competitors.
Nonetheless, this series is un
deniably providing a very use
ful social service: the ad revenue
it brings in help to pay the
Daily's deficit. I believe, how
ever, that the ads would be far
more interesting if Mr. Galvin
dug a bit deeper into the files.
Although this series of letters
from a certain Elmer H. Waver
does not exist, it should:
In 1960
Dear Sir:
You are a profit mongering,
war-profiteering, labor squeez
ing monopolist! You and the
rest of your ulcerated conform
ists have forgotten what it
means to have a social consci

ence. If you ever had one, you've
already sold it to the highest
bidder. (It couldn't have been
worth much, anyway.) How can
you bear to look at yourself in
the mirror after you've been
robbing the American people
blind and polluting their minds
with your horrid advertising? I
hope you choke on your next
pate de foie gras!
With disgust,
Elmer H. Waver
Freshman
Dear Sir:
Although I realize the vital
contribution which business has
made to American life, I cannot
help but wonder if the tactics
which your company uses are
not occasionally infelicitous. For
example, I think your recent
attempt to take over that Latin
American country was poorly
timed. And, speaking as a pros
pective law student, I wonder
if the new constitution you pro
posed for that African country—
the one that invests all sov
ereignty in an import-export
agency—is entirely legal.
Here at home, I applaud your
public-spirited attempt to solve
the race problem, but I must
point out that "shipping thorn

all to Liberia" has been tried
and failed. I am aware, more
over, that monopolies are the
most efficient form of business
organization, so it seems to me
that radio prices should go
down, not up, since the forma
tion of your transistor monop
oly.
These are, of course, differ
ences in means, not ends, and
I'm sure they can b? resolved
by reasonable men reasoning
together.
Sincerely yours,
Elmer H. Waver
Senior
And In 1967
Dear Sir:
As a recent graduate of Ivy
League Law, I would like to
apply for a position in your
corporate law department. I
have always had the greatest
respect for you and for the great
company you helped to build.
My frequent letters point to the
continuing interest I have had
for Motorola. It is, after all,
men like you and companies
like yours who have made Am
erica what it is today.

yours,

Dear Sir:
As a recent graduate of Ivy
League Law, I would like to
apply for a position in your
corporate law department. I
have always had the greatest
respect for you and for the great
company you helped to build.
My frequent letters point to the
continuing interest I have had
for Motorola. It is, after all,
men like you and companies
like yours who have made Am
erica what it is today.
Very respectfully
yours,
Elmer H. Waver
One of the greatest serials
since The Perils of Pauline has
been occupying the ad columns
of the Daily since September.
I am referring, of course, to
the "dialogue" between Robert
Galvin, Chairman of Motorola,
Inc., and various members of
the academic community. The
students complain about grey
flannel suits, ulcers, inadequate
pension plans, poor food in the
company cafeteria and other
crucial problems besetting busi
ness. Mr. Galvin either denies
all these evils or attributes them
to his competitors.
Nonetheless, this series is un
deniably providing a very use
ful social service: the ad revenue
it brings in help to pay the
Daily's deficit. I believe, how
ever, that the ads would be far
more interesting if Mr. Galvin
dug a bit deeper into the files.
Although this series of letters
from a certain Elmer H. Waver
does not exist, it should:

Dear Sir:
You are a profit mongering,
war-profiteering, labor squeez
ing monopolist! You and the
rest of your ulcerated conform
ists have forgotten what it
means to have a social consci

ence. If you ever had one, you've
already sold it to the highest
bidder. (It couldn't have been
worth much, anyway.) How can
you bear to look at yourself in
the mirror after you've been
robbing the American people
blind and polluting their minds
with your horrid advertising? I
hope you choke on your next
pate de foie gras!
With disgust,

Dear Sir:
Although I realize the vital
contribution which business has
made to American life, I cannot
help but wonder if the tactics
which your company uses are
not occasionally infelicitous. For
example, I think your recent
attempt to take over that Latin
American country was poorly
timed. And, speaking as a pros
pective law student, I wonder
if the new constitution you pro
posed for that African country—
the one that invests all sov
ereignty in an import-export
agency—is entirely legal.
Here at home, I applaud your
public-spirited attempt to solve
the race problem, but I must
point out that "shipping thorn

all to Liberia" has been tried
and failed. I am aware, more
over, that monopolies are the
most efficient form of business
organization, so it seems to me
that radio prices should go
down, not up, since the forma
tion of your transistor monop
oly.
