## Moral Heritage Calls For Love 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In reading Mr. Schaefer's col
umn on the traitors I was de
lighted with Mr. Schaefer's ex
tensive knowledge of the Judeo-
Christian morai heritage (i.e.,
to lie is immoral). Although Mr.
Schaefer has the basics down,
he seems to have inadvertrntly
overlooked some minor points of
this heritage.
One point (buried deep in the
Old Testament) that Mr. Schaef
er seems to have missed is the
saying "Thou shalt not kill"
(this was attributed to someone
important, although I forget his
exact name). Another point Mr.
Schaefer missed, although seem
ingly little understood today and
stated by a minor prophet any
way, is the saying "A new com
mandment I give to you, that
you love one another. . . "
Besides these minor technical
points of protest I must con
gratulate Mr. Schaefer on an
extraordinary column, presented
and reasoned with the skill of
an Eleventh Century Christian.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Schaefer's article, "Mor
ality and Professor Newleft:
Treason, 'Peaeemonger Lies'?,"
upsets me greatly because it
exemplifies so clearly the lack
of communication between pro
ponents and opponents of the
war in Vietnam.
Too often, I think, we rein
force our opinions by listening
to what we want to hear rather
than seeking out the best avail
able information. Mr. Schaefer
has a unique opportunity to
"stand up and tell Prof. New
left and his devotees where to
get off" every Wednesday when
these "peace mongers" identify
themselves. However, I wish
Mr. Schaefer and others who
find their fellow students intol
erable would first take a few

minutes to talk with them, not
to them.

I wonder if Mr. Sohaefer has
read "The Diary of a Medical
Intern in Vietnam" (accom
panied by pictures) in the March
25, 1967 issue of The Saturday
Review. Perhaps he might take
V'the baby-burning myth" a
little more seriously if he did.
And. as I recall, the morality
of our Judeo-Christian heritage
has something to say about kill
ing as well as living.

Take Heart, Joel Kugelmass.
Mr. Martin Taylor's sugges
tion that you "go to New York
to eat with Jews" may sound
ominous. I hasten to reassure
you. Speaking from life-long
experience I can confidently
promise you that you will sur
vive. In fact, you may even en
joy it. The food, though some
what heavy and not at all as
good as Chinese cooking, is far
better than Stanford fare.
So, if you ever do venture
that far East, why not call my
parents? They will bo glad to
thoroughly stuff you (everyone
knows about Jewish mothers!)
They would even be glad to feed
Mr. Taylor, if he would give
it a whirl.
I do not, however, wish to
get Mr. Taylor in trouble with
J. Edgar Hoover. Though Mr.
Taylor is evidently a courageous
fellow who exposes, without
fear, shame, or thought, his in
imitable collection of prejudices
to public view, he might balk
at offending the guardians of
our society by so patently sub

versive an act. My mother will
understand.
If Mr. Taylor won't eat with
the Jews, I have another sug
gestion. Upon graduating, let
him join that exclusive hunting
and eating club headed by Geo
rge Lincoln Rockwell. I hear
they are actively tracking down
that elusive beast which pla
gues Mr. Taylor's dreams . . .
reality.

Editor, The Daily:
In reading Mr. Schaefer's col
umn on the traitors I was de
lighted with Mr. Schaefer's ex
tensive knowledge of the Judeo-
Christian morai heritage (i.e.,
to lie is immoral). Although Mr.
Schaefer has the basics down,
he seems to have inadvertrntly
overlooked some minor points of
this heritage.
One point (buried deep in the
Old Testament) that Mr. Schaef
er seems to have missed is the
saying "Thou shalt not kill"
(this was attributed to someone
important, although I forget his
exact name). Another point Mr.
Schaefer missed, although seem
ingly little understood today and
stated by a minor prophet any
way, is the saying "A new com
mandment I give to you, that
you love one another. . . "
Besides these minor technical
points of protest I must con
gratulate Mr. Schaefer on an
extraordinary column, presented
and reasoned with the skill of
an Eleventh Century Christian.

Mr. Schaefer's article, "Mor
ality and Professor Newleft:
Treason, 'Peaeemonger Lies'?,"
upsets me greatly because it
exemplifies so clearly the lack
of communication between pro
ponents and opponents of the
war in Vietnam.
Too often, I think, we rein
force our opinions by listening
to what we want to hear rather
than seeking out the best avail
able information. Mr. Schaefer
has a unique opportunity to
"stand up and tell Prof. New
left and his devotees where to
get off" every Wednesday when
these "peace mongers" identify
themselves. However, I wish
Mr. Schaefer and others who
find their fellow students intol
erable would first take a few

minutes to talk with them, not
to them.

I wonder if Mr. Sohaefer has
read "The Diary of a Medical

panied by pictures) in the March
25, 1967 issue of The Saturday
Review. Perhaps he might take

Mr. Martin Taylor's sugges
tion that you "go to New York
to eat with Jews" may sound
ominous. I hasten to reassure
you. Speaking from life-long
experience I can confidently
promise you that you will sur
vive. In fact, you may even en
joy it. The food, though some
what heavy and not at all as
good as Chinese cooking, is far
better than Stanford fare.
So, if you ever do venture
that far East, why not call my
parents? They will bo glad to
thoroughly stuff you (everyone
knows about Jewish mothers!)
They would even be glad to feed
Mr. Taylor, if he would give
it a whirl.
I do not, however, wish to
get Mr. Taylor in trouble with
J. Edgar Hoover. Though Mr.
Taylor is evidently a courageous
fellow who exposes, without
fear, shame, or thought, his in
imitable collection of prejudices
to public view, he might balk
at offending the guardians of
our society by so patently sub

versive an act. My mother will
understand.
If Mr. Taylor won't eat with
