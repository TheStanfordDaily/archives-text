# Judicial Council Declares Run-Off Election Invalid
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS HENRY MULLER 
Judicial Council early yesterday
morning declared the May 9-10 run-off
election invalid and called for a new
election.
The decision invalidates the election
in toto and will require a new ballot
for Senior Class President, Senior
Class Vice President, NSA Represen
tative, and the class-ranking refer
endum.
The Council directed Elections Com
missioner Bill Berry to hold another
election "in not less than four but
not more than ten days." Berry has
not yet set a date lor the contest.
Invalidate Election
According to the Council's decision,
defeated candidate for Senior Class
President Mark Fogelman had ap
pealed to invalidate the election on the
basis that Berry had "violated instruc
tions given him by the Council regard
ing the staffing of election polls."
Fogelman claimed last night that he
had brought no formal charges to the
Council. He said he had discussed
alleged elections violations with Coun
cil members Martin Gerry and Judy
Bader, who advised him that Judicial
Council would investigate the claims.
Gerry confirmed Fogelman's claim

and admitted that the Council's de
cision inaccurately represented Fogel
rnan's position.
Apparent Violations
At the hearing Fogelman presented
information regarding several appar
ent violations of campaign and elec
tion procedures and asked the Council
to investigate the validity of the elec
tion on the basis of these allegations.
The Council based its decision solely
on the manner in which the polling
places were manned.
On the day before the election, the
Council had ordered Berry to have
Student Police staff the polls during
the entire election and specifically in
formed Berry that he should post
pone the election if the Student Police
would not comply.
Council's Decision
According to the Council's decision,
th • polls had been manned on May 9
by supporters of Soleng Tom. The de
cision stated: "Since those who man
ned the polls were not chosen from an
impartial agency, the results of the
entire election must be invalidated."
The Council's decision further
stated that it is now impossible to de
termine whether there actually was
any bias on the part of those who

manned tho polls and that the Council
"is not in any sense reflecting upon
the integrity or good faith of Mr.
Tom."

Fogelman and his running-mate
Robin Wiseman last night presented
to The Daily a statement saying that
they would withdraw from the race in
light of the Judicial Council decision.
They later retracted that statement.
Contacted after submission of the
withdrawal statement, Gerry and
LASSU Speaker Tom Forstenzer said
that it would not affect the new elec
tion. Forstenzer said that either Fo
gelman and Wiseman would have to
run or the persons with the third
highest number of votes in the pri
mary would be put on the ballot.
Gerry and Forstenzer had no com
ment on the retraction of the with
drawal statement.
The Council also passed decisions
on three other cases involving the rec
ent ASSU presidential elections. The
Council ruled "not guilty" in the cases
involving charges against Joe Reich
and Jeff Kane; Joel Kugelmass, Paul
Rupert, Tom Forstenzer and Chris
Harte; and The Daily.

gelman and Wiseman would have to
run or the persons with the third
highest number of votes in the pri
mary would be put on the ballot.
Gerry and Forstenzer had no com
ment on the retraction of the with
drawal statement.
The Council also passed decisions
on three other cases involving the rec
ent ASSU presidential elections. The
Council ruled "not guilty" in the cases
involving charges against Joe Reich
and Jeff Kane; Joel Kugelmass, Paul
Rupert, Tom Forstenzer and Chris
Harte; and The Daily.
Judicial Council early yesterday
morning declared the May 9-10 run-off
election invalid and called for a new
election.
The decision invalidates the election
in toto and will require a new ballot
for Senior Class President, Senior
Class Vice President, NSA Represen
tative, and the class-ranking refer
endum.
The Council directed Elections Com
missioner Bill Berry to hold another
election "in not less than four but
not more than ten days." Berry has
not yet set a date lor the contest.
Invalidate Election
According to the Council's decision,
defeated candidate for Senior Class
President Mark Fogelman had ap
pealed to invalidate the election on the
basis that Berry had "violated instruc
tions given him by the Council regard
ing the staffing of election polls."
Fogelman claimed last night that he
had brought no formal charges to the
Council. He said he had discussed
alleged elections violations with Coun
cil members Martin Gerry and Judy
Bader, who advised him that Judicial
Council would investigate the claims.
Gerry confirmed Fogelman's claim

and admitted that the Council's de
cision inaccurately represented Fogel
rnan's position.
Apparent Violations
At the hearing Fogelman presented
information regarding several appar
ent violations of campaign and elec
tion procedures and asked the Council
to investigate the validity of the elec
tion on the basis of these allegations.
The Council based its decision solely
on the manner in which the polling
places were manned.
On the day before the election, the
Council had ordered Berry to have
Student Police staff the polls during
the entire election and specifically in
formed Berry that he should post
pone the election if the Student Police
would not comply.
Council's Decision
According to the Council's decision,
th • polls had been manned on May 9
by supporters of Soleng Tom. The de
cision stated: "Since those who man
ned the polls were not chosen from an
impartial agency, the results of the
entire election must be invalidated."
The Council's decision further
stated that it is now impossible to de
termine whether there actually was
any bias on the part of those who

manned tho polls and that the Council
"is not in any sense reflecting upon
the integrity or good faith of Mr.
Tom."
