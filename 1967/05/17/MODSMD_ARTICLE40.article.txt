## Wanted: One Axe' Beg, Buy Or Steal 
### Steve Gruber 
The Axe is still missing. The
symbol of six consecutive Big
Game victories by Stanford has
been stolen and no one has of
fered to give it back.
Admittedly, Big Game is still
six months away, but we must
take drastic action now, or our
long-standing reputation as the
number one Red Hot School
on the West Coast will be lost.
What can we do?
First, Axe Commission must
find a new Axe. There are sev
eral ways to do this: they call
go to the nearest hardware
store and buy one or they could
roll a Boy Scout and take his
hatchet. Either way, we get a
new Axe and nobody knows the
difference.
But times are changing here
at The Farm, and perhaps the
student body wants a new Big
Game symbol. Sure, an axe was
great in 1899, but "nobody uses
axes anymore.
Why not adopt a new symbol
— one that fits in with the Stan
ford of 1967?
A Monkey Wrench?
Suggestions have already
started coming in. One student
suggested that Axe Com pur
chase a "Big Game Monkey
Wrench." Why? "You can hold
it in either hand," the student,
a prominent ASSU leader, said.
A Lagunita coed wants a
Big Game Ice Pick. "I can hear
the yell now," she said, "Give
'em the Ice Pick, give 'em the
Ice Pick, give 'em the Ice Pick,
Whore? Right in the..."
Several physics majors feel
that a stack of IBM cards would
be the appropriate symbol. "If
Berkeley were to win another
Big Game — which doesn't seem
too likely — we would present
them the Big Game IBM Cards,"
one of the physics majors com

merited. "However, if they were
run through the computer, they
would erase its memory space."
A Wilbur resident suggests
that Axe Com designate the
Mausoleum as the Big Game
prize. "That way, if Berkeley
won, the Mausoleum would be
theirs. If they want to move it
back to Berkeley, they would
be welcome to." The Stanford
family, residents of the Mauso
leum. was unavailable for com
ment. Warren G. Wonka, spokes
man for the Stanford estate,
stated, "The idea is ludicrous.
They couldn't get it across the
Dumbarton Bridge."
Our Campus For Yours
Other students are interested
in making the Big Game award
more substantial. One Germany
group has submitted a formal
proposal to the Overseas Cam
pus Director, offering to bet
Stanford's Germany campus
against Berkeley's Germany
campus. The winner of the Big
Game this year would win both
of them. "It's a fantastic deal,"
the proposal said, "If we win,
we pick up an entire Germany
campus, complete with Ger
mans. If we lose, we'll still have
four campi left."
Axe Commission will prob
ably reject all of these ideas,
but they still have a problem
— no Axe. In order to justify
their continued existence — how
can you have an Axe Com with
out ati Axe? — they will either
have to find the missing Axe or
buy another one.
Finding the old Axe will prob
ably be impossible. But there's
still hope:
Eyerly's Hardware, when con
tacted by The Daily, said they
are willing to sell us a new
Axe for between six and nine
dollars.
Such a deal! ! !
