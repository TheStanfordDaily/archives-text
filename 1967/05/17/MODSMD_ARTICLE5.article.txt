# Vietnam Alternatives Considered
## 
### MARY JEANNE NEWTON SUZANNE DONNELLY 
A broad range of proposals for
disengagement from the war in Viet
nam were expressed last night in a
"community meeting" in Memorial
Auditorium.
According to David Ransom, an
English T.A. and an organizer of the
meeting, the purpose was to provide
"debate within the movement." He
feels that opposition to the war is
growing and that many different ideas
are being discussed. He believes it
is time these alternatives are dis
cussed with "our neighbors," and that
the meeting attempt an "analysis
of what is, and what is possible."
With Professor Michael Novak mod
erating, various members of the com
munity expressed alternatives to our
present policy in Vietnam.
Brooks Otis of the Classics Depart
ment prefaced his remarks by stating
that he is "not interested in protest
but in action." He questioned the
practicality of protest in the face of
the very practical problem of the
present situation.
Professor Otis proposed a commit
tee composed of experts on South
east Asia from about ten of the most
prestigious universities in the na
tion. This committee would attempt
to formulate a "clear statement of
minimal U.S. conditions for disen
gagement."
Peter Ware, a member of the Anti-
Draft Union, spoke on his joint state
ment with David Ransom. He sug

gested that the building of a base
of political action is a "long-term
project" that will not be effective, and
lhat what is needed is "radical ac
tion." "The time has come to move
from protest to resistance" by re
fusing to serve in the military.
Professor George Leppert of Mech
anical Engineering, while expressing
his proposal for political action,
stated his hope that all of the sug
gestions given would be effective and
"complement each other." Specifically,
he urged support of the California
Democratic Council's proposed en
dorsement of a slate of delegates to
the 1968 Democratic National Con
vention who are opposed to the pres
ent policy in Vietnam.
Stating that objectors to the war
"must say NO fo our government,"
Jay Neugeboren, English instructor,
called for mass civil disobedience of
perhaps 30,000 people. A letter is be
ing circulated among the faculty and
staff in support of this movement.
A number of others, including
Stuart McLean of UCCM, John Saari
of Students for a Democratic Society,
and proponents of Dr. Martin Luther
King's Vietnam Summer plan, ex
pressed their opinions at the meeting
and in a pamphlet of proposals.

Afternoon Session
In the afternoon session of "To
ward Disengagement" alternative na
tional policies were presented.

Military arid political do-escalation
is the most feasible step the United
States can take in Vietnam, Lyman
Van Slyke, Asst. Professor in History
asserted. Interdiction is not a valid
argument for continuation of bomb
ing North Vietnam, he said. We
should stop bombing, attempt to ne
gotiate with Hanoi, and disengage
from unconditional support of the
Saigon regime.
"Both sides have thus far demand
ed mutually unacceptable precondi
tions," Philip Banda, graduate stu
dent in Biophysics, stated. He pre
sented a possible compromise "as an
attempt to break through the impasse
surrounding peace "negotiations."
The United States, Banda proposed
would halt the recently stepped-up at
tacks on North Vietnam. And North
Vietnam would halt its artillery,
rocket and mortar attacks across the
DMZ, and let the International Red
Cross visit captured American pilots.
"It is unclear what the U.S. is fight
ing for," said Michael Novak, Asst.
Professor in Religion. Our troops are
told that they are fighting Commun
ism. Other goals stated are stopping
China's wars of national liberation
and halting aggression from the
North, he said.
The September 23rd elections in
South Vietnam for premier may force
the U.S. to clarify its motives for in
volvement in Vietnam, Novak con
cluded.

"debate within the movement." He
feels that opposition to the war is
growing and that many different ideas
are being discussed. He believes it
is time these alternatives are dis
cussed with "our neighbors," and that
the meeting attempt an "analysis
of what is, and what is possible."
With Professor Michael Novak mod
erating, various members of the com
munity expressed alternatives to our
present policy in Vietnam.
Brooks Otis of the Classics Depart
ment prefaced his remarks by stating
that he is "not interested in protest
but in action." He questioned the
practicality of protest in the face of
the very practical problem of the
present situation.
Professor Otis proposed a commit
tee composed of experts on South
east Asia from about ten of the most
prestigious universities in the na
tion. This committee would attempt
to formulate a "clear statement of
minimal U.S. conditions for disen
gagement."
Peter Ware, a member of the Anti-
Draft Union, spoke on his joint state
ment with David Ransom. He sug

gested that the building of a base
of political action is a "long-term
project" that will not be effective, and
lhat what is needed is "radical ac
tion." "The time has come to move
from protest to resistance" by re
fusing to serve in the military.
Professor George Leppert of Mech
anical Engineering, while expressing
his proposal for political action,
stated his hope that all of the sug
gestions given would be effective and
"complement each other." Specifically,
he urged support of the California
Democratic Council's proposed en
dorsement of a slate of delegates to
the 1968 Democratic National Con
vention who are opposed to the pres
ent policy in Vietnam.
Stating that objectors to the war
"must say NO fo our government,"
Jay Neugeboren, English instructor,
called for mass civil disobedience of
perhaps 30,000 people. A letter is be
ing circulated among the faculty and
staff in support of this movement.
A number of others, including
Stuart McLean of UCCM, John Saari
of Students for a Democratic Society,
and proponents of Dr. Martin Luther
King's Vietnam Summer plan, ex
pressed their opinions at the meeting
and in a pamphlet of proposals.

Afternoon Session
In the afternoon session of "To
ward Disengagement" alternative na
tional policies were presented.

Military arid political do-escalation
is the most feasible step the United
States can take in Vietnam, Lyman
Van Slyke, Asst. Professor in History
asserted. Interdiction is not a valid
argument for continuation of bomb
ing North Vietnam, he said. We
should stop bombing, attempt to ne
gotiate with Hanoi, and disengage
from unconditional support of the
Saigon regime.
"Both sides have thus far demand
ed mutually unacceptable precondi
tions," Philip Banda, graduate stu
dent in Biophysics, stated. He pre
sented a possible compromise "as an
attempt to break through the impasse
surrounding peace "negotiations."
The United States, Banda proposed
would halt the recently stepped-up at
tacks on North Vietnam. And North
Vietnam would halt its artillery,
rocket and mortar attacks across the
DMZ, and let the International Red
Cross visit captured American pilots.
"It is unclear what the U.S. is fight
ing for," said Michael Novak, Asst.
Professor in Religion. Our troops are
told that they are fighting Commun
ism. Other goals stated are stopping
China's wars of national liberation
and halting aggression from the
North, he said.
The September 23rd elections in
South Vietnam for premier may force
the U.S. to clarify its motives for in
volvement in Vietnam, Novak con
cluded.
A broad range of proposals for
disengagement from the war in Viet
nam were expressed last night in a
"community meeting" in Memorial
Auditorium.
According to David Ransom, an
English T.A. and an organizer of the
meeting, the purpose was to provide
"debate within the movement." He
