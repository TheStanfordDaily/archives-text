# Lag Mess Monster Could Be Sunnyvale Sam On Sabbatical
## 
### 
The monster discovered in Lag
Mess Sunday afternoon fits the de
scription of a 16-year-old Mississippi
alligator named Sam.
Sam has been missing for some
time from the outdoor biology lab of
Fremont High School in Sunnyvale.
Science teacher Frank Robinson said
he was organizing a search party to
come Thursday with nets and ropes
to try to recapture Sam. Robinson
added that Sam is not at all vicious
and has never bitten anybody.
According to Robinson, the habits
of alligators are such that Sam will
probably spend a good deal of his
time soaking up the sun on the banks
of Lag Mess, with only an occasional
dip in the water to cool off. Further
more, he will probably stake out a
territory in the lake and stick close

to it, never venturing far from shore.
If he manages to eat properly, Sam
will grow to about 10 or 12 feet in
length by the time he is sixty years
old, and might live to be 100.
For four years, Sam has been kept
at Fremont High in his own cage,
surrounded by four-foot stakes and a
barbed-wire fence. Robinson said re
ports reaching him were that Sam
was kidnapped by Foothill College
students, but he had no conclusive
proof.
If startled, Sam would take to the
bottom of the lake. In cooler weather,
he could stay there for as much as
24 hours, but in warm weather no
more than three or four.
Robinson said Sam could live on
birds, which often appear around Lag
Mess, but his favorite food is rats.
