# Do High School Visits Cause Biased Admissions?
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO Second of Two Parts News Analysis 
The on-campus sorting process is just one
part — though a major one — of the com
plex Stanford admissions system. The report
on admissions submitted to the Humanities
and Sciences faculty goes beyond those pro
cedures used to select the entering fresh
man class from the thousands of applica
tions received each year.
According to that report, the current poli
cies and procedures are influenced by cer
tain "constraints" working on both the Uni
versity and the admissions staff. "The admis
sions office is concerned with maintaining
good relations with the faculty, the alumni,
and California. Clearly the legacy preference,
the faculty-staff criterion, and the fact that
a large proportion of the freshman class is
from California are manifestations of these
constraints."
In addition, the recruiting program of visit
ing high schools across tho country is co
ordinated with alumni groups, and the ma
jority of these recruiting missions occur
where strong alumni associations function.

The report emphasizes these factors "operate
in subtle and sometimes conflicting ways, and
it is not clear at any one time which con
straint is being responded to. For example,
the predominance of students from Califor
nia is certainly responsive to good alumni re
lations and relations with California, but may
not bo responsive to faculty interests in a
geographically more diverse student body."
High School Visits
In connection with school visitations, the
report includes a breakdown of the number
of private and public schools visited in var
ious geographic areas. In the partial list in
cluded below, the first figure is the number
of public schools visited, while the number in
the parenthesis represents the private schools:
• New England l (34)
• New York 4 (3)
• Middle Atlantic 5 (19>
• South 10 (7)
• Pacific (excl. Calif.) 65 (10)
• California 236 (23)
Douglas Walker, director of freshman ad
missions, said last week that ho had not yet
read the Humanities and Sciences report, but

that the noticeable geographic imbalance of
high school visitations was due to a lack of
funds and staff. He explained that the admis
sions office has to rely on alumni in New
York to assist in publicizing Stanford and
encouraging students to apply.
Facility Role
Though the report makes no definite recom
mendations concerning the composition of
the student body, it does pose several ques
tions about the role of the faculty in this
area. "It seems that the faculty has not al
ways expressed its concerns; indeed as a
faculty it has never even formulated them."
The report questions the appropriateness
of soliciting faculty consensus regarding the
compositions of the freshman class and the
possibility of creating a mechanism to medi
ate the conflicting interests and pressures ap
plied on freshman admissions.
Financial aids is also related to admissions,
and the report states that candidates' finan
cial n >eds sometimes do affect admissions de
cisions. Professor William Clebsch, chairman
of th > Humanities and Sciences committee on
admissions, explained that Stanford's scholar

ship funds are extremely low, but he ques
tioned the point at which monetary consider
ations should enter into the admissions pro
cedures. He said that his committee did not
study financial awards policies and proce
dures, but wonders if this should be done by
a faculty committee.
"A" Candidate
The report refers to the practice of send
ing "A letters" to a number of desirable ap
plicants to inform them of their acceptance
to the University several months before the
regular acceptance letters are mailed. For
the class of 1966, 222 of these letters were
sent, and 118 of the recipients enrolled. The
admissions office considers this return rate
to be quite good considering the caliber of
these applicants and the other schools to
which they are accepted. The possibility of
expanding this program is another point
offered for consideration by the faculty.
One of the final items mentioned in the
report is the data compiled and published by
Dr. John Black of Counseling and Testing
Services. The so called 'Black Report" was
based on questionnaires administered to more
than 2(H),000 freshmen at 307 univeicities, in

eluding 1,245 Stanford freshmen. The Black
Report compares the statistics from Stanford
with those from private and public univer
sities.
As the Humanities and Sciences report
points out, the Black data indicates that in
some characteristics Stanford freshmen dif
fer markedly from those at other private uni
versities. "Are these differences reflected in
the entire pool of applications to Stanford,
or are they a result of selective admissions,
recruiting or financial aid?"
liOving Care-
Professor Claude Simpson, chairman of
the Humanities and Sciences executive com
mittee, emphasized the intricacies of the ad
missions procedures. "It can't always be done
with the loving care we might want to give
it,"he said. He explained that the committee
that presented the report on admissions is
preparing recommendations in the form of
resolutions or motions for the meeting of
the Humanities and Sciences faculty next
Monday. He said that the faculty committee
would ultimately forward its findings and
recommendations to the Study of Education
at Stanford Steering Committee.

Douglas Walker, director of freshman ad
missions, said last week that ho had not yet
read the Humanities and Sciences report, but

that the noticeable geographic imbalance of
high school visitations was due to a lack of
funds and staff. He explained that the admis
sions office has to rely on alumni in New
York to assist in publicizing Stanford and
encouraging students to apply.
Facility Role
Though the report makes no definite recom
mendations concerning the composition of
the student body, it does pose several ques
tions about the role of the faculty in this
area. "It seems that the faculty has not al
ways expressed its concerns; indeed as a
faculty it has never even formulated them."
The report questions the appropriateness
of soliciting faculty consensus regarding the
compositions of the freshman class and the
possibility of creating a mechanism to medi
ate the conflicting interests and pressures ap
plied on freshman admissions.
Financial aids is also related to admissions,
and the report states that candidates' finan
cial n >eds sometimes do affect admissions de
cisions. Professor William Clebsch, chairman
of th > Humanities and Sciences committee on
admissions, explained that Stanford's scholar

ship funds are extremely low, but he ques
tioned the point at which monetary consider
ations should enter into the admissions pro
cedures. He said that his committee did not
study financial awards policies and proce
dures, but wonders if this should be done by
a faculty committee.
"A" Candidate
The report refers to the practice of send
ing "A letters" to a number of desirable ap
plicants to inform them of their acceptance
to the University several months before the
regular acceptance letters are mailed. For
the class of 1966, 222 of these letters were
sent, and 118 of the recipients enrolled. The
admissions office considers this return rate
to be quite good considering the caliber of
these applicants and the other schools to
which they are accepted. The possibility of
expanding this program is another point
offered for consideration by the faculty.
One of the final items mentioned in the
report is the data compiled and published by
Dr. John Black of Counseling and Testing
Services. The so called 'Black Report" was
based on questionnaires administered to more
than 2(H),000 freshmen at 307 univeicities, in

eluding 1,245 Stanford freshmen. The Black
Report compares the statistics from Stanford
with those from private and public univer
sities.
As the Humanities and Sciences report
points out, the Black data indicates that in
some characteristics Stanford freshmen dif
fer markedly from those at other private uni
versities. "Are these differences reflected in
the entire pool of applications to Stanford,
or are they a result of selective admissions,
recruiting or financial aid?"
liOving Care-
Professor Claude Simpson, chairman of
the Humanities and Sciences executive com
mittee, emphasized the intricacies of the ad
missions procedures. "It can't always be done
with the loving care we might want to give
it,"he said. He explained that the committee
that presented the report on admissions is
preparing recommendations in the form of
resolutions or motions for the meeting of
the Humanities and Sciences faculty next
Monday. He said that the faculty committee
would ultimately forward its findings and
recommendations to the Study of Education
at Stanford Steering Committee.
The on-campus sorting process is just one
part — though a major one — of the com
plex Stanford admissions system. The report
on admissions submitted to the Humanities
and Sciences faculty goes beyond those pro
cedures used to select the entering fresh
man class from the thousands of applica
tions received each year.
According to that report, the current poli
cies and procedures are influenced by cer
tain "constraints" working on both the Uni
versity and the admissions staff. "The admis
sions office is concerned with maintaining
good relations with the faculty, the alumni,
and California. Clearly the legacy preference,
the faculty-staff criterion, and the fact that
a large proportion of the freshman class is
from California are manifestations of these
constraints."
In addition, the recruiting program of visit
ing high schools across tho country is co
ordinated with alumni groups, and the ma
jority of these recruiting missions occur
where strong alumni associations function.

The report emphasizes these factors "operate
in subtle and sometimes conflicting ways, and
it is not clear at any one time which con
straint is being responded to. For example,
the predominance of students from Califor
nia is certainly responsive to good alumni re
lations and relations with California, but may
not bo responsive to faculty interests in a
geographically more diverse student body."

which they are accepted. The possibility of
expanding this program is another point
offered for consideration by the faculty.
One of the final items mentioned in the
report is the data compiled and published by
Dr. John Black of Counseling and Testing
Services. The so called 'Black Report" was
based on questionnaires administered to more
than 2(H),000 freshmen at 307 univeicities, in

eluding 1,245 Stanford freshmen. The Black
Report compares the statistics from Stanford
with those from private and public univer
sities.
As the Humanities and Sciences report
points out, the Black data indicates that in
some characteristics Stanford freshmen dif
fer markedly from those at other private uni
versities. "Are these differences reflected in
the entire pool of applications to Stanford,
or are they a result of selective admissions,
recruiting or financial aid?"
liOving Care-
Professor Claude Simpson, chairman of
the Humanities and Sciences executive com
mittee, emphasized the intricacies of the ad
missions procedures. "It can't always be done
with the loving care we might want to give
it,"he said. He explained that the committee
that presented the report on admissions is
preparing recommendations in the form of
resolutions or motions for the meeting of
the Humanities and Sciences faculty next
Monday. He said that the faculty committee
would ultimately forward its findings and
recommendations to the Study of Education
at Stanford Steering Committee.
The on-campus sorting process is just one
part — though a major one — of the com
plex Stanford admissions system. The report
on admissions submitted to the Humanities
and Sciences faculty goes beyond those pro
cedures used to select the entering fresh
man class from the thousands of applica
tions received each year.
According to that report, the current poli
cies and procedures are influenced by cer
tain "constraints" working on both the Uni
versity and the admissions staff. "The admis
sions office is concerned with maintaining
good relations with the faculty, the alumni,
and California. Clearly the legacy preference,
the faculty-staff criterion, and the fact that
a large proportion of the freshman class is
from California are manifestations of these
constraints."
In addition, the recruiting program of visit
ing high schools across tho country is co
ordinated with alumni groups, and the ma
jority of these recruiting missions occur
where strong alumni associations function.

The report emphasizes these factors "operate
in subtle and sometimes conflicting ways, and
it is not clear at any one time which con
straint is being responded to. For example,
the predominance of students from Califor
nia is certainly responsive to good alumni re
lations and relations with California, but may
not bo responsive to faculty interests in a
geographically more diverse student body."
High School Visits
In connection with school visitations, the
report includes a breakdown of the number
of private and public schools visited in var
ious geographic areas. In the partial list in
cluded below, the first figure is the number
of public schools visited, while the number in
the parenthesis represents the private schools:
• New England l (34)
• New York 4 (3)
• Middle Atlantic 5 (19>
• South 10 (7)
• Pacific (excl. Calif.) 65 (10)
• California 236 (23)
Douglas Walker, director of freshman ad
missions, said last week that ho had not yet
read the Humanities and Sciences report, but

that the noticeable geographic imbalance of
high school visitations was due to a lack of
funds and staff. He explained that the admis
sions office has to rely on alumni in New
York to assist in publicizing Stanford and
encouraging students to apply.
Facility Role
Though the report makes no definite recom
mendations concerning the composition of
the student body, it does pose several ques
tions about the role of the faculty in this
area. "It seems that the faculty has not al
ways expressed its concerns; indeed as a
faculty it has never even formulated them."
The report questions the appropriateness
of soliciting faculty consensus regarding the
compositions of the freshman class and the
possibility of creating a mechanism to medi
ate the conflicting interests and pressures ap
plied on freshman admissions.
Financial aids is also related to admissions,
and the report states that candidates' finan
cial n >eds sometimes do affect admissions de
cisions. Professor William Clebsch, chairman
of th > Humanities and Sciences committee on
admissions, explained that Stanford's scholar

ship funds are extremely low, but he ques
tioned the point at which monetary consider
ations should enter into the admissions pro
cedures. He said that his committee did not
study financial awards policies and proce
dures, but wonders if this should be done by
a faculty committee.
"A" Candidate
The report refers to the practice of send
ing "A letters" to a number of desirable ap
plicants to inform them of their acceptance
to the University several months before the
regular acceptance letters are mailed. For
the class of 1966, 222 of these letters were
sent, and 118 of the recipients enrolled. The
admissions office considers this return rate
to be quite good considering the caliber of
these applicants and the other schools to
which they are accepted. The possibility of
expanding this program is another point
offered for consideration by the faculty.
