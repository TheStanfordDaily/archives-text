## 'Crazy Quilt' Story Too Long; Narration, Acting Mas Pitfalls 
### DAVID PROCHASKA 
John Korty's Crazy Quilt
now playing at the Bijou in
Paly, is one of those films you
hate to criticize. There are so
few good American films that
are not made in Hollywood or
in the Underground, it is too
bad Crazy Quilt is not better
than it is.
There are a number of rea
sons to expect more, most of
them stemming from the fact
it was not made in Hollywood.
Unlike the all-too-typical Holly
wood collective creation, Crazy
Quilt is primarily the work of
Korty, who produced, directed,
photographed and edited it.
Without becoming embroiled
in an argument of the validity of
auteur theory — the director
is the single most important
creative element in a film — I
think it is safe to say Holly
wood too often obliterates in
dividuality in its search for the
lowest common audience de
nominator.
Crazy Quilt is different. We
can assume the finished film is
pretty nearly what Korty want
ed. The main problem in mak
ing a film the way you want is
convincing someone else to pay
for it. Crazy Quilt lacks the
fancy studio trappings, the
"name" actors and the techni
cal excellence possible with a
Hollywood-sized budget, but
scarcely seems to miss them. It
was shot on location in San
Francisco with actors from the
now-defunct Actox-s' Workshop.
The basis of the movie, "The
Illusionless Man and the Vision
ary Maid" by Allen Wheelis, is
quite promising. Henry (Tom
Hosqui) has absolutely no illu
sions about anything. He is
never discouraged by life be
cause ho never expects anything
from it. Henry meets Laura
belle (Ina Mela) who believes
in everything— including Henry.
Naturally, they marry.
The rest of Crazy Quilt
deals with their trying to live
together. When Laurabelle loses
her baby she blames Henry and
moves out. She takes up with
a series of men including an

actor who pilfers her box office
receipts, and Jim the fisherman
who already has three wives.
Laurabelle rejoins Henry.
A series of mishaps befall
them. Henry quits his job as
a termite exterminator. Laura
belle wins and loses the Irish
Sweepstakes the same day.
Henry builds a house which
burns down. He builds another
and the bank forecloses. Their
pride and joy — daughter Noel
— leaves home with a Hell's
Angels-type. We leave them
gray and aged but together.
The idea of pairing off a
thoroughgoing realist and ideal
ist has real possibilities. Unfor
tunately, the idea of adapting
Wheelis' story to the screen has
inherent pitfalls. There is time
to talk only about one of these
— length.
There is simply too much
story to convey in little more
than one hour. Crazy Quilt is
a series of sketches attempting
to be scenes. There is time
neither to develop nor to dif
ferentiate and effectively relate
these sketches.

Korty tries to solve this prob
lem by using a narrator (Bur
gess Meredith) to condense the
action. The device is successful
when a counterpoint is estab
lished between narration and
image. The narrator tells us
Laurabelle fixed Henry a differ
ent dessert every night during
their first month of marriage,
but what we see is a cake in
the shape of a termite.
But the device of narration
in film also has inherent pit
falls. It is very easy for the
images to merely illustrate the
narration, like a slide lecture,
and thus become subservient to
the narration. This is what hap
pens too much of the time in
Crazy Quilt. (Laurabelle's pets,
the burning house).
In the case of narration as
well as other elements (photo
graphy, acting), "Crazy Quilt"
relies too much on the original
story and too little on the film
medium to produce its effect.
Co-featured is Jacques Tati's
idea of a comedy, Mon Onele
(1958).

Crazy Quilt. (Laurabelle's pets,
the burning house).
In the case of narration as
well as other elements (photo
graphy, acting), "Crazy Quilt"
relies too much on the original
story and too little on the film
medium to produce its effect.
Co-featured is Jacques Tati's
idea of a comedy, Mon Onele
(1958).
John Korty's Crazy Quilt
now playing at the Bijou in
Paly, is one of those films you
hate to criticize. There are so
few good American films that
are not made in Hollywood or
in the Underground, it is too
bad Crazy Quilt is not better
than it is.
There are a number of rea
sons to expect more, most of
them stemming from the fact
it was not made in Hollywood.
Unlike the all-too-typical Holly
wood collective creation, Crazy
Quilt is primarily the work of
Korty, who produced, directed,
photographed and edited it.
Without becoming embroiled
in an argument of the validity of
auteur theory — the director
is the single most important
creative element in a film — I
think it is safe to say Holly
wood too often obliterates in
dividuality in its search for the
lowest common audience de
nominator.
Crazy Quilt is different. We
can assume the finished film is
pretty nearly what Korty want
ed. The main problem in mak
ing a film the way you want is
convincing someone else to pay
for it. Crazy Quilt lacks the
fancy studio trappings, the
"name" actors and the techni
cal excellence possible with a
Hollywood-sized budget, but
scarcely seems to miss them. It
was shot on location in San
Francisco with actors from the
now-defunct Actox-s' Workshop.
The basis of the movie, "The
Illusionless Man and the Vision
ary Maid" by Allen Wheelis, is
quite promising. Henry (Tom
Hosqui) has absolutely no illu
sions about anything. He is
never discouraged by life be
cause ho never expects anything
from it. Henry meets Laura
belle (Ina Mela) who believes
in everything— including Henry.
Naturally, they marry.
The rest of Crazy Quilt
deals with their trying to live
together. When Laurabelle loses
her baby she blames Henry and
moves out. She takes up with
a series of men including an

actor who pilfers her box office
receipts, and Jim the fisherman
who already has three wives.
Laurabelle rejoins Henry.
A series of mishaps befall
them. Henry quits his job as
a termite exterminator. Laura
belle wins and loses the Irish
Sweepstakes the same day.
Henry builds a house which
burns down. He builds another
and the bank forecloses. Their
pride and joy — daughter Noel
— leaves home with a Hell's
Angels-type. We leave them
gray and aged but together.
The idea of pairing off a
thoroughgoing realist and ideal
ist has real possibilities. Unfor
tunately, the idea of adapting
Wheelis' story to the screen has
inherent pitfalls. There is time
to talk only about one of these
— length.
There is simply too much
story to convey in little more
than one hour. Crazy Quilt is
a series of sketches attempting
to be scenes. There is time
neither to develop nor to dif
ferentiate and effectively relate
these sketches.

Korty tries to solve this prob
lem by using a narrator (Bur
gess Meredith) to condense the
action. The device is successful
when a counterpoint is estab
lished between narration and
image. The narrator tells us
Laurabelle fixed Henry a differ
ent dessert every night during
their first month of marriage,
but what we see is a cake in
the shape of a termite.
But the device of narration
in film also has inherent pit
falls. It is very easy for the
images to merely illustrate the
narration, like a slide lecture,
and thus become subservient to
the narration. This is what hap
pens too much of the time in
Crazy Quilt. (Laurabelle's pets,
the burning house).
