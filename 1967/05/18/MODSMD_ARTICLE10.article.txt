## 'Night Games' Script Lacking 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
The critics gave Night Games
a mixed reception when it was
brought to the San Francisco
Film Festival. Shirley Temple
was provoked. Now it is being
shown at the Fine Arts Theatre
in Palo Alto.
The director of Night Games
explores the secret regions of
the mind, a camera in one hand,
a Freudian primer in the other.
How often must the public be
subjected to the amoral bore
dom of the decadent rich in films
which purport to be "bold" and
"honest"?
Clinical Sex Not Artistic
Being bold, one must also be
discrete and this film is often
coarse, and clinical, pretending
to be artistic. It tells the story

of a man's search for heterosex
ual maturity, slightly impaired
by the fact that his mother en
joyed sleeping with him.
His fiancee comes to live in
the same splendidly furnished
house he grew up in and bears
a striking resemblance to his
mother.
With carefully framed, intelli
gent shots, the past is juxta
posed to the present as the hand
of a man pushes open a door
through which the child he was
emerges. This effect achieves
the simultaneity of the return
in time, but is overused.
The suggested is often more
powerful and tasteful. Where
the director has broken through
conventions in his search, he has
also sacrificed his liberty.

There are several delightfully
insane moments in this film
which otherwise lacks humor.
The boy and his aunt Astrid en
joyed coloring eggs to represent
the people of the house. They
ate the insides of the eggs and
discovered the taste of nothing
ness. The boy suggestively cap
tures the quiet, bewildered loss
of innocence in the adolescent.
His mime and movements corre
spond convincingly to the grown
man's former self.
The man's acting is overdra
matic, his wife isn't tortured
enough, and the boy's mother's
performance is polished but
lacks nuance. In general, these
competent actors suffer from an
unimaginative script. Night
Games is a miss.
