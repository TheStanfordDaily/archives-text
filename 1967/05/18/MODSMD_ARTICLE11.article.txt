# Lute Class To Give Concert
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
On May 26 in Dinkelspiel the
Music Department will present
an extremely unusual concert of
rare lute music. It is doubtful
if such a concert could be pre
sented in any other place in the
United States. Many of the
pieces will be having their first
performance in modern times.
The theme of the concert is
the lute in ensemble with other
instruments, including different
lutes. Lute duets, trios, and quar
tets will be performed. Most of
these come from the late six
teenth and early seventeenth
centuries.
The lutenists, so rare to find
in one place, are all members
of a lute class taught by Stan
ford Professor Stanley Buetens,
director of the concert. They
have formed the first modern
lute quartet and have already
played in concerts at Berkeley
and Mill Valley.
Four Tunings
Members of the Lute Quartet
are Stanley Buetens himself,
Joan Myers, Lyle Nordstrom,
and George Olczak. The quar
tets and trios that will be per
formed on May 26 require four
differently tuned lutes. The tun
ing of the instruments is in it
self quite a feat.

Three members of the Quar
tet will take up other instru
ments for a performance of the
Morley Consorts which require
in addition to the lute (Buetens),
a violin (Kenneth Goldsmith),
a bass transverse flute (Her
bert Myers), cittern (Nord
strom), pandora (Olczak), and
a bass viol (Myers).
This music is rarely perform
ed because of the unusual in
struments required.
Four voices will join the lutes

in two pieces by Emanuel Adrian
sen (written in 1534). The sing
ers are Anne Gamble, Ronnie
Blakely, Nile Norton, and Larry
Hill. Buetens and Mrs. Myers
will perform Dowland's "My
Lord Chamberlain's Galliard for
two to play on one lute".
The program will end with a
grand Balletto by Pietro Paolo
Melii (written in 1616) for 10
instruments, most of them
either lutes or some other pluck
ed instrument.
