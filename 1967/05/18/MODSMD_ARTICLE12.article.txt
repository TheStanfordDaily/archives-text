# Church Drama
## 
### 
A couple of weeks ago the
ever fecund Ram's Head pro
duced "Spring One-Acts." A
number of their numbers were
involved in last week's rather
successful opera production
Gianni Schicchi.
Their next production, Fry's
religious drama A Sleep Of Pris
oners, is being presented in Me
morial Church starting Friday
night and free of charge. Any
thing presented in Memorial
is free: organ recitals, sermons
and pageants, and we are glad
to note that attendance on Fri
day carries no obligation to
catch Memorial Church's more
orthodox Sunday spot.
