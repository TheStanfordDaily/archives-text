A fund for research in en
cephalitis has been set up in
memory of Gary Fleener, who
died as a result of the disease
on February 1, 1967 during his
stay at Stanford-in-France XIII.
A representative of the com
mittee to further the expansion
of the fund stated, "Because of
Gary's amicable personality and
his tendency to form close con
tacts, his death was a great loss
by the group."
"This feeling was expressed in
the holding of both Catholic and
Protestant memorial services
and the establishment of the
fund with an initial contribution
to the Stanford Merical Center."
Encephalitis has become a
pressing problem in medicine
today, as its causes are relatively
unknown and no definite cure
has been discovered.
The fund has been established
as a permanent memorial and
will be continually open for do
nations. Donations can be sent
to: Gary Fleener Memorial
Fund, c/o Dr. Robert J. Glaser,
Dean of the School of Medicine,
Stanford Medical Center, Palo
Alto, California, 94304.
Chocks should be made pay
able to Stanford University with
an indication that they are for
the fund. All contributions are
tax-deductible and an acknowl
edgement of the gift will be
made through a receipt.
Any further questions may be
address to George Breck 327-
2920, ext. 653.
