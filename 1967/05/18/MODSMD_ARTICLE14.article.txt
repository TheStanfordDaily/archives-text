# University Expecting Monetary Morass As Alumni Financial Support Falls Short
## 
### CHARLES THIERIOT 
It seems to be a well known
and accepted fact among stu
dents that Stanford is a fantas
tically wealthy university. This
is a nice preconception except
for the fact that it happens to
be completely false.
Stanford is not only not
wealthy, but it becomes a real
problem each year to scrape to
gether enough money to cover
basic operating expenses.
Few students realize that the
tuition they pay each quarter
only covers one half of their
educational expenses. Each stu
dent receives, in effect, a scholar
ship for the fifty per cent of his
tuition which he is not asked to
pay.
In 1966, for example, the edu

cation per student cost Stanford
$3,650, more than double the cost
of tuition.
The basic educational budget
of an independent university is
supported by endowment in
come, tuition, and expendable
gifts. Endowment and tuition
are the most regular elements.
Stanford A Low 25th
Although Stanford competes
academically with such univers
ities as Harvard and Yale, there
is great disparity in the amount
of yearly endowment. Stanford
ranks seventh in size of endow
ment among United States col
leges and universities. However,
it places twenty-fifth to thirtieth
in endowment per student,
which is a far more realistic
comparison.
In other words, the Univers

ity is not getting the necessary
support from alumni which is
desperately needed to retain the
high academic standing which is
now enjoyed.
To point out just how drastic
this lack of support is, during
the 1966-67 year at Harvard, 70.5
per cent of the students con
tributed to the university as
compared witli 9.9 per cent at
Stanford during the same year.
The University also largely
depends on gifts from busi
nesses and foundations not allili
ated with Stanford, but the Uni
versity has no right to expect
any financial help from outside
sources when it can not show
faith from its own students.
Also, without the use of a
large endowment, the university
becomes subject to momentary
pressures. Like any other busi
ness, an independent university
can not operate to the best of
its own advantage if it must be
wary of every dollar it spends.
Stanford Poor?
It is hard for people to believe
that Stanford is in financial dif
ficulties when they see all the
building going on around the
campus.

However, in doing financial
planning, Stanford must commit
funds in advance of their
receipt. Other institutions, such
as Harvard, can plan twelve
months in advance, and draw on
funds collected the previous
year. . â€¢'
In rtlio past;' Stanford has
capitalized heavily on situations
without money at hand by tak
ing chances, but that is no way
to run a university. Also, with
out a larger endowment the Uni
versity can not offer professors
the salaries and facilities which
they want and need.
No Relief In Sight
The yearly income is divided
in the following proportions: en
dowment 19 per cent, tuition
and fees 46 per cent, gifts and
non-government grants 2G per
cent, and 9 per cent from other
sources such as unrestricted
funds invested temporarily.
In the next five years, total
expenses for the university will
more than double, and quite ob
viously the slack must be taken
up by a much greater support
from ever increasing numbers
of alumni.
