# Wayne State Secret Files Trigger Student Protests
## 
### 
(CPS) — Discovery of secret
administration flies on political
and personal activities of stu
dents at Wayne State Univer
sity has triggered a series of
student protests and demands
for greater control in university
affairs.
President William R. Keast
had previously denied the exis
tence of the files, saying that if
such files did exist he would
have them destroyed immedi
ately.
Last week, however, the Vice-
President for Student Affairs,
James P. McCormick, agreed to
inspect the Safety and Security
office with two students, Charles
Larson, Chairman of the Stu
dent-Faculty Council (S-FC) and
Dena Clamage, head of the cam
pus Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS).
Locked Files
McCormick ordered the In
vestigation department head,
Edward Stogdill, to open the
files to "put all the grievance
to rest once and for all."
Stogdill as first refused to
unlock the file cabinets. When
the records were opened, the
students discovered, to McCor
mick's surprise, newspaper clip
pings from demonstrations, rec
ords of arrests for homosexual
ity and files on mentally dis
turbed people.
In addition, the files contained
records and charges of sex of
fenders, paroled convicts attend
ing the university, and pam
phlets of campus organizations,
most frequently the Young So
cialist Alliance.
Following the discovery of the
files, Donald F. Stevens, head
of University Safety, said there

was nothing incriminating in
the records. He agreed, however,
to destroy them.
'No Idea'
"I had no idea they were
there," he said. "It's been so
long since I looked at them."
Students reacted to the dis
closure by staging a 24-hour
vigil outside the president's of
fice and organizing a mass dem
onstration to protest the "lack
of student involvement in uni
versity aflairs."
A group of 28 students pre
sented a mandate for change de
manding more student power on
campus. The demands included
the establishment of investiga
tory committees "with full ac
cess to relevant information in
areas of university administra
tive concern, such as Security
Files."
Demands
Other student demands were:
• students must be voting
members of each Presidential
Advisory Committee;
• a student on the Board of
Governors to become a voting
member;
• a mechanism for binding
student, faculty, and administra
tion referendum on university
affairs;
• administrators should be
selected by those people whom
they directly serve;
• "students and faculty must
have sole decision-making power
in the areas of basic academic
policy."
The students, meanwhile, have
suspended their protests until
May 11, when they have demand
ed that President Keast give
his opinions on the six point
mandate.

student protests and demands
for greater control in university
affairs.
President William R. Keast
had previously denied the exis
tence of the files, saying that if
such files did exist he would
have them destroyed immedi
ately.
Last week, however, the Vice-
President for Student Affairs,
James P. McCormick, agreed to
inspect the Safety and Security
office with two students, Charles
Larson, Chairman of the Stu
dent-Faculty Council (S-FC) and
Dena Clamage, head of the cam
pus Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS).
Locked Files
McCormick ordered the In
vestigation department head,
Edward Stogdill, to open the
files to "put all the grievance
to rest once and for all."
Stogdill as first refused to
unlock the file cabinets. When
the records were opened, the
students discovered, to McCor
mick's surprise, newspaper clip
pings from demonstrations, rec
ords of arrests for homosexual
ity and files on mentally dis
turbed people.
In addition, the files contained
records and charges of sex of
fenders, paroled convicts attend
ing the university, and pam
phlets of campus organizations,
most frequently the Young So
cialist Alliance.
Following the discovery of the
files, Donald F. Stevens, head
of University Safety, said there

was nothing incriminating in
the records. He agreed, however,
to destroy them.
'No Idea'
"I had no idea they were
there," he said. "It's been so
long since I looked at them."
Students reacted to the dis
closure by staging a 24-hour
vigil outside the president's of
fice and organizing a mass dem
onstration to protest the "lack
of student involvement in uni
versity aflairs."
A group of 28 students pre
sented a mandate for change de
manding more student power on
campus. The demands included
the establishment of investiga
tory committees "with full ac
cess to relevant information in
areas of university administra
tive concern, such as Security
Files."
Demands
Other student demands were:
• students must be voting
members of each Presidential
Advisory Committee;
• a student on the Board of
Governors to become a voting
member;
• a mechanism for binding
student, faculty, and administra
tion referendum on university
affairs;
• administrators should be
selected by those people whom
they directly serve;
• "students and faculty must
have sole decision-making power
in the areas of basic academic
policy."
The students, meanwhile, have
suspended their protests until
May 11, when they have demand
ed that President Keast give
his opinions on the six point
mandate.

administration flies on political

sity has triggered a series of
student protests and demands

affairs.
