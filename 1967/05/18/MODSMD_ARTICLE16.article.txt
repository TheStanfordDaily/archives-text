healthy black Labrador gallantly
tried to retrieve and revive his
panting, exhausted master at

The pooch lacked the proper
Red Cross certification and was
duly ejected from the pool.

75 fly, .2 second away from the
IM record. Peterson, swimming
unattached, missed the IM rec
ord in the 50 free by .2 second
with his 23.6.
Based on placings in the pre
lims, which do not include div
ing and are by no means final,
KA, Kappa Sig, and Alpha Sig
are in for a battle that will prob
ably go down to the last relay.

The 75 fly, probably the hard
est event on the IM docket, wit
nessed an unprecedented intra
mural life-saving attempt. A
healthy black Labrador gallantly
tried to retrieve and revive his
panting, exhausted master at
pool's end.
The pooch lacked the proper
Red Cross certification and was
duly ejected from the pool.

KA's Sweep Backstroke
Bob Colwell and Bob Loehr
