# Future Swimming Papooses Spark Santa Clara HS Win
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The awesome swimming pow
er of Santa Clara High School,
shortly to be the power of the
Stanford frosh, shattered two
American records and a pack of
national high school records on
the way to a resounding victory
at the CCS meet last Saturday
at Foothill.
Mark Spitz swam an astound
ing 1:54.4 200 individual medley
to break the American record by
1.5 seconds, and also lowered his
American record for the 100
butterfly to 49.1. Spitz anchored
Santa Clara's 400 free relay in
45.7.
Freestyle Gangbusters
Santa Clara's free relay paced
out a jaw-dropping 3:06.8. The
American record in that event,
before Stanford broke it in the
NCAA's, was 3:07.2. Bob Jami
son led off in 46.6, a new high
school record, followed by Rick
Eagleston in 46.9, Fred Haywood
in 47.6, and Spitz.
All but Spitz (a, gasp, junior)
have signed letters of intent for
Stanford.
Jamison won the 100 free in
47.2, edging Eagleston's 47.4.
Eagleston won the 50 in 21.8.
Before Santa Clara bombed
it, the national high school rec
ord for the 100 was 47.7. Santa
Clara's free relay averaged 46.7.
After the meet, Santa Clara
swam a record-smashing 1:26.3
for the 200 freestyle rel^y—an
average of 21.6 per man.

Haywood, who swam on the
relay and got second in the 200
free (1:46.4), is basically not a
freestyler. He's the fastest 100
backstroker in the world, as a
result of his 52.6 victory at the
national AAU's.
Haywood won the CCS back
stroke in 53.1, beating teammate
Mitch Ivey's 53.4 —both times
cracked the high school record.
Ivey, who took fourth in the In
door AAU 200 backstroke in
1:56.7, has also signed for Stan
ford.
Paly Swimmers Shine
A number of other Stanford
to-be swimmers shone at the

CCS meet. Bob Nichols of Palo
Alto romped to the diving cham
pionship, while teammate Joe
Welsh took second in the 100 fly
(52.6) and fourth in the 50
(22.5).
John Ferris of Carmichael
will also fly his colors with Stan
ford next year. Ferris took
fourth in both the 200 IM
(1:57.7) and 200 fly (1.53.7) at
the AAU's and barely missed
qualifying in the 100 fly with a
51.8.
Of the six high school seniors
who placed in the AAU's (i.e.,
in the top six in the nation),
Stanford gets four and USC two.
