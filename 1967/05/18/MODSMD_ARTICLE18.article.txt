# But Third Place Likely
## Netmen Seek AAWU Title 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
crosses the bay tomorrow for
the start of the three day AAWU
tennis championships. The Card
team appears likely to repeat its
third place finish of last year.
Coach Dick Gould's eight net
men will play Oregon tomorrow
morning at 9:30 on the Uni
versity of California courts. A
win in that match would vault
the Tribe into the semifinals,
with the probable opponent of
UCLA at 2:00 Friday.
Brian Leek will go at number

one for the Cards as he has all
season. Leek lost in Oregon
when the Tribe topped the
Ducks 7-2. His season record for
dual matches was 7-12.
Dean Schlobohm (9-10), will
be number two, Craig Baise
(14-7) at three, Chuck Alloo (6-
8), Dale Wong (14-7) at five, and
John McCabe (11-8) will go at
six.
Leek and Baise will form num
ber one doubles, Aloo and Jamie
Carroll number two, and Schlo
bohm and John Cornell number
three.

The eventual winner of the
tournament will probably be
USC. The Trojans rank as heavy
favorites after their 7-2 drubbing
of UCLA in Los Angeles in early
May.
The Trojans boast a top three
of Stan Smith, the number 2
player in the country, Bob Lutz,
and Joaquin Loyo-Mayo, the
small Mexican ace. The team's
depth was great enough to snuff
the Cards 9-0 twice this season.
Bruins Won Two, Too
The Bruins also defeated Stan
ford twice this season, and based

on their very early victory over
the Trojans, could pull through
with an upset triumph. Their top
ace is lan Crookendon, who de
feated Smith in that match.
Stanford's chances of defeat
ing the Bruins are slim, al
though Gould does not consider
an upset impossible.
Face Cal For Third
If defeated, the Tribe will
more than likely face the num
ber four team in the conference,
Cal, at 9:30 Saturday. The Bears
feature one of the nation's best
players in Chuck Darley, but
Stanford can challenge very
capably past the number one
spot.
In earlier matches this season,
the Cards raged to a 6-3 win,
then squeaked out with a 5-4,
last doubles match determined
victory.
A win in this consolation
round would give the Tribe a
third place.
This is only the second year
that the AAWU tournament
competition has been based on
team-match play. USC took first
last year, with the Bruins sec
ond.

Stanford's chances of defeat
ing the Bruins are slim, al
though Gould does not consider
an upset impossible.
Face Cal For Third
If defeated, the Tribe will
more than likely face the num
ber four team in the conference,
Cal, at 9:30 Saturday. The Bears
feature one of the nation's best
players in Chuck Darley, but
Stanford can challenge very
capably past the number one
spot.
In earlier matches this season,
the Cards raged to a 6-3 win,
then squeaked out with a 5-4,
last doubles match determined
victory.
A win in this consolation
round would give the Tribe a
third place.
This is only the second year
that the AAWU tournament
competition has been based on
team-match play. USC took first
last year, with the Bruins sec
ond.
Stanford's varsity tennis team
crosses the bay tomorrow for
the start of the three day AAWU
tennis championships. The Card
team appears likely to repeat its
third place finish of last year.
Coach Dick Gould's eight net
men will play Oregon tomorrow
morning at 9:30 on the Uni
versity of California courts. A
win in that match would vault
the Tribe into the semifinals,
with the probable opponent of
UCLA at 2:00 Friday.
Brian Leek will go at number

one for the Cards as he has all
season. Leek lost in Oregon
when the Tribe topped the
Ducks 7-2. His season record for
dual matches was 7-12.
Dean Schlobohm (9-10), will
be number two, Craig Baise
(14-7) at three, Chuck Alloo (6-
8), Dale Wong (14-7) at five, and
John McCabe (11-8) will go at
six.
Leek and Baise will form num
ber one doubles, Aloo and Jamie
Carroll number two, and Schlo
bohm and John Cornell number
three.

The eventual winner of the
tournament will probably be
USC. The Trojans rank as heavy
favorites after their 7-2 drubbing
of UCLA in Los Angeles in early
May.
The Trojans boast a top three
of Stan Smith, the number 2
player in the country, Bob Lutz,
and Joaquin Loyo-Mayo, the
small Mexican ace. The team's
depth was great enough to snuff
the Cards 9-0 twice this season.
Bruins Won Two, Too
The Bruins also defeated Stan
ford twice this season, and based

on their very early victory over
the Trojans, could pull through
with an upset triumph. Their top
ace is lan Crookendon, who de
feated Smith in that match.
Stanford's chances of defeat
ing the Bruins are slim, al
though Gould does not consider
an upset impossible.
