Faculty and women students are
organizing petitions in support of the
over 300 Stanford men, and other stu
dents across the nation, who signed
the "We won't go" statements.
The petition for women students
is being circulated in all women's
residences. It states, "A feeling of
frustration rising from recurrent con
versations led us to formulate this
statement. We are women and we
are not asked to accept any form of
military classification."
"We are not asked to serve in Viet
nam in any direct way. But we are
citizens of this country which is in
volving itself in direct military action
in Vietnam in a way which we find
reprehensible. We must speak in sup
port of those men who a) will not
fight in Viet Nam or b) will not be
conscripted into the military."
"The idea grew out of a number of
conversations among students," ex
plains sponsor Kate Nichols. "It is
less an organized movement than a
spontaneous expression of concern."
Females Finally Move
Grove freshman Nan Goldie adds,
"We hope that from this beginning
will come action on the part of the
Stanford women."
The petitions now in circulation will
be turned in Monday. Plans are to
run the list as an advertisement in
The Daily, along with the list of fac
ulty, sometime next week. Nan Goldie
has asked for persons interested in
contributing to the cost of the ad to
contact her.
A group of concerned faculty and
staff are also circulating a petition in

support of the "We won't go" state
ment. This "Declaration of Con
science" has been sent out to mem
bers of the faculty and staff and is
also being circulated to professors
at Berkeley and San Francisco State.
Wisdom, Courage And Immoral War
Professor John McCarthy of Com
puter Science, who is collecting signa
tures at ♦ Stanford for the Faculty-
Staff Committee to End the War in
Vietnam, stated when asked why he
signed, "I admire the wisdom and
courage of the young men who have
decided not to take part in this im
moral war." Other original signers
at Stanford include Robert McAfee
Brown, George Leppert, and Charles
M. Stein.
The "Declaration of Conscience"
reads in part: "We believe that every
young man has the obligation to chose
for himself whether he will train to
kill and perhaps be killed in this war."
"This decision of conscience cannot
be made for him by any external
authority, including the American
government. We therefore urge young
men to consider whether they are
willing to be executioners and vic
tims."
"To all who determine that they
will not participate in this war, we
pledge our full and active support.
We also affirm that we will join with
them in a shared effort to assure that
their moral rejection of the war re
sults in effective political opposition
to it."
Both groups emphasize the import
ance of action as a consequence of the
statements of moral support.

pledge our full and active support.
We also affirm that we will join with
them in a shared effort to assure that
their moral rejection of the war re
sults in effective political opposition
to it."
Both groups emphasize the import
ance of action as a consequence of the
statements of moral support.
Faculty and women students are
organizing petitions in support of the
over 300 Stanford men, and other stu
dents across the nation, who signed
the "We won't go" statements.
The petition for women students
is being circulated in all women's
residences. It states, "A feeling of
frustration rising from recurrent con
versations led us to formulate this
statement. We are women and we
are not asked to accept any form of
military classification."
"We are not asked to serve in Viet
nam in any direct way. But we are
citizens of this country which is in
volving itself in direct military action
in Vietnam in a way which we find
reprehensible. We must speak in sup
port of those men who a) will not
fight in Viet Nam or b) will not be
conscripted into the military."
"The idea grew out of a number of
conversations among students," ex
plains sponsor Kate Nichols. "It is
less an organized movement than a
spontaneous expression of concern."
Females Finally Move
Grove freshman Nan Goldie adds,
"We hope that from this beginning
will come action on the part of the
Stanford women."
The petitions now in circulation will
be turned in Monday. Plans are to
run the list as an advertisement in
The Daily, along with the list of fac
ulty, sometime next week. Nan Goldie
has asked for persons interested in
contributing to the cost of the ad to
contact her.
A group of concerned faculty and
staff are also circulating a petition in

support of the "We won't go" state
ment. This "Declaration of Con
science" has been sent out to mem
bers of the faculty and staff and is
also being circulated to professors
at Berkeley and San Francisco State.
Wisdom, Courage And Immoral War
Professor John McCarthy of Com
puter Science, who is collecting signa
tures at ♦ Stanford for the Faculty-
Staff Committee to End the War in
Vietnam, stated when asked why he
signed, "I admire the wisdom and
courage of the young men who have
decided not to take part in this im
moral war." Other original signers
at Stanford include Robert McAfee
Brown, George Leppert, and Charles
M. Stein.
The "Declaration of Conscience"
reads in part: "We believe that every
young man has the obligation to chose
for himself whether he will train to
kill and perhaps be killed in this war."
"This decision of conscience cannot
be made for him by any external
authority, including the American
government. We therefore urge young
men to consider whether they are
willing to be executioners and vic
tims."
"To all who determine that they
will not participate in this war, we
pledge our full and active support.
We also affirm that we will join with
them in a shared effort to assure that
their moral rejection of the war re
sults in effective political opposition
to it."
