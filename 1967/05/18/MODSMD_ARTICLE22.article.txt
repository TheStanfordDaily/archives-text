## Invective Negates Possibility Of Debate 
### 
The Daily:
I am upset by Fritz Schaefer's
nvective against Professor New
eft and the peace-mongering
iars — partly because I think
le's wrong, but primarily be
•ause the tone he writes in pro
notes the exact opposite of the
'easoned debate essential to a
?air assessment of the problems
nvolved in our Vietnam posi
:ion.
I should like to take issue with
?ome of the points he raises.
1. I wonder if Mr. Schaefer
fias given any thought to the
logical difficulty inherent in, as
he says, "spewing forth one lie
ifter the next." (my emphasis.)
Not Convincing
2. The State Department
white paper of Feb. 1965 is not
a very convincing document. Its
failure to prove what it sets out
to prove has been argued in
"numerous articles and essays.
I recommend to Mr. Schaefer
the one written by I. F. Stone,
which he will find in The Viet
nam Reader, available in paper
back at the Bookstore.
3. Concerning lies: can Mr.
Schaefer be unaware of our
President's statements that we
would seek no military solution
to the Vietnam problem, that we
sought no wider conflict, that
we would not bomb Hanoi and
Haiphong, and that he was will
ing to talk epace "uncondition
ally" at any time and place that
Hanoi proposed—etcetera? Al
though I would hesitate to throw
about the term "liar" with such
abandon as does Mr. Schaefer,
I think Mr. Johnson has made it
sufficiently clear that his state
ments are not to be taken at
face value. This disquieting fact
is so widely recognized that the
vernacular has coined a special
euphemism for it, viz.: "the
credibility gap."
4. No matter how our Marines
might feel about killing or being
killed, their feelings are not the
last court of appeal in matters
of foreign policy. To imply as
Mr. Schaefer does that we must
continue fighting in order not
to betray the courage and gal
lantry of our soldiers, is to im
pute to the Army primacy over
the State Department, or in
other words to put political sci
ence in the service of military
science. Although one often
must feel that this is the de
facto state of affairs, I think
that not even Mr. Schaefer
would want to argue that the
reiation between the two should
take this form.
Healthy?
5. Mr. Schaefer might not be
so optimistic about the "healthy
future" of democracy in South
Vietnam if he were aware of
the terms in the South Vietna
mese constitution under which
dissent is permissible. It is per
missible only when it is "within

the national interest"—and the
national interest, as the consti
tution expicitly points out, is
defined by the president alone.
Copies of the South Vietnamese
constitution will soon be avail
able at the Y offices in the Wo
men's Clubhouse.
Self-examination and at least
the attempt of objectivity in
evaluating facts are prerequis
ites for any self-respecting posi
tion in a matter so complicated
and important as this one. Mr.
Schaefer should inform himself
further on the history and the
nature of the Vietnam conflict.
I think he would be surprised
at how much he didn't know
when he wrote his article. And
he should save his vulgarity for
places where it is more fitting.

"One of the most horrible fea
tures of war is that all the war
propaganda, all the screaming
and lies and hatred, comes in
variably from people who are
not fighting." George Orwell,
Homage to Catalonia.
Fritz Schaefer's column in
Tuesday's Daily is a classic ex
ample of cheer-leader mentality
and rah-rah rhetoric. We are
largely a nation of spectators,
getting our thrills vicariously
from a few athletic heroes who
are merely dots on a playing
field or bodies on a television
screen. Our loyalty to athletic
teams is usually a result of
chance — what city we live in
or what college we attend.
But our loyalty seems to be
not less but more fanatical the
more it is a result of irrational
chance rather than rational
choice. We form Booster Clubs,
lines of nubile pom-pom girls,
and cheerleading squads to bet
ter express our vicarious, irra
tional loyalty to our heroes who
provide our vicarious thrills.
Now Mr. Schaefer is one up on
the bulk of the populace; he
would apply the pep club men
tality to the arena of war, set
up grandstands (let's have it
out on Highway 61) and cheer
on the "boys." His fanatical loy
alty must be product of his
chance geographic location on
the globe; one could hardly call
his adolescent drivel a reasoned
discourse. Drop him in any
country in the world, he would
be waving his flag and cheering
on the "boys."
Perhaps he should be nomi
nated for head cheerleader of
the Vietnamese War Pep Squad.
But this spectator mentality
should be overcome. We are in
danger of becoming a nation of
spineless weaklings. I am re
minded of an incident that oc
curred some time ago at Foot

hill College when the great
right-fielder of the Army Team,
Maxwell Taylor, spoke there.
One troubled student asked the
nimble-witted General what he
could do to support the war.
Just as the retired hero was
about to utter some coachly
advice, a sturdy voice shouted,
"Enlist!"
Sound Advice. The "logic" of
your mumbo-jumbo jingoism,
Schaefer, demands, not merely
that you "stand up and be count
ed," but that you stand up and
fight. Otherwise your "article"
in The Daily becomes a master
piece of unintentional irony.
Those who support this farcical
and tragic war should be the
ones to fight it. They should
not be content to well-led, bovine
cheerleaders standing on the
sidelines rooting for a team
drawn largely from families who
cannot afford 2-S deferrments
for their sons. Don't sit around
and whine about Professor New
left's deplorable lack of team
loyalty. Get out there on the
field and drop a load of napalm
for Premier Ky.
Mary McCarthy has said that
the worst thing that could hap
pen to America is to win this
war. To insure against such
a disaster, let's encourage the
pep squad to get on the play
ing field.

I believe that it is time for
those who oppose the Johnson
policy in Vietnam to do more to
try to change that policy.
To those who oppose the war
but will not wear armbands: If
you will not do even this littl;
bit to show your opposition, the
policymakers are sure to think
you are on their side.
To those who wear armbands
but nothing else: Try wearing
the armband more than once
a week — the war goes on all
seven. Tell your friends to wear
them. Carry more than one arm
band, and give the extras away.
Only mass numbers of voters
can sway politicians. If only
those at Stanford know what
an armband means, it will be
as futile as many non-wearers
say. Write to other campuses to
let other students know of this
satisfactory form of protest, be
fore the school year is over.
Wear an armband at home
this summer — and explain
what it means. Only people who
distinguish themselves can be
seen — especially by those who
must choose the Republican to
run against Johnson.
When you drive — turn your
lights on. Put a bumper sticker
on your car. Try to buy decals
with peace symbols for your
windshield.
Show in all the little ways
you can, that you are among
those willing to take action re
sulting from your beliefs. None
of us alone can determine na
tional policy — bat if you are
unwilling to join in the protests
that have already started, you
count among those who do not
stand up for your convictions.

Editor, The Daily:
The second ugliest thing I
have seen on this campus (first
prize goes to Mem Claw) since
my arrival in September is a
strange kind of woman's ap
parel. It's called either a pant
dress or culottes, or what have
you. Basically they are ugly.
They do not enhance the beauty
of the wearer in any way. As a
matter of fact they accentuate
any bodily defects. I'm not sure
why girls wear them but I have
simulated the motives in three
categories. First, are com
fortable". Well, so are overalls,
and the most comfortable out
fit ever designed is no clothes at
all. Secondly, I have the impres
sion that girls who are not quite
brave enough to wear minis find
culottes an easy way out. True,
the culottes eliminate the risks

of miniskirts, but the odds are
that if you don't look good in
a mini, you'll look worse in a
pant-dress. Thirdly, the wearers
of these horrible eyesores are
under the false impression that
the culottes have a distinct and
perhaps continental flair to
them. Distinct they are, but only
in ugliness. Continental, they
are not. I call on all discrimin
ating male students to join me
in a campaign to do away with
pant-dresses. Vive les sans
culottes.

In a recent letter he commented

the culottes eliminate the risks

of miniskirts, but the odds are

"One of the most horrible fea
tures of war is that all the war
propaganda, all the screaming
and lies and hatred, comes in
variably from people who are
not fighting." George Orwell,
Homage to Catalonia.
Fritz Schaefer's column in
Tuesday's Daily is a classic ex
ample of cheer-leader mentality
and rah-rah rhetoric. We are
largely a nation of spectators,
getting our thrills vicariously
from a few athletic heroes who
are merely dots on a playing
field or bodies on a television
screen. Our loyalty to athletic
teams is usually a result of
chance — what city we live in
or what college we attend.
But our loyalty seems to be
not less but more fanatical the
more it is a result of irrational
chance rather than rational
choice. We form Booster Clubs,
lines of nubile pom-pom girls,
and cheerleading squads to bet
ter express our vicarious, irra
tional loyalty to our heroes who
provide our vicarious thrills.
Now Mr. Schaefer is one up on
the bulk of the populace; he
would apply the pep club men
tality to the arena of war, set
up grandstands (let's have it
out on Highway 61) and cheer
on the "boys." His fanatical loy
alty must be product of his
chance geographic location on
the globe; one could hardly call
his adolescent drivel a reasoned
discourse. Drop him in any
country in the world, he would
be waving his flag and cheering
on the "boys."
Perhaps he should be nomi
nated for head cheerleader of
the Vietnamese War Pep Squad.
But this spectator mentality
should be overcome. We are in
danger of becoming a nation of
spineless weaklings. I am re
minded of an incident that oc
curred some time ago at Foot

hill College when the great
right-fielder of the Army Team,
Maxwell Taylor, spoke there.
One troubled student asked the
nimble-witted General what he
could do to support the war.
Just as the retired hero was
about to utter some coachly
advice, a sturdy voice shouted,
"Enlist!"
Sound Advice. The "logic" of
your mumbo-jumbo jingoism,
Schaefer, demands, not merely
that you "stand up and be count
ed," but that you stand up and
fight. Otherwise your "article"
in The Daily becomes a master
piece of unintentional irony.
Those who support this farcical
and tragic war should be the
ones to fight it. They should
not be content to well-led, bovine
cheerleaders standing on the
sidelines rooting for a team
drawn largely from families who
cannot afford 2-S deferrments
for their sons. Don't sit around
and whine about Professor New
left's deplorable lack of team
loyalty. Get out there on the
field and drop a load of napalm
for Premier Ky.
Mary McCarthy has said that
the worst thing that could hap
pen to America is to win this
war. To insure against such
a disaster, let's encourage the
pep squad to get on the play

Editor, The Daily:
Discussion of the political na

the basic issue. The issue is not:
"Can the political be separated

after free and open discussion

The major question is not
whether The Experiment should
receive funds from LASSU but
whether it should be the only
politically - oriented group to
receive direct subsidies from
LASSU. The subsidy helping in
the production of Resistance

Fritz Schaefer's column in
Tuesday's Daily is a classic ex
ample of cheer-leader mentality
and rah-rah rhetoric. We are
largely a nation of spectators,
getting our thrills vicariously
from a few athletic heroes who
are merely dots on a playing
field or bodies on a television
screen. Our loyalty to athletic
teams is usually a result of
chance — what city we live in
or what college we attend.
But our loyalty seems to be
not less but more fanatical the
more it is a result of irrational
chance rather than rational
choice. We form Booster Clubs,
lines of nubile pom-pom girls,
and cheerleading squads to bet
ter express our vicarious, irra
tional loyalty to our heroes who
provide our vicarious thrills.
Now Mr. Schaefer is one up on
the bulk of the populace; he
would apply the pep club men
tality to the arena of war, set
up grandstands (let's have it
out on Highway 61) and cheer
on the "boys." His fanatical loy
alty must be product of his
chance geographic location on
the globe; one could hardly call
his adolescent drivel a reasoned
discourse. Drop him in any
country in the world, he would
be waving his flag and cheering
on the "boys."
Perhaps he should be nomi
nated for head cheerleader of
the Vietnamese War Pep Squad.
But this spectator mentality
should be overcome. We are in
danger of becoming a nation of
spineless weaklings. I am re
minded of an incident that oc
curred some time ago at Foot

hill College when the great
right-fielder of the Army Team,
Maxwell Taylor, spoke there.
One troubled student asked the
nimble-witted General what he
could do to support the war.
Just as the retired hero was
about to utter some coachly
advice, a sturdy voice shouted,
"Enlist!"
Sound Advice. The "logic" of
your mumbo-jumbo jingoism,
Schaefer, demands, not merely
that you "stand up and be count
ed," but that you stand up and
fight. Otherwise your "article"
in The Daily becomes a master
piece of unintentional irony.
Those who support this farcical
and tragic war should be the
ones to fight it. They should
not be content to well-led, bovine
cheerleaders standing on the
sidelines rooting for a team
drawn largely from families who
cannot afford 2-S deferrments
for their sons. Don't sit around
and whine about Professor New
left's deplorable lack of team
loyalty. Get out there on the
field and drop a load of napalm
for Premier Ky.
Mary McCarthy has said that

The Daily:
I am upset by Fritz Schaefer's
nvective against Professor New
eft and the peace-mongering
iars — partly because I think
le's wrong, but primarily be
•ause the tone he writes in pro
notes the exact opposite of the
'easoned debate essential to a
?air assessment of the problems
nvolved in our Vietnam posi
:ion.
I should like to take issue with
?ome of the points he raises.
1. I wonder if Mr. Schaefer
fias given any thought to the
logical difficulty inherent in, as
he says, "spewing forth one lie
ifter the next." (my emphasis.)
Not Convincing
2. The State Department
white paper of Feb. 1965 is not
a very convincing document. Its
failure to prove what it sets out
to prove has been argued in
"numerous articles and essays.
I recommend to Mr. Schaefer
the one written by I. F. Stone,
which he will find in The Viet
nam Reader, available in paper
back at the Bookstore.
3. Concerning lies: can Mr.
Schaefer be unaware of our
President's statements that we
would seek no military solution
to the Vietnam problem, that we
sought no wider conflict, that
we would not bomb Hanoi and
Haiphong, and that he was will
ing to talk epace "uncondition
ally" at any time and place that
Hanoi proposed—etcetera? Al
though I would hesitate to throw
about the term "liar" with such
abandon as does Mr. Schaefer,
I think Mr. Johnson has made it
sufficiently clear that his state
ments are not to be taken at
face value. This disquieting fact
is so widely recognized that the
vernacular has coined a special
euphemism for it, viz.: "the
credibility gap."
4. No matter how our Marines
might feel about killing or being
killed, their feelings are not the
last court of appeal in matters
of foreign policy. To imply as
Mr. Schaefer does that we must
continue fighting in order not
to betray the courage and gal
lantry of our soldiers, is to im
pute to the Army primacy over
the State Department, or in
other words to put political sci
ence in the service of military
science. Although one often
must feel that this is the de
facto state of affairs, I think
that not even Mr. Schaefer
would want to argue that the
reiation between the two should
take this form.
Healthy?
5. Mr. Schaefer might not be
so optimistic about the "healthy
future" of democracy in South
Vietnam if he were aware of
the terms in the South Vietna
mese constitution under which
dissent is permissible. It is per
missible only when it is "within

the national interest"—and the
national interest, as the consti
tution expicitly points out, is
defined by the president alone.
Copies of the South Vietnamese
constitution will soon be avail
able at the Y offices in the Wo
men's Clubhouse.
Self-examination and at least
the attempt of objectivity in
evaluating facts are prerequis
ites for any self-respecting posi
tion in a matter so complicated
and important as this one. Mr.
Schaefer should inform himself
further on the history and the
nature of the Vietnam conflict.
I think he would be surprised
at how much he didn't know
when he wrote his article. And
he should save his vulgarity for
places where it is more fitting.

1. I wonder if Mr. Schaefer

3. Concerning lies: can Mr.

I think Mr. Johnson has made it
sufficiently clear that his state

face value. This disquieting fact
is so widely recognized that the
vernacular has coined a special
euphemism for it, viz.: "the
credibility gap."
4. No matter how our Marines
might feel about killing or being
killed, their feelings are not the
last court of appeal in matters
of foreign policy. To imply as
Mr. Schaefer does that we must
continue fighting in order not
to betray the courage and gal

pute to the Army primacy over
the State Department, or in
other words to put political sci

must feel that this is the de

that not even Mr. Schaefer

5. Mr. Schaefer might not be

Fritz Schaefer's column in

But our loyalty seems to be

choice. We form Booster Clubs,
lines of nubile pom-pom girls,
and cheerleading squads to bet

provide our vicarious thrills.
Now Mr. Schaefer is one up on
the bulk of the populace; he
would apply the pep club men

up grandstands (let's have it
out on Highway 61) and cheer

his adolescent drivel a reasoned

One troubled student asked the

Just as the retired hero was

your mumbo-jumbo jingoism,
Schaefer, demands, not merely
that you "stand up and be count

policy in Vietnam to do more to
try to change that policy.
To those who oppose the war
but will not wear armbands: If

you are on their side.
To those who wear armbands
but nothing else: Try wearing
the armband more than once
a week — the war goes on all
seven. Tell your friends to wear
them. Carry more than one arm

Only mass numbers of voters

those at Stanford know what
an armband means, it will be
as futile as many non-wearers
say. Write to other campuses to

Wear an armband at home

what it means. Only people who

When you drive — turn your

The second ugliest thing I
have seen on this campus (first
prize goes to Mem Claw) since
my arrival in September is a
strange kind of woman's ap
parel. It's called either a pant
dress or culottes, or what have
you. Basically they are ugly.
They do not enhance the beauty
of the wearer in any way. As a
matter of fact they accentuate
any bodily defects. I'm not sure
why girls wear them but I have
simulated the motives in three
categories. First, are com
fortable". Well, so are overalls,
and the most comfortable out
fit ever designed is no clothes at
all. Secondly, I have the impres
sion that girls who are not quite
brave enough to wear minis find
culottes an easy way out. True,
the culottes eliminate the risks

of miniskirts, but the odds are
that if you don't look good in
a mini, you'll look worse in a
pant-dress. Thirdly, the wearers
of these horrible eyesores are
under the false impression that
the culottes have a distinct and

"One of the most horrible fea
tures of war is that all the war
propaganda, all the screaming
and lies and hatred, comes in
variably from people who are
not fighting." George Orwell,
Homage to Catalonia.
Fritz Schaefer's column in
Tuesday's Daily is a classic ex
ample of cheer-leader mentality
and rah-rah rhetoric. We are
largely a nation of spectators,
getting our thrills vicariously
from a few athletic heroes who
are merely dots on a playing
field or bodies on a television
screen. Our loyalty to athletic
teams is usually a result of
chance — what city we live in
or what college we attend.
But our loyalty seems to be
not less but more fanatical the
more it is a result of irrational
chance rather than rational
choice. We form Booster Clubs,
lines of nubile pom-pom girls,
and cheerleading squads to bet
ter express our vicarious, irra
tional loyalty to our heroes who
provide our vicarious thrills.
Now Mr. Schaefer is one up on
the bulk of the populace; he
would apply the pep club men
tality to the arena of war, set
up grandstands (let's have it
out on Highway 61) and cheer
on the "boys." His fanatical loy
alty must be product of his
chance geographic location on
the globe; one could hardly call
his adolescent drivel a reasoned
discourse. Drop him in any
country in the world, he would
be waving his flag and cheering
on the "boys."
Perhaps he should be nomi
nated for head cheerleader of
the Vietnamese War Pep Squad.
But this spectator mentality
should be overcome. We are in
danger of becoming a nation of
spineless weaklings. I am re
minded of an incident that oc
curred some time ago at Foot

hill College when the great
right-fielder of the Army Team,
Maxwell Taylor, spoke there.
One troubled student asked the
nimble-witted General what he
could do to support the war.
Just as the retired hero was
about to utter some coachly
advice, a sturdy voice shouted,
"Enlist!"
Sound Advice. The "logic" of
your mumbo-jumbo jingoism,
Schaefer, demands, not merely
that you "stand up and be count
ed," but that you stand up and
fight. Otherwise your "article"
in The Daily becomes a master
piece of unintentional irony.
Those who support this farcical
and tragic war should be the
ones to fight it. They should
not be content to well-led, bovine
cheerleaders standing on the
sidelines rooting for a team
drawn largely from families who
cannot afford 2-S deferrments
for their sons. Don't sit around
and whine about Professor New
left's deplorable lack of team
loyalty. Get out there on the
field and drop a load of napalm
for Premier Ky.
Mary McCarthy has said that
the worst thing that could hap
pen to America is to win this
war. To insure against such
a disaster, let's encourage the
pep squad to get on the play
ing field.

Editor, The Daily:

"Can the political be separated

tures of war is that all the war
propaganda, all the screaming
and lies and hatred, comes in
variably from people who are
not fighting." George Orwell,
Homage to Catalonia.
Fritz Schaefer's column in
Tuesday's Daily is a classic ex
ample of cheer-leader mentality
and rah-rah rhetoric. We are
largely a nation of spectators,
getting our thrills vicariously
from a few athletic heroes who
are merely dots on a playing
field or bodies on a television
screen. Our loyalty to athletic
teams is usually a result of
chance — what city we live in
or what college we attend.
But our loyalty seems to be
not less but more fanatical the
more it is a result of irrational
chance rather than rational
choice. We form Booster Clubs,
lines of nubile pom-pom girls,
and cheerleading squads to bet
ter express our vicarious, irra
tional loyalty to our heroes who
provide our vicarious thrills.
Now Mr. Schaefer is one up on
the bulk of the populace; he
would apply the pep club men
tality to the arena of war, set
up grandstands (let's have it
out on Highway 61) and cheer
on the "boys." His fanatical loy
alty must be product of his
chance geographic location on
the globe; one could hardly call
his adolescent drivel a reasoned
discourse. Drop him in any
country in the world, he would
be waving his flag and cheering
on the "boys."
Perhaps he should be nomi
nated for head cheerleader of
the Vietnamese War Pep Squad.
But this spectator mentality
should be overcome. We are in
danger of becoming a nation of
spineless weaklings. I am re
minded of an incident that oc
curred some time ago at Foot

hill College when the great
right-fielder of the Army Team,
Maxwell Taylor, spoke there.
One troubled student asked the
nimble-witted General what he
could do to support the war.
Just as the retired hero was
about to utter some coachly
advice, a sturdy voice shouted,
"Enlist!"
Sound Advice. The "logic" of
your mumbo-jumbo jingoism,
Schaefer, demands, not merely
that you "stand up and be count
ed," but that you stand up and
fight. Otherwise your "article"
in The Daily becomes a master
piece of unintentional irony.
Those who support this farcical
and tragic war should be the
ones to fight it. They should
not be content to well-led, bovine
cheerleaders standing on the
sidelines rooting for a team
drawn largely from families who
cannot afford 2-S deferrments
for their sons. Don't sit around
and whine about Professor New
left's deplorable lack of team
loyalty. Get out there on the
field and drop a load of napalm
for Premier Ky.
Mary McCarthy has said that
the worst thing that could hap
pen to America is to win this
war. To insure against such
a disaster, let's encourage the
pep squad to get on the play
ing field.

• The Real Question
Editor, The Daily:
Discussion of the political na
ture of The Experiment, the
most recent being in Mr. Brody's
article of May 8, tends to cloud
the basic issue. The issue is not:
"Can the political be separated
from the educational?" 112 think
few would disagree with the
right to act when such action is
based upon knowledge, but only
after free and open discussion
has produced this basis for ac
tion — which is Dean Smith's
explicit meaning and not that
assigned to him by Mr. Kast
on May 10.
The major question is not
whether The Experiment should
receive funds from LASSU but
whether it should be the only
politically - oriented group to
receive direct subsidies from
LASSU. The subsidy helping in
the production of Resistance
and the "We Accuse" posters
can only be excused if money
likewise goes to other journals
of opinion that oppose Resis
tance. Subsidized free speech is

tolerable only if all sides are
subsidized. If not all then none.

• Stand Up
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that it is time for
those who oppose the Johnson
policy in Vietnam to do more to
try to change that policy.
To those who oppose the war
but will not wear armbands: If
you will not do even this littl;
bit to show your opposition, the
policymakers are sure to think
you are on their side.
To those who wear armbands
but nothing else: Try wearing
the armband more than once
a week — the war goes on all
seven. Tell your friends to wear
them. Carry more than one arm
band, and give the extras away.
Only mass numbers of voters
can sway politicians. If only
those at Stanford know what
an armband means, it will be
as futile as many non-wearers
say. Write to other campuses to
let other students know of this
satisfactory form of protest, be
fore the school year is over.
Wear an armband at home
this summer — and explain
what it means. Only people who
distinguish themselves can be
seen — especially by those who
must choose the Republican to
run against Johnson.
When you drive — turn your
lights on. Put a bumper sticker
on your car. Try to buy decals
with peace symbols for your
windshield.
Show in all the little ways
you can, that you are among
those willing to take action re
sulting from your beliefs. None
of us alone can determine na
tional policy — bat if you are
unwilling to join in the protests
that have already started, you
count among those who do not
stand up for your convictions.

• Down With Culottes
Editor, The Daily:
The second ugliest thing I
have seen on this campus (first
prize goes to Mem Claw) since
my arrival in September is a
strange kind of woman's ap
parel. It's called either a pant
dress or culottes, or what have
you. Basically they are ugly.
They do not enhance the beauty
of the wearer in any way. As a
matter of fact they accentuate
any bodily defects. I'm not sure
why girls wear them but I have
simulated the motives in three
categories. First, are com
fortable". Well, so are overalls,
and the most comfortable out
fit ever designed is no clothes at
all. Secondly, I have the impres
sion that girls who are not quite
brave enough to wear minis find
culottes an easy way out. True,
the culottes eliminate the risks

of miniskirts, but the odds are
that if you don't look good in
a mini, you'll look worse in a
pant-dress. Thirdly, the wearers
of these horrible eyesores are
under the false impression that
the culottes have a distinct and
perhaps continental flair to
them. Distinct they are, but only
in ugliness. Continental, they
are not. I call on all discrimin
ating male students to join me
in a campaign to do away with
pant-dresses. Vive les sans
culottes.

In a recent letter he commented
