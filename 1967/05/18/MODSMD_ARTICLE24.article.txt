## U.S. Should End Draft 
### Mark Hatfield 
The time has come to end
the military draft.
That bald declaration will
startle many. But when all the
facts are in, and all the current
and projected needs for mili
tary manpower have been tak
en into account, it is difficult
to avoid the conclusion that
America does not need the draft,
America can afford not to have
the draft, and America is over
due in bringing to an end this
drastic invasion of the lives and
liberties of her young men.
Congress is now beginning to
debate President Johnson's legi
slation to extend the draft an
other four years. In years post
Congressional examination of
this issue was perfunctory.
This year things are different.
Thanks no doubt to the height
ened awareness of America's
young people, whose lives the
draft so seriously affects, many
in Congress are now for the
first time rethinking the premi
ses upon which the draft is sup
posedly based. An increasing
number of them are finding it
sadly out of step with both our
nation's traditions and with its
military manpower needs.
Involuntary Servitude
We must never allow our
selves to forget that however
pressing the circumstances, the
draft is involuntary servitude.
It is legitimate and constitution
al when Congress, exercising its
power to raise and support arm
ies, has no reasonable alterna
tive. But conscription must al

ways be the last desperate re
sort for meeting military man
power needs, not the cheap and
easy expedient.
The only real argument for
having an involuntary draft is
that the Nation could not rea
sonably afford to raise and re
tain the needed military man
power without it. I maintain
that the Nation can afford to eli
minate the draft. In doing so
we will restore lost liberties. We
can end once and for all the
inherent inequities of a com
pulsory system. We can upgrade
our armed forces and increase
our national security. And we
can do it at a price this rich and
powerful Nation can easily af
ford.
There is no numerical fit .
age of manpower for filling n;i .
tary ranks. Each year nearly
four times as many men as the
military needs enter the draft
age pool. With more realistic
service qualifications and sharp
ly increased wages and fringe
benefits, and with an enhanced
status for military careers, we
can attract the 500,000 men we
need each year, even at Vietnam
buildup level.
Precious Liberties
All we have to do is to make
up our minds that we are going
to stop exchanging precious lib
erties for false economy — false
because, when the total econo
mic costs of the draft system
are taken into account, includ
cluding civilian wages foregone
by draftees, we may well be

saving nothing at all. And this
calculation fails to take into ac
count the qualitative value of
skilled career specialists serving
in crucial military positions now
filled by reluctant draftees.
From the standpoint of indivi
dual liberty, equity to all, the
enhancement of national se
curity, and the total economic
costs, the draft fares badly in
comparison with an all-volun
-teer armed forces system.
How do we get from the pres
ent draft to the volunteer army?
Reaffirm Commitment
First, we must unequivocally
reaffirm our commitment to the
goal of voluntary armed forces.
The draft should be extended for
one or at the most two years.
During that time the Defense
Department should embark on
a program designed to make
the draft increasingly unneces
sary. A special joint committee
of Congress — independent of
the Defense Department and the
Selective Service System —
should be set up to make recom
mendations for a phasing out
of the draft, and to maintain a
continual review of the Defense
Department's progress toward
that goal. And military pay and
fringe benefits should be raised
substantially, starting now.
It is time we made the firm
decision to put an end to in
equity, put an end to uncer
tainty, put an end to inefficiency,
and regain for our young people
the liberties the draft has taken
from them.
