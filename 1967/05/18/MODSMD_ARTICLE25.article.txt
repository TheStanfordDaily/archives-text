# Off The Record
## Freshman 'Pledge' Meets SU 
### Peggy Rusk 
Stanford University held a
special High School Day a few
weeks ago to give incoming
freshmen a chance to look
around. Although you had to
look very closely to find any
Stanford "pledges" on campus
I did happen to overhear a very
interesting conversation be
tween a freshman coed and a
new pledge at the Union. It went
something like this:
"Excuse me, but I seem to be
lost. Could you tell me how to
get to Cubberley Auditorium?"
"Sure. Just go past the P. 0.,
walk through Mem Pla, turn
right at the Claw, and it is right
in between The Experiment and
the Old Libe."
"I beg your pardon, but I
don't quite understand!"
"Well, have a seat and I'll
write it all out for you. Are you
new around here?"
"Sort of. I'm coming here next
year."
What Teas?
"New freshman, huh. Hey,
would you like to buy a brand
new suit outfit, complete with
gloves and a hat? It's just per
fect for teas." (My ears seemed
to detect some muffled snicker
ing from the coed).
"That's very nice of you, but
my mother and I have already
planned to go shopping. We've
got a long list, too: a red skirt,
white blouses, dressy wools. .
"Yea, great. Just make sure
you get a raincoat and a bikini
and you'll be all set."
The coed, who had been non
chalantly scanning the crowd
for familiar faces of people she
wanted to accidentally run into,
suddenly showed a casual sign
of recognition. A modified hippy
passed by their table.
"Hi, Loretta!"
"Do you know that hippie? Is
she your roommate!?"

"Who, Loretta? No, she's my
English T.A."
"She's one of your teachers?"
the pledge gasped. "Are they all
like that?"
Hippie English Department
"Well, the English department
is with it, but the Civ instructors
are inhibited."
"Do they give you a lot of
work?"
"Oh, it's not so bad. I've got to
finish a take-home mid-term to
day. It's a three page paper on
the history of Western Man
from 1000 B.C. to 1914."
"Wow. That's a little broad,
isn't it?"
"Yeah, but we only have to
give one great thinker for each
century."
"What other courses do you
take?"
"Well, I've got a seminar in
the Primitive Dances of the
Eastern Wababanana Tribe and
Uses of the Library."
"What does everyone do for
excitement around here during
the week?"
"Good question. You can take
safaris through the steam tun
nels under the street or up the
ventilation ducts in the old libe,
or you can go up to the fifth
floor in the UGLY."
"Do the boys ever raid the
girls' dorm?"

"No. With open house hours
they don't need to anymore."
"Really? Wait till I tell my
father that. What were some of
the hardest things that you had
to learn when you came here?"
"Well. I think learning how
to fill out those drink slips at
Roble was one. Next in line was
the cafeteria at T.M.U., then the
text book department of the
bookstore, and the stacks. Here,
I've finished writing out the in
structions on how to get to Cub
Aud. If you get lost again just
ask someone else."
"Thank you. Uh, I wonder
do you have any final advice for
a new Stanfordite?"
Words Of Wisdom
"Sure. First be sure and get
a good picture in the frosh
book, your social life will de
pend on it. Then, always remem
ber to sign out, it gives the ad
ministration a feeling of secur
ity. Finally, don't show your in
telligence, it makes people un
comfortable."
"Thanks again. Hey, do you
know what you want to do when
you get out of college?"
"No, not really. But if I were
a man I'd know what to do."
"What's that?"
"I'd be a linotyper in The
Daily printing office."
