## Councilors Charge 'Daily’ Travesty 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Having been present at the
Judicial Council meeting last
Monday night, we are neces
sarily interested in the charges
of procedural ignorance and
sloppy understanding set forth
in your editorial of May 17. The
editorial gives four examples of
the Council's ignorance and slop
piness; each deserves separate
comment.
The editorial asserts that the
Council acted in a manner which
made it uncertain whether an
institution can be charged with
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion. This issue arose at the be
ginning of the case charging
The Stanford Daily with negli
gence with regard to publish
ing a letter to the Editor writ
ten by one of the ASSU Vice
Presidential candidates.
The uncertainty as to wheth
er an organization can be ac
cused of a Fundamental Stand
ard violation lay in the minds
of various members of The Daily
staff and not in the minds or in
the actions of the Council. The
Council cited at the time of the
hearing Article IV, Section 3
of the ASSU Constitution which
states: "The Judicial Council
shall have exclusive original jur
isdiction in all cases involving
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard by any student organ
ization."
No Uncertainty
The only uncertainty left after
the council had succinctly and
fully responded to the inquiry
lay with a member of The
Daily staff who had to be shown
a copy of the ASSU Constitu
tion. As to the failure of the
Council to outline possible pen
alties, it should be noted (1) the
Council has never before heard
a Fundamental Standard charge
against a sludent organization,
and (2) the Council does not
feel it proper to discuss, before
hearing the case, possible or
appropriate penalties. Indeed the
Council never did discuss pen
alties because it found The
Daily to be not guilty of the
charge.
The other examples of slop
piness and ignorance (allegedly
the Council's) involved a dis
pute over the Senior Class run
off election. The Daily charges
that there was uncertainty as
to who was making the charges.
To put it bluntly, there was
never any uncertainty at the
hearing: Mr. Fogelman was
making the charges. Mr. Fogel
man read off six charges and
was questioned about each. Mr.
Tom, Mr. Horowitz, Mr. Berry
and various witnesses were then
asked to state their knowledge
as to the charges. The charges
were made by Mr. Fogelman
against Mr. Tom and against
Mr. Berry, the Elections Com
missioner.
It is inconceivable to us that
any attentive or even physically
present member of the audience
could have been uncertain as to
that matter. However, it must
be noted that The Daily in its
news coverage of the proceed
ings misquoted Martin Gerry.
Mr. Gerry stated that the Coun
cil's decision inaccurately repre
sented Mr. Fogelman's position
not because it asserted that Mr.
Fogelman had brought the
charges before the Council (he
did), but because the opinion
stated that Mr. Fogelman ask
ed that the Council invalidate
the election. Mr. Fogelman did
not at any time ask the Coun
cil to invalidate the election; he
brought the charges before the
Council. The Council, itself, first
raised the question of invalidat
ing the election in its delibera
tions on the t ".se. The Daily's
failure to accurately report
what Mr. Gerry said may well
have contributed to its uncer
tainty.
What Witnesses?
The next charge was that the
Council failed to summon or
contact several critical witnesses
in the case. The Daily, of course,
does not mention or even inti
mate who these critical wit
nesses who were neither sum
moned nor contacted were. In
fact, the Council had either
heard from that evening or con
tacted for information every
important witnesses.
The final charge was that the
Council had failed originally to

determine whether the May 9-10
ballot was invalid or whether
only the Senior Class President
ial election would have to be
reconsidered. This charge, oddly
enough, is the only one where
an uncertainty was created by
the Council. This uncertainty
lasted lor approximately one
minute. When the Council at
1:30 a.m. brought in its decision
to invalidate the election results,
it had, of course, been primarily
concerned with the election
about which the charges had
been brought, the Senior class
election. When the Council was
asked whether the entire bal
lot would have to be put up f or
a vote, the Council immediately
reconvened and unanimously de
cided that it would. This pro
cedural sloppiness and unpar
donable uncertainty lasted for
sixty seconds.
The Council just did not at
any time display the "procedural
ignorance" and "sloppy under
standing" of which it was ac
cused. To call the Council's ac
tions a travesty is completely
inaccurate. If the members of
the The Daily staff who were
present were procedurally or
Constitutionally ignorant as well
as generally uncertain, we can
only feel it bizarre (but alas
not infrequent) that they resort
to an editorial column to display
their own inabilities. We can
only reassign those memorable
words of The Daily editorial:
"a travesty has been made of
an institution which badly needs
to command the respect of this
community."

• Give 9 Em The...
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding your editorial bid
ding good riddance to the Axe,
may we inquire what criteria
make trivialities acceptable to
The Daily Edit Board?
Having just spent a weekend
at Chico State College and wit
nessing there a total college
campus involved in a week dedi
cated to fun, we return to Stan
ford and see one of the last
hopes of campus spirit being
trampled underfoot.
The Daily (editorials) seem to
think that, unless every waking
moment is spent in some pseudo
serious, "meaningful" endeavor,
a student is totally wasting his
academic time. Of course, this
does not preclude The Daily
from sponsoring such trivialities
as the Warren G. Wonka legend
arid the preposterous Lag "Gator
fiasco." Trivialities seem to be
legitimate only when they have
the blessing of The Daily.
Rivalry, campus spirit, a little
non-constructive fun never hurt
any campus, and you seem to be
bent on destroying every last
drop of it available here at the
Farm.

• Indiscriminate?
Editor, The Daily:
For months now, The Daily
has been coming out against
various Stanford traditions, such
as social regs, in loeo parentis,
conservatism, racial prejudice,
fraternities. In spite of a rather
weak editorial style and some
what puerile approach to these
non-puerile issues, it has man
aged to attain the image of a
fairly liberal, progressive col
lege paper, although one learns
to think of The Daily only in the
context of other college papers,
never daring to compare this
"student effort" to Big Time
journals such as the Palo Alto
Times.
But now, with Wednesday's
"Good Riddance" editorial re
garding the stolen Axe, one dis
covers that The Daily isn't "lib
eral," but only indiscriminate.
While the university is play
ing with "childhood toys," you
wise, self-important old schol
ars of The Daily are playing
with something far more dan
gerous than dolls, cards, or even
axes: editorial advantage. The

blood of the "unapathetic" Daily
is running a bit thick these days,
one might say coagulating on
the brink of relevant journal
ism. And the fear is, after read
ing yesterday's paranoid editor
ial, that it isn't even red blood.

• In And Out
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Kugelmass is mistaken in
his assertation that Roble's fire
drill three weeks ago was actu
ally an attempt to discover vio
lators of social regulations.
It is present University policy
that each women's residence
have a fire drill during the
course of every quarter. This is
solely a matter of safety. The
procedure in Roble is to check
the sign-out books to ascertain
that those who are not present
are out of the dormitory. This
is not policing; it is concern for
the safety of the girls. In case
of an emergency (earthquake,
fire, etc.) anyone not signed out
and not at her station would
presumably still be in her room
or in the corridors. Other peo
ple's lives would consequently
be endangered in searching out
the individual.
In the recent fire drill, it be
came apparent that a number of
girls who were not present in
the house were not signed out.
This discovery and the ensuing
consequences, were the result
of the drill, not the reason for
it.

• Student Drama
Editor, The Daily:
The Freshman Drama Group
supports Mr. Chan's contention
that "the general poor health
of student artistic life at Stan
ford" could be very much im
proved by more student initia
tive. Yet he failed to include
the Freshman Drama Group as
one of the few student-run dra
matic organization that Stanford
can now boast.
During the winter quarter,
this group produced six plays
and an original short film which
were performed and directed
solely by freshmen. We will be
concluding our first year of
existence with a comedy May

28 and 29. We feel that Fresh
man Drama is contributing tc
the cultural life of Stanford b>
giving freshmen an unusual op
portunity to demonstrate thei s
talents in an undertaking ind<>-
pendent of faculty supervision.

• And Again...
Editor, The Daily:
Although I appreciate the out
standing publicity given to me
by your sports department in
yesterday's article on the Stan
ford Crew, I feel that I cannot
accept all the honors. The cap
tion under the picture says that
I was both stroke and coxswain
of the varsity shell which de
feated Cal last Saturday. But
this duality of roles would en
tail sitting frontwards and back
wards, rowing and steering, and
panting and shouting all r v
once. It would be more than
any normal human being cou I, J
undertake. In order to set the
record straight, I feel that the
glory and fame that accom
panies that picture should go
to our illustrious senior cox
swain, Jonathan Reider. He
the one to be thrown in after
every victory.
