Standard of Conduct
In an informal news preview
of the conference Monday, Prof.
John McDonough stated that
"The University is necessarily
involved in defining the right
standard of human conduct."
Dr. John Maurer stated that
parental permissiveness has en
abled today's students to speak
out more freely. In addition, the
economic affluence has given
them more alternatives lor ac
tion.
"Dr. (Benjamin) Spock prob
ably has more to do with what's
going on now than anyone real
izes," Maurer stated.
Distrust of Elders
Dean of Students Joel Smith
stated, "It seems to me extra
ordinary ironic that a genera
tion such as this generation

which places so much trust in
community should have so much
distrust of the older genera
tion."
At the same time, Smith ex
pressed concern at the mutual
loss of trust between genera
tions. It is "ridiculous" for the
older generation to equate per
sonal appearance with morality,
or to assume that just because
students criticize society's values
they have no moral standards
of their own, he said.
Cesare Massarenti, in explain
ing his views for student gov
ernment next year, stated that
he and Peter Lyman "want to
counter, in a very effective way,
the misconception that students
are irresponsible."
Town Hall
"Anybody that is connected
with the University should be
involved in the decisions of the
University," Massarenti went on.
In explaining this view, he said,
"We don't want to impose solu
tions." He felt that a town hall
type meeting could be one solu
tion.
McDonough said that the aca
demic institutions should foster
the expression of student opin
ion, but added, "the faculty
would have very little enthu
siasm for" community meetings.
