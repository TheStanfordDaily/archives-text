# Lowenstein Urges Viet War De-Escalation
## 
### BRUCE BENTON 
The solution to the problem of the
Vietnam war lies in the halting of
escalation by the United States, ac
cording to Attorney Allard Lowen
stein.
Speaking to an overflow crowd in
the Madera Lounge last night, Lowen
stein stressed three steps which the
U.S. must take to end the war. First,
we must stop all the bombing. Second
we must agree to negotiate with the
National Liberation Front. And final
ly, we must support the enlargement
of the international control agency
to regulate the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Vietnam.
Three Assertions
Lowenstein made three assertions
defining his position regarding pres
ent government policy.
"The most unfortunate aspect of
the Vietnam situation is that the
government doesn't tell us the truth,"
he stated. "The government is pre
tending to seek one settlement, a ne
gotiated peace, and is actively seek
ing another."
"The goals that this government
seeks are not attainable, and they
are therefore stupid goals." In mak
ing this second assertion, Lowenstein
pointed out that the Johnson Admini
stration must believe the Viet Cong
"will just disappear" so a negotiation
will never be necessary.

The facts of the situation show
this idea to be false, he said. Accord
ing to Lovvenstein, Secretary of De
fense McNamara told the Senate that
nothing we do with bombs will stop
infiltration or break the morale of
Hanoi. He also pointed out General
Westmoreland's estimate that the war
might last ten more years.
"Because the government is dis
honest about its goals, it is commit
ting a third atrocity — to sabotage
any chance we have for negotiations,"
Lowenstein added for his final asser
tion. This is perhaps the worst fail
ing of our government, he said.
Stop The Conflict
President Johnson has engineered
the problem into a situation where
there are only three choices: total
war, unilateral withdrawal, or John
son's policy. Our duty is to create a
fourth option. "We must show the
Administration that we support a
policy of stopping the conflict at its
present level."
Answering questions concerning
our policy as it might affect China,
Lowenstein said, "Right now our
China watchers sit around and watch
China from Hong Kong. The next
thing you know they will be watch
ing Hong Kong from Formosa."
Refuting the claims that Vietnam is
a parallel to Munich, where a dictator

was appeased, Lowenstein asked,
"Who is the Hitler in Vietnam? If he
wins, is his next stop San Francisco?
But what if his next target is Peking,
then what do we do?"
The Johnson Image
Speaking of President Johnson as
a man he respected, Lowenstein com
pared the public image of the Presi
dent to a "great gale of political hali
tosis coming out of the White House."
When asked a question on the 1968
presidential elections Lowenstein ex
pressed the hope that a Democrat

other than Lyndon Johnson might
win the office. If the contest becomes
a matter between Johnson and a Re
publican who favors ending the mili
tary struggle in Vietnam, Lowenstein
said, it might become necessary to
"put country before party."

Lowenstein will engage in an in
formal debate on Vietnam this after
noon with Stanford's diplomat-in-resi
dence, John K. Emerson. The event is
scheduled for 4:30 in the Tresidder
small lounge.

"Who is the Hitler in Vietnam? If he
wins, is his next stop San Francisco?
But what if his next target is Peking,
then what do we do?"
The Johnson Image
Speaking of President Johnson as
a man he respected, Lowenstein com
pared the public image of the Presi
dent to a "great gale of political hali
tosis coming out of the White House."
When asked a question on the 1968
presidential elections Lowenstein ex
pressed the hope that a Democrat

other than Lyndon Johnson might
win the office. If the contest becomes
a matter between Johnson and a Re
publican who favors ending the mili
tary struggle in Vietnam, Lowenstein
said, it might become necessary to
"put country before party."

Lowenstein will engage in an in
formal debate on Vietnam this after
noon with Stanford's diplomat-in-resi
dence, John K. Emerson. The event is
scheduled for 4:30 in the Tresidder

'LBJ must be assuming that Ho Chi
\flnh will conduct himself in order
o guarantee Johnson's reelection: sur
render just before elections," said Al
ard G. Lowenstein last night in an
nformal speech.
The solution to the problem of the
Vietnam war lies in the halting of
escalation by the United States, ac
cording to Attorney Allard Lowen
stein.
Speaking to an overflow crowd in
the Madera Lounge last night, Lowen
stein stressed three steps which the
U.S. must take to end the war. First,
we must stop all the bombing. Second
we must agree to negotiate with the
National Liberation Front. And final
ly, we must support the enlargement
of the international control agency
to regulate the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Vietnam.
Three Assertions
Lowenstein made three assertions
defining his position regarding pres
ent government policy.
"The most unfortunate aspect of
the Vietnam situation is that the
government doesn't tell us the truth,"
he stated. "The government is pre
tending to seek one settlement, a ne
gotiated peace, and is actively seek
ing another."
"The goals that this government
seeks are not attainable, and they
are therefore stupid goals." In mak
ing this second assertion, Lowenstein
pointed out that the Johnson Admini
stration must believe the Viet Cong
"will just disappear" so a negotiation
will never be necessary.

The facts of the situation show
this idea to be false, he said. Accord
ing to Lovvenstein, Secretary of De
fense McNamara told the Senate that
nothing we do with bombs will stop
infiltration or break the morale of
Hanoi. He also pointed out General
Westmoreland's estimate that the war
might last ten more years.
"Because the government is dis
honest about its goals, it is commit
ting a third atrocity — to sabotage
any chance we have for negotiations,"
Lowenstein added for his final asser
tion. This is perhaps the worst fail
ing of our government, he said.
Stop The Conflict
President Johnson has engineered
the problem into a situation where
there are only three choices: total
war, unilateral withdrawal, or John
son's policy. Our duty is to create a
fourth option. "We must show the
Administration that we support a
policy of stopping the conflict at its
present level."
Answering questions concerning
our policy as it might affect China,
Lowenstein said, "Right now our
China watchers sit around and watch
China from Hong Kong. The next
thing you know they will be watch
ing Hong Kong from Formosa."
Refuting the claims that Vietnam is
a parallel to Munich, where a dictator

was appeased, Lowenstein asked,
"Who is the Hitler in Vietnam? If he
wins, is his next stop San Francisco?
But what if his next target is Peking,
then what do we do?"
