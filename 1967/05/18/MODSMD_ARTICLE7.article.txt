# Clockwork Quarrel: Quarters Versus Semesters
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Two much debated issues among pro
fessors and college administrators across
he country concern the division of the aca
iemic year and how students' course loads
should be distributed during their four years
>112 undergraduate education.
The most popular plans are the semester
system or the quarter scheme, which Stan
ford has used since 1918. Advocates of the
semester system argue that it gives students
nore time to pursue their studies in depth,
o experiment with various approaches to
he subject matter, and to have more time for
;tudy and extracurricular activities between
?xams.
Proponents of quarter divisions stress that
students can take more courses, enjoy anxiety
;ree vacations, and take advantage of a
•egUlar quarter during summer months.
Three-Three Plan
A large number of American universities
lave instituted variations of these two pro
grams. At Miami of Ohio, Occidental, Lake
Forest, and Dartmouth, for instance, a "three
:hree" plan is in operation whereby students
take three courses three times per year. Dart

mouth's bulletin states that this system: "em
phasizes the development of students' ability
to understand and appreciate the original
work of original minds of the past and pres
ent" by allowing for greater "depth and
breadth" study.
Dennis McNeely, a Dartmouth transfer, ex
plained that classes are held Monday through
Saturday, and there is more emphasis placed
on independent study, and it gives students
more extra time. He added, however, that
there was no way to "pick up" extra units.
Wellesley College in Massachusetts has fall
and winter terms of twelve weeks each during
which girls attend four classes twice a week.
In the spring students study two courses for
six weeks with four class hours for each
subject. Transfer Jo Ann Kolmes said that
many of her professors disliked that system
because the courses were too broad.
"Professors Are Saner"
When asked to compare the Wellesley plan
to Stanford, she explained that they were much
the same, "except that the six week period
was too much of a shock. Stanford professors
seem to be much saner about the course ma
terial to be covered per quarter."
At the University of Santa Clara freshmen

and sophomores take four courses three
times a year while juniors and seniors elect
three during each term. Transfer Pat Hanley
feels that her academic load at Santa Clara
was too structured, and she prefers the great
er flexibility of the quarter system:
"Students are not allowed to take extra
courses, and if someone drops a class after
the first week of the quarter, the units can
only be made up in summer school or by
staying for part of a fifth year."
The semester system at Harvard has some
courses that last for the whole year, while
others are for one semester. Students are
given a two week "reading period" before
finals which, as several ex-Harvard students
point out, allows students more freedom to
participate in community activities.
Johnie Scott, who transferred into Stan
ford this year, said that the Harvard model
should be copied on more campuses. "Al
though the quarter system allows students
to move through subjects faster and have
more exposure to various courses, there is
no time for depth."
Progressive Systems
A small number of "progressive institu
tions" have initiated plans quite distinct from

either the semester, quarter, or three-three
systems, At Antioch the year is divided into
three periods; two are spent in intensive study
on the Ohio campus, and the third is devoted
to some type of related field work. Most An
tioch students take five years to earn their
bachelor degrees.
At St. John's in Annapolis, Maryland, the
"course of studies is designed," according to
the handbook, "to rehabilitate the name and
meaning of liberal arts curriculum." The four
years are divided among six divisions: Langu
age, Mathematics, Music, Laboratory, and
Formal Lecture.
Course material is based upon selected
"Great Books ... signposts, as it were, on the
various roads of our tradition." These books
are dealt with in chronological order, begin
ning with Greek literature the freshman year
and progressing to modern works in the se
nior year. Students have only oral exams and
independent research papers. Reading assign
ments and course requirements are identical
for all students of the same year.
C loser To Home
The University of California at Berkeley
switched from the semester to the quarter
system this year, and most of the other U.C.

campuses are following suit. Several students
from Berkeley criticize the change because
professors seem to be assigning a semester
of work in a quarter's time.
The Stanford Law School, on the other
hand, changed last year to semesters. Profes
sor John McDonough said that the system
has worked very well because the course
schedule can be divided better during law
students' three years,
"We always found it disruptive to have so
many stops and starts. Student organizations
especially suffered when they had to slow
down for exams," McDonough explained. He
added that semesters allow for a more ad
vantageous exam schedule. Law students
now begin their academic year after Labor
Day and have finals before Christmas vaca
tions. McDonough said that he had heard
no complaints about the new plan.
The question of quarters versus semesters
has been raised frequently in the Academic
Council and will be examined during the
Study of Education at Stanford. Tomorrow
The Daily will publish a forum dealing with
this topic. Guest writers will include Dr. Har
vey Hall, registrar, and Larry Friedlander,
assistant professor of English.

this topic. Guest writers will include Dr. Har
vey Hall, registrar, and Larry Friedlander,
assistant professor of English.
Two much debated issues among pro
fessors and college administrators across
he country concern the division of the aca
iemic year and how students' course loads
should be distributed during their four years
>112 undergraduate education.
The most popular plans are the semester
system or the quarter scheme, which Stan
ford has used since 1918. Advocates of the
semester system argue that it gives students
nore time to pursue their studies in depth,
o experiment with various approaches to
he subject matter, and to have more time for
;tudy and extracurricular activities between
?xams.
Proponents of quarter divisions stress that
students can take more courses, enjoy anxiety
;ree vacations, and take advantage of a
•egUlar quarter during summer months.
Three-Three Plan
A large number of American universities
lave instituted variations of these two pro
grams. At Miami of Ohio, Occidental, Lake
Forest, and Dartmouth, for instance, a "three
:hree" plan is in operation whereby students
take three courses three times per year. Dart

mouth's bulletin states that this system: "em
phasizes the development of students' ability
to understand and appreciate the original
work of original minds of the past and pres
ent" by allowing for greater "depth and
breadth" study.
Dennis McNeely, a Dartmouth transfer, ex
plained that classes are held Monday through
Saturday, and there is more emphasis placed
on independent study, and it gives students
more extra time. He added, however, that
there was no way to "pick up" extra units.
Wellesley College in Massachusetts has fall
and winter terms of twelve weeks each during
which girls attend four classes twice a week.
In the spring students study two courses for
six weeks with four class hours for each
subject. Transfer Jo Ann Kolmes said that
many of her professors disliked that system
because the courses were too broad.
"Professors Are Saner"
When asked to compare the Wellesley plan
to Stanford, she explained that they were much
the same, "except that the six week period
was too much of a shock. Stanford professors
seem to be much saner about the course ma
terial to be covered per quarter."
At the University of Santa Clara freshmen

and sophomores take four courses three
times a year while juniors and seniors elect
three during each term. Transfer Pat Hanley
feels that her academic load at Santa Clara
was too structured, and she prefers the great
er flexibility of the quarter system:
"Students are not allowed to take extra
courses, and if someone drops a class after
the first week of the quarter, the units can
only be made up in summer school or by
staying for part of a fifth year."
The semester system at Harvard has some
courses that last for the whole year, while
others are for one semester. Students are
given a two week "reading period" before
finals which, as several ex-Harvard students
point out, allows students more freedom to
participate in community activities.
Johnie Scott, who transferred into Stan
ford this year, said that the Harvard model
should be copied on more campuses. "Al
though the quarter system allows students
to move through subjects faster and have
more exposure to various courses, there is
no time for depth."
Progressive Systems
A small number of "progressive institu
tions" have initiated plans quite distinct from

either the semester, quarter, or three-three
systems, At Antioch the year is divided into
three periods; two are spent in intensive study
on the Ohio campus, and the third is devoted
to some type of related field work. Most An
tioch students take five years to earn their
bachelor degrees.
At St. John's in Annapolis, Maryland, the
"course of studies is designed," according to
the handbook, "to rehabilitate the name and
meaning of liberal arts curriculum." The four
years are divided among six divisions: Langu
age, Mathematics, Music, Laboratory, and
Formal Lecture.
Course material is based upon selected
"Great Books ... signposts, as it were, on the
various roads of our tradition." These books
are dealt with in chronological order, begin
ning with Greek literature the freshman year
and progressing to modern works in the se
nior year. Students have only oral exams and
independent research papers. Reading assign
ments and course requirements are identical
for all students of the same year.
C loser To Home
The University of California at Berkeley
switched from the semester to the quarter
system this year, and most of the other U.C.

campuses are following suit. Several students
from Berkeley criticize the change because
professors seem to be assigning a semester
of work in a quarter's time.
The Stanford Law School, on the other
hand, changed last year to semesters. Profes
sor John McDonough said that the system
has worked very well because the course
schedule can be divided better during law
students' three years,
"We always found it disruptive to have so
many stops and starts. Student organizations
especially suffered when they had to slow
down for exams," McDonough explained. He
added that semesters allow for a more ad
vantageous exam schedule. Law students
now begin their academic year after Labor
Day and have finals before Christmas vaca
tions. McDonough said that he had heard
no complaints about the new plan.
The question of quarters versus semesters
has been raised frequently in the Academic
Council and will be examined during the
Study of Education at Stanford. Tomorrow

Two much debated issues among pro
fessors and college administrators across
he country concern the division of the aca
iemic year and how students' course loads
should be distributed during their four years
>112 undergraduate education.
The most popular plans are the semester
system or the quarter scheme, which Stan
ford has used since 1918. Advocates of the
semester system argue that it gives students
nore time to pursue their studies in depth,
o experiment with various approaches to
he subject matter, and to have more time for
;tudy and extracurricular activities between
?xams.
Proponents of quarter divisions stress that
students can take more courses, enjoy anxiety
;ree vacations, and take advantage of a
•egUlar quarter during summer months.
Three-Three Plan
A large number of American universities
lave instituted variations of these two pro
grams. At Miami of Ohio, Occidental, Lake
Forest, and Dartmouth, for instance, a "three
:hree" plan is in operation whereby students
take three courses three times per year. Dart

mouth's bulletin states that this system: "em
phasizes the development of students' ability
to understand and appreciate the original
work of original minds of the past and pres
ent" by allowing for greater "depth and
breadth" study.
Dennis McNeely, a Dartmouth transfer, ex
plained that classes are held Monday through
Saturday, and there is more emphasis placed
on independent study, and it gives students
more extra time. He added, however, that
there was no way to "pick up" extra units.
Wellesley College in Massachusetts has fall
and winter terms of twelve weeks each during
which girls attend four classes twice a week.
In the spring students study two courses for
six weeks with four class hours for each
subject. Transfer Jo Ann Kolmes said that
many of her professors disliked that system
because the courses were too broad.
"Professors Are Saner"
When asked to compare the Wellesley plan
to Stanford, she explained that they were much
the same, "except that the six week period
was too much of a shock. Stanford professors
seem to be much saner about the course ma
terial to be covered per quarter."
At the University of Santa Clara freshmen

and sophomores take four courses three
times a year while juniors and seniors elect
three during each term. Transfer Pat Hanley
feels that her academic load at Santa Clara
was too structured, and she prefers the great
er flexibility of the quarter system:
"Students are not allowed to take extra
courses, and if someone drops a class after
the first week of the quarter, the units can
only be made up in summer school or by
staying for part of a fifth year."
The semester system at Harvard has some
courses that last for the whole year, while
others are for one semester. Students are
given a two week "reading period" before
finals which, as several ex-Harvard students
point out, allows students more freedom to
participate in community activities.
Johnie Scott, who transferred into Stan
ford this year, said that the Harvard model
should be copied on more campuses. "Al
though the quarter system allows students
to move through subjects faster and have
more exposure to various courses, there is
no time for depth."
Progressive Systems
A small number of "progressive institu
tions" have initiated plans quite distinct from

either the semester, quarter, or three-three
systems, At Antioch the year is divided into
three periods; two are spent in intensive study
on the Ohio campus, and the third is devoted
to some type of related field work. Most An
tioch students take five years to earn their
bachelor degrees.
At St. John's in Annapolis, Maryland, the
"course of studies is designed," according to
the handbook, "to rehabilitate the name and
meaning of liberal arts curriculum." The four
years are divided among six divisions: Langu
age, Mathematics, Music, Laboratory, and
Formal Lecture.
Course material is based upon selected
"Great Books ... signposts, as it were, on the
various roads of our tradition." These books
are dealt with in chronological order, begin
ning with Greek literature the freshman year
and progressing to modern works in the se
nior year. Students have only oral exams and
independent research papers. Reading assign
ments and course requirements are identical
for all students of the same year.
C loser To Home
The University of California at Berkeley
switched from the semester to the quarter
system this year, and most of the other U.C.

campuses are following suit. Several students
from Berkeley criticize the change because
professors seem to be assigning a semester
of work in a quarter's time.
The Stanford Law School, on the other
hand, changed last year to semesters. Profes
sor John McDonough said that the system
has worked very well because the course
schedule can be divided better during law
students' three years,
"We always found it disruptive to have so
many stops and starts. Student organizations
especially suffered when they had to slow
down for exams," McDonough explained. He
added that semesters allow for a more ad
vantageous exam schedule. Law students
now begin their academic year after Labor
Day and have finals before Christmas vaca
tions. McDonough said that he had heard
no complaints about the new plan.

has been raised frequently in the Academic
Council and will be examined during the
