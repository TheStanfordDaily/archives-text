Hallowed tradition
of "pinning" a girl is
up-dated by-
Sprite bottle caps.
According to an independent survey (we took it
ourselves), a startling new practice is becoming
widespread on some college campuses.
Suddenly, fraternity men are no longer "pinning"
the lovely young things that catch their eye.
Instead, they reach for a bottle of tart,
Sprite--and proceed to "cap"
> object affections.
through the ceremony of openinga bottle of Sprite.
It fizzes! Roars! Buzzes! Tingles! Bubbles!
All of which makes for a much more moving moment
than to simply "pin" a girl.
Then, too, the intimacy of two people engaged
in the act of opening a bottle of Sprite in itself
leads to strong emotional involvement.
Capped off, of course, by the sharing of a
few moments of delicious abandon. (Tasting the
tingling tartness of Sprite, that is.)
The beauty of the idea is that if the course
of true love does not run smooth, you don't have
to go to the trouble of getting back your pin.
You just buy another bottle of Sprite.
