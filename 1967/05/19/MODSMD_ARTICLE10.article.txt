## Impact Of Vietnam Summer 
### WILLIAM F. PEPPER 
(CPS)—Vietnam Summer, a
national educational program
against the war in Vietnam an
nounced April 23 in Cambridge
by Dr. Martin Luther King, could
well determine (through its suc
cess or failure) the destiny of
the United States.
The first announcement of the
summer program came April 15
in New York, when the civil
rights leader and Nobel Prize
winner told 125,000 persons that
college students should stay
home this summer (as they did
for the famous Mississippi Sum
mer of 1964) and work within
their communities toward end
ing the war.
Support for the nationwide
educational and organizational
effort has been forthcoming from
every constituency connected
with the peace movement. In my
judgment the success of Vietnam
Summer may not only make it
impossible for today's barbaric
leadership to continue this
wretched war, but also develop
political organizational bases
across the country for tomor
row's struggle to acomplish pol
itical, social and economic recon
struction.
Organized
The concept of Viet Nam Sum
mer originated with organizing
experiences in the Greater Bos
ton area. (Gar Alperovitz of the
Kennedy Institute at Harvard is
now chief director of the sum
mer project.)
Since then ,a number of or
ganizations— Women Strike for
Peace, clergy and laymen con
cerned with the war, the Nation
al Council of Churches, and the
National Conference for New
Politics (NCNP) among them—
have been cooperating in the ef
fort NCNP, for example, has

placed a man in full-time work
in Cambridge to help the proj
ect begin, and it is now recruit
ing and hiring field coordinators.
Another example of group ef
forts are those of the national
leadership of the University
Christian Movement and Stu
dents for a Democratic Society,
as well as other student organi
zations who are touring campus
es and recruiting volunteers. Lee
Webb of the Institute for Policy
Studies in Washington is serving
as one of the key national direc
tors.
Mississippi Reversed
Viet Nam Summer is a sort
of Mississippi Summer in re
verse, in which volunteers work
in their own communities (in
stead of going South) over the
vacation in order to: (1) identi
fy by survey or other means the
anti-war sentiment present; (2)
educate and cultivate further
with resource discussion ses
sions; and (3) organize this sen
timent into specific action proj
ects, the nature of which will
be determined at the local level.
These latter may involve peti
tions to Congressmen demand
ing that they return and hold
public hearings on the war in
their districts; placement of an
ti-war questions on local ballots;
encouragement of new political
groups at the local level; and
even the urgent development of
a national alternative to Lyndon
Johnson for president of this
country in 1968.
Infinite Possibilities
Possibilities for other activity
are infinite. And, moreover, or
ganizers are now hoping for over
10,000 volunteers at work in 500
communities by the fourth of
July.
Although the call to partici
pate is out to professionals,
housewives, workers and others,

this effort needs widespread stu
dent participation in order to
succeed. And students who are
ready to join their brothers and
sisters all over America in per
haps the most serious drive of
the peace movement to date,
should get in touch with the na
tional office immediately. Be
cause the killing, the bombing,
the rape in Vietnam are still
going on.

executive director of the Nation
al Conference for New Politics.)
