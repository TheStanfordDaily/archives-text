# Quarters Allow Opportunities For More Elective Exploration
## 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
While the University of Cali
fornia has decided to change to
tjie quarter system, on the Stan
ford campus one begins to hear
agitation for a return to semes
ters.
The main argument posed is
the quarter is too short.
<Â£ne barely begins to delve into
a*subject before finals are upon
us. Moreover, we go through the
process of closing down the uni
versity, with its complications of
examination, grading, re-coordi
nation and re-registration, three
times when it is possible to do it
only twice.
These criticisms have validity.
But what the critics fail to rec
ognize is that the semester sys
tem also has its faults. It is easy
to examine a system presently
under operation and demonstrate
its failings. It is much more dif
ficult to imagine the complica

tions that would arise under an
opposite system. They must not
be ignored. We must recognize
that the development of these
problems may even outweigh the
advantages.
More (bourses
In the first place, under the
quarter system, a student is able
to take more courses. If he
wants to move out of his major
field to inquire into another, ho
can afford the time required
without having to struggle af
terwards to meet his major re
quirements. Under the semester
system, this would be impossible.
Moreover, although a student
can take more courses he is less
likely to be taking many differ
ent ones at once. Under a quar
ter system he would be much
more likely to take three 5-unit
courses whereas under a semes
ter system most students study
five 3-unit classes.

Secondly, a greater variety of
courses can be offered to stu
dents. The presence of a year
divided into three parts instead
of two allows the faculty and
administration the freedom to
plan courses of differing scopes.
Courses can be programmed for
one, two or throe quarters, de
pending on the breadth of sub
ject matter to be covered.
Real Vacations
Thirdly, vacations become
real vacations under a quarter
system. The majority of students
will not find time to study very
diligently during a vacation any
way, so why iniitate a system
that pretends they will?
Furthermore, with a long va
cation breaking into the middle
of a course of study, it becomes
much more difficult for the stu
dent to relate the material pre
sented and see the course as a
unity.

Finally, the most important
obstacle to the semester system
is the Overseas Campus pro
gram. Residence in Europe for
one semester would certainly not
be long enough for a relationship
to develop between the student
and the local population, while
two semesters, although provid
ing enough time, would drastic
ally cut down the number of
students who could benefit by
the experience. A two-semester
program would take such a large
block out of the education pro
gram that students with demand
ing majors (for example, engi
neering) would lose the oppor
tunity entirely.
Outside Reading
It seems that the greatest crit
icism of the quarter system
comes from those involved in
courses requiring outside read
ing. But perhaps a great part of
the problem is that instructors
attempt to fit a semester's work
into one quarter. If they would
limit the scope of the course and
teach it for one quarter or ex
pand it and teach it for two, then
perhaps the problem would not
exist.
One sometimes wonders wheth
er some of the agitation for a
semester system does not basic
ally stem from the fact that we
are on the quarter system. The
word "change" begins to become
synonymous with the word
"good."
Before we change, we should
definitely be aware of the con
sequences.
