# Year-Long Courses Promote Better Scholastic Methods
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
The University of Toronto,
which I attend, has only one
term per year; it runs then on
the uni-semester system.
The chief advantages of such
a system are two: the first re
lates to the quality of work ac
complished and the second is
connected to personal develop
ment.
One principle ingredient is ed
ucation which Stanford seems to
ignore by adhering to the quar
ter system is time. Quality work
is not usually done in nine or
ten week bursts; it takes a much
longer period of time, such as a
year.
Paper Writing
This is illustrated perhaps
most graphically in the writing
of term papers. Under the cur
rent system at Stanford, one
must get to the library no later
than, say, the end of the second
week of the quarter so that hc>
msy find two or three of the ten
relevant books. (Of the rest of
the ten, Stanford does not hold
five, one is being rebound, and
one or two have been checked
out by a professor for the year.)
Because of course reading
loads and other term paper
work, a student cannot afford to
spend more than a week or two
of intensive work on any one
jjaper.
The kind of written work which
results is predictable. Students
must choose their topics before
the course has really begun and
V>Qn they have inadequate time
to complete papers, so compara
tively superficial writing results.
This is the fault of the system
and not of the students.
In a school with a year-long
term in which only one or two
major writing asignments are

made for each course, the pa
pers can be more substantial be
cause of the longer academic cy
cle. The additional time permits
more thorough research so that
basic problems, which tend to
get ignored in a quarter system
because they cause undue delay
and prevent completion of one
term paper so that the next one
can be begun, tend more often
to be comfronted.
High Expectations
The expectation of teachers is
higher; they demand that the
topic chosen be covered thor
oughly and that all aspects of it
be confronted.
A further advantage to hav
ing a long period of time in
which to write papers is that
it gives an idea time to develop.
The immediate inspiration for
a term paper is tempered by sev
eral months of thinking about
it, challenging it, redefining it.
This is healthy and usually re
sults in a paper in which the
assertions are well-though out
and thoroughly substantiated.
The benefits for term papers
then of the uni-semester system
are mainly in terms of complete
ness; a piece of work represents
a real coming-to-grips with a
scholarly problem.
integrated Whole
There are benefits also for nor
mal course work. These are sum
marized by integration or whole
ness.
On a quarter system, knowl
edge tends to become considered
as contained in a series of iso
lated ten-week packages. The ex
amination system, which empha
sizes intensive memorization for
one performance, only accentu
ates this tendency. As a result,
the system makes it difficult to
see interrelationships among dis
ciplines.
The year system with its long

er period of exposure and its em
phasis on thorough work per
mits and even encourages the
discovery of relatedness of vari
ous fields. And one has the time
to encorporate an insight from
sociology, say, in a term paper
for history.
The seeing of wholeness with
in a discipline is also fostered.
One has time to see the relation
between the work of the first
half of the year and that of the
second. He is encouraged to see
the work of the entire year as a
whole.
The college years are a time
for development: questioning,
experimenting, concluding, chal
lenging. This process can go on
much fore fruitfully and much
less disruptively if the intensive
ness that the quarter system
brings with it is broken.
Campus Atmosphere
The atmosphere of a campus
with a year term is more re
laxed. There is an implicit ack
nowledgment that time is one
of the prime factors in educa
tion. But more importantly,
there is a realization that valid
personal change comes only
slowly. We didn't all become
Democrats, for example, during
pre-reg week. It was a change
which only came over time as we
challenged one by one the po
litical assumptions we had
learned at home.
The quarter system does not
adequately recognize and pro
vide for this long-term type of
development. Such activity must
be done outside of the existing
academic structure, which means
in some ways in conflict with it.
This produces many which-way
do-I-go pressures that would be
eliminated if such development
(which is a natural process)
were recognized and rated into
the academic structure.
