# Reduce Plethora Of Paper Work

### DR. HARVEY HALL Registrar 
Prior to 1917-18, Stanford op
erated on a semester calendar.
In 1918 Stanford went on the
quarter system a id has remain
ed so ever sine .
In 1933, ther. was a major
review of the S'inford calendar
and it was deci ed to remain on
the quarter s' >tem by vote of
the Fall Acad nic Council.
In 1955, there was another
extensive review of the Univer-
calendar and it was again
decided to remain on the quar
fyr system. Before and after
the 1955 review there had been
frfiany minor scrimmages on this
(juestion in some of which I
|vive participated.
Minority Opinion
,J I have always wound up on
tjie minority side of these dis
cussions because from the stand
point of the Registrar's Office
semester system seems to
me to be clearly advantageous.
Ll feel justified in cribbing
literally from my own 1955 notes
Kere because I do not believe
ffiat the issues or circumstances
imve changed.
'XI think we can assume here
tyat a summer session will be
the same under
$ther a semester system or
ouarter system (since we are
qhrrently operating with one

week programs, four-week pro
grams, eight-week programs,
and eleven-week programs, it is
difficulty to see how a semester
plan could offer a more complex
program than we now have un
der the quarter system).
With the Summer Session re
garded as a constant factor un
der either system we can simp
ly compare two semester regi
strations under that system as
against three quarterly registra
tions in an academic year un
der our existing system.
Semester Advantages
Several advantages are im
mediately apparent.
The cost of supplies would
be reduced; registration materi
als for one of the quarters
would represent a clear sav
ings. Processing these in the
machine room would be part
of the same saving, and one
of the quantity Time Schedules
which we now issue would no
longer be necessary.
A savings in personnel could
be realized. One of our tempor
ary registration day payrolls

would be wiped out completely.
We could also reduce the staff
in the Recorder's Office.
Deadlines
We are continually confront
ed with deadlines in this office.
Pre-registration comes three
weeks before the end of a quar
ter and then final examinations
and grade recording are imme
diately upon us. Thereafter we
immediately prepare for the en
suing quarter's registration. At
the end of the first two weeks
we consider programs fixed and
we start preparation for mid
term report sheets.
We just barely have time to
do this and get the mid term re
port sheets into the hands of
the instructors who return them
to us in about two or three days'
time having ascertained the cor
rectness of the names thereon
and having indicated those who
are doing unsatisfactory work.
"Unsatisfactory notices" are
immediately sent to students
and then it is time for pre regi
stration and the cycle repeats.

The fact that these deadlines
would not come quite so fre
quently under the semester
system would enable us to fur
nish better service to faculty
and students and would relieve
the tension caused by the press
ing time factor under which we
are constantly working.
Increased Efficiency
More time would enable us to
perform our tasks with a high
level of accuracy. Under the two
registrations of the semester
system less faculty and student
time would be devoted to the
mechanics of program planning
and registering.
My own hope here is that
this would not mean that stu
dents would see less of their ad
visers, but that they would de
vote more time to long range
planning and discussion of ob
jectives.
I realize that I have been talk
ing so far about the mechanical
trappings of the system and not
education itself. At the risk of
seeming to rationalize, I want to
add that I do believe that the

longer term would make more
time for thinking, exploring —
studying in depth which is peda
gogically sound.
Deeply Imbedded
I am well aware that the prob
lems incident to the change it
self would not be inconsequen
tial. The quarter system is deep
ly imbedded in our systems, our
records, and all of our publi
cations.
A complete re-thinking of the
total curriculum would be neces
sitated by this kind of change.
I realize also that with the
University of California just
having changed to a quarter
system, with the California State
Colleges about to do so, and
the junior colleges thinking
about it, the time seems less
propitious for such a change
than has been the case on other
occasions when the question
was studied thoroughly.
Notwithstanding these consid
erations, if there were a vote
on the subject now and I were
to participate, I would vote to
change to the semester system.

ings. Processing these in the
machine room would be part
of the same saving, and one
of the quantity Time Schedules
which we now issue would no
longer be necessary.
A savings in personnel could
be realized. One of our tempor
ary registration day payrolls

would be wiped out completely.
We could also reduce the staff
in the Recorder's Office.
Deadlines
We are continually confront
ed with deadlines in this office.
Pre-registration comes three
weeks before the end of a quar
ter and then final examinations
and grade recording are imme
diately upon us. Thereafter we
immediately prepare for the en
suing quarter's registration. At
the end of the first two weeks
we consider programs fixed and
we start preparation for mid
term report sheets.
We just barely have time to
do this and get the mid term re
port sheets into the hands of
the instructors who return them
to us in about two or three days'
time having ascertained the cor
rectness of the names thereon
and having indicated those who
are doing unsatisfactory work.
"Unsatisfactory notices" are
immediately sent to students
and then it is time for pre regi
stration and the cycle repeats.

The fact that these deadlines
would not come quite so fre
quently under the semester
system would enable us to fur
nish better service to faculty
and students and would relieve
the tension caused by the press
ing time factor under which we
are constantly working.
Increased Efficiency
More time would enable us to
perform our tasks with a high
level of accuracy. Under the two
registrations of the semester
system less faculty and student
time would be devoted to the
mechanics of program planning
and registering.
My own hope here is that
this would not mean that stu
dents would see less of their ad
visers, but that they would de
vote more time to long range
planning and discussion of ob
jectives.
I realize that I have been talk
ing so far about the mechanical
trappings of the system and not
education itself. At the risk of
seeming to rationalize, I want to
add that I do believe that the

longer term would make more
time for thinking, exploring —
studying in depth which is peda
gogically sound.
Deeply Imbedded
I am well aware that the prob
lems incident to the change it
self would not be inconsequen
tial. The quarter system is deep
ly imbedded in our systems, our
records, and all of our publi
cations.
A complete re-thinking of the
total curriculum would be neces
sitated by this kind of change.
I realize also that with the
University of California just
having changed to a quarter
system, with the California State
Colleges about to do so, and
the junior colleges thinking
about it, the time seems less
propitious for such a change
than has been the case on other
occasions when the question
was studied thoroughly.
Notwithstanding these consid
erations, if there were a vote
on the subject now and I were
to participate, I would vote to
change to the semester system.
Prior to 1917-18, Stanford op
erated on a semester calendar.
In 1918 Stanford went on the
quarter system a id has remain
ed so ever sine .
In 1933, ther. was a major
review of the S'inford calendar
and it was deci ed to remain on
the quarter s' >tem by vote of
the Fall Acad nic Council.
In 1955, there was another
extensive review of the Univer-
calendar and it was again
decided to remain on the quar
fyr system. Before and after
the 1955 review there had been
frfiany minor scrimmages on this
(juestion in some of which I
|vive participated.
Minority Opinion
,J I have always wound up on
tjie minority side of these dis
cussions because from the stand
point of the Registrar's Office
semester system seems to
me to be clearly advantageous.
Ll feel justified in cribbing
literally from my own 1955 notes
Kere because I do not believe
ffiat the issues or circumstances
imve changed.
'XI think we can assume here
tyat a summer session will be
the same under
$ther a semester system or
ouarter system (since we are
qhrrently operating with one

week programs, four-week pro
grams, eight-week programs,
and eleven-week programs, it is
difficulty to see how a semester
plan could offer a more complex
program than we now have un
der the quarter system).
With the Summer Session re
garded as a constant factor un
der either system we can simp
ly compare two semester regi
strations under that system as
against three quarterly registra
tions in an academic year un
der our existing system.
Semester Advantages
Several advantages are im
mediately apparent.
The cost of supplies would
be reduced; registration materi
als for one of the quarters
would represent a clear sav
ings. Processing these in the
machine room would be part
of the same saving, and one

trappings of the system and not
education itself. At the risk of
seeming to rationalize, I want to
add that I do believe that the

longer term would make more
time for thinking, exploring —
studying in depth which is peda
gogically sound.
Deeply Imbedded
I am well aware that the prob
lems incident to the change it
self would not be inconsequen
tial. The quarter system is deep
ly imbedded in our systems, our
records, and all of our publi
cations.
A complete re-thinking of the
total curriculum would be neces
sitated by this kind of change.
I realize also that with the
University of California just
having changed to a quarter
system, with the California State
Colleges about to do so, and
the junior colleges thinking
about it, the time seems less
propitious for such a change
than has been the case on other
occasions when the question
was studied thoroughly.
Notwithstanding these consid
erations, if there were a vote
on the subject now and I were
to participate, I would vote to
change to the semester system.
Prior to 1917-18, Stanford op
erated on a semester calendar.
In 1918 Stanford went on the
quarter system a id has remain
ed so ever sine .
In 1933, ther. was a major
review of the S'inford calendar
and it was deci ed to remain on
the quarter s' >tem by vote of
the Fall Acad nic Council.
In 1955, there was another
extensive review of the Univer-
calendar and it was again
decided to remain on the quar
fyr system. Before and after
the 1955 review there had been
frfiany minor scrimmages on this
(juestion in some of which I
|vive participated.
Minority Opinion
,J I have always wound up on
tjie minority side of these dis
cussions because from the stand
point of the Registrar's Office
semester system seems to
me to be clearly advantageous.
Ll feel justified in cribbing
literally from my own 1955 notes
Kere because I do not believe
ffiat the issues or circumstances
imve changed.
'XI think we can assume here
tyat a summer session will be
the same under
$ther a semester system or
ouarter system (since we are
qhrrently operating with one

week programs, four-week pro
grams, eight-week programs,
and eleven-week programs, it is
difficulty to see how a semester
plan could offer a more complex
program than we now have un
der the quarter system).
With the Summer Session re
garded as a constant factor un
der either system we can simp
ly compare two semester regi
strations under that system as
against three quarterly registra
tions in an academic year un
der our existing system.
Semester Advantages
Several advantages are im
mediately apparent.
The cost of supplies would
be reduced; registration materi
als for one of the quarters
would represent a clear sav
ings. Processing these in the
machine room would be part
of the same saving, and one
of the quantity Time Schedules
which we now issue would no
longer be necessary.
A savings in personnel could
be realized. One of our tempor
ary registration day payrolls

would be wiped out completely.
We could also reduce the staff
in the Recorder's Office.
Deadlines
We are continually confront
ed with deadlines in this office.
Pre-registration comes three
weeks before the end of a quar
ter and then final examinations
and grade recording are imme
diately upon us. Thereafter we
immediately prepare for the en
suing quarter's registration. At
the end of the first two weeks
we consider programs fixed and
we start preparation for mid
term report sheets.
We just barely have time to
do this and get the mid term re
port sheets into the hands of
the instructors who return them
to us in about two or three days'
time having ascertained the cor
rectness of the names thereon
and having indicated those who
are doing unsatisfactory work.
"Unsatisfactory notices" are
immediately sent to students
and then it is time for pre regi
stration and the cycle repeats.

The fact that these deadlines
would not come quite so fre
quently under the semester
system would enable us to fur
nish better service to faculty
and students and would relieve
the tension caused by the press
ing time factor under which we
are constantly working.
Increased Efficiency
More time would enable us to
perform our tasks with a high
level of accuracy. Under the two
registrations of the semester
system less faculty and student
time would be devoted to the
mechanics of program planning
and registering.
My own hope here is that
this would not mean that stu
dents would see less of their ad
visers, but that they would de
vote more time to long range
planning and discussion of ob
jectives.

trappings of the system and not
education itself. At the risk of
seeming to rationalize, I want to
