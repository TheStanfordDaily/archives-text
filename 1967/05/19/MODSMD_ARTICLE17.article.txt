# No Time To Relax
## Continual Pressure Hinders Learning 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
With the quarter system, pro
fessors are forced to choose be
tween two poor options, accord
ing to Larry Friedlander, assist
ant professor of English.
"The system makes you as
sign too much material to digest.
Teachers must either spend half
the term slowly introducing ma
terial and methodology and then
rush for scope; or limit the fo
cus to certain select works, thus
negating the basic problem in
the humanities — comparing lit
erary work."
Assimilate Methods
Friedlander also stressed that
in all humanities and social sci
ences a student's assimilation of
his instructor's "method of at
tack" is as important as the con
crete information offered. "Stu
dents and their teachers have to
get used to each other," he ex
plained. In a ten to twelve week
quarter, according to Friedland
er, students have little contact
with their professors, and teach
ers have a difficult time evalu
ating a student's work and prog
ress on the basis of a paper and
one or two exams.
"People are forced to teach a
topic rather than a course. Stu
dents taking four or five classes
suffer from the omnipresent

pressure of grades and have no
chance to make a mistake,"
Friedlander said. "Learning is a
slow process, and it is drastically
reduced when a student has no
freedom to experiment and has
to stick to ways he knows will
get him through."
Friedlander praised the Har
vard semester system which in
cludes a long reading period.
"Students know they have some
leeway to read on their own and
to get excited about an author
who may not he on the regular
reading list. There's no chance
for that here. Indigestion results
when students have to gulp
down four classes a day and
have no chance for feedback."
The quarter plan, Friedlander
stated, prevents the creation of
a community which fosters di
verse cultural and life styles, "a
learning world that encourages
occasional rebellion. Quarters
cause a general ill-feeling to
ward courses, because students
don't have time to find out if
their professors are right. A sta
sis of discomfort remains," said
Friedlander.
Inhuman Load
Students are currently over
loaded, Friedlander feels. "Too
much is demanded of them in an
inhuman way that doesn't take

into consideration the vagueries
of human nature and emotion.
The semester plan is a more hu
mane system which allows for
more independence and relaxa
tion. You don't need to pressure
people to assure that they are
students . . . their caliber is high
enough that they don't have to
be watched any more. Students
tend to react to the premises
that underlie a system," he said.
Friedlander pointed out that
grades are not the only pressure
intensified by the quarter sys
tcm. "Students are under pres
sure to understand which is the
hardest of all. They become frus
trated and pesimistic about re
wards other than grades . . .
true joy undoubtedly has to do
with learning, and their poten
tial as scholars is countered by
the structure of the courses."
Christmas Anxiety?
There is a tendency for stu
dents to feel that pass-fail grad
ing would eliminate much of the
academic pressure, Friedlander
continued. Though revising the
current grading pattern would
be advantageous, Friedlander

feels that the real source of pres
sure comes from lack of time.
"Students begin to assume that
learning will always cause ten
sion, and this is simply not the
case." He added that semesters
ending with reading periods
would cause a general decrease
in pressure that would compen
sate for "a little anxiety during
Christmas vacation."
One of Friedlander's main
criticisms of the quarter plan
concerns its effect upon activi
ties outside the classroom. "Stu
dents having work in small bun
dles can't leave room to partici
pate in exciting extracurricular
activities. This results in an im
poverishment of their own and
the University's cultural life."
Friedlander lias made it a prac
tice in his Shakespeare and dra
ma classes to have acting rather
than discussion sections.
He explained that a great, deal
of talent was revealed when stu
dents were encouragd to partici
pate. "The best way to learn is
through doing. This is hard to
ask when students are overbur
dened with work," he concluded.

with their professors, and teach
ers have a difficult time evalu
ating a student's work and prog
ress on the basis of a paper and
one or two exams.
"People are forced to teach a
topic rather than a course. Stu
dents taking four or five classes
suffer from the omnipresent

pressure of grades and have no
chance to make a mistake,"
Friedlander said. "Learning is a
slow process, and it is drastically
reduced when a student has no
freedom to experiment and has
to stick to ways he knows will
get him through."
Friedlander praised the Har
vard semester system which in
cludes a long reading period.
"Students know they have some
leeway to read on their own and
to get excited about an author
who may not he on the regular
reading list. There's no chance
for that here. Indigestion results
when students have to gulp
down four classes a day and
have no chance for feedback."
The quarter plan, Friedlander
stated, prevents the creation of
a community which fosters di
verse cultural and life styles, "a
learning world that encourages
occasional rebellion. Quarters
cause a general ill-feeling to
ward courses, because students
don't have time to find out if
their professors are right. A sta
sis of discomfort remains," said
Friedlander.
Inhuman Load
Students are currently over
loaded, Friedlander feels. "Too
much is demanded of them in an
inhuman way that doesn't take

into consideration the vagueries
of human nature and emotion.
The semester plan is a more hu
mane system which allows for
more independence and relaxa
tion. You don't need to pressure
people to assure that they are
students . . . their caliber is high
enough that they don't have to
be watched any more. Students
tend to react to the premises
that underlie a system," he said.
Friedlander pointed out that
grades are not the only pressure
intensified by the quarter sys
tcm. "Students are under pres
sure to understand which is the
hardest of all. They become frus
trated and pesimistic about re
wards other than grades . . .
true joy undoubtedly has to do
with learning, and their poten
tial as scholars is countered by
the structure of the courses."
Christmas Anxiety?
There is a tendency for stu
dents to feel that pass-fail grad
ing would eliminate much of the
academic pressure, Friedlander
continued. Though revising the
current grading pattern would
be advantageous, Friedlander

feels that the real source of pres
sure comes from lack of time.
"Students begin to assume that
learning will always cause ten
sion, and this is simply not the
case." He added that semesters
ending with reading periods
would cause a general decrease
in pressure that would compen
sate for "a little anxiety during
Christmas vacation."
One of Friedlander's main
criticisms of the quarter plan
concerns its effect upon activi
ties outside the classroom. "Stu
dents having work in small bun
dles can't leave room to partici
pate in exciting extracurricular
activities. This results in an im
poverishment of their own and
the University's cultural life."
Friedlander lias made it a prac
tice in his Shakespeare and dra
ma classes to have acting rather
than discussion sections.
He explained that a great, deal
of talent was revealed when stu
dents were encouragd to partici
pate. "The best way to learn is
through doing. This is hard to
ask when students are overbur
dened with work," he concluded.
With the quarter system, pro
fessors are forced to choose be
tween two poor options, accord
ing to Larry Friedlander, assist
ant professor of English.
"The system makes you as
sign too much material to digest.
Teachers must either spend half
the term slowly introducing ma
terial and methodology and then
rush for scope; or limit the fo
cus to certain select works, thus
negating the basic problem in
the humanities — comparing lit
erary work."
Assimilate Methods
Friedlander also stressed that
in all humanities and social sci
ences a student's assimilation of
his instructor's "method of at
tack" is as important as the con
crete information offered. "Stu
dents and their teachers have to
get used to each other," he ex
plained. In a ten to twelve week
quarter, according to Friedland
er, students have little contact
with their professors, and teach
ers have a difficult time evalu
ating a student's work and prog
ress on the basis of a paper and
one or two exams.
"People are forced to teach a
topic rather than a course. Stu
dents taking four or five classes
suffer from the omnipresent

pressure of grades and have no
