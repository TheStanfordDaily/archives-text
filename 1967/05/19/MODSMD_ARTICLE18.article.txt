### BRUCE MERRY 
Friday night's Tresidder Italian film is Two Women. Based on
what is perhaps Alberto Moravia's finest novel, La Ciociura, the
movie depicts the German hold over central Italy in the second
World War. A mother and her daughter flee to the nearby hills
as refugees; Sofia Loren won her Oscar for the brilliant perfor
mance she gives of the older woman in the film. For anyone inter
ested in Italy or movies, this is a must. Tresidder will show it in
three sittings: at 7:30, 8:30 and 9:30. Only run you 40c.

I)r. Strangelove is Tresidder's Saturday offering. This energetic
satire of an American nuclear bomber sent onto an irreparable
course of world destruction by a crazy American general is Peter
Sellers all the way through.
Hobbling about as the macabre Nazi theoretician in the title;
phelgmatic as an English soldier who could stop the ruin of ihe
world if he can find the proper coins for a telephone call, annoyed
as the American President who has to solve the crisis while suffer
ing from a chill in the brain. Another 40c, the same time as Fri
day night's Two Women.

The Pope, America, Acting; everything falls under their scourge.
