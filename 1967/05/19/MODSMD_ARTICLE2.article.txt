# Berry Announces Ballot Discrepancy To LASSU
## 
### CICELY BATES 
Elections Commissioner Bill Berry
announced to the Legislature last
night that in a recount of votes cast
in the ASSU primary election of May
3 and 4 a major discrepancy was
found between the ballots counted
and the names signed in the election
registration book â€” 3853 names are
listed in the registration book, while
only 3650 ballots were cast.
Berry could give no explanation
for the extra 200 names not present
in the first two official counts which
took pkice immediately after the elec
tion. In that count there were approx
imately 70 more names than ballots.
The Legislature could not resolve
whether ballots were misplaced or
names were added, but voted to ac
cept the ballots with the understand
ing that the Judicial Council could
still reject the results. Bill Berry an
nounced his resignation from the
post of Elections Commissioner for
"academic pressures," at that time.
Student Financial Manager Terry
Murphy presented the 1967-68 ASSU
budget for consideration by the Legi
slature. The Legislature approved
certain budget requests with minor
changes, but the major debate lasting
45 minutes centered around the pro

posed appropriation lor the Axe Com
mission.
After rejecting two amendments
to delete the money for all activities
with the exception of Spring Sing,
and another to drop the funding of
cards, cannon, and girl's outfits, they
accepted the appropriation.
In the speakers report, Forstenzer
commented that he felt that students
were feeling a "terror" due to the
"heirarchy of naked power" possessed
by the administration. He felt that
many acts of the Board of Trustees
were repressing and forcing students
"toward a crisis."
Committee of 15
Forstenzer also questioned the use
fulness of the Committee of 15. He
stated that it negotiates and com
promises, but the Board of Trustees
really decided everything. He sug
gested that the Legislature somehow
give the Committee more power to
actually make rules instead of act
ing as a "riot squad" on matters that
no one else will consider.
Nominations for Speaker and Lia
son Officer of LASSU were taken
from the floor. Craig Venator, Steve
McMillan and Mike Weinstein were
nominated for Speaker and Dave
Stepner was nominated for Liaison

Officer. Nominations will also bo
takon at the next LASSU meeting,
when election will take place.
The ASSU Education Commission
will be working with the SES Steer
ing Committee and will be a perma
nent function of the Legislature. For
stenzer announced that only a few
applications for the Commission had
been turned in and recommended that
$5,000 be added to next year's bud
get for the Commission's expenses.
Expulsion Bill
Only one bill came to a vote in last
night's meeting. A measure was de
feated to expel any member who
missed any three LASSU meetings in
one quarter, although he would be
allowed to have any student substi
tute act for him. Presently a mem
b"r is expelled if he misses three con
secutive meetings.
A bill proposing Stanford's with
drawal from the National Student
Association (NSA) was not acted up
on when it was found that it had
never been put in writing.
In debate over the budget, the
Legislature approved appropriations
for the ASSU Executive, the ASSU
office, the Legislature, Art Board, As
sociated Women Students, and finally,
the Axe Commission.
