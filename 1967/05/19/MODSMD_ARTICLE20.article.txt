# DRAMA REVIEW
## ACT Depicts Welsh Charm 
### BRUCE MERRY 
American Conservatory Theat
er's Under Milkwood, currently
showing at the Geary Theater,
San Francisco, is a genial and
charming production.
Dylan Thomas' play was ori
ginally written for the British
Radio and as a drama it tends
to depend heavily on the voice
of the narrator.
ACT'S performance of Under
Milkwood never quite solves
the problem of the narrator. Ac
cording to William Ball's con
ception of the show the one
which Ringland, the present di
rector, is following in this pro
duction the part is split into
two.
ACT's two narrators, Richard
Dysart (who is currently doing
the lead in the company's bril
liant Death Of A Salesman and
Paul Shenar (Brother Julian in
Tiny Alice) fit together badly;
the latter is slick, tugging on

a gray scarf round his should
ers, while Dysart is gentle, iron
ic, distant, in the manner of his
Willy Loman.
The play adopts a myriad of
voices and impressions to sug
gest an average day in an un
distinguished Welsh mining com
munity. ACT uses a east of ten,
doubling and tripling murder
ously, up to the point where
Rene Auberjonois (the peren
nial clown), Barbara Colby and
others skip around with their
clothes pulled up to portray
small children, waiting for the
school bus, playing between les
sons, etc.
In its wisdom and all-describ
ing humor, Under Milkwood
draws on Portrait Of The Artist
As A Young Dog and other
prose writings of Thomas'
youth. It is the type of pastiche
of urban nostalgia which Gold
ing used more recently in Free
Fall.

We see the whole vision of
the scruffy Welsh villagers' day:
the postman detecting adultrv
at breakfast time, women walk
ing at noon; lovers mooting in
the warm grass of the after
noon. At night the men go out
to souse; their wives squabble
in darkening porches; children
cry and get tucked into bed.

As the moon comes out and
the vacuous clergyman (Reno
Auberjonois) trots round detect
ing village sin, the whole drama
of a day fades. As ACT plays it.
1 nder Milkwood has charm and
poetry; but they will never make
it what it is not: a play for the
stage. Certainly not with a cast
of ten.

San Francisco, is a genial and
charming production.
Dylan Thomas' play was ori
ginally written for the British
Radio and as a drama it tends
to depend heavily on the voice
of the narrator.
ACT'S performance of Under
Milkwood never quite solves
the problem of the narrator. Ac
cording to William Ball's con
ception of the show the one
which Ringland, the present di
rector, is following in this pro
duction the part is split into
two.
ACT's two narrators, Richard
Dysart (who is currently doing
the lead in the company's bril
liant Death Of A Salesman and
Paul Shenar (Brother Julian in
Tiny Alice) fit together badly;
the latter is slick, tugging on

a gray scarf round his should
ers, while Dysart is gentle, iron
ic, distant, in the manner of his
Willy Loman.
The play adopts a myriad of
voices and impressions to sug
gest an average day in an un
distinguished Welsh mining com
munity. ACT uses a east of ten,
doubling and tripling murder
ously, up to the point where
Rene Auberjonois (the peren
nial clown), Barbara Colby and
others skip around with their
clothes pulled up to portray
small children, waiting for the
school bus, playing between les
sons, etc.
In its wisdom and all-describ
ing humor, Under Milkwood
draws on Portrait Of The Artist
As A Young Dog and other
prose writings of Thomas'
youth. It is the type of pastiche
of urban nostalgia which Gold
ing used more recently in Free
Fall.

We see the whole vision of
the scruffy Welsh villagers' day:
the postman detecting adultrv
at breakfast time, women walk
ing at noon; lovers mooting in
the warm grass of the after
noon. At night the men go out
to souse; their wives squabble
in darkening porches; children
cry and get tucked into bed.

As the moon comes out and
the vacuous clergyman (Reno
Auberjonois) trots round detect
ing village sin, the whole drama
of a day fades. As ACT plays it.
1 nder Milkwood has charm and
poetry; but they will never make
it what it is not: a play for the
stage. Certainly not with a cast
of ten.
