# 400 See Magnuson Foil Impeachment
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
More than 400 people saw
Roger Magnuson escape im
peachment as Donner House so
cial chairman Wednesday night.
The event, billed by Magnuson
as "the social event of the sea
son," was held at Stern Hall,
in Donner Lounge.
Thirty Donner residents had
submitted a petition at the reg
ular house meeting Monday
night demanding Magnuson's
ouster. The impeachment trial
was set for Wednesday night
and was supposed to be a quiet,
orderly affair.
But Magnuson didn't see it
that way.
He ordered nearly 50 gallons
of beer and 30 large pizzas for
the house meeting, then ran an
advertisement in The Daily. The

advertisement invited the en
tire campus to the affair and
offered "free beer, free pizza,
and professional entertainment."
Magnuson also rented the ser
vices of an accordian player
and an 800 million candlepower
searchlight.
Members of the group favor
ing impeachment were outraged
by Magnuson's ambivalent atti
tude about his own impeach
ment trial. But Magnuson non
chalantly told them, "I don't
see why 400 people would dis
turb a house meeting."
Those favoring the impeach
ment made several attempts to
ruin the party. "We called up
the pizza parlors and told them

that Dormer House's credit was
not good," Mike Wolff said.
Magnuson finally straighten
ed out the pizza problems, but
when they were delivered at
about 10:30, several students
broke into the pizza truck and
ran off with approximately ten
pizzas. A Stern Flail resident as
sistant, and former track star,
chased the vandals and forced
them to drop the pizzas.
Although a two-thirds major
ity was necessary to impeach
Magnuson, only 29 votes were
cast for impeachment, while 36
voted to retain Magnuson.
Speaking in his own defense,
Magnuson claimed he had
promised a different social pro
gram and had provided exactly
that.
The parties sponsored by Mag
nuson included the Mystery
Movies at which "The Habits
and Characteristics of the Nor
way Rat" and "Dance, Little
Children" were shown. The sec
ond movie is a description of
an outbreak of venereal disease
in a Kansas Community.
Magnuson had also promised
to have "a very ugly party." Ac
cordingly, he hired a topless
dancer to entertain at a battle
of the bands. "The curtains
were pulled down, three gallons
of water were spilled on the
dance floor, and there were sev
eral shoving fights," he said. "It
was a very, very, ugly party."
Magnuson could see no rea
son why he should be impeach
ed. "Those parties were the best
entertainment since the Hoover
Tower suicides," he said.
Among the charges brought
against Magnuson was that he
had refused to attend house
meetings, he had practiced "will
ful deception" against the mem
bers of the house, and he had
made wasteful expenditures.
After the final vote was taken,
Stern Hall Director William L.
Leland told Magnuson to re
quest everyone to leave. "An all
campus party could be a fine
idea, but this one was irrespon
sibly planned and organized,"
Leland said later. "I felt it was
a potentially dangerous situa
tion, but I regret having to take
that action."


Donner House president, John Keller, presided over Wednesday
night's impeachment triail held in the Donner Lounge. Roger
Magnuson, Conner's social chairman, has been accused of vio
lating the responsibilities of his office, but escaped impeachment.
