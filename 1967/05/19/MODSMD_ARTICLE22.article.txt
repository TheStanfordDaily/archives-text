# Cards Can Cop Crown Today
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
The Stanford baseball team
gets a chance today to clinch
the AAWU pennant and take
its first big step towards the
NCAA championship.
The Cards will take on Cal
at 3:00 this afternoon at the
"Sunken Diamond, and then

travel across the bay to Berke
ley for a rematch tomorrow. A
victory in either game will wrap
up the AAWU title.
The Tribe currently sports a
conference record of 8-1, with
the two Cal games remaining.
Second place Oregon, after drop
ping a double-header to UCLA,

is now 7-3, also with two games
left.
Unfortunately for Cal, Coach
Dutch Fehring is going to throw
everything he has at them.
Starting pitchers for Stanford
will be Sandy Vance (9-0, 1.11
ERA) and Rod Poteete (2-0, 0.83
ERA), the same duo that stifled

Washington on one run in two
games last weekend. Poteete has
been especially impressive of
late.
Leading the offense will be
Mike Schornaker and Jeff Rohl
fing, both of whom are among
the top half dozen hitters in the
conference with identical aver
ages of .389.
Mark Marquess, who drives
official scorers crazy by con
tinually slamming vicious balls
directly at fielders, has also
been getting in some good licks.
The infield of Bob Boone,
Frank Duffy, Dick Swan, and
Marquess continues to display
its vacuum cleaner effciency.

On paper, Cal would seem to
have very little chance of stall
ing the Tribe's pennant drive.
Their conference record is only
3-11, and they were soundly
tromped by Stanford a couple
of weeks ago.
But, as several people have
perceptively observed, baseball
is a funny game. The Bears
have had just two losing sea
sons in the past fifty years, and
they will be even more "up"
than usual.
Nothing would give Cal great
er pleasure than to knock Stan
ford out of the NCAA cham
pionships. It's up to the In
dians to see that they don't.
