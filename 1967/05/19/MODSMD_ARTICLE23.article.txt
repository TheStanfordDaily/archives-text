# Pac-8 Records To Topple; Cards In Conference Meet
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
Over half of the Pae 8 track
records are expected to fall this
weekend as the conference
'gathers for its grand finale, the
1967 AAWU Track and Field
Championships at the Univer
sity of Oregon in Eugene.
By the end of the dual meet
competition two weeks ago, 10 of
the 18 conference meet records
had been bettered and two oth
ers nearly matched. If the
weather is favorable, even more
records may fall.
UCLA Favored
Defending champion UCLA is
again favored to win the crown.
USC is given the edge by some
strength of individuals such as
Lennox Miller, Earl McCullouch,
nox Miller, Earl McCullouch,
and Bob Seagren, who are ex
pected to gather several first

places for the Trojans. Some
Bruins superior depth.
Oregon State may muster
enough strength to challenge
the two Los Angeles powers,
but the other five universities,
Stanford, Oregon, Washington,
Washington State, and Cal are
well out of the running.
Iron Man Leads Tribe
Bud Walsh leads the Stanford
contingent, entering possibly
five events. He presently is
ranked first in the conference
in the long jump and third in
the 120 high hurdles. In addi
tion, he will enter the 440 inter
mediate hurdles, the 440 relay,
and perhaps the mile relay.
Peter Boyce goes into the
meet with the best height in
the conference, 7' 0". He will
be challenged by Steve Kelley
feel this will overcome the
and Dick Fosbury of OSU and

Rick Sloan of UCLA, aIJ of
whom have done 6' 10".
Ward and Vaughan also Ranked
Jim Ward and Craig Vaughan
both are ranked third in the
conference. Ward's time of 47.4
for the 440 is still .4 seconds ofl
his lifetime best, and as he is
recovered from the injury that
hampered him during the early
season, he should improve on
that time.
Vaughan, too, has been slow
ed by injury, but should be
ready to break his personal best
of 24' 11V 2 ".
