# Construction Booms Adjacent To Quad; First Phase Of New Mall Gets Underway
## 
### BEVERLY CORY 
What is hidden behind the white
construction fence along Lomita
Drive? Right now, a lot of big yel
low bulldozers rearranging dirt.
But Contractors Engstrum and
Nourse left windows for sidewalk
superintendents interested in prog

gress on what is to be the Space En
gineering building.
Excavation, which has just begun,
marks the first step in the construc
tion of the new Lomita Mall. The sec
ond step will be the closing of Lomita
Drive for its transition to a pede
strian walkway similar to the area
east of Quad.
Road Closed
The Planning Office does not expect
the road to be closed to traffic until
after the end of spring quarter, but
definite plans for the construction
of the mall are currently under re
view with landscape architect Dan
Rolfs, and will not be known until
next week.
The Space Engineering building,
located next to the McCullough build
ing, is scheduled for completion in
December 1968. Being built at a cost
of $3,676,777, it is in part financed by
a grant from the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration.
Fall quarter, construction will be
gin nearby on the Earth Sciences
building, which is to extend across
Lomita at the south end of the pro
posed mall.
Athletic Pavilion
On the other side of campus,
ground breaking ceremonies on May
9 initiated construction of the Ros
coe Maples Athletic Pavilion. What
is now only mountains of earth and
carefully laid-out stakes will be an
8000 seat basketball stadium by Oct
ober 28, 1968.
Located on Campus Drive near the
soccer field, the pavilion is being
built by Wheatly-Jacobsen, Inc. for
$2,677,000. Gifts finance the entire
project. Dedication is set for Novem
ber 30, 1968, at a Stanford vs. North
western game.
While workmen are just beginning
those projects, work elsewhere on
campus nears completion. Farthest
along is the Herrin Biological Science
Building, on Serra at the end of Lo

mita, across from Math Corner. The
biology department reports its new
quarters are virtually complete. They
plan to vacate their rooms on Quad
to move into the new building during
July.
White Plaza
Students will find a change on
White Plaza when they return
autumn quarter, as boards will have
come down to reveal a remodeled Old
Union. Work began last spring on
the structure, which will be ready for
occupancy in July.
The rennovated office building will
be a sort of Inner Quad and Encina
rolled into one. It will house the Dean
and Associate Dean of Students, the
Registrar, the National Service Of
fice, and the Admissions and Finan
cial Aids departments.
Students in need of the Counseling
and Testing Center will find it there,
as well as the office which maintains
a list of available off-campus housing,

and the Committee on Public Exer
cises.
Cashiers Oflier
There will also be two tellers win
dows where students may pay fees.
It will be only a branch of the main
Cashiers Office which will remain in
Encina, according to Dan Swagert
of the Planning Office who handled
the remodeling project in its early
stages.
The Lou Henry Hoover Building,
erected adjacent to Hoover Tower, is
now more than 75 percent done, re
ports the Construction Office. When
completed it will hold the East Asian
collections, and a large part of the
newspaper collections of the Hoover
Institute.
The building will also provide office
space for both visiting and resident
staff researchers. It is expected to be
ready by the beginning of autumn
quarter, and will be dedicated within
a month of its opening.

those projects, work elsewhere on
campus nears completion. Farthest
along is the Herrin Biological Science
Building, on Serra at the end of Lo

mita, across from Math Corner. The
biology department reports its new
quarters are virtually complete. They
plan to vacate their rooms on Quad
to move into the new building during
July.
White Plaza
Students will find a change on
White Plaza when they return
autumn quarter, as boards will have
come down to reveal a remodeled Old
Union. Work began last spring on
the structure, which will be ready for
occupancy in July.
The rennovated office building will
be a sort of Inner Quad and Encina
rolled into one. It will house the Dean
and Associate Dean of Students, the
Registrar, the National Service Of
fice, and the Admissions and Finan
cial Aids departments.
Students in need of the Counseling
and Testing Center will find it there,
as well as the office which maintains
a list of available off-campus housing,

and the Committee on Public Exer
cises.
Cashiers Oflier
There will also be two tellers win
dows where students may pay fees.
It will be only a branch of the main
Cashiers Office which will remain in
Encina, according to Dan Swagert
of the Planning Office who handled
the remodeling project in its early
stages.
The Lou Henry Hoover Building,
erected adjacent to Hoover Tower, is
now more than 75 percent done, re
ports the Construction Office. When
completed it will hold the East Asian
collections, and a large part of the
newspaper collections of the Hoover
Institute.
The building will also provide office
space for both visiting and resident
staff researchers. It is expected to be
ready by the beginning of autumn
quarter, and will be dedicated within
a month of its opening.
What is hidden behind the white
construction fence along Lomita
Drive? Right now, a lot of big yel
low bulldozers rearranging dirt.
But Contractors Engstrum and
Nourse left windows for sidewalk
superintendents interested in prog

gress on what is to be the Space En
gineering building.
Excavation, which has just begun,
marks the first step in the construc
tion of the new Lomita Mall. The sec
ond step will be the closing of Lomita
Drive for its transition to a pede
strian walkway similar to the area
east of Quad.
Road Closed
The Planning Office does not expect
the road to be closed to traffic until
after the end of spring quarter, but
definite plans for the construction
of the mall are currently under re
view with landscape architect Dan
Rolfs, and will not be known until
next week.
The Space Engineering building,
located next to the McCullough build
ing, is scheduled for completion in
December 1968. Being built at a cost
of $3,676,777, it is in part financed by
a grant from the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration.
Fall quarter, construction will be
gin nearby on the Earth Sciences
building, which is to extend across
Lomita at the south end of the pro
posed mall.
Athletic Pavilion
On the other side of campus,
ground breaking ceremonies on May
9 initiated construction of the Ros
coe Maples Athletic Pavilion. What
is now only mountains of earth and
carefully laid-out stakes will be an
8000 seat basketball stadium by Oct
ober 28, 1968.
Located on Campus Drive near the
soccer field, the pavilion is being
built by Wheatly-Jacobsen, Inc. for
$2,677,000. Gifts finance the entire
project. Dedication is set for Novem
ber 30, 1968, at a Stanford vs. North
western game.
