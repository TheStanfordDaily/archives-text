# Admission Report
## 
### 
The report on admission presented to the
Humanities and Sciences faculty is a long
overdue expose of the outdated, confidential
practices of the admission office. It makes pub
lic for the first time facts which demonstrate
that current policies all but guarantee that
Stanford will never become a dynamic and
diversified community.
Though the admission staff has taken a token
step by altruistically yielding to pressures to
admit students from disadvantaged minority
groups, it still has failed to perceive the
changes that have occurred in the last 25 years.
Application processing, recruiting, and legacy
staff preferences, for instance, continue to re
flect intransigent short-sightedness.
The academic ability of prospective students,
which supposedly accounts for 70 per cent of
the admission decision, is now determined by
a freshman grade prediction based almost en
tirely on high school grades. If this practice
is used to insure that freshmen will survive
their first year at Stanford, then one must ask
if this is not a moot point. The median high
school grade average for the latest entering
class was over 3.87. This should be sufficient
proof that the majority of the class was ade
quately endowed to survive the rigors of uni
versity academics. More important still is the
advent of deferred or pass-fail grading for
freshmen. This fact alone renders grade pre
diction a useless exercise.
As the scholastic ability of students in
creases, personal factors become the dominant
determinants for admission. Personal ratings
are entirely subjective judgments made on the
basis of character recommendations, extra-cur
ricular activities, "leadership potential," and —
for more than half the applicants — personal
interviews. Until recently the faculty has re
mained painfully silent, failing to provide the
admission staff with more objective guidelines
for evaluating a candidate's non-academic qual
ifications. This has meant only selection of the
best-rounded applicants, thus perpetuating a
homogenous student body of high school super
men.
The admission staff should make allowances
for students with more specialized talents and
interests. A student who excells in creative
writing should not be placed in the general
pool of applicants only to be rejected because

his math and science grades have lowered his
average. Perhaps special classifications should
be established so that exceptional students
would compete for admission only with stu
dents of comparable talent.
No effort has been made to insure geographic
distribution in the student body. This is an un
subtle form of discrimination resulting in a
conspicuous absence of cultural minority
groups, as shown by the Black Report on Stan
ford freshmen. Admission personnel will main
tain that they receive few applications from
certain areas and Stanford is less known in the
eastern states. However, since the recruiting
tour includes no New York City high schools,
it appears that the admission staff does not
want to correct the situation. Surely the Uni
versity could defray the additional expense
of having a representative stop in New York
on the way back from his visit to 34 New En
gland prep schools.
Granted, financial matters are an important
consideration in Stanford admissions. Scholar
ship money, for instance, would have to be
trebled to admit the students who qualify for
admissions in all categories. But it is neverthe
less deplorable that financial need should re
sult in the rejection of desirable students. The
admission office is forced to continue favoring
legacies to insure continual monetary support,
thereby further promoting geographic imbal
ance. Finding a workable solution to this para
dox should be enough incentive for a care
ful examination of admission and financial aid
policies.
The average Stanford student is saran-wrap
ped, suffering from a pitiful lack of exposure
to backgrounds different from his own. The ad
mission staff has at its fingertips a plethora of
rationalizations to justify the status quo. But
the fact that fewer than ten of the hundred
men accepted to both Stanford and Harvard
last year chose Stanford demonstrates the im
mediacy of the problem. A member of the ad
mission staff explained emotionally that this
preference for Harvard resulted from the elec
tion of David Harris.
This assertion is just one more example of
the deeply-engrained provincialism existing in
the admission office. No amount of internal re
form will improve Stanford unless current poli
cies and procedures are drastically reformed.

the admission office. No amount of internal re

The report on admission presented to the
Humanities and Sciences faculty is a long
overdue expose of the outdated, confidential
practices of the admission office. It makes pub
lic for the first time facts which demonstrate
that current policies all but guarantee that
Stanford will never become a dynamic and
diversified community.
Though the admission staff has taken a token
step by altruistically yielding to pressures to
admit students from disadvantaged minority
groups, it still has failed to perceive the
changes that have occurred in the last 25 years.
Application processing, recruiting, and legacy
staff preferences, for instance, continue to re
flect intransigent short-sightedness.
The academic ability of prospective students,
which supposedly accounts for 70 per cent of
the admission decision, is now determined by
a freshman grade prediction based almost en
tirely on high school grades. If this practice
is used to insure that freshmen will survive
their first year at Stanford, then one must ask
if this is not a moot point. The median high
school grade average for the latest entering
class was over 3.87. This should be sufficient
proof that the majority of the class was ade
quately endowed to survive the rigors of uni
versity academics. More important still is the
advent of deferred or pass-fail grading for
freshmen. This fact alone renders grade pre
diction a useless exercise.
As the scholastic ability of students in
creases, personal factors become the dominant
determinants for admission. Personal ratings
are entirely subjective judgments made on the
basis of character recommendations, extra-cur
ricular activities, "leadership potential," and —
for more than half the applicants — personal
interviews. Until recently the faculty has re
mained painfully silent, failing to provide the
admission staff with more objective guidelines
for evaluating a candidate's non-academic qual
ifications. This has meant only selection of the
best-rounded applicants, thus perpetuating a
homogenous student body of high school super
men.
The admission staff should make allowances
for students with more specialized talents and
interests. A student who excells in creative
writing should not be placed in the general
pool of applicants only to be rejected because

his math and science grades have lowered his
average. Perhaps special classifications should
be established so that exceptional students
would compete for admission only with stu
dents of comparable talent.
No effort has been made to insure geographic
distribution in the student body. This is an un
subtle form of discrimination resulting in a
conspicuous absence of cultural minority
groups, as shown by the Black Report on Stan
ford freshmen. Admission personnel will main
tain that they receive few applications from
certain areas and Stanford is less known in the
eastern states. However, since the recruiting
tour includes no New York City high schools,
it appears that the admission staff does not
want to correct the situation. Surely the Uni
versity could defray the additional expense
of having a representative stop in New York
on the way back from his visit to 34 New En
gland prep schools.
Granted, financial matters are an important
consideration in Stanford admissions. Scholar
ship money, for instance, would have to be
trebled to admit the students who qualify for
admissions in all categories. But it is neverthe
less deplorable that financial need should re
sult in the rejection of desirable students. The
admission office is forced to continue favoring
legacies to insure continual monetary support,
thereby further promoting geographic imbal
ance. Finding a workable solution to this para
dox should be enough incentive for a care
ful examination of admission and financial aid
policies.
The average Stanford student is saran-wrap
ped, suffering from a pitiful lack of exposure
to backgrounds different from his own. The ad
mission staff has at its fingertips a plethora of
rationalizations to justify the status quo. But
the fact that fewer than ten of the hundred
men accepted to both Stanford and Harvard
last year chose Stanford demonstrates the im
mediacy of the problem. A member of the ad
mission staff explained emotionally that this
preference for Harvard resulted from the elec
tion of David Harris.
