## For The Defense: Irrational Behavior 
### Maggie McComas 
A witness in a recent judicial
case involving election disputes
questioned the validity of any
judgment of his actions, claim
ing he behaved irrationally at
the time of his alleged violation.
Oddly enough, that irrational
behavior was presented in a very
rational form, namely a docu
ment signed and presented to
The Daily. The statement indi
cated that the person was at that
time interested in clarifying for
the record his involvement in
somewhat disreputable events.
A few days later, another
signed statement was given for
publication in The Daily, again
for the purpose of explaining
actions which otherwise might
have been misinterpreted. A
short time later, those concerned
wished to withdraw the state
ment, ihe irrationality in this
case being less apparent than
real.
Paradoxical Compulsion
This compulsion to document
events and intentions is para
doxical in that those who at first
seem compelled to use this meth
od to immortalize themselves in
the annals of history (though on
an admittedly trivial level) are
the first to provide their own re
interpretation of events, doing so
under the guise of the oft
wronged excuse of "biased" re
porting.
Gathering and writing news
goes beyond a mere recollection
of events and documentation of
quotations and facts. In order
for an event to be justified as
news is must be evaluated, often
on a very subtle level. There is
no such animal as a purely "ob
jective" account of an event,
just as it is not possible for any
person to observe an event ob
jectively, be it a baseball game
or an assassination.
The greatest aid toward the
desired level of objectivity is, of
course, documentation and veri
fication of facts, as well as an
adequate explaination of events
on the ground level from those
with first-hand knowledge.

Unfortunately, the process of
verifying facts for the record
eventually rests on a human
factor, and that factor, in light
of recent events, is too often
colored not so much by the re
porter's falibility as by the less
justifiable influence of irrespon
sibility and irrationality.
For a writer, it is more than
frustrating to be compelled to
search for objectivity simply by
balancing assertions and contra
dictions, especially when those
making such assertions later
wish to be excused on the basis
of irrationality.
One participant in other judic
ial actions even went so far as
to suggest that The Daily,
through "objective" reporting,
vindicated actions which had not
even been considered by Judicial
Council.
Sit In Judgment
The Daily is not a judicial
body and does not seek to sit in
judgment. The purpose of a
news page is not to usurp the
functions of any decision-mak
ing body, but to report news, as
best presented by original
sources. Unfortunately, present
conditions in this community
make such sources a shaky foun
dation for the type of objectiv
ity so badly needed.
The Daily does wish to give
a chance for both sides to be
heard. But a reporter must ex
pect that those presenting their
cases assume the responsibility
for their presentations and back
them with supportable evidence.
This cybernetic-loup - anxiety
tioned in a news story is, ad
mittedly, in part a reflection up
on the competence and under
standing of the writer immedi
ately responsible. But a lack of
credibility may lie as well with
original sources. Irrationality
may be the ideal excuse for tem
porary alleviation of the re
sponsibility for past actions and
present consequences, but it is
hardly a suitable foundation for
the type of constructive ex
changes which we seek within
the University community.

Council.
Sit In Judgment
The Daily is not a judicial
body and does not seek to sit in
judgment. The purpose of a
news page is not to usurp the
functions of any decision-mak
ing body, but to report news, as
best presented by original
sources. Unfortunately, present
conditions in this community
make such sources a shaky foun
dation for the type of objectiv
ity so badly needed.
The Daily does wish to give
a chance for both sides to be
heard. But a reporter must ex
pect that those presenting their
cases assume the responsibility
for their presentations and back
them with supportable evidence.
This cybernetic-loup - anxiety
tioned in a news story is, ad
mittedly, in part a reflection up
on the competence and under
standing of the writer immedi
ately responsible. But a lack of
credibility may lie as well with
original sources. Irrationality
may be the ideal excuse for tem
porary alleviation of the re
sponsibility for past actions and
present consequences, but it is
hardly a suitable foundation for
the type of constructive ex
changes which we seek within
the University community.
A witness in a recent judicial
case involving election disputes
questioned the validity of any
judgment of his actions, claim
ing he behaved irrationally at
the time of his alleged violation.
Oddly enough, that irrational
behavior was presented in a very
rational form, namely a docu
ment signed and presented to
The Daily. The statement indi
cated that the person was at that
time interested in clarifying for
the record his involvement in
somewhat disreputable events.
A few days later, another
signed statement was given for
publication in The Daily, again
for the purpose of explaining
actions which otherwise might
have been misinterpreted. A
short time later, those concerned
wished to withdraw the state
ment, ihe irrationality in this
case being less apparent than
real.
Paradoxical Compulsion
This compulsion to document
events and intentions is para
doxical in that those who at first
seem compelled to use this meth
od to immortalize themselves in
the annals of history (though on
an admittedly trivial level) are
the first to provide their own re
interpretation of events, doing so
under the guise of the oft
wronged excuse of "biased" re
porting.
Gathering and writing news
goes beyond a mere recollection
of events and documentation of
quotations and facts. In order
for an event to be justified as
news is must be evaluated, often
on a very subtle level. There is
no such animal as a purely "ob
jective" account of an event,
just as it is not possible for any
person to observe an event ob
jectively, be it a baseball game
or an assassination.
The greatest aid toward the
desired level of objectivity is, of
course, documentation and veri
fication of facts, as well as an
adequate explaination of events
on the ground level from those
with first-hand knowledge.

Unfortunately, the process of
verifying facts for the record
eventually rests on a human
factor, and that factor, in light
of recent events, is too often
colored not so much by the re
porter's falibility as by the less
justifiable influence of irrespon
sibility and irrationality.
For a writer, it is more than
frustrating to be compelled to
search for objectivity simply by
balancing assertions and contra
dictions, especially when those
making such assertions later
wish to be excused on the basis
of irrationality.
One participant in other judic
ial actions even went so far as
to suggest that The Daily,
through "objective" reporting,
vindicated actions which had not
even been considered by Judicial
Council.
