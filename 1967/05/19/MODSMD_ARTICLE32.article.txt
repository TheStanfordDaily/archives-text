# Two Minutes of Haight
## Kick The Machine; Escape The Cycle! 
### Tim Haight 
In the last few years, man has
learned much about himself by
studying his cybernetic ma
chines. One of the most interest
ing phenomena he has observed
is the circular process into which
a computer, or a man, may slip
if something goes wrong.
With the machine, some part
might misfunction or the pro
gram might be wrong. The ma
chine can go into an infinite cy
cle of computation, until cleared.
With man, a worry might devel
op into an "anxiety neurosis"
which consumes more and more
of his neurones and his thoughts,
leaving him with too little unoc
cupied mental capacity to effect
ively cope with his environment.
With the machine, we shake it
to get the gears back in place or
turn the power on and off to jolt
it. We may even kick it. With
man, sleep may solve a problem
or a mild worry, while more ex
treme cases can demand electro
shock treatment or drugs or sur
gery.
Taking this a step further, in
the spirit of Freud's analogies

about the mental states of men
and societies, we might diagnose
some of America's present di
lemmas as neurotic circular
processes. One instance comes
immediately to mind: the cycle
of our meet-force-with-force for
eign policy.
Cat And Mouse Game
The other day an administra
tor (of all people!) put the situ
ation very aptly. He said that
the mouse of Communism had
the powerful American cat (pa
per tiger?) playing its games.
He thought that the U.S. could
rise above the knee-jerk re
sponse to "aggression" and
plunge its resources into a plan
of world development that would
so attract our wavering allies
and the third world that our
"adversaries" would have to fol
low our lead.
But we're not doing it. One
reason why might be that we are
caught in this neurotic loop: We
preserve our security with a
"world policeman" military and
economic policy that causes such
unfortunate reactions that the

policy must be increased to meet
new reactions. The increase, in
turn, creates more problems.
Vietnam is an obvious exam
ple. Everything we've tried has
only caused more death and got
ten us in deeper. What would
have happened if Ho Chi Minh
had won an election in 1956 and
had then been the recipient of a
massive American aid program
to develop the country, get it
through its "take-off" period,
and bring it to the point that
some of the European Commu
nist states are at now?
One might say that we tried
that with Ngo Dinh Diem. But
there our search for a "non-
Communist alternative" had us
put in command a man with au
thoritarian tendencies who was
completely out of touch with thp
political and economic wants of
his people. Because, further, of
our anti - Communism, our need
for him to remain stable and
"look good" to the world led us
to tolerate gross abuses of our
aid. When we realized that it
would be difficult to help the

peasant under his reign, we set
tled for arming the police.
Aid Might End War
Our preoccupation for main
taining a militarily strong anti-
Communist government allowed
us to ignore the course that
might have stopped the war—a
massive campaign of aid to Viet
nam North and South, Commu
nist or not. But we thought we
could get along with guns. We
thought they were cheaper and
safer.
That image of the Second
World War, when the bombs that
fell on Pearl Harbor were made
with our surplus iron, haunts
us and makes us distrust aid to
"enemies". The spectre of our
inept, Comfriunist-exploited aid
projects of the fifties described
in The Ugly American causes us
to give up hope.
But if we could get out of this
neurotic worry and see around
us, we would perceive a world of
new weapons and tele-communi
cations that would see and deter
a Japanese-type aggression in
the making. And our aid in the
fifties failed because we under
estimated the nationalistic, po
litical, and cultural feelings of
the people in our effort to be
anti-Communist above all.
We put too much faith in the
idea that money could make
even dictators like Batista, Tru
iillo, and Diem smell good in a
few years. Our neurotic anxiety
drew us to those symbols of
military strength — to our great
loss. The people saw from where
the money went (or at least
where it didn't go) that we wore
interested in them only to the

extent that we gained the alle
giance of their bosses.
Give Recognition
So the people rebelled, aided
and egged on by their Commu
nist neighbors. After all, what
have we ever done to make
North Vietnam or Communist
China think we were anything
but selfish, rich, imperialistic
militarists? We kept the Com
munists from even seeing what
an American looked like by non
recognition, let alone helping
them fight the gnawing poverty,
ignorance, and disease in their
countries. We surrounded them
with our troops.
And it goes on and on, around
and around. We see "aggres
sion" — a lot of poor peasants
whom we have given nothing re
sorting to force to change their
lot — and we kill them and act
surprised when they call us
names.
It's time to kick the machine.
This cycle leads only to endless
bloodshed. We must show people
that we have something to offer
for friendship, rather than only
punishment for non-compliance.
Our present circular process is
confirming Communist stereo
types of us instead of confound
ing them.
This cypernotic-loup - anxiety
neurosis is not only self-defeat
ing. It is also taking up too
much of our resources. It is leav
ing the world in nerd, the Negro
mistreated at home, and the
great hopes of peaceful coexist
ence in limbo. It is allowing our
country to mumble about Viet
nam, while we move toward nu
clear war.

processes. One instance comes
immediately to mind: the cycle
of our meet-force-with-force for
eign policy.
Cat And Mouse Game
The other day an administra
tor (of all people!) put the situ
ation very aptly. He said that
the mouse of Communism had
the powerful American cat (pa
per tiger?) playing its games.
He thought that the U.S. could
rise above the knee-jerk re
sponse to "aggression" and
plunge its resources into a plan
of world development that would
so attract our wavering allies
and the third world that our
"adversaries" would have to fol
low our lead.
But we're not doing it. One
reason why might be that we are
caught in this neurotic loop: We
preserve our security with a
"world policeman" military and
economic policy that causes such
unfortunate reactions that the

policy must be increased to meet
new reactions. The increase, in
turn, creates more problems.
Vietnam is an obvious exam
ple. Everything we've tried has
only caused more death and got
ten us in deeper. What would
have happened if Ho Chi Minh
had won an election in 1956 and
had then been the recipient of a
massive American aid program
to develop the country, get it
through its "take-off" period,
and bring it to the point that
some of the European Commu
nist states are at now?
One might say that we tried
that with Ngo Dinh Diem. But
there our search for a "non-
Communist alternative" had us
put in command a man with au
thoritarian tendencies who was
completely out of touch with thp
political and economic wants of
his people. Because, further, of
our anti - Communism, our need
for him to remain stable and
"look good" to the world led us
to tolerate gross abuses of our
aid. When we realized that it
would be difficult to help the

peasant under his reign, we set
tled for arming the police.
Aid Might End War
Our preoccupation for main
taining a militarily strong anti-
Communist government allowed
us to ignore the course that
might have stopped the war—a
massive campaign of aid to Viet
nam North and South, Commu
nist or not. But we thought we
could get along with guns. We
thought they were cheaper and
safer.
That image of the Second
World War, when the bombs that
fell on Pearl Harbor were made
with our surplus iron, haunts
us and makes us distrust aid to
"enemies". The spectre of our
inept, Comfriunist-exploited aid
projects of the fifties described
in The Ugly American causes us
to give up hope.
But if we could get out of this
neurotic worry and see around
us, we would perceive a world of
new weapons and tele-communi
cations that would see and deter
a Japanese-type aggression in
the making. And our aid in the
fifties failed because we under
estimated the nationalistic, po
litical, and cultural feelings of
the people in our effort to be
anti-Communist above all.
We put too much faith in the
idea that money could make
even dictators like Batista, Tru
iillo, and Diem smell good in a
few years. Our neurotic anxiety
drew us to those symbols of
military strength — to our great
loss. The people saw from where
the money went (or at least
where it didn't go) that we wore
interested in them only to the

extent that we gained the alle
giance of their bosses.
Give Recognition
So the people rebelled, aided
and egged on by their Commu
nist neighbors. After all, what
have we ever done to make
North Vietnam or Communist
China think we were anything
but selfish, rich, imperialistic
militarists? We kept the Com
munists from even seeing what
an American looked like by non
recognition, let alone helping
them fight the gnawing poverty,
ignorance, and disease in their
countries. We surrounded them
with our troops.
And it goes on and on, around
and around. We see "aggres
sion" — a lot of poor peasants
whom we have given nothing re
sorting to force to change their
lot — and we kill them and act
surprised when they call us
names.
It's time to kick the machine.
This cycle leads only to endless
bloodshed. We must show people
that we have something to offer
for friendship, rather than only
punishment for non-compliance.
Our present circular process is
confirming Communist stereo
types of us instead of confound
ing them.
This cypernotic-loup - anxiety
neurosis is not only self-defeat
ing. It is also taking up too
much of our resources. It is leav
ing the world in nerd, the Negro
mistreated at home, and the
great hopes of peaceful coexist
ence in limbo. It is allowing our
country to mumble about Viet
nam, while we move toward nu
clear war.
In the last few years, man has
learned much about himself by
studying his cybernetic ma
chines. One of the most interest
ing phenomena he has observed
is the circular process into which
a computer, or a man, may slip
if something goes wrong.
With the machine, some part
might misfunction or the pro
gram might be wrong. The ma
chine can go into an infinite cy
cle of computation, until cleared.
With man, a worry might devel
op into an "anxiety neurosis"
which consumes more and more
of his neurones and his thoughts,
leaving him with too little unoc
cupied mental capacity to effect
ively cope with his environment.
With the machine, we shake it
to get the gears back in place or
turn the power on and off to jolt
it. We may even kick it. With
man, sleep may solve a problem
or a mild worry, while more ex
treme cases can demand electro
shock treatment or drugs or sur
gery.
Taking this a step further, in
the spirit of Freud's analogies

had won an election in 1956 and
had then been the recipient of a
massive American aid program
to develop the country, get it
through its "take-off" period,
and bring it to the point that
some of the European Commu
nist states are at now?
One might say that we tried
that with Ngo Dinh Diem. But
there our search for a "non-
Communist alternative" had us
put in command a man with au
thoritarian tendencies who was
completely out of touch with thp
political and economic wants of
his people. Because, further, of
our anti - Communism, our need
for him to remain stable and
"look good" to the world led us
to tolerate gross abuses of our
aid. When we realized that it
would be difficult to help the

peasant under his reign, we set
tled for arming the police.
Aid Might End War
Our preoccupation for main
taining a militarily strong anti-
Communist government allowed
us to ignore the course that
might have stopped the war—a
massive campaign of aid to Viet
nam North and South, Commu
nist or not. But we thought we
could get along with guns. We
thought they were cheaper and
safer.
That image of the Second
World War, when the bombs that
fell on Pearl Harbor were made
with our surplus iron, haunts
us and makes us distrust aid to
"enemies". The spectre of our
inept, Comfriunist-exploited aid
projects of the fifties described
in The Ugly American causes us
to give up hope.
But if we could get out of this
neurotic worry and see around
us, we would perceive a world of
new weapons and tele-communi
cations that would see and deter
a Japanese-type aggression in
the making. And our aid in the
fifties failed because we under
estimated the nationalistic, po
litical, and cultural feelings of
the people in our effort to be
anti-Communist above all.
We put too much faith in the
idea that money could make
even dictators like Batista, Tru
iillo, and Diem smell good in a
few years. Our neurotic anxiety
drew us to those symbols of
military strength — to our great
loss. The people saw from where
the money went (or at least
where it didn't go) that we wore
interested in them only to the

extent that we gained the alle
giance of their bosses.
Give Recognition
So the people rebelled, aided
and egged on by their Commu
nist neighbors. After all, what
have we ever done to make
North Vietnam or Communist
China think we were anything
but selfish, rich, imperialistic
militarists? We kept the Com
munists from even seeing what
an American looked like by non
recognition, let alone helping
them fight the gnawing poverty,
ignorance, and disease in their
countries. We surrounded them
with our troops.
And it goes on and on, around
and around. We see "aggres
sion" — a lot of poor peasants
whom we have given nothing re
sorting to force to change their
lot — and we kill them and act
surprised when they call us
names.
It's time to kick the machine.
This cycle leads only to endless
bloodshed. We must show people
that we have something to offer
for friendship, rather than only
punishment for non-compliance.
Our present circular process is
confirming Communist stereo
types of us instead of confound
ing them.
This cypernotic-loup - anxiety
neurosis is not only self-defeat
ing. It is also taking up too
much of our resources. It is leav
ing the world in nerd, the Negro
mistreated at home, and the
great hopes of peaceful coexist
ence in limbo. It is allowing our
country to mumble about Viet
nam, while we move toward nu
clear war.
In the last few years, man has
learned much about himself by
studying his cybernetic ma
chines. One of the most interest
ing phenomena he has observed
is the circular process into which
a computer, or a man, may slip
if something goes wrong.
With the machine, some part
might misfunction or the pro
gram might be wrong. The ma
chine can go into an infinite cy
cle of computation, until cleared.
With man, a worry might devel
op into an "anxiety neurosis"
which consumes more and more
of his neurones and his thoughts,
leaving him with too little unoc
cupied mental capacity to effect
ively cope with his environment.
With the machine, we shake it
to get the gears back in place or
turn the power on and off to jolt
it. We may even kick it. With
man, sleep may solve a problem
or a mild worry, while more ex
treme cases can demand electro
shock treatment or drugs or sur
gery.
Taking this a step further, in
the spirit of Freud's analogies

about the mental states of men
and societies, we might diagnose
some of America's present di
lemmas as neurotic circular
processes. One instance comes
immediately to mind: the cycle
of our meet-force-with-force for
eign policy.
Cat And Mouse Game
The other day an administra
tor (of all people!) put the situ
ation very aptly. He said that
the mouse of Communism had
the powerful American cat (pa
per tiger?) playing its games.
He thought that the U.S. could
rise above the knee-jerk re
sponse to "aggression" and
plunge its resources into a plan
of world development that would
so attract our wavering allies
and the third world that our
"adversaries" would have to fol
low our lead.
But we're not doing it. One
reason why might be that we are
caught in this neurotic loop: We
preserve our security with a
"world policeman" military and
economic policy that causes such
unfortunate reactions that the

policy must be increased to meet
new reactions. The increase, in
turn, creates more problems.
Vietnam is an obvious exam
ple. Everything we've tried has
only caused more death and got
ten us in deeper. What would
have happened if Ho Chi Minh
had won an election in 1956 and
had then been the recipient of a
massive American aid program
to develop the country, get it
through its "take-off" period,
