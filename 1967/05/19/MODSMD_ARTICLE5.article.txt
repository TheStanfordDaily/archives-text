### HENRY MULLER 
The Board ol Trustees yesterday

stration houses" and simultaneously
established a midnight limit on all
open house hours.
This action will provide fur the
conversion of two Wilbur and two
Stern houses into integrated, coedu
cational residences, each with a dis
tinct academic program. In addition,
Branner Hall will become a coeduca
tional freshman dormitory, housing
98 men and 63 women in different
wings.
The liberalized open house hours
will extend to all campus residences
and will place the primary responsi
bility for the development and en
forcement of social regulations with
the individual living groups.
The Board decision calls for a mid
night limit Thursdays through Sat
urdays and leaves with the president
of the University the responsibility to
establish more restrictive limits for
other evenings. According to Dean of
Students Joel Smith, these limits have
not yet been decided.
Daytime open house hours will

also be established at (lie discretion
ot ttie president. The new rules will
become effective next fall.
In other action, the trustees elected
W. Parmer Fuller 111 to replace Rich
ard F. Guggenhime as president of
the Board. Guggenhime will serve
as one of its four vice presidents.
Fuller, a member of the Board
since 1958, is a prominent San Fran
cisco businessman and a director of
of YV. I J . Fuller & Co. He graduated
from Stanford in 1934 and from Har
vard Law School in 1937.
Faculty Resident
The ratio of upperclassmen to
freshmen will be approximately 3 to
1 in each "demonstration house,"
with a ratio of men to women of less
than 2 to l. Each house will be head
ed by a faculty resident.
The houses will each have an aca
demic program organized around a
particular theme, following the model
of the Grove Project, where all resi
dents take a five-unit seminar. The
themes have not yet been determined,
although they are presently being
planned in cooperation with prospec
tive faculty residents.
Smith yesterday praised those who
had worked on the proposal present
ed to the trustees in the following
statement to The Daily:
"I regard the work of the subcom
mittee which drafted the proposal for
'demonstration houses' as a model
of how students can effectively par
ticipate in making significant changes
at Stanford. These students on the
subcommittee — Jan Jacobi, Rick
Levin, Rod Levine, and Mike Menke,
deserve the appreciation of the entire
Stanford community."
Wilbur Experiment
Jacobi, chairman of the ASSU
Housing Commission which last Feb
ruary proposed a Wilbur Experiment
involving eight "demonstration
houses," made the following state
ment:
"What seems important to me on
this great occasion is the spirit of
community exemplified by the stu
dents, faculty, and administrators
who have worked (and sweated!) to

gether side by side, tirelessly on this
issue since last fall. It has been a
beautiful thing to see, and I think all
of us who have been involved in this
process have been inspired by the
vision of how significant change can
be achieved at Stanford.
"From the Freshman Year subcom
mittee ol the Housing Commission to
the Spitz SES Committee and its sub
committee, through the painstaking
work of Dean Smith, Vice Provost
Packer, and Provost Lyman this past
month, we have achieved a dramatic
step toward the day when residences
at Stanford will be exciting, inspiring,
and enjoyable places to live."
Under the plan approved by the
trustees, the Grove Project will move
in one of the Stern "demonstration
houses." The membership will con
sist of a core from the present group
with new members selected to fill
vacancies.
The students who will live in the
other Stern "demonstration house"
will in large part consist of students
already living in that house, while the
two Wilbur houses will contain com
pletely new groups.
Recommendations for the adoption
of "demonstration houses" were made
unanmiously by the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford.
Responsible
Each residence unit will be respon
sible for setting its own hours, with
in the boundaries set by the trustees
and the president. In addition, the
dean of students may establish more
restrictive hours for freshmen dur
ing their first quarter of residence...
Social regulations will be the same
in "demonstration houses" as in other
University residences. The trustee de
cision asks that in each of these
houses hours be determined by the
faculty resident on the basis of a
majority vote of the residents, pro
vided they are within the limits set
by the University.
Smith explained in addition that
"under the leadership and direction
of the faculty resident and tutors, all
residents will be responsible for their
enforcement."

Violations will bo referred to a
House Council comprised of two stu
dents, two tutors, and the faculty resi
dent. Appeals from the council's de
cision will be possible by the indivi
dual concerned or the dean of stu
dents to the Interim Judicial Board.
Other Residences
The same pattern will hold true in
other residences, where faculty resi
dents, directors, resident assistants,
and sponsors will share with all other
residents the responsibility for de
velopment and enforcement of regu
lations.
The liberalized open house regula
tions contain the local option provi
sions of the Committee of Fifteen's
(Cl 5) recommendation on open
house presented last January. Cl 5,
however, had suggested a 2:30 a.m.
maximum for weekends with mid
night for weeknights.
The total number of male sponsors
next year will not lie affected by the
"demonstration houses" because there
will be six sponsors in Branner, mak
ing up for the absence of any in the
two experimental Wilbur Houses.

The Board ol Trustees yesterday
approved lour coeducational "demon
stration houses" and simultaneously
established a midnight limit on all
open house hours.
This action will provide fur the
conversion of two Wilbur and two
Stern houses into integrated, coedu
cational residences, each with a dis
tinct academic program. In addition,
Branner Hall will become a coeduca
tional freshman dormitory, housing
98 men and 63 women in different
wings.
The liberalized open house hours
will extend to all campus residences
and will place the primary responsi
bility for the development and en
forcement of social regulations with
the individual living groups.
The Board decision calls for a mid
night limit Thursdays through Sat
urdays and leaves with the president
of the University the responsibility to
establish more restrictive limits for
other evenings. According to Dean of
Students Joel Smith, these limits have
not yet been decided.
Daytime open house hours will

also be established at (lie discretion
ot ttie president. The new rules will
become effective next fall.
In other action, the trustees elected
W. Parmer Fuller 111 to replace Rich
ard F. Guggenhime as president of
the Board. Guggenhime will serve
as one of its four vice presidents.
Fuller, a member of the Board
since 1958, is a prominent San Fran

of YV. I J . Fuller & Co. He graduated
from Stanford in 1934 and from Har

Faculty Resident
The ratio of upperclassmen to
freshmen will be approximately 3 to
1 in each "demonstration house,"
with a ratio of men to women of less
than 2 to l. Each house will be head
ed by a faculty resident.
The houses will each have an aca
demic program organized around a
particular theme, following the model
of the Grove Project, where all resi
dents take a five-unit seminar. The
themes have not yet been determined,
although they are presently being
planned in cooperation with prospec

Smith yesterday praised those who

statement to The Daily:
"I regard the work of the subcom

The Board ol Trustees yesterday
approved lour coeducational "demon
stration houses" and simultaneously
established a midnight limit on all
open house hours.
This action will provide fur the
conversion of two Wilbur and two
Stern houses into integrated, coedu
cational residences, each with a dis
tinct academic program. In addition,
Branner Hall will become a coeduca
tional freshman dormitory, housing
98 men and 63 women in different
wings.
The liberalized open house hours
will extend to all campus residences
and will place the primary responsi
bility for the development and en
forcement of social regulations with
the individual living groups.
The Board decision calls for a mid
night limit Thursdays through Sat
urdays and leaves with the president
of the University the responsibility to
establish more restrictive limits for
other evenings. According to Dean of
Students Joel Smith, these limits have
not yet been decided.
Daytime open house hours will

also be established at (lie discretion
ot ttie president. The new rules will
become effective next fall.
In other action, the trustees elected
W. Parmer Fuller 111 to replace Rich
ard F. Guggenhime as president of
the Board. Guggenhime will serve
as one of its four vice presidents.
Fuller, a member of the Board
since 1958, is a prominent San Fran
cisco businessman and a director of
of YV. I J . Fuller & Co. He graduated
from Stanford in 1934 and from Har
vard Law School in 1937.
Faculty Resident
The ratio of upperclassmen to
freshmen will be approximately 3 to
1 in each "demonstration house,"
with a ratio of men to women of less
than 2 to l. Each house will be head
ed by a faculty resident.
The houses will each have an aca
demic program organized around a
particular theme, following the model
of the Grove Project, where all resi
dents take a five-unit seminar. The
themes have not yet been determined,
although they are presently being
planned in cooperation with prospec
tive faculty residents.
Smith yesterday praised those who
had worked on the proposal present
ed to the trustees in the following
statement to The Daily:
"I regard the work of the subcom
mittee which drafted the proposal for
'demonstration houses' as a model
of how students can effectively par
ticipate in making significant changes
at Stanford. These students on the
subcommittee — Jan Jacobi, Rick
Levin, Rod Levine, and Mike Menke,
deserve the appreciation of the entire
Stanford community."
Wilbur Experiment
Jacobi, chairman of the ASSU
Housing Commission which last Feb
ruary proposed a Wilbur Experiment
involving eight "demonstration
houses," made the following state
ment:
"What seems important to me on
this great occasion is the spirit of
community exemplified by the stu
dents, faculty, and administrators
who have worked (and sweated!) to

gether side by side, tirelessly on this
issue since last fall. It has been a
beautiful thing to see, and I think all
of us who have been involved in this
process have been inspired by the
vision of how significant change can
be achieved at Stanford.
"From the Freshman Year subcom
mittee ol the Housing Commission to
the Spitz SES Committee and its sub
committee, through the painstaking
work of Dean Smith, Vice Provost
Packer, and Provost Lyman this past
month, we have achieved a dramatic
step toward the day when residences
at Stanford will be exciting, inspiring,
and enjoyable places to live."
Under the plan approved by the
trustees, the Grove Project will move
in one of the Stern "demonstration
houses." The membership will con
sist of a core from the present group
with new members selected to fill
vacancies.
The students who will live in the
other Stern "demonstration house"
will in large part consist of students
already living in that house, while the
two Wilbur houses will contain com
pletely new groups.
Recommendations for the adoption
of "demonstration houses" were made
unanmiously by the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford.
Responsible
Each residence unit will be respon
sible for setting its own hours, with
in the boundaries set by the trustees
and the president. In addition, the
dean of students may establish more
restrictive hours for freshmen dur
ing their first quarter of residence...
Social regulations will be the same
in "demonstration houses" as in other
University residences. The trustee de
cision asks that in each of these
houses hours be determined by the
faculty resident on the basis of a
majority vote of the residents, pro
vided they are within the limits set
by the University.
Smith explained in addition that
"under the leadership and direction
of the faculty resident and tutors, all
residents will be responsible for their
enforcement."

Violations will bo referred to a
House Council comprised of two stu
dents, two tutors, and the faculty resi
dent. Appeals from the council's de
cision will be possible by the indivi
dual concerned or the dean of stu
dents to the Interim Judicial Board.
Other Residences
The same pattern will hold true in
other residences, where faculty resi
dents, directors, resident assistants,
and sponsors will share with all other
residents the responsibility for de
velopment and enforcement of regu
lations.
The liberalized open house regula
tions contain the local option provi
sions of the Committee of Fifteen's
(Cl 5) recommendation on open
house presented last January. Cl 5,
however, had suggested a 2:30 a.m.
