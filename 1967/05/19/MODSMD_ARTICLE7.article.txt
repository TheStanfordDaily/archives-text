# Diplomat, Radical Differ On U.S. Peace Ambitions
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
"Tho principal problem is how do
we end the war in Vietnam," stated
Stanford's diplomat-in-residence John
K. Emerson. Campus visitor Allard
G. Lowenstein went on to state that
if the United States government fol
lowed through on this belief with

action, there would be no reason for
debate.
Lowenstein, who is currently the
chief advisor of the Campus Coordi
nating Committee, added in his dis
cussion with Emerson in the Tresid
der small lounge yesterday afternoon
that "It is always interesting to de
bate with State Department officials,
because you don't always know what
side of the coin you are going to
come up on."
Emerson, who was last year the
Deputy Head of the Japanese Em
bassy, admitted, "My speciality is
Japan; I am not an expert on South
east Asia."
Referring to his experience in the
State Department, he stated that in
working on foreign relations policy,
"There are never any simple solu
tions."
In what contact he has had with
the Vietnam situation, Emerson stat
ed, "I am convinced beyond a doubt
that the United States desires settle
ment." Along this line, he felt that
a recent statement by Senators Ful
bright and Church on their positions
towards the war was "excellent" and
represents "exactly what the United
States desires."
In that statement, which was sign
ed by 13 other Senators, the two call
ed for settlement of the Vietnam sit

uation as soon as possible through
unilateral peace talks. But they as
serted their belief that there should
be no withdrawal of troops.
U.S. Against Negotiations
Emorson admitted he felt that the
United States had made mistakes in
handling the Vietnam situation. This
was particularly true "in the early
days when we might have been able
to influence the French to take a
more healthy stand," he stated.
In stating his position, Lowenstein
listed the three conditions which sug
gest to him that the United States
government's action doesn't agree
with its insistance that it desires
peace.
First, Lowenstein stated he feels,
"The United States does not want to
negotiate an honorable peace." One
example of this position was the "es
calation" of the bombing after the
Christmas truce, while there was
still a chance for negotiation.
"The United States seeks to pro
duce a change in the military balance
of power," Lowenstein stated in list
ing his second point. "And we carry
on this action despite the consistant
advice of military chiefs since Korea
against an Asia land war."
For his final point, Lowenstein in
sisted the "United States has tor
pedoed negotiations."
