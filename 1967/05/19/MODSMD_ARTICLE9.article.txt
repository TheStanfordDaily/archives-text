# CREO, Focus San Cristobal
## Growth Of Concern, Cooperation 
### 
What happens when a casual
visitor to Mexico becomes aware
of the suffering of people who
do not have even basic medical
needs ?
Kathy Costello, a graduate ed
ucation student, went to Chi
apas, Mexico near the Yucatan
Peninsula in the summer of
1965 to work on a census proj
ect for a liberal, young Catholic
bishop there. Soon after she
and several other Stanford grad
uate students arrived, they were
pressed into medical service, due
to the extreme needs of the In
dians in the Chiapas area.
Kathy and her friends came
back to Stanford in the fall,

knowing they had to do more.
The next spring they formed
CREO, a group of students and
other interested persons who
would promote the cause of
these Indians of Chiapas. The
group met at the Newman Cen
ter but kept itself a humanitar
ian effort not tied to any par
ticular reglious group. The
group raised money and inter
ested many others in the proj
ect.
Last summer, Kathy and nine
others returned to Chiapas to
administer the supplies and tal
ent they had collected. Several
hospitals and groups donated

medicines and equipment for
the project. The Palo Alto Ro
tary Club donated funds for 900
diphtheria shots.
One of the ten who stayed in
Chiapas for periods of two to
ten weeks, was Don Prolo, M.D.,
a resident at the Stanford Med
ical Center in Neurosurgery. He
had just his two week vacation
to give, but did and became in
volved just as Kathy had.
~ Prolo and others, including
nurses from Stanford and El
Camino hopsitals, gave diphthe
ria shots, performed TB tests,,
treated for worms, pneumonia,
thyroid, and many other dis

eases. Still others without speci
fic medical training cooked and
performed many other tasks.
Prolo emphasized the effective
ness of even limited medical
care because "the people were
dying of remedial disease, ones
that we have simple medicines
for."
Prolo, as many others, is now
involved many hours weekly for
CREO. The organization has
grown to one hundred mem
bers, most of whom are involv
ed in money raising, collecting
supplies, and training those who
actually go to Chiapas.
This summer between 15 and
25 will go for periods of two
weeks or more. The first group
leaves on June 1. During the
next few weeks they will con
tinue their training in Spanish,
basic first aid, and area culture.
Their ages range from a fresh
man 18 years old to over 60.
Most are from the Stanford
community.
The reaction of the people of
Chiapas has been enthusiastic.
"We became aware of the situa
tion there, and they became
aware of us," says Dr. Prolo.
"The Indians expect us to go
back." The San Cristobal Junior
Chamber, a group of young
Mexican business and profes
sional people, also responded to
the needs of the Indians and
offered to join with CREO in
a joint project.

CREO received cooperation
also l'rom the Palo Alto Jaycees
who, dedicated to fostering in
ternational understanding, are
also working on the project
known as "Focus San Cristo
bal." Through the project, a mo
bile medical clinic will be
bought and supplied for the In
dians in Chiapas. CREO will
supply the personnel and or
ganization and has received ad
ditional help from the Mexican
government, and private Mexi
can physicians.
Dr. Javier Torroella, Director
of Mexican Institute of Tropical
Ophthamology, will be directly
responsible for the clinic, after
it is given to the San Cristobal
Junior Chamber International.
Both Mexican and U.S. physi
cians, dentists, nurses, and re
lated personnel will work
through CREO with the clinic.
It is hoped that donations will
allow the clinic to be in opera
tion later this year.
Most of the one hundred mem
bers of CREO appear deeply
involved. "Once you have com
mitted yourself and become in
volved, it's hard to pull back,"
says Dr. Prolo, "but we need
people committed at all levels
who take the project to the
end." Prolo and Kathy Costcllo,
who is now a co-chairman of
CREO, have additional informa
tion about the project.
