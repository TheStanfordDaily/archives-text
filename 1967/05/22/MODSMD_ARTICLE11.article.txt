## 'Prisoners' Attains Lyricism 
### FRANK S. ALBERTI 
A Sleep of Prisoners opened
on Friday, May 19, beginning a
two week stay at Memorial
Church. The other two perfor
mances will be on Friday, May
26 and Saturday, May 27.
Robert Sevra, the director, in
the informal discussion which
followed the performance, talk
ed with great personal convic
tion of his dedication to Chris
topher Fry's play. He and Alan
Mokler, the producer, bravely
accepted the challenge of add
ing a serious script to the Ram's
Head repertory, which already
included a successful Boy
Friend.
Few prisoners of war are
brought to a church. Not any
church, but a real one. These
were Fry's own instructions.
The church, played by Mem
Chu, is the principal character
She gives shelter to Pvt. David
King, Pvt. Peter Able, Cpl. Jo?
eph Adams and Pvt. Tim Mea
dows, harbors their dreams
but does not bring them peace.
On the contrary, she makes
them remember biblical stories
they learned in their childhood
Not always gentle stories, the e.

Their "real" Christian names
foretell the characters they are
to become in each other's dream
projections. In turn, they be
come Cain and Abel, Abraham
and Isaac, David and Absalom.
Intelligent Performances
The cast, with intelligent
awareness, explored the lyrical
levels of meaning in their rela
tion to each other. "You have to
think twice every time you want
to think," gibes Alan Mokler as
Pvt. Able, carefully, but some
what hesitantly plays up the
humor of their predicament;
humor which could have bright
ened Mr. Fry's sometimes over
ly poetic work.
Faced with the technical as
well as the metaphysical prob
lems posed by Mem Chu, direc
tor Sevra could have given the
venerable, earthquake - proof
grande dame more to do; there
by extending the linear move
ment of the poetry into space,
compensating for the lack of
dramatic action.
Suggestions for Production
Why not (move the lights
around to illuminate some of the
glass windows providing visual

relief to overly intellectual dia
logues? Some of the sleep se
quences could have been taped
to correspond with the actor's
dream roles.
Expressing the "prolific indif
ference" of the world these pris
oners could have looked shab
bier, sounded more tortured.
There was an overall feeling
of unity in the acting which
did much to carry the play.
Less Violence
Chuck Alston brings a gentle
tone to his role as Adams. In
one or two of the fight scenes
there could have been less actual
violence, more control.
Rick Krueger, as Pvt. Tim
Meadows failed to establish his
stage personality completely.
He has much potential which
hopefully will be asserted. It is
indeed difficult to play to a sea
of pews.
Samuel Swartz' music was
witty and appropriate and Dean
B. Davie Napier is to be thank
ed for once again trying to
make the church an integral
part of the college community.
Won't you?

Intelligent Performances
The cast, with intelligent
awareness, explored the lyrical
levels of meaning in their rela
tion to each other. "You have to
think twice every time you want
to think," gibes Alan Mokler as
Pvt. Able, carefully, but some
what hesitantly plays up the
humor of their predicament;
humor which could have bright
ened Mr. Fry's sometimes over

Faced with the technical as
well as the metaphysical prob

venerable, earthquake - proof
grande dame more to do; there
by extending the linear move
ment of the poetry into space,
compensating for the lack of
dramatic action.
Suggestions for Production
Why not (move the lights
around to illuminate some of the
glass windows providing visual

relief to overly intellectual dia
logues? Some of the sleep se
quences could have been taped
to correspond with the actor's
dream roles.
Expressing the "prolific indif
ference" of the world these pris
oners could have looked shab
bier, sounded more tortured.
There was an overall feeling
of unity in the acting which
did much to carry the play.
Less Violence
Chuck Alston brings a gentle
tone to his role as Adams. In
one or two of the fight scenes
there could have been less actual
violence, more control.
Rick Krueger, as Pvt. Tim
Meadows failed to establish his
stage personality completely.
He has much potential which
hopefully will be asserted. It is
indeed difficult to play to a sea
of pews.
Samuel Swartz' music was
witty and appropriate and Dean
B. Davie Napier is to be thank
ed for once again trying to
make the church an integral
part of the college community.

A Sleep of Prisoners opened
on Friday, May 19, beginning a
two week stay at Memorial
Church. The other two perfor
mances will be on Friday, May
26 and Saturday, May 27.
Robert Sevra, the director, in
the informal discussion which
followed the performance, talk
ed with great personal convic
tion of his dedication to Chris
topher Fry's play. He and Alan
Mokler, the producer, bravely
accepted the challenge of add
ing a serious script to the Ram's
Head repertory, which already
included a successful Boy
Friend.
