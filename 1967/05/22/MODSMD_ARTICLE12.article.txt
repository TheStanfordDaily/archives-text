# Asian Scholars Give Views On China, Vietnam Protests
## 
### ROGER LaBRUCHERIE 
Dinkelspiel provided the for
um for three speakers dealing
with China and Vietnam. Politi
cal Science professors Robert C.
North and Michel C. Oksenberg
outlined and analyzed current
developments in China, while
Dr. Milorad Drachkovitch senior
staff member of the Hoover Insti
tution commented on public and
academic opinion of the war in
Vietnam. At the end of the day
all three participated in a panel
discussing Southeast Asia.
Professor Oksenberg at
tempted to give his audience
some insight into the Cultural
Revolution from the other—that
is, Mao's—point of view. Oksen
berg feels that the Cultural Rev
olution is the result of the appli
cation of Mao's revolutionary
ethic and guerilla techniques to
the situation which has devel
oped in China since 1949 and
especially since the failure of the
Great Leap in the late fifties.
Reflecting on Mao's rise to
power, and speaking on a plane
which the alumni probably had
difficulty reaching, Oksenberg
pointed out that Mao's successes
had come from the application
of guerilla tactics in unfavor
able circumstances. Mao, says
Oksenberg, is currently applying
these tactics against the greatest
challenge he has yet faced: the
incipient loss of the revolution
ary elan which he sees not only
necessary for building the ideal
communist state, but as a virtue
of itself for a society.
Continuous Revolution
The loss of this elan and de
velopments which Mao charac
terizes as bourgeoise have led
him to turn to the Red Guard
and to purging ideological slack
ers in order to guarantee the
continuation after his death of
a China dedicated to egalitarian
ism and continuous revolution.

Thus seen, Oksenberg con
cluded, the Cultural Revolution
takes on a rationality which it
does not, at first inspection, evi
dence.
Professor North's analysis
concurred largely with that of
Oksenberg's, but North sought
to place the Cultural Revolution
in a larger context as the symp
tom of a problem which is press
ing not only upon China but
upon the entire underdeveloped
world, and, because of the state
of military technology, concerns
the developed world as well.
That problem is the race be
tween technology and popula
tion, and the Cultural Revolu
tion, says North, is part of the
convulsion China is undergoing
upon recognizing that her des
tiny is presently on the wrong
horse.
No More Lucky Circumstances
North points out that China's
archaic social structure and an
economy ruined by years of
Japanese occupation nad civil
war had allowed the Commu
nists to make rapid improve
ments after 1949. But since the
late 1950'5, when the problem
has become one of building a
new social order rather than
tearing out an old one, prob
lems and economic setbacks
have occurred which have re
sulted in large-scale disaffection
by the people. The Culutral Rev
olution is at least partly the at
tempt by Mao to regain the sup
port and enthusiasm of the
masses for the (continuing) rev
olution.
The question is whether Mao
can succeed in reinstilling
through the head what has been
lost through the stomach. North
obviously feels that in the long
run, Mao is doomed to failure,
that the answer must be sought
in readjusting the rates of popu
lation growth and technological

growth. He further feels that the
problem is one to which peoples
of all nations—developed as well
as underdeveloped—must turn
their attention, and soon.
Opinion Gap Unwarranted
Dr. Drachkovitch centered his
address around the various ele
ments of support and opposition
to the Vietnam war. He feels
that there exists the appearance
of a large gap of opinion be
tween the general public and col
lege communities which is un
warranted, and that this is due
to the failure of supporting
groups to make their positions
vocal, as do the dissenting
groups.
He commented that the pro
test groups are a heterogeneous
body ranging from political
idealists to "hate America" ele
ments, and that their case is
more publicized because of the
sensationalist nature of the
press.
