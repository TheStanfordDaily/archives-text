# Conference Speakers Ask Ease In Regulations

### KIRK HANSON 
Stanford's students today are
more moral, better disciplined,
more concerned and sensitive
than preceding generations of
students, according to three
speakers at Saturday's Stanford
Conference.
In the series on Student Life,
Dean of Students Joel Smith,
Professor of Law John McDon
ough, and Cowell Health Center
Psychiatrist John Maurer called
for an end to the University's
In loco parentis role, the relaxa
tion of restrictions on the use of
marijuana, and the relaxation of
University regulations that say
"there is one moral answer to
every question."
Smith, speaking on Student

Morality, said the University's
acting as a moral authority or
parent was "always a mistake."
He stated that the "testing of
moral standards" is an integral
part of education.
Compassionate Morality
Smith also cited a "capability
to talk freely and honestly about
sexual behavior" as a character
istic of today's students. He
acknowledged a "slight increase
of sexual contact over previous
generations," but emphasized
that there has also been an "in
creased compassion and concern
for the individuals" and so
"higher sexual standards than
in the past."
McDonough asked the ques
tion "Have we outlived the fun
damental standard?" Any appli
cation tied to in loco parentis
is outdated, according to Mc-
Donough. He expressed concern
over the growing complexity of
student discipline in a pluralistic
society. "Student councils are
hardly up to such responsibility,
nor is it clear that faculty mem
bers and administrators are,
either."
In asking the University to
"seriously consider getting out
of the business of setting and
enforcing general standards of
conduct for students," McDon
ough called for a two fold con
cern of the University for stu
dent conduct.
Prohibition In Common Interest
As "educator," the University
would determine "what kinds of
conduct a university is entitled"
to require of or prohibit to
students in the common interest
of carrying forward a reason
ably harmonious educational en
terprise." As "proprietor," it
would make regulations "to in
sure the health, safety, and mu
tual convenience of approxi
mately 20,000 people who come
together each day on the cam
pus."

Dr. Maurer explained to the
participants in the conference
the medical information known
about LSD and marijuana and
concluded that the laws regulat
ing the use of marijuana were
not justified. While warning of
the effects, known and yet un
discovered, of LSD, he character
ized marijuana as "relatively
innocuous," and noted it appears
"to have the same effect as sev
eral drinks of alcohol." He fur
ther pointed out it does not have
the symptoms of withdrawal
and psychological dependency
that can result from alcohol or
nicotine.
Smith raised several objec
tions to tendencies in student
morality. He called for a realiza
tion that the practice of morality
is more difficult than the theory,
and noted the students must put
their concern for morality into
practice. He criticized the ex
treme moral iniipnation which
"makes it impossible for stu
dents tc play a constructive role
in society," and termed it a way
of 'selling out'.
Self righteous Bigotry
His third objection was that
students have considered it legit
imate to disobey any law they
disagree with. Smith claims such
civil disobedience is justified
only when all the ordinary
means of change are exhausted.
He also warned that the self
righteousness of the students
can develop into a bigotry that
says all fraternity men "lead
morally depraved lives," or that
"you can't trust anyone over
thirty."
All three speakers clashed
with parents and alumni during
question and answer periods
after the talks. The end of in
loco parentis was criticized most
highly. One member of the Class
of '17 stated: "I don't agree
times are changing; they change
only if you let them."

Psychiatrist John Maurer called
for an end to the University's
In loco parentis role, the relaxa
tion of restrictions on the use of
marijuana, and the relaxation of
University regulations that say
"there is one moral answer to
every question."
Smith, speaking on Student

Morality, said the University's
acting as a moral authority or
parent was "always a mistake."
He stated that the "testing of
moral standards" is an integral
part of education.
Compassionate Morality
Smith also cited a "capability
to talk freely and honestly about
sexual behavior" as a character
istic of today's students. He
acknowledged a "slight increase
of sexual contact over previous
generations," but emphasized
that there has also been an "in
creased compassion and concern
for the individuals" and so
"higher sexual standards than
in the past."
McDonough asked the ques
tion "Have we outlived the fun
damental standard?" Any appli
cation tied to in loco parentis
is outdated, according to Mc-
Donough. He expressed concern
over the growing complexity of
student discipline in a pluralistic
society. "Student councils are
hardly up to such responsibility,
nor is it clear that faculty mem
bers and administrators are,
either."
In asking the University to
"seriously consider getting out
of the business of setting and
enforcing general standards of
conduct for students," McDon
ough called for a two fold con
cern of the University for stu
dent conduct.
Prohibition In Common Interest
As "educator," the University
would determine "what kinds of
conduct a university is entitled"
to require of or prohibit to
students in the common interest
of carrying forward a reason
ably harmonious educational en
terprise." As "proprietor," it
would make regulations "to in
sure the health, safety, and mu
tual convenience of approxi
mately 20,000 people who come
together each day on the cam
pus."

Dr. Maurer explained to the
participants in the conference
the medical information known
about LSD and marijuana and
concluded that the laws regulat
ing the use of marijuana were
not justified. While warning of
the effects, known and yet un
discovered, of LSD, he character
ized marijuana as "relatively
innocuous," and noted it appears
"to have the same effect as sev
eral drinks of alcohol." He fur
ther pointed out it does not have
the symptoms of withdrawal
and psychological dependency
that can result from alcohol or
nicotine.
Smith raised several objec
tions to tendencies in student
morality. He called for a realiza
tion that the practice of morality
is more difficult than the theory,
and noted the students must put
their concern for morality into
practice. He criticized the ex
treme moral iniipnation which
"makes it impossible for stu
dents tc play a constructive role
in society," and termed it a way
of 'selling out'.
Self righteous Bigotry
His third objection was that
students have considered it legit
imate to disobey any law they
disagree with. Smith claims such
civil disobedience is justified
only when all the ordinary
means of change are exhausted.
He also warned that the self
righteousness of the students
can develop into a bigotry that
says all fraternity men "lead
morally depraved lives," or that
"you can't trust anyone over
thirty."
All three speakers clashed
with parents and alumni during
question and answer periods
after the talks. The end of in
loco parentis was criticized most
highly. One member of the Class
of '17 stated: "I don't agree
times are changing; they change
only if you let them."
Stanford's students today are

students, according to three

Conference.
