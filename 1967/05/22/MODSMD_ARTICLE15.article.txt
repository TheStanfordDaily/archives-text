## Man And Humanities 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
"Humanities are those studies
which find meaning in experi
ence," stated Prof. John Dodds,
director of Stanford's Special
Programs in Humanities. And
from that perspective, alumni
questioned the four professors
concerned with "Freedom and
the Humanities" about topics
ranging from the General Stu
dies Program to admissions pol
icy.
Prof. Dodds, in his discussion
of "Freedom and the Humani-

ties" spoke of the "new kind of
restlessness in the air of student
circles." These students, if they
don't "get exactly what they
want, retreat into a state of dis
trust," Dodds added.
"I find it especially encourag
ing," Dodds continued, pointing
out students were on the right
track, "that these students are
concerned about the kind of edu
cation dished out to them." He
referred to the formation of the
Special Program in Humanities
as an example, and called it "one
of the significant achievements
to come about through collabor
ation between students and fac
ulty."
Similarity
He pointed out the similarity
of the artist and the scientist
who look for a likeness that
wasn't known before. Dodds
added that he felt "Both the
humanities and the sciences
should relate together with a
larger theory of man."
On a more specific aspect of
the humanities, Prof. Lorenz
Eitner, Executive Head of the
Department of Art and Architec
ture, considered the demands
made by society on a creative in
dividual.
"An artist must have a ter
rifically strong feeling of what
must be done," Eitner stated.
This means that even the artist
himself might not understand
what he is creating.
'The artist creates, but he

does not communicate," Eitner
added. "Society cannot judge by
usual means. The viewer must,
therefore, withhold his immedi
ate personal reaction."
Cannot Be Taught
Eitner admitted that "There is
a certain element of creativity in
all human enterprises." But at
the same time, "There seems to
be from century to century a
fixed ratio of creative artists,"
indicating that creativity can not
be taught.
Prof. David Levin of the En
glish Department used the hu
manities to explain the Colonial
Puritan. He pointed out that the
Puritan, like the modern Ameri
can, "was the most dangerous
when certain of his absolute
Tightness."
"It seems to me that both the
generation over 30 and the re
bellious young (generation)
overemphasize the newness of
the problems that divide them,"
he added.
Five Generations
"In my own lifetime of 42
years, for example, there have
been at least five generations in
the U.S.—the Lost, the Radical,
the Silent, the Beat, and at last—
thanks to Time magazine—the
so-called Now Generation of the
1960'5."
Prof. Levin offered as one
positive aspect of the Puritan
philosophy his standard "that
allowed him to admit his mis
takes."
