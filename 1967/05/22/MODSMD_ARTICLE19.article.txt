# Laxmen Decision Palo 8-7
## 
### 
The Stanford Lacrosse Team
came a long way toward win
ning its first Northern Califor
nia championship when it de
feated traditional champion Palo
Alto, 8-7, at Woodside High
School Saturday.
Palo Alto jumped to a 2-0 lead
with only two minutes gone in
the first quarter, as former Ail-
American Bruce Lloyd and then
Bill Oatway tallied.
Chris Rafferty then bounced
in a hard shot from the restrain
ing line, putting Stanford on
the scoreboard with only four
minutes gone in the game.
Retaliation
Palo Alto committed its first
foul three minutes later, and
within eight seconds, Bob Hawk
ins assisted Mel Ellis in tying
the score.

Play was even the rest of the
first half, as Palo Alto and then
Stanford traded scores, with the
game tied at half-time, 4-4.
Baseball Slow
Poor calls by the referees and
the consequent debates in the
second half resulted in the slow
moving atmosphere of a base
ball game, as players and spec
tators called for the game to
resume. But the debates went
on uninterrupted, sometimes for
as long as ten minutes before
play was resumed.
The Indians built up an 8-6
lead with just minutes remain
ing, with the great efforts by
Clay Primrose, who played his
best game of the season, scor
ing two goals and registering
additional points in assists.
But Palo Alto was never out

of the game, and came back
with its last goal on a beautiful
play, as Lloyd assisted last
year's Indian coach Gene Dicka
son, who placed the ball square
ly in the upper left corner of
the goal.
The attack passed the ball
more than usual and the favor
able effects are seen in the rec
ord number of five assisted
goals. There were few stars in
this game, and it must be seen
as a good team effort.
Scoring: Stanford — Prim
rose, Muser, Ellis, two each;
Hawkins, Rafferty, one each.
Palo Alto — Lloyd, three; Sher
wood, two; Oatway, Dickason,
one each.
