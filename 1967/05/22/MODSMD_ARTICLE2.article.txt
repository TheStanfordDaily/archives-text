# Lyman Outlines Problems Of Progress To Alumni
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
Saturday was Alumni Day here at
Stanford; a day for grads to return to
the Farm and learn all about what
has happened since their departure.
The keynote address was delivered
by Provost Richard Lyman at a noon
luncheon at Bowman Alumni House.
Sitting under the trees the gathered

multitude was given a brief, but de
tailed look at the accomplishments
of the "Sterling Era".
Dr. Lyman's topic was "Tradition
and Progress — Is There a Conflict
Between Them?" Admitting that he
was perhaps begging the question,
Lyman said, "... these men (David
Starr Jordan, Ray Lyman Wilbur,

J. E. Wallace Sterling) embody a
great tradition of progress at Stan
ford."
Provost Lyman went on to out
line three problems that have arisen
out of Stanford's need to progress.
The first of these was financial.
Pointing out that the total Univer
sity budget in 1949 was $11 million,
and nearly half again that amount
was spent last year just for building
projects, Lyman said, "... we are
finding that when we draw graphs
with one line representing our needs
and another our projected income,
these two lines tend to diverge in a
very disconcerting way."
The second problem Lyman men
tioned has grown out of the tremen
dous growth in research over the
past decade which has effected an
enormously increased emphasis upon
postgraduate education. Indicating
that graduate study is more expen
sive than undergraduate study, Ly
man continued, "If the trend toward
even more graduate students con
tinues, one may ask, how will the
undergraduates fare?"
Lyman added that there was a
whole mythology that had grown up
around this question, and according
to that mythology the "undergradu
ates are becoming an exploited mi
nority within the University."
The third area in which problems
have arisen according to Lyman, is
facilities. "In spite of all the building
—such as the superb new Meyer Li
brary for Undergraduates — we still
have some notable unfulfilled needs
in terms of facilities.
"Some of the Chemistry Labs are
little short of deplorable, our drama
facilities are outmoded and inadequ
ate by any standard, too many aca
demic departments are badly housed,
with their offices scattered over sev
eral different locations, the Music
Department uses a former ladies
lounge for a practice room."
Provost Lyman went on to explain
how the Sterling Era had tried to
deal with these problems, espec
ially the Graduatc-Undergradu
ate dilemma. "The undergradu
ate is far from being forgotten
in one of the best known inno
vations of the Sterling Era —
the development of Stanford
centers overseas. The very
schedule of classes at the over
seas campuses reflects a recog
nition of the fact that education
is a process of growth that does
not stop — must not stop —
when the bell rings."
But, solutions breed problems.
"The overseas campuses have
presented the home campus with
a distinct challenge," Lyman
said. "If all this can happen
abroad, why not at home? . . .
Living groups are out to contri
bute to education objectives in
the broadest sense. And this de
mand, difficult though it often
is to meet in practice, is surely
a constructive one, to which the
overseas campuses give real im
petus."

Lyman concluded by warning
the alumni that resources were
not the only problem in dealing
with the other dilemmas. "Mon
ey alone will not enable us to
find the appropriate new de
signs for liberal arts education.
Money alone would not tell us
how to maximize the advan
tages of the private university.
Money alone will not devise ef
fective ways of seeing to it that
excellent classroom teaching
gets recognized and properly
rewarded."
"The University must have
the understanding and support
of its alumni and friends out
side."
"We do not have all the an
swers, and just when we think
we've got a few of them, some
one comes along and changes
the questions. The Sterling Era
has seen a growth of both free
dom and responsibility at Stan
ford. That, I submit, is true
progress, and it is true also to
the best in the University's tra
dition."

in one of the best known inno
vations of the Sterling Era —
the development of Stanford
centers overseas. The very
schedule of classes at the over
seas campuses reflects a recog
nition of the fact that education
is a process of growth that does
not stop — must not stop —
when the bell rings."
But, solutions breed problems.
"The overseas campuses have
presented the home campus with
a distinct challenge," Lyman
said. "If all this can happen
abroad, why not at home? . . .
Living groups are out to contri
bute to education objectives in
the broadest sense. And this de
mand, difficult though it often
is to meet in practice, is surely
a constructive one, to which the
overseas campuses give real im
petus."

Lyman concluded by warning
the alumni that resources were
not the only problem in dealing
with the other dilemmas. "Mon
ey alone will not enable us to
find the appropriate new de
signs for liberal arts education.
Money alone would not tell us
how to maximize the advan
tages of the private university.
Money alone will not devise ef
fective ways of seeing to it that
excellent classroom teaching
gets recognized and properly
rewarded."
"The University must have
the understanding and support
of its alumni and friends out
side."
"We do not have all the an
swers, and just when we think
we've got a few of them, some
one comes along and changes
the questions. The Sterling Era
has seen a growth of both free
dom and responsibility at Stan
ford. That, I submit, is true
progress, and it is true also to
the best in the University's tra
dition."
Saturday was Alumni Day here at
Stanford; a day for grads to return to
the Farm and learn all about what
has happened since their departure.
The keynote address was delivered
by Provost Richard Lyman at a noon
luncheon at Bowman Alumni House.
Sitting under the trees the gathered

multitude was given a brief, but de
tailed look at the accomplishments
of the "Sterling Era".
Dr. Lyman's topic was "Tradition
and Progress — Is There a Conflict
Between Them?" Admitting that he
was perhaps begging the question,
Lyman said, "... these men (David
Starr Jordan, Ray Lyman Wilbur,

J. E. Wallace Sterling) embody a
great tradition of progress at Stan
ford."
Provost Lyman went on to out
line three problems that have arisen
out of Stanford's need to progress.
The first of these was financial.
Pointing out that the total Univer
sity budget in 1949 was $11 million,
and nearly half again that amount
was spent last year just for building
projects, Lyman said, "... we are
finding that when we draw graphs
with one line representing our needs
and another our projected income,
these two lines tend to diverge in a
very disconcerting way."
The second problem Lyman men
tioned has grown out of the tremen
dous growth in research over the
past decade which has effected an
enormously increased emphasis upon
postgraduate education. Indicating
that graduate study is more expen
sive than undergraduate study, Ly
man continued, "If the trend toward
even more graduate students con
tinues, one may ask, how will the
undergraduates fare?"
Lyman added that there was a
whole mythology that had grown up
around this question, and according
to that mythology the "undergradu
ates are becoming an exploited mi
nority within the University."
The third area in which problems
have arisen according to Lyman, is
facilities. "In spite of all the building
—such as the superb new Meyer Li
brary for Undergraduates — we still
have some notable unfulfilled needs
in terms of facilities.
"Some of the Chemistry Labs are
little short of deplorable, our drama
facilities are outmoded and inadequ
ate by any standard, too many aca
demic departments are badly housed,
with their offices scattered over sev
eral different locations, the Music
Department uses a former ladies
lounge for a practice room."
Provost Lyman went on to explain
how the Sterling Era had tried to
deal with these problems, espec
ially the Graduatc-Undergradu
ate dilemma. "The undergradu
ate is far from being forgotten
in one of the best known inno
vations of the Sterling Era —
the development of Stanford
centers overseas. The very
schedule of classes at the over
seas campuses reflects a recog
nition of the fact that education
