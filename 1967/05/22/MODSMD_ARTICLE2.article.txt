# Lyman Outlines Problems Of Progress To Alumni
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
Saturday was Alumni Day here at
Stanford; a day for grads to return to
the Farm and learn all about what
has happened since their departure.
The keynote address was delivered
by Provost Richard Lyman at a noon
luncheon at Bowman Alumni House.
Sitting under the trees the gathered

multitude was given a brief, but de
tailed look at the accomplishments
of the "Sterling Era".
Dr. Lyman's topic was "Tradition
and Progress — Is There a Conflict
Between Them?" Admitting that he
was perhaps begging the question,
Lyman said, "... these men (David
Starr Jordan, Ray Lyman Wilbur,

J. E. Wallace Sterling) embody a
great tradition of progress at Stan
ford."
Provost Lyman went on to out
line three problems that have arisen
out of Stanford's need to progress.
The first of these was financial.
Pointing out that the total Univer
sity budget in 1949 was $11 million,
and nearly half again that amount
was spent last year just for building
projects, Lyman said, "... we are
finding that when we draw graphs
with one line representing our needs
and another our projected income,
these two lines tend to diverge in a
very disconcerting way."
The second problem Lyman men
tioned has grown out of the tremen
dous growth in research over the
past decade which has effected an
enormously increased emphasis upon
postgraduate education. Indicating
that graduate study is more expen
sive than undergraduate study, Ly
man continued, "If the trend toward
even more graduate students con
tinues, one may ask, how will the
undergraduates fare?"
Lyman added that there was a
whole mythology that had grown up
around this question, and according
to that mythology the "undergradu
ates are becoming an exploited mi
nority within the University."
The third area in which problems
have arisen according to Lyman, is
facilities. "In spite of all the building
—such as the superb new Meyer Li
brary for Undergraduates — we still
have some notable unfulfilled needs
in terms of facilities.
"Some of the Chemistry Labs are
little short of deplorable, our drama
facilities are outmoded and inadequ
ate by any standard, too many aca
demic departments are badly housed,
with their offices scattered over sev
eral different locations, the Music
Department uses a former ladies
lounge for a practice room."
Provost Lyman went on to explain
how the Sterling Era had tried to
