# CARDS WIN PAC-8!
## Shotts' Shot Shoots Bears 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Ron Shotts blasted a throe
run homer Friday to provide
the margin of victory in Stan
ford's 5-1 victory over Cal and
assure the Tribe of the Pac-8
baseball championship.
Although the NCAA commit
tee has not formalized its deci
sion, it appears likely that only
Stanford (31-3) and Fresno
State will play off for the dis

trict eight Spot in the NCAA's at
Omaha. The teams will have a
best two of three series, with
the first game at one school and
the last two at the other.
Coach Dutch Fehring said he
would prefer to have the first
game at Stanford if he wins
the coin flip. The first game
will probably be Friday.
In the third inning of Friday's

game Rod Poteete beat out an
infield single. Mark Marquess
followed with an opposite field
double, sending Poteete to third.
Shotts then stepped up, and
to "the delirious joy of The Daily
headline writer, clubbed the ball
far over the left field fence.
Marquess, whose name unfor
tunately is alliteratively unsuit
able, nevertheless clouted a

homer in the fifth in his favor
ite left-center alley.
The final Tribe tally also came
in the fifth inning on singles
by Mike Schomaker and Bob
Boone and a ground ball by
Jeff Rohlfing.
Hurler Poteete was not quite
as sharp as he has been the
last few weeks. He walked two
batters and actually allowed
Cal to score a run, the first he
has given up in 27 innings of
conference play. Marty Inger
soll's 4-bagger in the sixth was
the spoiler.
Fine Swan - Duffy - Marquess
double plays in the fourth and
sixth innings helped Poteete
considerably.
Rematch Win
Although Saturday's rematch
didnot matter, the Tribe nine
suffered no letdown. Sandy
Vance chucked a four hitter to
lead the Cards to a 6-3 win over
the Bears. It marked a three
game sweep of Cal for the
Cards this season.
The Tribe's Bob Boone and
Jeff Rolfing broke the game
