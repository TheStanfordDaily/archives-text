# Neutrinos Hold IM Command; Playoffs To Determine Champ
## 
### 
With the softball, volleyball,
and water polo tournaments
starting tomorrow, it looks as
if the Neutrinos will walk away
with the University intramural
championship.
The group of physics grad
students, leading the point total
after two quarters, are in the
finals for all three sports, in
addition to having men still left
in the golf and horseshoes single
elimination tournaments.
They, however, are not the
favorites in any of the three
major tournaments. In softball,
14 teams made it through the
regular season undefeated.

Teams to watch include the
Delts, the Theta Delts, and the
Alpha Delts, who upset Sigma
Chi Omega for league cham
pions.
The volleyball tournament will
also feature 14 undefeated teams
among an unusually fine field
this year, headed by the D.U.'s,
Phi Kaps, Chi Psi's and Neu
trinos.

There was a big upset in
season play in water-polo as the
Alpha Sigs dumped the peren
nial champion in this sport, the
Betas.
Single elimination tourna
ments in tennis and golf are
down to the quarterfinals, while
one of the two final positions
in the horseshoes tournaments
has been filled.
