## The 						Draft: A Joke? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
May I agree entirely with
Senator Hatfield in his declaim
ing the necessity of the draft.
I believe he has stated the fun
damental fact that the U.S. is
so utterly wealthy and militari
ly superarmed that the system
does not need any of us to
carry on the slaughter. The sys
tem does not need me! It's a
joke! Here is the 22 year old
fleet footed intellectual who out
ran the Draft Board for four
years, while marching in pro
test . . . and they don't even
need me to carry on the war.
It's a joke. The sheer gargan
tuan proportion of this tragedy
is comic.
The world of Alice is the last
bastion of sanity. But Mr. John
son is the jester of the century
• . . "Lynda Bird, sweetheart, I
hate to say this but your daddy
may go down in history as the
man who started World War
III." Top that one Mr. Hatfield.
Some of us have got a funny
line, too. I won't go ... I just
won't go.

Editor, The Daily:
Just a few comments about
Mr. Schaefer's vitriolic column
by a grad student who is not a
disciple of, nor totally in agree
ment with, "Prof. Newleft":
1) Mr. Schaefer's democracy
— Mr. Schaefer cites disagree
ment in the Saigon government
as presaging a healthy demo
cratic future for South Vietnam.
While I might tend toward more
optimism concerning South Viet
nam for this reason also, unfor
tunately, after reading Mr.
Schaefer's column I must be a
bit more pessimistic about demo
cracy, aware of the fact that we
in this country defined demo
cracy as disagreement only
within the political elite of a
nation and did not include the
right of the individual citizen to
disagree with the political elite
(as "Prof. Newleft" disagrees).
I might suggest that one as
pect of democracy may be com
pletely antithetical to Mr.
Schaefer's way of thinking: the
right of the citizen to disagree
with his government and not be
considered a traitor. And if we
are not in Vietnam to give some
Vietnamese "Prof. Newleft" this
very right which Mr. Schaefer
would seem to want to deny
to an American "Prof. Newleft",
then what are we there for?
2) Mr. Schaefer's morality:
Mr. Schaefer states that he
doesn't know what morality is
being referred to when he hears
about the "immoral war" in
Vietnam. But certainly other
standards of morality exist than
the "my country, right or
wrong", dog-eat-dog morality
that Mr. Schaefer's letter im
plies. Perhaps the standard of
morality being referred to by
"Prof. Newleft" is the same
standard that was applied by in
ternational law and the United
States government in the Nur
emberg and Tokyo war crimes
trials.
This is not to condemn the
leaders of this country as war
criminals by analogy (I would
not support this proposition),
but merely to defend the right
of American citizens to use as
a standard of morality the same
standard used at Nuremberg and
perhaps to conclude that our
Vietnam policy and/or methods
are "immoral".
Or more simply, Mr. Schaefer,
perhaps a standard of morality
exists that would find the burn
ing of other human beings'
flesh (including many civilian
women and children) with jellied
gasoline to be "immoral". No, I
do not expect that the Marine
fighting for his life in Vietnam
to consider the use of napalm
on his adversary to be "im
moral". But neither do I think

that the morality of a soldier
in battle is the standard of
morality that all civilized citi
zens would like to, or should,
accept.
Yes, Mr. Schaefer, members
of the "new left", professors
and otherwise, are often in er
ror, they are often intolerant,
and are often extreme. But so
are you. And if I were forced
to choose, I would choose er
ror, intolerance, and extremism
in the service of human lives
and human standards.

I am sorry to dispell all the
excitement, but I am afraid
there is no alligator. In the in
terest of furthering the univers
ity's major purpose—the pursuit
of truth—l feel that I should
explain the source of the alleged
sightings. The beast in question
is actually a resident of Roble
Hall whose name considerations
of chivalry forbid me to men
tion. However, I can verify the
physical description given, in
light of the fact that I had a
blind date with her Saturday
night.
The description given the
Stanford officer— about five feet
tall, slimy, scaled, with large
green teeth —corresponds exact
ly to that of my companion of
the evening mentioned. It should
be considered dangerous, as it
bit me on the chest as I was at
tempting to escape after escort
ing it back to the portals of
Roble.
The beast should not be con
sidered as being entirely pernic
ious, however; it has promised
me that anyone who dates it
three weekends in a row will
learn the location of the Axe.

I am sorry to dispell all the
excitement, but I am afraid
there is no alligator. In the in
terest of furthering the univers
ity's major purpose—the pursuit
of truth—l feel that I should
explain the source of the alleged
sightings. The beast in question
is actually a resident of Roble
Hall whose name considerations
of chivalry forbid me to men
tion. However, I can verify the
physical description given, in
light of the fact that I had a
blind date with her Saturday
night.
The description given the
Stanford officer— about five feet
tall, slimy, scaled, with large
green teeth —corresponds exact
ly to that of my companion of
the evening mentioned. It should
be considered dangerous, as it
bit me on the chest as I was at
tempting to escape after escort
ing it back to the portals of
Roble.
The beast should not be con
sidered as being entirely pernic

me that anyone who dates it
three weekends in a row will
learn the location of the Axe.

May I agree entirely with
Senator Hatfield in his declaim
ing the necessity of the draft.
I believe he has stated the fun
damental fact that the U.S. is
so utterly wealthy and militari
ly superarmed that the system
does not need any of us to
carry on the slaughter. The sys
tem does not need me! It's a
joke! Here is the 22 year old
fleet footed intellectual who out
ran the Draft Board for four
years, while marching in pro
test . . . and they don't even
need me to carry on the war.
It's a joke. The sheer gargan
tuan proportion of this tragedy
is comic.
The world of Alice is the last
bastion of sanity. But Mr. John
son is the jester of the century
• . . "Lynda Bird, sweetheart, I
hate to say this but your daddy
may go down in history as the
man who started World War
III." Top that one Mr. Hatfield.
Some of us have got a funny
line, too. I won't go ... I just
won't go.

Just a few comments about
Mr. Schaefer's vitriolic column
by a grad student who is not a
disciple of, nor totally in agree
ment with, "Prof. Newleft":
1) Mr. Schaefer's democracy
— Mr. Schaefer cites disagree
ment in the Saigon government
as presaging a healthy demo
cratic future for South Vietnam.
While I might tend toward more
optimism concerning South Viet
nam for this reason also, unfor
tunately, after reading Mr.
Schaefer's column I must be a
bit more pessimistic about demo
cracy, aware of the fact that we
in this country defined demo
cracy as disagreement only
within the political elite of a
nation and did not include the
right of the individual citizen to
disagree with the political elite
(as "Prof. Newleft" disagrees).
I might suggest that one as
pect of democracy may be com
pletely antithetical to Mr.
Schaefer's way of thinking: the
right of the citizen to disagree
with his government and not be
considered a traitor. And if we
are not in Vietnam to give some
Vietnamese "Prof. Newleft" this
very right which Mr. Schaefer
would seem to want to deny
to an American "Prof. Newleft",
then what are we there for?
2) Mr. Schaefer's morality:
Mr. Schaefer states that he
doesn't know what morality is
being referred to when he hears
about the "immoral war" in
Vietnam. But certainly other
standards of morality exist than
the "my country, right or
wrong", dog-eat-dog morality
that Mr. Schaefer's letter im
plies. Perhaps the standard of
morality being referred to by
"Prof. Newleft" is the same
standard that was applied by in
ternational law and the United
States government in the Nur
emberg and Tokyo war crimes
trials.
This is not to condemn the
leaders of this country as war
criminals by analogy (I would
not support this proposition),
but merely to defend the right
of American citizens to use as
a standard of morality the same
standard used at Nuremberg and
perhaps to conclude that our
Vietnam policy and/or methods
are "immoral".
Or more simply, Mr. Schaefer,
perhaps a standard of morality
exists that would find the burn
ing of other human beings'
flesh (including many civilian
women and children) with jellied
gasoline to be "immoral". No, I
do not expect that the Marine
fighting for his life in Vietnam
to consider the use of napalm
on his adversary to be "im
moral". But neither do I think

that the morality of a soldier
in battle is the standard of
morality that all civilized citi
zens would like to, or should,
accept.
Yes, Mr. Schaefer, members
of the "new left", professors
and otherwise, are often in er
ror, they are often intolerant,
and are often extreme. But so
are you. And if I were forced
to choose, I would choose er
ror, intolerance, and extremism
in the service of human lives
and human standards.

Vietnam policy and/or methods
are "immoral".
Or more simply, Mr. Schaefer,
perhaps a standard of morality
exists that would find the burn
ing of other human beings'
flesh (including many civilian
women and children) with jellied
gasoline to be "immoral". No, I
do not expect that the Marine
fighting for his life in Vietnam
to consider the use of napalm
on his adversary to be "im
moral". But neither do I think

that the morality of a soldier
in battle is the standard of
morality that all civilized citi
zens would like to, or should,
accept.
Yes, Mr. Schaefer, members
of the "new left", professors
and otherwise, are often in er
ror, they are often intolerant,
and are often extreme. But so
are you. And if I were forced
to choose, I would choose er
ror, intolerance, and extremism
in the service of human lives
and human standards.

I am sorry to dispell all the
excitement, but I am afraid
there is no alligator. In the in
terest of furthering the univers
ity's major purpose—the pursuit
of truth—l feel that I should
explain the source of the alleged
sightings. The beast in question
is actually a resident of Roble
Hall whose name considerations
of chivalry forbid me to men
tion. However, I can verify the
physical description given, in
light of the fact that I had a
blind date with her Saturday
night.
The description given the
Stanford officer— about five feet
tall, slimy, scaled, with large
green teeth —corresponds exact
ly to that of my companion of
the evening mentioned. It should
be considered dangerous, as it
bit me on the chest as I was at
tempting to escape after escort
ing it back to the portals of
Roble.
The beast should not be con
sidered as being entirely pernic
ious, however; it has promised
me that anyone who dates it
three weekends in a row will
learn the location of the Axe.

May I agree entirely with
Senator Hatfield in his declaim
ing the necessity of the draft.
I believe he has stated the fun
damental fact that the U.S. is
so utterly wealthy and militari
ly superarmed that the system
does not need any of us to
carry on the slaughter. The sys
tem does not need me! It's a
joke! Here is the 22 year old
fleet footed intellectual who out
ran the Draft Board for four
years, while marching in pro
test . . . and they don't even
need me to carry on the war.
It's a joke. The sheer gargan
tuan proportion of this tragedy
is comic.
The world of Alice is the last
bastion of sanity. But Mr. John
son is the jester of the century
• . . "Lynda Bird, sweetheart, I
hate to say this but your daddy
may go down in history as the
man who started World War
III." Top that one Mr. Hatfield.
Some of us have got a funny
line, too. I won't go ... I just
won't go.

Just a few comments about
Mr. Schaefer's vitriolic column
by a grad student who is not a
disciple of, nor totally in agree
ment with, "Prof. Newleft":
1) Mr. Schaefer's democracy
— Mr. Schaefer cites disagree
ment in the Saigon government
as presaging a healthy demo
cratic future for South Vietnam.
While I might tend toward more
optimism concerning South Viet
nam for this reason also, unfor
tunately, after reading Mr.
Schaefer's column I must be a
bit more pessimistic about demo
cracy, aware of the fact that we
in this country defined demo
cracy as disagreement only
within the political elite of a
nation and did not include the
right of the individual citizen to
disagree with the political elite
(as "Prof. Newleft" disagrees).
I might suggest that one as
pect of democracy may be com
pletely antithetical to Mr.
Schaefer's way of thinking: the
right of the citizen to disagree
with his government and not be
considered a traitor. And if we
are not in Vietnam to give some
Vietnamese "Prof. Newleft" this
very right which Mr. Schaefer
would seem to want to deny
to an American "Prof. Newleft",
then what are we there for?
2) Mr. Schaefer's morality:
Mr. Schaefer states that he
doesn't know what morality is
being referred to when he hears
about the "immoral war" in
Vietnam. But certainly other
standards of morality exist than
the "my country, right or
wrong", dog-eat-dog morality
that Mr. Schaefer's letter im
plies. Perhaps the standard of
morality being referred to by
"Prof. Newleft" is the same
standard that was applied by in
ternational law and the United
States government in the Nur
emberg and Tokyo war crimes
trials.
This is not to condemn the
leaders of this country as war
criminals by analogy (I would
not support this proposition),
but merely to defend the right
of American citizens to use as
a standard of morality the same
standard used at Nuremberg and
perhaps to conclude that our
Vietnam policy and/or methods
are "immoral".
Or more simply, Mr. Schaefer,
perhaps a standard of morality
exists that would find the burn
ing of other human beings'
flesh (including many civilian
women and children) with jellied
gasoline to be "immoral". No, I
do not expect that the Marine
