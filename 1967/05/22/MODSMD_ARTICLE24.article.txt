# A 						Fresh Look
## Vietnam Questions Difficult To Answer 
### Roger Boescbe 
Since my arrival at Stanford
eight months ago, I have been
extensively questioning myself
on the subject of Vietnam. The
questions I have been strug
gling with have not been easy
ones, and sadly, for lack of cor
rect information, I have not
come up with enough concrete
answers.
Upon reading Tuesday's Daily
I discovered that someone else
had considered the problem, and
presumably had come up with
some satisfactory answers.
Fritz Schaefer, in speaking of
some fictional character, "Pro
fessor Newleft", has said of
him: "He makes up lists of ques
tions which he seems to think
are unanswerable by Americans
and the United States govern
ment." Not only do Mr. Schaef
er's answers seem dogmatic
and oversimplified, but he also
seems to be asking the wrong
questions.
He calls the 160 people who
signed the Anti-Draft petition
"traitors", but I must question
his definition of traitor. I had
never known a traitor to be one
who opposes the current policy
of his government. Probably
after much internal debate,
these 160 people acted in accor
dance with a principle they sub
stantiated in their minds. Al
though the decision may be
wrong, it is still courageous, for
they face perhaps five years in
prison and an unwarranted scar
on their remaining civilian life.
I do not think treason is the
best word.
A Value Judgment
Furthermore, Mr. Schaefer
claims he isn't aware of the
protesters' "moral superiority",
yet, he has passed a grave
moral judgment on anyone who
happens to disagree with him.
Mr. Schaefer, in denying others
the right to pass value judg
ments, has contradicted him
self by exercising that same
right.
In his closing paragraph he
again assumes this right, for
he asks "American men" to
stand up and tell the protestors
"where to get off". His justifi
cation is that since 500,000 sol
diers are fighting for "freedom"
in Vietnam we should support
them at Stanford by an unques
tioning defense of our nation's
siand. The implications of such
a statement are frightening. It

indicates to me that he feels
those who disagree with him
are wrong, and are not even
"American men." The further
implication is that our country
cannot be wrong, and when it
takes a stand, by sending troops
or otherwise, any good "Ameri
can" will support this stand.
Mr. Schaefer further implies
that the war is not "immoral",
but he offers no evidence to
support this claim. He only
says that the New Left is lack
ing in morality because it lies,
and consequently, it is not to
be trusted. He offers the State
Department as the exposer of
one of these lies, but how can
we trust the State Department,
if, by his own standards, anyone
who has given false information
in the past is not to be trusted.
They promised no escalation
which was followed by just that,
and they assured us of few
civilian casualities in the North,
only to admit later that there
were some "unavoidable" trage
dies.
Can All Be Wrong?
Again, he speaks of using na
palm and claims that he would
n't be too sorry if a soldier who
was trying to kill him were na
palmed. But sadly, Mr. Schaefer
has again asked himself the
wrong question. I am certain
he would be sorry if some in
nocent civilians were killed by
napalm. In fact, if my memory
doesn't fail me, the American
Medical Association claims that
approximately 9 out of 10 deaths
in Vietnam are civilian. Can
everyone who opposes Mr.
Schaefer be mistaken?
The most frightening thing
about Mr. Schaefer's stand is
the fact that when it comes to
considering the complexities and
ambiguities of the situation, Mr.
Schaefer is rather certain of
one alternative, but unwilling
to entertain many others. There
seem to be only two possibilities;
either war or a "Communist to
talitarian state".
Not only are there other pos
sibilities, but he also gives no
evidence as to why a unified
Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh

would be bad. Although it may,
in fact, be evil, it is not neces
sarily so, especially if we con
sider the suffering going on
now.
Ask These Questions
In all honesty, I want to em
phasize that am not clear on my
stand and have few concret" 1
answers to present, but I think
I have been asking myself some
probing questions. What really
annoyed me about Mr. Schaef
er's column was the fact that,
without treating any really chal
lenging questions, he seemed
sure of his stand on the entire
subject. For instance, he doesn't
ask by what right we have to
pass a value judgment on an
other person's stand. What evi
dence about the war, if any,
can we accept as valid? If one's
conscience goes against his coun
try's policy, doesn't he have the
right to follow his conscience?
What would actually result if
we fought defensively for a
few weeks and confined our
bombing to the South in an at
tempt at peace? If our position
is as clear as he implies, why
are so many countries in oppo
sition to it? Is it feasible that

democracy can even exist in
Asia considering their tradi
tions?
In short, although it may be
justifiable, on what grounds can
we justify the "necessary"
deaths, American and Vietna

mese, that are occurring every
day. Mr. Schaefer seemed to
avoid all the basic questions, and
his oversimplified answers and
dogmatic acceptance of our po
licy does not put us any closer
to understanding the problem.
