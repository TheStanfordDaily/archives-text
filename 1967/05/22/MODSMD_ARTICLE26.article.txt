# Trustee Decisions
## 
### 
The trustees' decision to allow four "demon
stration houses" as well as coeducation in
Branner Hall next year is encouraging in at
least two respects. It shows a genuine concern
for constructive educational innovation and
experimentation and also demonstrates confi
dence in the judgment of those on campus who
are working to improve Stanford's education.
The "demonstration houses" are a first step
toward the ideal of making residences the cen
ter of intellectual life and achieving a fusion
of the student's social and academic lives. At
worst, they will still provide a vast improve
ment over the sterile existence students now
lead in the concrete cell-blocks of Wilbur and
Stern.
Approval of the "demonstration houses" is
a vote of confidence for the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES), which has worked dili
gently for several weeks to prepare the first
major proposal — with the exception of off
campus housing for women — to face the test
of approval by the trustees. That they should
have accepted it without making even the
slightest change we find promising, for it in
dicates that SES will be able to continue mak
ing necessary recommendations without having
to fear that the Board will be a major obstruc
tion to innovation.
But most of all, the trustee decision should
be viewed as a green light for student initia
tive in seeking improvement at Stanford. The
Wilbur Experiment, after all, was first pro
posed by the ASSU Housing Commission, which
was created by students and included some
faculty members. The surprisingly rapid im
plementation of the "demonstration houses"
shows that students can be effective if their
purpose is serious.
The original Wilbur Experiment was to con
sist of eight "demonstration houses," but SES
changed it to include only four, mostly for
practical reasons, we are told. Hopefully, stu

dents, faculty, and administrators will work
to make the experiment a success, so that the
University can in the near future consider ex
tending the benefits of these houses to other
residences at Stanford.

The "liberalized'open house hours passed
by the trustees last week, however, are a dis
appointment. They are an improvement be
cause they include the local autonomy provi
sions of the Committee of Fifteen's recommen
dation last January; but the midnight limit
for weekends and more restrictive hours for
other evenings are a direct slap in the face to
the Committee of Fifteen, which had suggest
ed a 2:30 a.m. maximum limit for weekends
and midnight during the week. The restric
tions imposed by the new regulations again
show the ugly remnants of a tradition at Stan
ford which we had thought might be disap
pearing more rapidly.
What is more disquieting, however, is that
the social regulations enforcement procedure
in the "demonstration houses" will bypass Judi
cial Council. All violations will be considered
by house councils comprised of two tutors, the
faculty resident, and only two students. And
all appeals from the house council will go di
rectly to the Interim Judicial Board, which
consists of five faculty members appointed by
the President of the University. This is hardly
what one might consider placing the respon
sibility for enforcement of regulations with
the members of each living group.
The University should not expect overwhelm
ing student gratitude for the new hours, nor
should anyone be surprised if the next year
brings forth new demands for greater liberal
ization of open hous regulations. It is not by
making small concessions only when they are
absolutely necessary while perpetuating an
anachronism that the University will gain the
respect or confidence of the student body.

tion to innovation.
But most of all, the trustee decision should
be viewed as a green light for student initia
tive in seeking improvement at Stanford. The
Wilbur Experiment, after all, was first pro
posed by the ASSU Housing Commission, which
was created by students and included some
faculty members. The surprisingly rapid im
plementation of the "demonstration houses"
shows that students can be effective if their
purpose is serious.
The original Wilbur Experiment was to con
sist of eight "demonstration houses," but SES
changed it to include only four, mostly for
practical reasons, we are told. Hopefully, stu

dents, faculty, and administrators will work
to make the experiment a success, so that the
University can in the near future consider ex
tending the benefits of these houses to other
residences at Stanford.

The "liberalized'open house hours passed
by the trustees last week, however, are a dis
appointment. They are an improvement be
cause they include the local autonomy provi
sions of the Committee of Fifteen's recommen
dation last January; but the midnight limit
for weekends and more restrictive hours for
other evenings are a direct slap in the face to
the Committee of Fifteen, which had suggest
ed a 2:30 a.m. maximum limit for weekends
and midnight during the week. The restric
tions imposed by the new regulations again
show the ugly remnants of a tradition at Stan
ford which we had thought might be disap
pearing more rapidly.
What is more disquieting, however, is that
the social regulations enforcement procedure
in the "demonstration houses" will bypass Judi
cial Council. All violations will be considered
by house councils comprised of two tutors, the
faculty resident, and only two students. And
all appeals from the house council will go di
rectly to the Interim Judicial Board, which
consists of five faculty members appointed by
the President of the University. This is hardly
what one might consider placing the respon
sibility for enforcement of regulations with
the members of each living group.
The University should not expect overwhelm
ing student gratitude for the new hours, nor
should anyone be surprised if the next year
brings forth new demands for greater liberal
ization of open hous regulations. It is not by
making small concessions only when they are
absolutely necessary while perpetuating an
anachronism that the University will gain the
respect or confidence of the student body.
The trustees' decision to allow four "demon
stration houses" as well as coeducation in
Branner Hall next year is encouraging in at
least two respects. It shows a genuine concern
for constructive educational innovation and
experimentation and also demonstrates confi
dence in the judgment of those on campus who
are working to improve Stanford's education.
The "demonstration houses" are a first step
toward the ideal of making residences the cen
ter of intellectual life and achieving a fusion
of the student's social and academic lives. At
worst, they will still provide a vast improve
ment over the sterile existence students now
lead in the concrete cell-blocks of Wilbur and
Stern.
Approval of the "demonstration houses" is
a vote of confidence for the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES), which has worked dili
gently for several weeks to prepare the first
major proposal — with the exception of off
campus housing for women — to face the test
of approval by the trustees. That they should
have accepted it without making even the
slightest change we find promising, for it in
dicates that SES will be able to continue mak
ing necessary recommendations without having
to fear that the Board will be a major obstruc
tion to innovation.
