# Contribution To Education
## 
### 
At the beginning of winter quarter, a Daily
editorial stated, "the Grove Project will test the
limits and merits of residential education."
It seems to us that the Grove both intended
to do and has done much more than that.
If the goals of the Grove pertain only to resi
dential education narrowly defined—the inte
gration of academic life into the resident—then
it has had only limited success. Some students
are satisfied with their seminars; some are not.
Discussions from the seminars rarely carry over
into everyday conversation. The central theme
of "Development" has been only loosely ad
hered to, and some of the most successful semi
nars have been those which developed furthest
away from the central theme.
Residence seminars are, indeed, a step to
ward residential education, and it is not the
idea but the specifics that need improvement.
The Grove has shown that perhaps individu
ally structured seminars should be allowed to
develop according to the interests of the mem
bers rather than be confined to an arbitrarily
predetermined theme.
In addition, house seminars should be given
for no more than three units of credit. Present
Grove seminars are five units. Many students,
such as those in engineering or science, cannot
take on the additional load and so are pre
cluded from projects like the Grove, while stu
dents in majors with fewer requirements find
it far easier to pick up an extra course. Allow
ing more diversified students to participate in
such houses would better fulfill the purposes
of residential education.
But the Grove is much more than a resi
dence with an academic theme. Another impor
tant aspect is its coeducation. Residents and
visitors alike praise the natural atmosphere
which encourages informal relationships be
tween the sexes. Coeducation at the Grove has
produced a sense of maturity and responsi
bility, a social cohesiveness, and a deeper aware
ness of what it means to live with other people.
For despite accusations that the Grove has
created a hyper-intellectual atmosphere, the em
phasis there is not on ideas but on interperson
al relationships. Members stress that the Grove
means learning to live with other people. It is
a paradox that of all the residences at Stanford
the Grove should be singled out because it is

doing just what a residence should. The dor
mitory or house where students go to sleep and
to grab a hurried meal is hardly a real resi
dence; only a house in which the members
really learn to live and work together can be
called a residence. Yet when one group of
people manages to do this it is considered the
exception, when it should be the rule.
It is true that the Grove has had exceptional
circumstances in which to organize a living
group. The physical facilities of the Phi Delt
house have contributed greatly to the comfort
of the group. Yet others have had similar fa
cilities — the Phi Delts, for example — and
have not been noted for their achievements
either in deepening interpersonal relationships
or in contributing to the University. The Grove
obviously has something going for it besides
a good location. Whether it would have been
as much a success in less desirable surround
ings is another question, one which may be
answered by the experience of next year's
"demonstration houses".
The proliferation of Grove-type residences
may also answer another question: how much
of the Grove s success can be attributed to its
uniqueness. That it was an experiment, that
it was closely watched by the administration
and the community all year, that many nights
at dinner there were more guests than mem
bers, contributed to the atmosphere of the
house. Some students feel this insured its uni
queness; others say it made their house less of
a home. But because the emphasis in the Grove
was on relationships within the house rather
than to the community, it might succeed even
better without this "fishbowl" treatment.
The Grove has shown that a group of stu
dents, given responsibility for constructing an
academic and social life, can do an admirable
job — that the responsibility they exercise is
commensurate with the responsibility they are
given. It is regrettable that the faculty mem
bers who signed up promising to associate with
the house have for the most part failed; the
contribution they could have made is unful
filled.
Despite its shortcomings, the Grove has
shown that a real residence, academic and
personal, is possible. We hope that Stanford,
in assessing its limitations, will not obscure the
contributions it has made towards education.

of the group. Yet others have had similar fa
cilities — the Phi Delts, for example — and
have not been noted for their achievements
either in deepening interpersonal relationships
or in contributing to the University. The Grove
obviously has something going for it besides
a good location. Whether it would have been
as much a success in less desirable surround
ings is another question, one which may be
answered by the experience of next year's
"demonstration houses".
The proliferation of Grove-type residences
may also answer another question: how much
of the Grove s success can be attributed to its
uniqueness. That it was an experiment, that
it was closely watched by the administration
and the community all year, that many nights
at dinner there were more guests than mem
bers, contributed to the atmosphere of the
house. Some students feel this insured its uni
queness; others say it made their house less of
a home. But because the emphasis in the Grove
was on relationships within the house rather
than to the community, it might succeed even
better without this "fishbowl" treatment.
The Grove has shown that a group of stu
dents, given responsibility for constructing an
academic and social life, can do an admirable
job — that the responsibility they exercise is
commensurate with the responsibility they are
given. It is regrettable that the faculty mem
bers who signed up promising to associate with
the house have for the most part failed; the
contribution they could have made is unful
filled.
Despite its shortcomings, the Grove has
shown that a real residence, academic and
personal, is possible. We hope that Stanford,
in assessing its limitations, will not obscure the
contributions it has made towards education.
At the beginning of winter quarter, a Daily
editorial stated, "the Grove Project will test the
limits and merits of residential education."
It seems to us that the Grove both intended
to do and has done much more than that.
If the goals of the Grove pertain only to resi
dential education narrowly defined—the inte
gration of academic life into the resident—then
it has had only limited success. Some students
are satisfied with their seminars; some are not.
Discussions from the seminars rarely carry over
into everyday conversation. The central theme
of "Development" has been only loosely ad
hered to, and some of the most successful semi
nars have been those which developed furthest
away from the central theme.
Residence seminars are, indeed, a step to
ward residential education, and it is not the
idea but the specifics that need improvement.
The Grove has shown that perhaps individu
ally structured seminars should be allowed to
develop according to the interests of the mem
bers rather than be confined to an arbitrarily
predetermined theme.
In addition, house seminars should be given
for no more than three units of credit. Present
Grove seminars are five units. Many students,
such as those in engineering or science, cannot
take on the additional load and so are pre
cluded from projects like the Grove, while stu
dents in majors with fewer requirements find
it far easier to pick up an extra course. Allow
ing more diversified students to participate in
such houses would better fulfill the purposes
of residential education.
But the Grove is much more than a resi
dence with an academic theme. Another impor
tant aspect is its coeducation. Residents and
visitors alike praise the natural atmosphere
which encourages informal relationships be
tween the sexes. Coeducation at the Grove has
produced a sense of maturity and responsi
bility, a social cohesiveness, and a deeper aware
ness of what it means to live with other people.
For despite accusations that the Grove has
created a hyper-intellectual atmosphere, the em
phasis there is not on ideas but on interperson
al relationships. Members stress that the Grove
means learning to live with other people. It is
a paradox that of all the residences at Stanford
the Grove should be singled out because it is

doing just what a residence should. The dor
mitory or house where students go to sleep and
to grab a hurried meal is hardly a real resi
dence; only a house in which the members
really learn to live and work together can be
called a residence. Yet when one group of
people manages to do this it is considered the
exception, when it should be the rule.
It is true that the Grove has had exceptional
circumstances in which to organize a living
group. The physical facilities of the Phi Delt
house have contributed greatly to the comfort
of the group. Yet others have had similar fa
