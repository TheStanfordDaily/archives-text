## Preventing Change Requires Planning 
### Bob Fishman 
"It's not true that times are
changing," said a member of the
Class of '17 at the Alumni Con
ference. "They only change if
you let them."
I do not claim that every ad
ministrator carries these words
on a plastic-encased card in his
wallet. I suspect, however, that
they do.
To offer evidence for my sus
picions, I humbly submit the
never-before disclosed minutes
of a secret administration meet
ing held ten years ago. I stum
bled across this document rec
ently while prowling through
the garbage can in the back of
Building 10.
Presiding at the meeting was
Dean Friendly, famous for his
crew-cut, his bright smile and
his well-concealed paunch. At
the meeting, hewever, he was
not smiling.
Unwelcome News
"I have bad news for all of
us," he announced gravely. "The
Ford Foundation has just given
us $25,000,000 to improve the
quality of student life."
Cries of "The horror! The hor
ror!" filled the room.
But that means change," the
Assistant Dean moaned.
"Don't leap to conclusions,
Smedley," the Dean shot back.
"Why do you think we're here?
We need constructive, imagina
tive suggestions for dissipating
the money."
Immediately, all hands shot
up. First to speak was the Un
ion Director.
Ways To Waste Money
"I think we should build a
new Union. I can see it now: just
like a huge motel. The cafeteria
will be big and noisy, the film
rooms unequipped to show
movies, and the lounges simply
uninhabitable!"
Next on the agenda was the
man from the Athletics Office.
"Nothing is more irrelevant to
education than big-time intercol
legiate athletics," he said proud
ly. "I propose, therefore, that
we build a new basketball

pavilion with triple the seating
capacity of the old one. That
should soak up $2,000,000 at
least. And it could be the nu
cleus for a whole new athletic
activities center."
The expert on libraries then
rose to speak.
Library Not For Study
"I propose an Undergraduate
Library. It will not have a single
book that the Main Library does
not have already. The building
will be cavernous and open so
that sound can carry easily.
Don't worry about the students
studying too much: at the Un
dergraduate Library they won't
be able to study at all."
The man from the Housing
Office spoke next.
"Although all campus hous
ing is in need of improvement,
it seems to me that we should
build new houses only for the
fraternities. They're the only
group we can count on not to
improve the quality of student
life. So, we'll build three beauti
ful new fraternity clusters, and
nothing for anybody else. But if
the Stern men complain too
much, we'll build them four
more houses—just like the old
ones. And if that doesn't shut
them up, we'll carpet the halls."
Trouble With Applicants
Dean Friendly then inter
rupted with a question for the
man from the Admissions Office.
"I understand that we've been
getting a lot more applicants
who are bright, creative, inquisi
tive, unapathetic and open to
new ideas. Troublemakers, in
other words.'
"Don't worry about us," the
Admissions man assured him.
"We're so smart we don't even
need a quota system. We have
something better we call 'per
sonal' qualifications."
Dean Friendly was satisfied:
he smiled his famous smile.
"With innovations like these,"
he announced, "we can expect
no change in the quality of stu
dent life whatsoever. And that's
what I call planning ahead."
"It's not true that times are

on a plastic-encased card in his
wallet. I suspect, however, that
they do.
To offer evidence for my sus
picions, I humbly submit the
never-before disclosed minutes
of a secret administration meet
ing held ten years ago. I stum
bled across this document rec
ently while prowling through
the garbage can in the back of
Building 10.
Presiding at the meeting was
Dean Friendly, famous for his
crew-cut, his bright smile and
his well-concealed paunch. At
the meeting, hewever, he was
not smiling.
Unwelcome News
"I have bad news for all of
us," he announced gravely. "The
Ford Foundation has just given
us $25,000,000 to improve the
quality of student life."
Cries of "The horror! The hor
ror!" filled the room.
But that means change," the
Assistant Dean moaned.
"Don't leap to conclusions,
Smedley," the Dean shot back.
"Why do you think we're here?
We need constructive, imagina
tive suggestions for dissipating
the money."
Immediately, all hands shot
up. First to speak was the Un
ion Director.
Ways To Waste Money
"I think we should build a
new Union. I can see it now: just
like a huge motel. The cafeteria
will be big and noisy, the film
rooms unequipped to show
movies, and the lounges simply
uninhabitable!"
Next on the agenda was the
man from the Athletics Office.
"Nothing is more irrelevant to
education than big-time intercol
legiate athletics," he said proud
ly. "I propose, therefore, that
we build a new basketball

pavilion with triple the seating
capacity of the old one. That
should soak up $2,000,000 at
least. And it could be the nu
cleus for a whole new athletic
activities center."
The expert on libraries then
rose to speak.
Library Not For Study
"I propose an Undergraduate
Library. It will not have a single
book that the Main Library does
not have already. The building
will be cavernous and open so
that sound can carry easily.
Don't worry about the students
studying too much: at the Un
dergraduate Library they won't
be able to study at all."
The man from the Housing
Office spoke next.
"Although all campus hous
ing is in need of improvement,
it seems to me that we should
build new houses only for the
fraternities. They're the only
group we can count on not to
improve the quality of student
life. So, we'll build three beauti
ful new fraternity clusters, and
nothing for anybody else. But if
the Stern men complain too
much, we'll build them four
more houses—just like the old
ones. And if that doesn't shut
them up, we'll carpet the halls."
Trouble With Applicants
Dean Friendly then inter
rupted with a question for the
man from the Admissions Office.
"I understand that we've been
getting a lot more applicants
who are bright, creative, inquisi
tive, unapathetic and open to
new ideas. Troublemakers, in
other words.'
"Don't worry about us," the
Admissions man assured him.
"We're so smart we don't even
need a quota system. We have
something better we call 'per
sonal' qualifications."
Dean Friendly was satisfied:
he smiled his famous smile.
"With innovations like these,"
he announced, "we can expect
no change in the quality of stu
dent life whatsoever. And that's
what I call planning ahead."
"It's not true that times are
changing," said a member of the
Class of '17 at the Alumni Con
ference. "They only change if
you let them."
I do not claim that every ad
ministrator carries these words
on a plastic-encased card in his
wallet. I suspect, however, that
they do.
