# Letters To The Editor
## Poll-Worker Denies Any Irregularities 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Gerry and Miss Bader in
their letter in Thursday's Daily
seemed to overlook one most
important point. There is only
one sufficient reason for invali
dating the results of the elec
tion: that irregularities were
found in the conduct of the poll
workers, or on the parts of the
candidates, or on the part of the
campaign workers.
The Judicial Council did not
attempt to contact voters or poll
workers to determine if irregu
larities did take place. Though
in their letter they leave the
implication that irregularities
were found, the fact is that the
Council found that Mr. Fogel
man's charges were without
basis and that no irregularities
occurred at the polls.
If the Council has invalidated
this election simply for the pur
pose of slapping Mr. Berry's
hand for not following their
wishes, they have done this in
complete disregard for judicial
process. If the Council's quarrel
is with Mr. Berry, he should pay
the consequences. The Council
is doing this community the
greatest disservice in their im
plicit allegations against Mr.
Tom and Mr, Horowitz.

Editor, The Daily:
It seems that the Judicial
Council has taken the unprece
dented action in declaring the
past Senior Class election in
valid. Their basis for voiding the
election was that the polls were
not manned by student police
the first day of elections.
Never before have the polls
been controlled by student
police. Does this mean that all
elections prior to this one were
invalid? Since the Council has
made their decision, be it right
or wrong, there seems no re
course to action, but to hold
another election.
We would like to urge all stu
dents, especially the juniors, to
return to the polls and show the
Council that the election wasn't
invalid. We have already elected
Soleng Tom and Jere Horowitz
once. We urge that the Class of
1968 do it again.

Editor, The Daily:
I'm disturbed! Last nioht, a

group of men from a fraternity
which will remain anonymous
entered our house at Wilbur, in
tent on "capturing" the presi
dent of their pledge class, who
also happens to be president of
our house, Soto. Pie had initiated
the "pledge sneak" against the
actives, and this was their man
ner of retaliation.
The men who attempted to
bring about the "capture" com
pletely disrupted our house,
showed discourtesy to the wife
of our faculty resident, went
through all the personal belong
ings of the pledge involved, took
his girl-friend captive, and had
to be restrained by members of
our house, including a sponsor,
whom they termed "a turkey".
All in all the actions of these
people were reminiscent of jun
ior high school. In a similar inci
dent in our house the same
night, but with a different fra
ternity, a pledge had pickle
relish poured all over him and
his bed at three o'clock in the
morning.
When these types of things be
come a common occurrence, as
they are, I think it is time to
question their validity and/or
worth. If the purpose of the
"pledge sneak" is to get the
pledge class to work together
as a group, why not do some
thing constructive, such as work
ing with the kids from East Palo
Alto, as the Phi Psi pledges
have.
In addition, speaking for Soto
House, I would like to say that
the campus apathy over the loss
of the Axe is shared by the men
of Soto.

One of the pictures of the
Stanford Crew in yesterday's
Daily shows "sophomore cox
swain Jim Haley" being thrown
into the drink alter "stroking"
the Stanford Varsity to victory
over Cal. The Daily caption
writer has confused the posi
tions of the stroke (who rows
the strokes) and the coxswain
(who simply yells the stroke).
Although I have the greatest ad
miration for Mr. Haley's abilities
as a stroke, as a coxswain he is
as yet untested. To do both is
beyond the scope of the ordi
nary mortal. The gentleman be
ing dunkod is none other than
myself. The water was quite re

One of the pictures of the
Stanford Crew in yesterday's
Daily shows "sophomore cox
swain Jim Haley" being thrown
into the drink alter "stroking"
the Stanford Varsity to victory
over Cal. The Daily caption
writer has confused the posi
tions of the stroke (who rows
the strokes) and the coxswain
(who simply yells the stroke).
Although I have the greatest ad
miration for Mr. Haley's abilities
as a stroke, as a coxswain he is
as yet untested. To do both is
beyond the scope of the ordi
nary mortal. The gentleman be

Mr. Gerry and Miss Bader in
their letter in Thursday's Daily
seemed to overlook one most
important point. There is only
one sufficient reason for invali
dating the results of the elec
tion: that irregularities were
found in the conduct of the poll
workers, or on the parts of the
candidates, or on the part of the
campaign workers.
The Judicial Council did not
attempt to contact voters or poll
workers to determine if irregu
larities did take place. Though
in their letter they leave the
implication that irregularities
were found, the fact is that the
Council found that Mr. Fogel
man's charges were without
basis and that no irregularities
occurred at the polls.
If the Council has invalidated
this election simply for the pur
pose of slapping Mr. Berry's
hand for not following their
wishes, they have done this in
complete disregard for judicial
process. If the Council's quarrel
is with Mr. Berry, he should pay
the consequences. The Council
is doing this community the
greatest disservice in their im
plicit allegations against Mr.
Tom and Mr, Horowitz.

It seems that the Judicial
Council has taken the unprece
dented action in declaring the
past Senior Class election in
valid. Their basis for voiding the
election was that the polls were
not manned by student police
the first day of elections.
Never before have the polls
been controlled by student
police. Does this mean that all
elections prior to this one were
invalid? Since the Council has
made their decision, be it right
or wrong, there seems no re
course to action, but to hold
another election.
We would like to urge all stu
dents, especially the juniors, to
return to the polls and show the
Council that the election wasn't
invalid. We have already elected
Soleng Tom and Jere Horowitz
once. We urge that the Class of
1968 do it again.

Editor, The Daily:
I'm disturbed! Last nioht, a

group of men from a fraternity
which will remain anonymous
entered our house at Wilbur, in
tent on "capturing" the presi
dent of their pledge class, who
also happens to be president of
our house, Soto. Pie had initiated
the "pledge sneak" against the
actives, and this was their man
ner of retaliation.
The men who attempted to
bring about the "capture" com
pletely disrupted our house,
showed discourtesy to the wife
of our faculty resident, went
through all the personal belong
ings of the pledge involved, took
his girl-friend captive, and had
to be restrained by members of
our house, including a sponsor,
whom they termed "a turkey".
All in all the actions of these
people were reminiscent of jun
ior high school. In a similar inci
dent in our house the same
night, but with a different fra
ternity, a pledge had pickle
relish poured all over him and
his bed at three o'clock in the
morning.
When these types of things be
come a common occurrence, as
they are, I think it is time to
question their validity and/or
worth. If the purpose of the
"pledge sneak" is to get the
pledge class to work together
as a group, why not do some

actives, and this was their man
ner of retaliation.
The men who attempted to
bring about the "capture" com
pletely disrupted our house,
showed discourtesy to the wife
of our faculty resident, went
through all the personal belong
ings of the pledge involved, took
his girl-friend captive, and had
to be restrained by members of
our house, including a sponsor,
whom they termed "a turkey".
All in all the actions of these
people were reminiscent of jun
ior high school. In a similar inci
dent in our house the same
night, but with a different fra
ternity, a pledge had pickle
relish poured all over him and
his bed at three o'clock in the
morning.
When these types of things be
come a common occurrence, as
they are, I think it is time to
question their validity and/or
worth. If the purpose of the
"pledge sneak" is to get the
pledge class to work together
as a group, why not do some
thing constructive, such as work
ing with the kids from East Palo
Alto, as the Phi Psi pledges
have.
In addition, speaking for Soto
House, I would like to say that
the campus apathy over the loss
of the Axe is shared by the men
of Soto.

Editor, The Daily:
One of the pictures of the
Stanford Crew in yesterday's
Daily shows "sophomore cox
swain Jim Haley" being thrown
into the drink alter "stroking"
the Stanford Varsity to victory
over Cal. The Daily caption
writer has confused the posi
tions of the stroke (who rows
the strokes) and the coxswain
(who simply yells the stroke).
Although I have the greatest ad
miration for Mr. Haley's abilities
as a stroke, as a coxswain he is
as yet untested. To do both is
beyond the scope of the ordi
nary mortal. The gentleman be
ing dunkod is none other than
myself. The water was quite re
freshing and completely free of
crocodiles.
