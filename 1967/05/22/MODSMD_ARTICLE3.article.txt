## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The Violations Investigation Com
mittee of the Education Commission
last night dismissed allegations made
by Senior Class Presidential candi
date Mark Fogelman against his op
ponents—Soleng Tom and Jere Hor
witz—and The Daily.
The allegations were contained in a
campaign sheet distributed on cam
pus by Fogelman. They included the
charge that Horwitz had phoned Rob
in Wiseman, Fogelman's running
mate, and told her that "the cam
paign would be a dirty one and that
extensive countercharges would be
filed."
Horwitz claimed that this was not
true and that Fogelman's campaign
sheet had damaged his reputation. The
committee found that "Fogelman pub
lished the statement without due con
cern regarding the truth."
In ascertaining what actually hap
pened, the committee found that "Hor
witz did call Miss Wiseman; Miss
Wiseman was left with the impres
sion that the would be a
rough (hard-fought) but honestly con
ducted one; Miss Wiseman communi
cated to Mr. Fogelman that Mr. Hor
witz said that the campaign would be
a "dirty" campaign; Mr. Fogelman
then recorded the conversation in his

campaign sheet and published it
against the advice and over the pro
test of Miss Wiseman."
Fogelman Apologized
Fogelman concurred with these
findings and apologized to Horwitz,
He also stated that he would remove
the campaign sheets from public dis
play within 24 hours.
The committee dismissed for lack
of evidence Fogelman's other allega
tions against Tom, Horwitz and The
Daily. Fogelman had charged that
his campaign was hurt by the fact
that some of his campaign posters
were torn down, that Tom received
more than his share of coverage in
The Daily, and that Tom's campaign
insignia—and orange dot—was posted
in unauthorized places.
The committee found "insufficient
evidence to prove collusion between
The Daily and the candidate in ques
tion (Tom) . . . , no evidence of any
design to injure Mr. Fogelman . . . ,
(and) nc evidence to show that either
Mr. Tom or Mr. Horwitz was in any
way related to the tearing down of
campaign posters" or the unauthorized
posting of orange dots.
Committee Chairman Martin Gerry
pointed out that although circum
stances seemed to have worked
against Fogelman, this was not proof
of election rules violations.

true and that Fogelman's campaign
sheet had damaged his reputation. The
committee found that "Fogelman pub
lished the statement without due con
cern regarding the truth."
In ascertaining what actually hap
pened, the committee found that "Hor
witz did call Miss Wiseman; Miss
Wiseman was left with the impres
sion that the would be a
rough (hard-fought) but honestly con
ducted one; Miss Wiseman communi
cated to Mr. Fogelman that Mr. Hor
witz said that the campaign would be
a "dirty" campaign; Mr. Fogelman
then recorded the conversation in his

campaign sheet and published it
against the advice and over the pro
test of Miss Wiseman."
Fogelman Apologized
Fogelman concurred with these
findings and apologized to Horwitz,
He also stated that he would remove
the campaign sheets from public dis
play within 24 hours.
The committee dismissed for lack
of evidence Fogelman's other allega
tions against Tom, Horwitz and The
Daily. Fogelman had charged that
his campaign was hurt by the fact
that some of his campaign posters
were torn down, that Tom received
more than his share of coverage in
The Daily, and that Tom's campaign
insignia—and orange dot—was posted
in unauthorized places.
The committee found "insufficient
evidence to prove collusion between
The Daily and the candidate in ques
tion (Tom) . . . , no evidence of any
design to injure Mr. Fogelman . . . ,
(and) nc evidence to show that either
Mr. Tom or Mr. Horwitz was in any
way related to the tearing down of
campaign posters" or the unauthorized
posting of orange dots.
Committee Chairman Martin Gerry
pointed out that although circum
stances seemed to have worked
against Fogelman, this was not proof
of election rules violations.
