# Spring Sing Amusement: LSD Parody, Miniskirts
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
A large and rather enthusiastic
crowd attended three hours and five
minutes of Spring Sing yesterday
evening in the Frost Amphitheatre.
Campus dignitaries, such as Rev. Na
pier, the Head Yell Leader, Barbara
Dray (Assistant to the Dean of Stu
dents), Sue Bailey and Prince Light
foot presided over Evensong.
All the aforementioned dignitaries
except Lightfoot evaluated the 'dit
ties', twelve in number, varied in
quality, which eating and living
groups all over the Farm sang to us.
The show began with the decline
of twilight. A friendly but not infre
quently tedious M.C. first introduced
The Business School, a singing "Ma
dame Jeanette." They failed to fea
ture in the prize stakes, though the
appearance of two shaggy black mon
grels and a spotty white bitch from
the verdant Stanford shrubbery
caused considerable audience 'involve
ment.'
Trip Number
Next Roth/Kappa Sigma (subse
quent prize-winners) did "The Stan
ford Trip." They offered an LSD
parody, and a couple of good jokes.
Viz: "A number from that great mo
tion-picture by Wally starring Victor
Mature." Or: "One pill makes you
larger; one pill makes you smaller;
and the one the health service gives
you . .
Next the M.C., in between murmurs
of "Okay", declared that Spring
Sing is not run by The Daily/Beta
Chi/Grove House combine. (Groans
of hebetude: "Yeah", etc.)
Lathrop House cooed their way to
a prize with "The Exchange Song."
Most sexual of the female choirs,
they gambolled in luminous off-pink
stockings, yellow miniskirts and pink
diamonds betwixt their breasts.

Fourth came El Campo/J ordan
with their winning "The 59th Red
Tile Roof." They should be told that,
chorally no less than musically,
snapping fingers are about as pleas
ing as the assault of a castrated alli
gator. However, employing balloons,
girls' buttocks and naive political
satire, they were typical succeeders
of the 1967 Sing.
Los Arcos and Roble, whom I per
sonally liked best (speaking as En
tertainment Editor of The Daily, a
figure erroneously advertised on the
back of the official program as "An
dy Wilson") sang a farrago of "Rain"
and other pops.
Although many of their words
were drowned by laughter and ap
plause, one caught: "I wasn't paying
$3,000 a year for that kind of non
sex." And a catchy enough number:
"Tip toe through the Napalm with
me . .
Sixth came (saw and spielen) Stan
ford in Gemany "Ecs Vee I." I quote
the anonymous compere (of "Okay"
fame but dubious linguistic prepara
tion.) One of their verses might have
been plagiarised from the Student
Prince.
El Toro got the seventh and ulti
mate ("Sweepstake") prize for their
delicious rendering of "Don't Medley
With You Roomate." (Sic) Useful
lyrics like: "All the dollies lived so
far away; Used to have to go to San
Jose; try to remember our kind of
September; with girls removed and
chances slender; when three weeks
notice you had to send her."
About Branner, who won the ma
jor prize ("Women under 40") there
is little to say beyond the compere's
"The obvious comment is to thank
the one girl who was brave enough
to come without a mask." Of course
only one Branner girl in the choir

had in fact worn a face concealer.
This got the loudest and most sus
tained audience 'involvement' of the
show.
Kappa Alpha came through ninth
with "The Sound of Money." To them
"okay" muttered "I liked you guys
better when you had Carol Doda."

Theta Delta Chi and Durand were
antipenultimate with "Stanford U"
Beta Chi/Adelpha were (and are)
nameless in their choice of title for
a number based on marijuana smok
ing.
Muir, Granada and Eucalypto
wound up the night with their ren
dering of "Guys and Dolls." "I'm as

hearty as Kansas in August."
Lightfoot told a suspiciously Pla
tonic Indian myth about light and
darkness; then we sang the Campus
hymn. As most of the thinking mem
bers of the audience had by now
burnt their program, they appeared
to have no way of knowing the
words to Stanford Hymn.

appearance of two shaggy black mon
grels and a spotty white bitch from
the verdant Stanford shrubbery
caused considerable audience 'involve
ment.'
Trip Number
Next Roth/Kappa Sigma (subse
quent prize-winners) did "The Stan
ford Trip." They offered an LSD
parody, and a couple of good jokes.
Viz: "A number from that great mo
tion-picture by Wally starring Victor
Mature." Or: "One pill makes you
larger; one pill makes you smaller;
and the one the health service gives
you . .
Next the M.C., in between murmurs
of "Okay", declared that Spring
Sing is not run by The Daily/Beta
Chi/Grove House combine. (Groans
of hebetude: "Yeah", etc.)
Lathrop House cooed their way to
a prize with "The Exchange Song."
Most sexual of the female choirs,
they gambolled in luminous off-pink
stockings, yellow miniskirts and pink
diamonds betwixt their breasts.

Fourth came El Campo/J ordan
with their winning "The 59th Red
Tile Roof." They should be told that,
chorally no less than musically,
snapping fingers are about as pleas
ing as the assault of a castrated alli
gator. However, employing balloons,
girls' buttocks and naive political
satire, they were typical succeeders
of the 1967 Sing.
Los Arcos and Roble, whom I per
sonally liked best (speaking as En
tertainment Editor of The Daily, a
figure erroneously advertised on the
back of the official program as "An
dy Wilson") sang a farrago of "Rain"
and other pops.
Although many of their words
were drowned by laughter and ap
plause, one caught: "I wasn't paying
$3,000 a year for that kind of non
sex." And a catchy enough number:
"Tip toe through the Napalm with
me . .
Sixth came (saw and spielen) Stan
ford in Gemany "Ecs Vee I." I quote
the anonymous compere (of "Okay"
fame but dubious linguistic prepara
tion.) One of their verses might have
been plagiarised from the Student
Prince.
El Toro got the seventh and ulti
mate ("Sweepstake") prize for their
delicious rendering of "Don't Medley
With You Roomate." (Sic) Useful
lyrics like: "All the dollies lived so
far away; Used to have to go to San
Jose; try to remember our kind of
September; with girls removed and
chances slender; when three weeks
notice you had to send her."
About Branner, who won the ma
jor prize ("Women under 40") there
is little to say beyond the compere's
"The obvious comment is to thank
the one girl who was brave enough
to come without a mask." Of course
only one Branner girl in the choir

had in fact worn a face concealer.
This got the loudest and most sus
tained audience 'involvement' of the
show.
Kappa Alpha came through ninth
with "The Sound of Money." To them
"okay" muttered "I liked you guys
better when you had Carol Doda."

Theta Delta Chi and Durand were
antipenultimate with "Stanford U"
Beta Chi/Adelpha were (and are)
nameless in their choice of title for
a number based on marijuana smok
ing.
Muir, Granada and Eucalypto
wound up the night with their ren
dering of "Guys and Dolls." "I'm as

hearty as Kansas in August."
Lightfoot told a suspiciously Pla
tonic Indian myth about light and
darkness; then we sang the Campus
hymn. As most of the thinking mem
bers of the audience had by now
burnt their program, they appeared
to have no way of knowing the
words to Stanford Hymn.
A large and rather enthusiastic
crowd attended three hours and five
minutes of Spring Sing yesterday
evening in the Frost Amphitheatre.
Campus dignitaries, such as Rev. Na
pier, the Head Yell Leader, Barbara
Dray (Assistant to the Dean of Stu
dents), Sue Bailey and Prince Light
foot presided over Evensong.
All the aforementioned dignitaries
except Lightfoot evaluated the 'dit
ties', twelve in number, varied in
quality, which eating and living
groups all over the Farm sang to us.
The show began with the decline
of twilight. A friendly but not infre
quently tedious M.C. first introduced
The Business School, a singing "Ma
dame Jeanette." They failed to fea
ture in the prize stakes, though the
appearance of two shaggy black mon
grels and a spotty white bitch from
the verdant Stanford shrubbery
caused considerable audience 'involve
