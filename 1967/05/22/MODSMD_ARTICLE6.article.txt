# IJB Overrules Sapir Decision, Interprets Fun Stan Violations
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
In a decision which overruled Ju
dicial Council's acquittal of Marc
Sapir, the Interim Judicial Board
(IJB) has ruled that "the violation
of University law, policy and regula
tions is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard."
Acting upon an appeal by the Uni
versity in response to the Council's
decision of last February, IJB has
ruled:
• Sapir's conduct constituted a vio
lation of the Fundamental Standard.
• The Student Judicial Council has

the responsibility to enforce Univers
ity policy not in conflict with ASSU
Constitution and By-Laws.
Spring Protest
Sapir, a medical student, partici
pated in the 50-hour sit-in in President
Wallace Sterling's office last May to
protest administration of the Selective
Service test. Sapir was not a regis
tered student at the time.
Last spring the Judicial Council
found the other 34 demonstrators
guilty of Fundamental Standard vio
lations, claiming they failed to ex
haust all possible channels of com
munication with the University ad
ministration.
The ASSU By-Laws state that the
constitution and By-Laws "Shall be
controlling in ASSU judicial proceed
ings" in the event that "University
policy and the ASSU Constitution
and By-Laws conflict." The Council,
upon acquitting Sapir in February,
did not reach the question of enforce
ment of University policy in the event
of no conflict with ASSU By-Laws.
The IJB decision interprets the By-
Laws to imply that the "ASSU Judi
cial Councils are not competent to
enforce University policy and regula
tions, the violations of which are
not contrary to the Fundamental
Standard."
Refuting this implication, the IJB
asserts that "the issue whether the
Council has the responsibility to en
force University policy when its vio
lation does not amount to a violation
of the Fundamental Standard does not
exist."

Council member Judy Bader, re
ferring to the composition of IJB,
questioned "the right of persons to
enforce regulations when they are
not subject to those regulations." The
IJB is composed of five professors,
all of whom are appointed directly by
the president. The rulings in cases
considered by IJB are final, unless
overruled by the president himself.
Marc Sapir yesterday said, "One
finds it difficult to see how the board
(IJB) appointed by the president
would go against the president's ap
peal."
The IJB decision further requested
that Judicial Council set a penalty
for Sapir "no later than May 23,1967."
Sapir said that he would abide by
the penalty set, but felt that it should
be set by the University, not Judicial
Council.
"This decision makes In loco paren
tis explicit," Sapir said. "The Judicial
Council must enforce University
rules regardless of whether students
have a part in making those rules.
It makes it impossible for an equit
able student judicial system to exist."
After last spring's sit-in, Sapir and
Alan Traister, who also was not a
registered student at that time, re
quested that they be tried with the
other 34 demonstrators, but the ad
ministration did not include their
names on the list submitted to Judi
cial Council. Upon returning to school
last fall, Sapir was informed by then
Dean of Students Donald H. Winbig
ler that his case would be prosecuted.

Judicial Council refused to hear the
Traister case last fall, and stated
that it appeared his case did not fall
within their jurisdiction since he was
not registered at the time of the in
cident.
The case was then referred to IJB
at the request of Dean of Students
Joel P. Smith. IJB found Traister
guilty of violating the Fundamental
Standard and also insured the Judi
cial Council the power to consider
similar cases.
Death of Fun Stan
Sapir refused to attend his Judicial
Council hearing in January on the
grounds that both the Council and
the administration lacked jurisdiction
over his conduct as a non-student. He
also stated that he found the Funda
mental Standard to be "self-contra
dicting" in principle since it is ap
plicable only to a certain segment of
the University (students) and ex
empts the groups by which it is "be
ing freely applied" (administrators)."
The Sapir case has also caused con
flict at the medical school in regard
to jurisdiction over student conduct.
Some members of the Medical School
faculty had suggested that the school
have its own judicial system, as does
the Law Softool.
"The Fundamental Standard is dead.
It did not die a natural death; it was
bludgeoned to death by bureaucratic
stupidity." So stated Council member
Dan Lewis last night.
The Council will meet tonight with
the Dean of Students to discuss the
IJB decision.

last fall, Sapir was informed by then
Dean of Students Donald H. Winbig
ler that his case would be prosecuted.

Judicial Council refused to hear the
Traister case last fall, and stated
that it appeared his case did not fall
within their jurisdiction since he was
not registered at the time of the in
cident.
The case was then referred to IJB
at the request of Dean of Students
Joel P. Smith. IJB found Traister
guilty of violating the Fundamental
Standard and also insured the Judi
cial Council the power to consider
similar cases.
Death of Fun Stan
Sapir refused to attend his Judicial
Council hearing in January on the
grounds that both the Council and
the administration lacked jurisdiction
over his conduct as a non-student. He
also stated that he found the Funda
mental Standard to be "self-contra
dicting" in principle since it is ap
plicable only to a certain segment of
the University (students) and ex
empts the groups by which it is "be
ing freely applied" (administrators)."
The Sapir case has also caused con
flict at the medical school in regard
to jurisdiction over student conduct.
Some members of the Medical School
faculty had suggested that the school
have its own judicial system, as does
the Law Softool.
"The Fundamental Standard is dead.
It did not die a natural death; it was
bludgeoned to death by bureaucratic
stupidity." So stated Council member
Dan Lewis last night.
The Council will meet tonight with
the Dean of Students to discuss the
IJB decision.
In a decision which overruled Ju
dicial Council's acquittal of Marc
Sapir, the Interim Judicial Board
(IJB) has ruled that "the violation
of University law, policy and regula
tions is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard."
Acting upon an appeal by the Uni
versity in response to the Council's
decision of last February, IJB has
ruled:
• Sapir's conduct constituted a vio
lation of the Fundamental Standard.
• The Student Judicial Council has

the responsibility to enforce Univers
ity policy not in conflict with ASSU
Constitution and By-Laws.
Spring Protest
Sapir, a medical student, partici
pated in the 50-hour sit-in in President
Wallace Sterling's office last May to
protest administration of the Selective
Service test. Sapir was not a regis
tered student at the time.
Last spring the Judicial Council
found the other 34 demonstrators
guilty of Fundamental Standard vio
lations, claiming they failed to ex
haust all possible channels of com
munication with the University ad
ministration.
The ASSU By-Laws state that the
constitution and By-Laws "Shall be
controlling in ASSU judicial proceed
ings" in the event that "University
policy and the ASSU Constitution
and By-Laws conflict." The Council,
upon acquitting Sapir in February,
did not reach the question of enforce
ment of University policy in the event
of no conflict with ASSU By-Laws.
The IJB decision interprets the By-
Laws to imply that the "ASSU Judi
cial Councils are not competent to
enforce University policy and regula
tions, the violations of which are
not contrary to the Fundamental
Standard."
Refuting this implication, the IJB
asserts that "the issue whether the
Council has the responsibility to en
force University policy when its vio
lation does not amount to a violation
of the Fundamental Standard does not
exist."

Council member Judy Bader, re
ferring to the composition of IJB,
questioned "the right of persons to
enforce regulations when they are
not subject to those regulations." The
IJB is composed of five professors,
all of whom are appointed directly by
the president. The rulings in cases
considered by IJB are final, unless
overruled by the president himself.
Marc Sapir yesterday said, "One
finds it difficult to see how the board
(IJB) appointed by the president
would go against the president's ap
peal."
The IJB decision further requested
that Judicial Council set a penalty
for Sapir "no later than May 23,1967."
Sapir said that he would abide by
the penalty set, but felt that it should
be set by the University, not Judicial
Council.
"This decision makes In loco paren
tis explicit," Sapir said. "The Judicial
Council must enforce University
rules regardless of whether students
have a part in making those rules.
It makes it impossible for an equit
able student judicial system to exist."
After last spring's sit-in, Sapir and
Alan Traister, who also was not a
registered student at that time, re
quested that they be tried with the
other 34 demonstrators, but the ad
ministration did not include their
names on the list submitted to Judi
cial Council. Upon returning to school

force University policy when its vio
lation does not amount to a violation
of the Fundamental Standard does not
exist."

Council member Judy Bader, re
ferring to the composition of IJB,
questioned "the right of persons to
enforce regulations when they are
not subject to those regulations." The
IJB is composed of five professors,
all of whom are appointed directly by
the president. The rulings in cases
considered by IJB are final, unless
overruled by the president himself.
Marc Sapir yesterday said, "One
finds it difficult to see how the board
(IJB) appointed by the president
would go against the president's ap
peal."
The IJB decision further requested
that Judicial Council set a penalty
for Sapir "no later than May 23,1967."
Sapir said that he would abide by
the penalty set, but felt that it should
be set by the University, not Judicial
Council.
"This decision makes In loco paren
tis explicit," Sapir said. "The Judicial
Council must enforce University
rules regardless of whether students
have a part in making those rules.
It makes it impossible for an equit
able student judicial system to exist."
After last spring's sit-in, Sapir and
Alan Traister, who also was not a
registered student at that time, re
quested that they be tried with the
other 34 demonstrators, but the ad
ministration did not include their
names on the list submitted to Judi
cial Council. Upon returning to school
last fall, Sapir was informed by then
Dean of Students Donald H. Winbig
ler that his case would be prosecuted.

Judicial Council refused to hear the
Traister case last fall, and stated
that it appeared his case did not fall
within their jurisdiction since he was
not registered at the time of the in
cident.
The case was then referred to IJB
at the request of Dean of Students
Joel P. Smith. IJB found Traister
guilty of violating the Fundamental
Standard and also insured the Judi
cial Council the power to consider
similar cases.

Sapir refused to attend his Judicial
Council hearing in January on the
grounds that both the Council and
the administration lacked jurisdiction
over his conduct as a non-student. He
also stated that he found the Funda
mental Standard to be "self-contra
dicting" in principle since it is ap
plicable only to a certain segment of
the University (students) and ex
empts the groups by which it is "be
ing freely applied" (administrators)."
The Sapir case has also caused con
flict at the medical school in regard
to jurisdiction over student conduct.
Some members of the Medical School
faculty had suggested that the school
have its own judicial system, as does
the Law Softool.
"The Fundamental Standard is dead.
It did not die a natural death; it was
bludgeoned to death by bureaucratic
stupidity." So stated Council member
Dan Lewis last night.
The Council will meet tonight with
the Dean of Students to discuss the
IJB decision.
