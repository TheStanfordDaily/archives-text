# Selective Objection
## CCC To Initiate Anti-War Petition 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
A nationwide drive to collect signa
tures for a petition asking for selec
tive conscientious objector status be
gins this week on the Stanford cam
pus.
The petition calls for offering altern
ative status to those who object to
a specific war. The New York-based
Campus Coordinating Committee, or
ganizer of the petition, hopes to pre
sent 50,000 signatures of draft age
males to the Congress by May 30.
Stanford is organizing the drive on
the West Coast.
The petition reads: "As Americans
of draft age, we face an urgent dilem
ma because many of us cannot in
good consciencc support American
policy in Vietnam. We are deeply com
mitted to the procedures of majority
rule and to action within the law. Yet
we believe that a great strength of
the American constitutional system is
its genius for accomodating the dic
tates of the individual conscience with
in the framework of the law.
"In the present situation, we be
lieve that this can best be done by
offering alternative service to those

who are opposed in conscience to
fighting in Vietnam. We are convinced
that offering such an option would be
in the national interest, as well as con
sistent with the finest traditions of
American democracy."
"This statement is not so radical
as to alienate those who agree basic
ally about the nature of this war but
are unable to make the total commit
ment such as signing a *We won't go'
statement," explained Wilbur sponsor
Dave Calfee, coordinator of the drive.
Sponsor Paul Rupert added, "Any
one who is disaffected by this war—
from the student who is willing to go
to jail to the one who simply feels
disenchanted but doesn't know quite
what to do—can sign this statement.
It offers a constructive alternative
upon which these ranges of opinion
can meet." He pointed out that Dr.
Martin Luther King stated a few days
ago that serving overseas as a con
scientious objector was "the most im
portant political move" that a person
could presently take and that selective
CO status would offer this alternative
to those opposed to the war.
Besides collecting signatures on

campus, Stanford students will be
traveling to other campuses on the
West Coast and speaking this week.
The drive at Stanford was started
in cooperation with Allard K. Lowen
stein, who was here last week. Lowen
stein is chief advisor to the C.C.C.
Other advisors include John Kenneth
Galbraith, Dr. Martin Luther King,
Norman Thomas, Dr. John C. Bennett,
President of Union Theological Semin
ary, Rabbi Abraham J. Herschel of the
Clergy and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, and Gerhard Elston of the
National Council of Churches.
The C.C.C. grew out of the letter to
President Johnson last winter signed
by 100 college and university student
body presidents and questioning U.S.
policy in Vietnam. Previous C.C.C.
projects have included a petition ques
tioning the war and the draft signed
by 1000 seminary students, and the
organization of the nationwide "Day
of Inquiry" May 10, which involved
150 colleges in mass conferences and
teach-ins across the country.
The C.C.C. has also planned several
projects for this summer. Public de
bate and discussion on the war will
be encouraged by the sponsoring of
debates with representatives of the
government's position, the circulation
of petitions to encourage congressmen
to hold local hearings on the war, and
providing speakers to local organiza
tions. Petitions for "Negotiations
Now" will be circulated. Local news
papers, high school student body of
ficers, clergymen and others will be
encouraged to use their influence in
communities. Intensive polls will be
conducted in selected areas, and CCC
will provide counsel on alternatives
to the draft.
