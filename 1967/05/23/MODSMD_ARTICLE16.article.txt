# Death Of Fun Stan
## 
### 
The Furulamcntal Standard is clead. It
did not die a natural death; it was blud
geoned to death by bureaucratic stupidity,
t —Dan Lewis
Judicial Council Member
Yes, Mr. Lewis, the Fundamental Standard is
dead, it died sometime last week when the In
terim Judicial Board (IJB) wrote its decision on
the Marc Sapir case, using as one of its argu
ments the contention that violations of Univer
sity law, policy, and regulations are also viola
tions of the Fundamental Standard.
/ The Fundamental Standard is defined in the
ASSU by-laws in the following manner: "Stu
dents are expected to show, both within and
without the University, such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens." To say that this
statement implies that students must indiscrimi
nately obey all University policy is to remove
the personal element which makes of the Funda
mental Standard a mature and rational approach
to the problem of insuring proper behavior.
The Fundamental Standard exists because it
allows students, within certain reasonable limits,
tb set their own standards and abide by them.
Its value lies in that it includes areas difficult
tb legislate and in which individual differences
tttist be considered above arbitrary decrees. In
short, the Fundamental Standard appeals to the
consciences of students and asks them to inter
pret their actions in terms of the broad guidelines
established by its definition. In addition, of
course, it leaves to the student Judicial Council

the final responsibility for interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard in each case.
The IJB decision has destroyed the Funda
mental Standard because it has, in effect, made
it obsolete; instead of trying to use it as a tool
for enforcement of University regulations, IJB
should perhaps have been more honest and
simply recommended abolition of the Funda
mental Standard and ordered the Judicial Coun
cil to enforce all University regulations.
IJB has set the precedent that students must
enforce regulations which they did not establish
themselves. Ironically, the administration proud
ly claims that the trend is toward greater stu
dent responsibility for enforcement of rules
which they develop themselves, while at the
same time it establishes totally contradictory
precedents. Not only have students been de
prived of the right to decide on the regula
tions which govern their lives; now they
have lost the right to interpret these rules
through their judicial council. And if Judicial
Council makes a ruling which does not conform
to the expectations of the administration, then
IJB — which consists only of faculty members
appointed by the present of the University —
may intervene, as it did in the Sapir case. If IJB
views itself as a local version of the Supreme
Court, it should keep in mind that even justices
of the high court only interpret laws to which
they are subject.
You're right, Mr. Lewis, the Fundamental
Standard is dead. But it was not killed by stupid
ity; it was murdered — in cold blood. The IJB
decision was clearly another attempt at restrict
ing the rights of students to control their lives
and should be seen as just that.

of the high court only interpret laws to which
they are subject.
You're right, Mr. Lewis, the Fundamental
Standard is dead. But it was not killed by stupid
ity; it was murdered — in cold blood. The IJB
decision was clearly another attempt at restrict
ing the rights of students to control their lives
and should be seen as just that.
The Furulamcntal Standard is clead. It
did not die a natural death; it was blud
geoned to death by bureaucratic stupidity,

Yes, Mr. Lewis, the Fundamental Standard is
dead, it died sometime last week when the In
terim Judicial Board (IJB) wrote its decision on
the Marc Sapir case, using as one of its argu
ments the contention that violations of Univer
sity law, policy, and regulations are also viola
tions of the Fundamental Standard.
/ The Fundamental Standard is defined in the
ASSU by-laws in the following manner: "Stu
dents are expected to show, both within and
without the University, such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens." To say that this
statement implies that students must indiscrimi
nately obey all University policy is to remove
the personal element which makes of the Funda
mental Standard a mature and rational approach
to the problem of insuring proper behavior.
The Fundamental Standard exists because it
allows students, within certain reasonable limits,
tb set their own standards and abide by them.
Its value lies in that it includes areas difficult
tb legislate and in which individual differences
tttist be considered above arbitrary decrees. In
short, the Fundamental Standard appeals to the
consciences of students and asks them to inter
pret their actions in terms of the broad guidelines
established by its definition. In addition, of
course, it leaves to the student Judicial Council

the final responsibility for interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard in each case.
The IJB decision has destroyed the Funda
mental Standard because it has, in effect, made
it obsolete; instead of trying to use it as a tool
for enforcement of University regulations, IJB
should perhaps have been more honest and
simply recommended abolition of the Funda
mental Standard and ordered the Judicial Coun
cil to enforce all University regulations.
IJB has set the precedent that students must
enforce regulations which they did not establish
themselves. Ironically, the administration proud
ly claims that the trend is toward greater stu
dent responsibility for enforcement of rules
which they develop themselves, while at the
same time it establishes totally contradictory
precedents. Not only have students been de
prived of the right to decide on the regula
tions which govern their lives; now they
have lost the right to interpret these rules
through their judicial council. And if Judicial
Council makes a ruling which does not conform
to the expectations of the administration, then
IJB — which consists only of faculty members
appointed by the present of the University —
may intervene, as it did in the Sapir case. If IJB
views itself as a local version of the Supreme
Court, it should keep in mind that even justices
of the high court only interpret laws to which
they are subject.
