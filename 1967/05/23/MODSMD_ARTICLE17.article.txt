# The 						Limits Of Endurance

The recent movement of American and South
Vietnamese troops into the southern portion of
tttte Demilitarized Zone was explained by the
State Department as a "purely defensive mea
sure" to combat the infiltration of North Vietna
mese troops in the south.
Even at this late date, Washington insists that
such action in no way constitutes an invasion of
the north by the allies, even though ground
maneuvers have been accompanied by a step-
Up in bombing raids on Hanoi with increasing
casualties on both sides.
U.S. officials also insist that we are remaining
within the narrow range of limited warfare, as
there are at present no apparent plans to push
for ground attacks in the northern portion of
the DMZ.
When the U.S. first began bombing North
Vietnam in February 1965, the President claimed
sought "no wider war." And while such
spokesmen as former ambassadors Kennan and
Reischauer slough off fears of Chinese domina
tion, it becomes increasingly apparent that the
fears of the U.S. government are self-reinforcing,
as military action has continued to force the
North Vietnamese farther and farther into the
arms of the Chinese.
The failure of U.S. policy thus far has only in
part been military, for it certainly does not lack
strategy, although much of it is poorly calcu
lated. What is lacking is understanding and re
spect for a different culture and lack of faith in
the self-determination of other peoples. The U.S.
has shown blatant disregard for the potential of
Southeast Asian nationalism and its possibilities
as a firm foundation for the type of government
which will be the starting point for economic
and cultural development of such countries as
Vietnam.
The strategy of bombing involves pushing the
enemy against a wall, pushing him beyond the
limits of all endurance. During the period of
bombing in the last two years, there has been
no indication of weakening by the opposition.

Bombing has been a failure, both politically and
militarily. The use of such nondiscriminate wea
pons has obscured military targets and at the
same time has brought destruction to the civilian
population to such a degree that reorganization
of government in the South and eventual reuni
fication of the two Vietnams will be impossible
in the economic and social spheres.
The North Vietnamese will endure, as will the
allied forces. And in a case where there can be
no surrender, there can be no equitable conces
sions. Those being pushed beyond endurance
are not government leaders or policy-makers,
but rather those who are probably more aware
of the immediate repercussions of war and those
who have little part in the policy-making. The
war is trying patience at two extremes â€” on one
hand the Vietnamese peasants who are now liv
ing at subsistence levels in a war-ravaged coun
try and on the other hand, an increasingly broad
ly based segment of the American public express
ing concern over our war policy.
The credibility gap has not existed so much
because of the absence of facts. The discrepan
cies among statistics gleaned from military head
quarters in Saigon, Radio Hanoi and free-lance
journalists are not irreconcilable. The real lack
of credibility exists within the American public
itself, at a point where the Vietnamese have
made clear their disapproval of the presence of
Westerners and where we must force ourselves
to admit that we cannot continue to rationalize
our interference in another hemisphere on the
basis of our role as the perpertrator of demo
cracy.
The mythical democracy of which Western
officialdom speaks is an institution which is neith
er desired by nor applicable to the Vietnamese.
And ironically, those in this country who con
tinue to insist upon shoving this institution
down the throats of other peoples are blindly
perpetuating a system where the loud cry of dis
sent makes headlines, but makes not the slightest
dent on the hard-headed policy-making machine.
