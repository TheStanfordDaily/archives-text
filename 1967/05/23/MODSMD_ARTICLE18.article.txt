# In Glass Houses
## To Please Alums, Hide The Students 
### Robert E. Stone 
Last Saturday Stanford was
treated to the spectacle of
Alumni Day. About 300 grads
dating as far back as the class
of '97 returned to the Farm to
hear the bromides of faculty and
administrators, to be served a
Tresidder hamburger lunch, and
to make their pledges of continu
ing support to the University.
The program prepared for the
alums was varied and interest
ing, and incomplete. No where,
no time during the day, were the
alums subjected to the har
angues of the misguided Stan
ford liberal, the student. Any
student. No student.
Whether this was an over
sight on the part of the members
of the alumni groups that plan
ned the event, or whether it was
a purposeful omission is not
known, but evidence would indi
cate that students were purpose
fully left off the program.
Tell Us Why
According to Bill Stone, ASSU
Vice President, "I phoned the
Alumni Association when I real
ized that there were no students
on the program and asked them
how come? They assured me it
was an oversight, and suggested
that I come and mingle with the
alums and say whatever I
wanted."
My paranoia, however, sug
gested a more dastardly plot
than at first appears. Alums are
down on students. They want to
hear that students are bad, dis
respectful, slovenly, and unintel
ligent. As any administrator
knows, this is not an easy pic
ture to paint, especially when
there are seven or eight of Stan
ford's best standing around
waiting to tell the alums their
side of the story.
The solution to this dilemma
is obvious. Hide the students;
pretend that they don't exist.
Use them where they must be
used, but don't let them make
any formal statements. That
strategy was used to good ad
vantage Saturday.
Make Believe
One may readily ask why stu
dents should be exempted from
the privilege of selling their Uni
versity, and I use the word sell
ing advisedly. The reason I
maintain is excruciatingly sim

pie; the alums don't want to be
made to believe that students
can look or behave other than
they appear on TV or in the
newspapers.
On alumni day, the alums get
what they want. The University,
as Provost Lyman so neatly put
it, "must rely on its alumni and
friends outside." Relying as
heavily as we do, it should not
have been a surprise to see the
participants kiss-up to the old
grads.
In the morning session, the
newly-elected President of the
Board of Trustees received a
roar of approval when he an
nounced that there was no room
for student representation on
the Board. It was immediately
unclear whether Mr. Fuller
meant student representatives
or represented students, but the
impression was that he meant
both.
One For Students
Only once was an attempt made
to meditate the dispute, and it
is too bad that Provost Lyman
cost himself any chance of being
President of the University by
coming out in favor of the stu
dents. Fuller's angry look could
be seen clear across the Bowman
courtyard as the Provost men
tioned the 90 per cent of Stan
ford students who never get
their names in the papers or on
the evening news, and com
mented about the dedication of
those students who had helped
design the master plan for the
Demonstration Houses.
Maybe it is just as well that
Provost Lyman lost the Presi
dency Saturday. Maybe he can
do more for students as the
number two man. At least he's
usually here.
Fuller told the audience that
the telegram telling him that he
had been nominated appeared to
him to be a great trick and a
great compliment. To the stu
dents of Stanford, it is only a
great trick.
Now that the alums have
gone, let us hope that we can
remember that there are indeed
students here; students who can
and do make a great contribu
tion to the University. It is a
record I am willing to match
with Mr. Fuller and all the
alums at any time they choose.
