## Reply From Hatfield

Editor, The Daily:
I appreciate your support on
the draft legislation, and am
hopeful that as increasing num
bers of citizens inform them
selves on this issue, the chance
for its becoming legislation will
be enhanced.
There is no doubt in my mind

that such legislation will even
tually be passed by the Con
gress, however I believe it to be
a vital issue whose passage nec
essitates immediate acceleration.
Again, my thanks for your
support and your fine editorial.
MARK O. HATFIELD
