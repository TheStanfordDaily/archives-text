# Luce Sees No Immediate New Left Threat

### LONNIE TERRY 
Speaking last night on "What is the
New Left?", Phillip A. Luce, a former
member of the Progressive Labor Par
tyty (PLP) called Communist infiltra
tion of student political groups insig
nificant and the influence of such
groups "apparent yet irrelevant."
Groups such as the Dußois Clubs of
America, the Young Socialist Alliance,
and the Communist Party USA, said
Luce, are "clearly Communist groups."
They are "what we used to ca11...
phone booth organizations, which
means you could squeeze all their mem
bership into a phone booth," he said.
Luce called the two largest college
student groups, Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) and the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) "certainly not Communist
groups. They don't fulfill the precept
of Communist organizations — they
are not financed by nor totally support
the Communist movement."
New Left Small
Luce called the entire New Left
movement small and said "if you talk
about national organization, you're
talking about a group of 12,000 peo
ple." He said that the groups have, at
times, "been able to really get thou
sands of other students to join their
protests" but called those times exam
ples of groups speaking to real prob
lems and in those cases, drawing
large crowds.
In 1963 Luce, a former editor of the
Progressive Labor Magazine led a stu
dent trip to Cuba in violation of the
State Department travel ban. He said
he defected from the PLU when he de
cided to "stop lying to myself" and
recognized that a "total revolution"
was not necessary to change American
society.
According to Luce, "SDS is difficult
to talk about," because the loose con
nections between chapters and the na
tional organization leave local chapters
free to do "pretty much what they
want."
He cited some of the "further out"
activities of SDS as being the publica
tion of "Towards Student Syndicalism"
and of a pamphlet on how to organize
high school students. The syndicalism

plan called for the take over of univer
sities by "shouting down" both the stu
dent government and professors "with
whom you do not agree." He called the
SDS position in the high school paper
"bizarre" when it said that setting
waste cans afire would "show the high
school administration that there's stu
dent unrest."
Anti-Communist
However, he described himself as
"Anti-Communist (but) not Anti-SDS
on all levels." He held that "so long as
SDS holds out really relevant issues"
he would support those activities of
the organization. Such issues, he said,
would include opposition to the draft
and to the control of personal lives by
"big government."
"SNCC is even more difficult to
deal with," said Luce. He said that

Communists have tried to infiltrate
the group, but claimed they had little
success because of "few number of
Negro Communists" and because the
"attitude, boldness, and independence
of SNCC have made it relatively im
possible for Communists to get in."
Noting that SNCC's leader Stokley
Carmichael had been associated with
Bill Epton, a New York PLP leader,
Max Sanford, the U.S. chairman of
the Revolutionary Action Movement
(RAM), Luce expressed concern
about "a trend generally for the fu
ture."
RAM's position on civil rights said
Luce, "is one of the strangest held
in the United States today." He sum
marized it saying that "the best way
to solve the racial problems in the
U.S. is for all the black people to kill
off all the white people."

"The only way to combat Commu
nism in the U.S. is to realize who
they are and not to make wild
charges . . . and to do it intelligently,"
said Luce. "The staff of the House
Un-American Activities Committee,"
said Luce, "are good people . . . not
prone to make hasty charges. The
problem with HUAC is who is on
the committee. If there has ever been
a more loutish group of congressmen
on any committee it would be hard
to conceive of it,"he concluded.
According to Luce, the current
Communist infiltration problem is not
serious. He said he agreed with Izzy
Stone who said, "If you put them all
together they might be able to take
over a Post Office, they couldn't hold
it, but they might be able to take it
over." The Communists, he said, "defi
nitely aren't going to take over Wash
ington," at the moment.
