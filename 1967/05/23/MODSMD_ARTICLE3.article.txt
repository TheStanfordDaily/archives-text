# Open SES Meeting
## Prof. Good Questions General Studies Rules 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Three students and a professor had
their say yesterday in open hearings
before the Study of Education at
Stanford. The hearings were on the
subjects of freshman year and Gen
eral Studies and Major requirements,
and will be continued this evening.
Professor of Religion Edwin Good,
a member of the University General
Studies Committee, remarked that
there are two problems with the
freshman year and General Studiesâ€”
inflexibility and the survey syndrome.
He explained that the General Studies
program was originally intended to
end the split between upper and
lower division studies. He explained
that this hasn't happened, especially
in the freshman year.
The freshman year, Good said, is

pretty much the same for all fresh
men, consisting of English, Western
Civilization, a foreign language and
either science or mathematics. The
overseas campus program, he noted,
fulfills all General Studies require
ments in the humanities and social
sciences. And since about half the
undergraduates at Stanford go to an
overseas campus, the first two years
for a great many Stanford students
are spent getting General Studies
"out of the way."
Good added that this situation is
made worse by housing freshmen in
separate dormitories. Furthermore, he
said, a students options for General
Studies courses are restricted to a
small number and, in the humanities,
to certain kinds of programs.
Breadth and Quantity
Good said that, in general, there is
a "confusion between breadth of

learning and quantification of cover
age." He questioned some assump
tions which he said prevailed in cur
rent educational theory: that there
are certain things which every well
educated person should know; and
that depth should be accounted for
by a student's major after the
breadth has come first.
He said it is possible to go through
depth to breadth, rather than vice
versa, and that specifics should be
taught before generalizations are ar
rived at. This would prevent, he said,
leaving a student at the mercy of the
"great man" and his synthesis of all
previous thought.
Eliminate Intro Surveys
Specifically, Good proposed several
possible alternatives: eliminate intro
ductory surveys, let every course be
acceptable as a general studies course,
let students have the option to take

anything they please. He said the
General Studies program "should not
be centered around its administrative
convenience."
Jim Rowan, a junior, proposed
that Western Civ tie in more with the
present and come to terms more with
current events, perhaps by being
oriented toward specific problems. He
also suggested that the course be
taught in reverse chronological order,
so that the past could be related more
directly to the present.
Freshman Mike Wolf criticized the
General Studies science courses, say
ing that there is "too much trivia and
ridiculous detail." He said science
courses might have some relation to
social issues, particularly in the area
of the development of scientific the
ory. He also criticized Western Civi
lization courses for being too often
sloppy in material and presentation.
