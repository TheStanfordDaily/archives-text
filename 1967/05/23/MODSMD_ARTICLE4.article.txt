# Researchers Study 'Pot' Smokers

Marijuana.
To Dean Joel Smith and other ad
ministrators, the very word seems to
inspire heady visions of pungent cof
fee houses. To parents of college-age
students who tune into the San Fran
cisco Chronicle's sensational brand of
marijuana coverage on the campus,
there arise warped ideas about the
seriousness of the pot-use problem.
Most students merely exhibit
strained expressions in the face of
these two attitudes, perhaps realizing
the true extent of the problem.
The student attitude toward mari
juana use is one of studied indiffer
ence to the anguished hysteria of
those older groups. This attitude
seems to be justified, according to two
non-student observers. These observ
ers, although working independently
at Stanford, have arrived at nearly
the same conclusions about student
marijuana use.
One is Dr. John I. Maurer, staff psy
chiatrist at Cowell Student Health
Center. The second, Mrs. Emily Gar
field, is a research assistant to Dr.
Richard Blum at the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Working in their respective areas,
Dr. Maurer, coming in contact with
only those students who seek his help,
and Dr. Blum's staff, conducting a long
term study of student drug use for the
National Institute of Mental Health,
have come to the following general
conclusion: There is an increase in

drug use, but marijuana seems to be
an "incidental problem" in Dr. Maur
er's words, with no tendency noted
among users to move on to try a
narcotic (heroin, LSD).
Biased Sample
In Dr. Maurer's observations, he
was able to draw his general con
clusions from what he termed a "very
biased sample of students." He in
sisted that any student seeking his
aid does so voluntarily, and thus, is
likely to be in some trouble already.
Dr. Maurer contrasts these stu
dents, a definite minority, to those
who do use marijuana, but don't have
problems. Likewise, he doesn't classi
fy every student who tries marijuana
as having a problem. "Those who
drift into problems with marijuana
rely on it as a tranquilizer, or an
escape route," commented Dr. Maurer.
Dr. Maurer also sees a problem
with those who use the weed to sup
port their own habit, and thus break
a law. He is quick to point out, how
ever, that on a college campus a mari
juana "pusher" doesn't usually deal
in anything but the "dangerous drug",
as marijuana is legally classified.
Mrs. Garfield's range of experience
is derived from conducting some 400
random sample interviews in the pro
cess of completing Dr. Blum's study
of drug use. The study covers six
schools, from Los Angeles to Oregon
including two resident schools, two
state institutions, one junior college,
and one parochial college.
Conducting her interviews, which
cover questions ranging from family

background to whether a student uses
drugs, has brought her into close
agreement with Dr. Maurer's observa
tions.
On the reasons behind the use of
marijuana, as compared with other
means of escape (alcohol), Mrs. Gar
field explained that students "are not
trying to escape into drugs, they are
trying to find out more about them
selves." "For kicks," and "for social
thrills in a group of friends" are both
phrases used by Dr. Maurer and Mrs.
Garfield.
Why Marijuana?
Both also agreed that drug "users"
of any habitual (not addictive) nature
are a very low factor, but one-timers
are considerably higher. Some esti
mates range upwards of 50 per cent at
Stanford. Neither Dr. Maurer nor
Mrs. Garfield would make an explicit
statement on the number of those who
have tried marijuana. Dr. Maurer
refused to estimate because of the
bias of those students he talks to, and
Mrs. Garfield, due to the incomplete
nature of the research and the im
pending release of definitive statistics
later this year.
One point that Mrs. Garfield made
from her contacts with students, was
that "Students can't, or seem to be
unable to talk with parents (about
drug use)."
Parents were reared with the "in
grained wrongness of drug use,"
stated Mrs. Garfield.
Thus the generation that crawls
out of bed to a Tirend, takes a Compoz
to counteract the Tirend jitters, and

a few aspirin on the side to feel better
before that Sleep-Eze at night, can't
see why students accept marijuana,
and wonder where they got the idea.
Oppose Marijuana Laws
Most students simply don't put
marijuana in the dangerous drug cata
gory. Both Dr. Maurer and Mrs. Gar
field oppose the laws on marijuana,
feeling that they are fully out of pro
portion to the social and medical use
of the drug. They also give students
more credit than the law makers and
in loco parentis advocates, as Mrs.
Garfield stated "most students realize
that LSD is a potentially dangerous
drug, and don't make the move up
ward from marijuana that parents
and administrators seem to expect."
Dr. Maurer emphasized "The LSD
decision is more seriously considered.
A student might try marijuana but
would be scared of LSD." According
to Dr. Maurer, the repeated reports
of possible organic or mental damage,
perhaps even chromosomal damage,
seems to have a deterrent effect on
a potential user.
It was in the area of the confused
expectations on the part of the other
generation that Mrs. Garfield sug
gested some changes. She thought a
're-education process of parents and
students," would be necessary, especi
ally to aim at a higher level of sophis
tication. "Obviously the fright ap
proach isn't working," added Mrs.
Garfield, "and something is wrong
when high school students leave class
laughing after a typical narcotics
scare film."

means of escape (alcohol), Mrs. Gar
field explained that students "are not
trying to escape into drugs, they are
trying to find out more about them
selves." "For kicks," and "for social
thrills in a group of friends" are both
phrases used by Dr. Maurer and Mrs.
Garfield.
Why Marijuana?
Both also agreed that drug "users"
of any habitual (not addictive) nature
are a very low factor, but one-timers
are considerably higher. Some esti
mates range upwards of 50 per cent at
Stanford. Neither Dr. Maurer nor
Mrs. Garfield would make an explicit
statement on the number of those who
have tried marijuana. Dr. Maurer
refused to estimate because of the
bias of those students he talks to, and
Mrs. Garfield, due to the incomplete
nature of the research and the im
pending release of definitive statistics
later this year.
One point that Mrs. Garfield made
from her contacts with students, was
that "Students can't, or seem to be
unable to talk with parents (about
drug use)."
Parents were reared with the "in
grained wrongness of drug use,"
stated Mrs. Garfield.
Thus the generation that crawls
out of bed to a Tirend, takes a Compoz
to counteract the Tirend jitters, and

a few aspirin on the side to feel better
before that Sleep-Eze at night, can't
see why students accept marijuana,
and wonder where they got the idea.
Oppose Marijuana Laws
Most students simply don't put
marijuana in the dangerous drug cata
gory. Both Dr. Maurer and Mrs. Gar
field oppose the laws on marijuana,
feeling that they are fully out of pro
portion to the social and medical use
of the drug. They also give students
more credit than the law makers and
in loco parentis advocates, as Mrs.
Garfield stated "most students realize
that LSD is a potentially dangerous
drug, and don't make the move up
ward from marijuana that parents
and administrators seem to expect."
Dr. Maurer emphasized "The LSD
decision is more seriously considered.
A student might try marijuana but
would be scared of LSD." According
to Dr. Maurer, the repeated reports
of possible organic or mental damage,
perhaps even chromosomal damage,
seems to have a deterrent effect on
a potential user.
It was in the area of the confused
expectations on the part of the other
generation that Mrs. Garfield sug
gested some changes. She thought a
're-education process of parents and
students," would be necessary, especi
ally to aim at a higher level of sophis
tication. "Obviously the fright ap
proach isn't working," added Mrs.
Garfield, "and something is wrong
when high school students leave class
laughing after a typical narcotics
scare film."
Marijuana.
To Dean Joel Smith and other ad
ministrators, the very word seems to
inspire heady visions of pungent cof
fee houses. To parents of college-age
students who tune into the San Fran
cisco Chronicle's sensational brand of
marijuana coverage on the campus,
there arise warped ideas about the
seriousness of the pot-use problem.
Most students merely exhibit
strained expressions in the face of
these two attitudes, perhaps realizing
the true extent of the problem.
The student attitude toward mari
juana use is one of studied indiffer
ence to the anguished hysteria of
those older groups. This attitude
seems to be justified, according to two
non-student observers. These observ
ers, although working independently
at Stanford, have arrived at nearly
the same conclusions about student
marijuana use.
One is Dr. John I. Maurer, staff psy
chiatrist at Cowell Student Health
Center. The second, Mrs. Emily Gar
field, is a research assistant to Dr.
Richard Blum at the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Working in their respective areas,
Dr. Maurer, coming in contact with
only those students who seek his help,
and Dr. Blum's staff, conducting a long
term study of student drug use for the
National Institute of Mental Health,
have come to the following general
conclusion: There is an increase in

drug use, but marijuana seems to be
an "incidental problem" in Dr. Maur
er's words, with no tendency noted
among users to move on to try a
narcotic (heroin, LSD).
Biased Sample
In Dr. Maurer's observations, he
was able to draw his general con
clusions from what he termed a "very
biased sample of students." He in
sisted that any student seeking his
aid does so voluntarily, and thus, is
likely to be in some trouble already.
Dr. Maurer contrasts these stu
dents, a definite minority, to those
who do use marijuana, but don't have
problems. Likewise, he doesn't classi
fy every student who tries marijuana
as having a problem. "Those who
drift into problems with marijuana
rely on it as a tranquilizer, or an
escape route," commented Dr. Maurer.
Dr. Maurer also sees a problem
with those who use the weed to sup
port their own habit, and thus break
a law. He is quick to point out, how
ever, that on a college campus a mari
juana "pusher" doesn't usually deal
in anything but the "dangerous drug",
as marijuana is legally classified.
Mrs. Garfield's range of experience
is derived from conducting some 400
random sample interviews in the pro
cess of completing Dr. Blum's study
of drug use. The study covers six
schools, from Los Angeles to Oregon
including two resident schools, two
state institutions, one junior college,
and one parochial college.
Conducting her interviews, which
cover questions ranging from family

background to whether a student uses
drugs, has brought her into close
agreement with Dr. Maurer's observa
tions.
On the reasons behind the use of
marijuana, as compared with other
means of escape (alcohol), Mrs. Gar
field explained that students "are not
trying to escape into drugs, they are

Most students merely exhibit
strained expressions in the face of
these two attitudes, perhaps realizing
the true extent of the problem.
The student attitude toward mari
juana use is one of studied indiffer
ence to the anguished hysteria of
those older groups. This attitude
seems to be justified, according to two
non-student observers. These observ
ers, although working independently
at Stanford, have arrived at nearly
the same conclusions about student
marijuana use.
One is Dr. John I. Maurer, staff psy
chiatrist at Cowell Student Health
Center. The second, Mrs. Emily Gar
field, is a research assistant to Dr.
Richard Blum at the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Working in their respective areas,
Dr. Maurer, coming in contact with
only those students who seek his help,
and Dr. Blum's staff, conducting a long
term study of student drug use for the
National Institute of Mental Health,
have come to the following general
conclusion: There is an increase in

drug use, but marijuana seems to be
an "incidental problem" in Dr. Maur
er's words, with no tendency noted
among users to move on to try a
narcotic (heroin, LSD).
Biased Sample
In Dr. Maurer's observations, he
was able to draw his general con
clusions from what he termed a "very
biased sample of students." He in
sisted that any student seeking his
aid does so voluntarily, and thus, is
likely to be in some trouble already.
Dr. Maurer contrasts these stu
dents, a definite minority, to those
who do use marijuana, but don't have
problems. Likewise, he doesn't classi
fy every student who tries marijuana
as having a problem. "Those who
drift into problems with marijuana
rely on it as a tranquilizer, or an
escape route," commented Dr. Maurer.
Dr. Maurer also sees a problem
with those who use the weed to sup
port their own habit, and thus break
a law. He is quick to point out, how
ever, that on a college campus a mari
juana "pusher" doesn't usually deal
in anything but the "dangerous drug",
as marijuana is legally classified.
Mrs. Garfield's range of experience
is derived from conducting some 400
random sample interviews in the pro
cess of completing Dr. Blum's study
of drug use. The study covers six
schools, from Los Angeles to Oregon
including two resident schools, two
state institutions, one junior college,
and one parochial college.
Conducting her interviews, which
cover questions ranging from family

background to whether a student uses
drugs, has brought her into close
agreement with Dr. Maurer's observa
tions.
On the reasons behind the use of
marijuana, as compared with other
means of escape (alcohol), Mrs. Gar
field explained that students "are not
trying to escape into drugs, they are
trying to find out more about them
selves." "For kicks," and "for social
thrills in a group of friends" are both
phrases used by Dr. Maurer and Mrs.
Garfield.
Why Marijuana?
Both also agreed that drug "users"
of any habitual (not addictive) nature
are a very low factor, but one-timers
are considerably higher. Some esti
mates range upwards of 50 per cent at
Stanford. Neither Dr. Maurer nor
Mrs. Garfield would make an explicit
statement on the number of those who
have tried marijuana. Dr. Maurer
refused to estimate because of the
bias of those students he talks to, and
Mrs. Garfield, due to the incomplete
nature of the research and the im
pending release of definitive statistics
later this year.
One point that Mrs. Garfield made
from her contacts with students, was
that "Students can't, or seem to be
unable to talk with parents (about
drug use)."
Parents were reared with the "in
grained wrongness of drug use,"
stated Mrs. Garfield.
Thus the generation that crawls
out of bed to a Tirend, takes a Compoz
to counteract the Tirend jitters, and

a few aspirin on the side to feel better
before that Sleep-Eze at night, can't
see why students accept marijuana,
and wonder where they got the idea.
Oppose Marijuana Laws
Most students simply don't put
marijuana in the dangerous drug cata
gory. Both Dr. Maurer and Mrs. Gar
field oppose the laws on marijuana,
feeling that they are fully out of pro
portion to the social and medical use
of the drug. They also give students
more credit than the law makers and
in loco parentis advocates, as Mrs.
Garfield stated "most students realize
that LSD is a potentially dangerous
drug, and don't make the move up
ward from marijuana that parents
and administrators seem to expect."
Dr. Maurer emphasized "The LSD
decision is more seriously considered.
A student might try marijuana but
would be scared of LSD." According
to Dr. Maurer, the repeated reports
of possible organic or mental damage,
perhaps even chromosomal damage,
seems to have a deterrent effect on
a potential user.
It was in the area of the confused
expectations on the part of the other
generation that Mrs. Garfield sug
gested some changes. She thought a
're-education process of parents and
students," would be necessary, especi
ally to aim at a higher level of sophis
tication. "Obviously the fright ap
proach isn't working," added Mrs.
Garfield, "and something is wrong
when high school students leave class
laughing after a typical narcotics
scare film."
Marijuana.
To Dean Joel Smith and other ad
ministrators, the very word seems to
inspire heady visions of pungent cof
fee houses. To parents of college-age
students who tune into the San Fran
cisco Chronicle's sensational brand of
marijuana coverage on the campus,
there arise warped ideas about the
seriousness of the pot-use problem.
