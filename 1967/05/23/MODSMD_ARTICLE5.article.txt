# 75 Women To Go OFF; Housing Details Expected
## 
### 
Seventy-five senior women will
move off campus next fall without
drawing for the privilege because
only 75 declared they wanted to.
In another housing issue, drawing
for the demonstration houses will
take place on dates to be announced.
Specific information about applica
tions for the demonstration houses
will be released this afternoon by the
Dean of Students' office.
Assistant Di'an of Students Sally
Mahoney expressed mild surprise at
the small number of women desiring
to live off campus next year. Admini
strators had anticipated greater in
terest and had arranged for a draw
last Thursday, but it was made un
necessary.
Miss Mahoney offered no explana
tion for the apparent lack of interest.
She said generalizations were hard to
make because "decisions about hous
ing arrangements are very personal."
Some junior girls said their parents
refused to let them live off campus.
Other Difficulties
Another difficulty may have been
that, unlike some other universities,

Stanford has no arrangements for
"approved university housing" off
campus which would make the move
easier. Some girls felt that living off
campus would lead to a "feeling of
isolation" from the university. Others
spoke of a "nostalgic feeling about
the last year."
One girl said simply that moving
off campus is "a lot more complicated
than most people realize."
Social regulations which now apply
to women's residences on campus
will have no bearing on women liv
ing off. Miss Mahoney said the girls
were allowed to move off campus as
individuals and that the only criterion
the administration used in allowing
each girl to move off was a written
request to do so.
The 75 women who received the
option to move off campus by default
have all been notified, Miss Mahoney
said. They are expected to commit
themselves by signing a vacancy card
by Friday. This is, in effect, a request
for the return of their room deposits
and a cancelation of their room reser
vations.
More Information Today
The Dean of Students office has
not yet released specific information
on the demonstration houses. At their
meeting last Thursday, the Board of
Trustees left technical considerations
to President Wallace Sterling. Ster
ling has been mildly ill recently and
the decisions therefore have been de

layed. The Dean of Students will an
nounce today full details on the dem
onstration houses for next fall.
On Thursday evening, faculty resi
dents heading the demonstration
houses will conduct open forums for
students with specific questions about
the programs.
As approved by the Trustees, there
will be two houses in Wilbur and two
in Stern Hall, each containing upper
and lowerclassmen, both men and
women, and each centered around an
academic theme. The idea was first
developed by the Freshman Subcom
mittee of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion.
Stern Houses Included
As finally worked out by the Study
of Education at Stanford and an ad
visory committee to Dean of Students
Joel Smith, the original plan was
altered to include Stern houses and
several proposed academic themes
for the houses were drawn up.
The information to be released by
the Dean of Students today will be
more specific, including naming which
houses will be affected by the project
and how the residents will be chosen.
A similar project to the demonstra
tion houses has been in operation
since January in the Grove House,
which has received favorable com
ment from students, faculty and ad
ministrators. They also resemble the
five overseas campuses in many re
spects, although those are not open
to freshmen.
