A DECLARATION OF CONSCIENCE
. s*
Many American young men have announced that they will refuse to participate in the barbarism of the Vietnam war. We, too believe
our war in Vietnam is immoral, unjust, unconscionable.
The undersigned, like the majority of our countrymen, are not among those called on to offer their lives in Vietnam. No sacrifice
demanded of us can equal the loss of a single life, Vietnamese or Amrican. With all Americans, we share a responsibility for those of
our youth who have been ordered off to war.
We believe that every young man has the obligation to choose for himself whether he will train to kill and perhaps be killed in this
war. This decision of conscience cannot be made for him by any external authority, including the American government. We therefore
urge young men to consider whether they are willing to be executioners and victims. To all who determine that they will not participate
in his war, we pledge our full and active support. We also affirm that we will join with them in a shared effort to assure that their
moral rejection of the war results in effedve political opposition to it.

our youth who have been ordered off to war.
We believe that every young man has the obligation to choose for himself whether he will train to kill and perhaps be killed in this
war. This decision of conscience cannot be made for him by any external authority, including the American government. We therefore
urge young men to consider whether they are willing to be executioners and victims. To all who determine that they will not participate
in his war, we pledge our full and active support. We also affirm that we will join with them in a shared effort to assure that their
moral rejection of the war results in effedve political opposition to it.

A DECLARATION OF CONSCIENCE
. s*
Many American young men have announced that they will refuse to participate in the barbarism of the Vietnam war. We, too believe
our war in Vietnam is immoral, unjust, unconscionable.
The undersigned, like the majority of our countrymen, are not among those called on to offer their lives in Vietnam. No sacrifice
demanded of us can equal the loss of a single life, Vietnamese or Amrican. With all Americans, we share a responsibility for those of
our youth who have been ordered off to war.
