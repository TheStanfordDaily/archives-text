# Voting Starts Again Today For Senior Class Officers
## 
### CHARLES THIERIOT 
New elections will be held today
and tomorrow for Senior Class Presi
dent, Senior Class Vice President,
NSA Representative, and the class
ranking referendum.
The candidates will be the same as
for the previous election which was
invalidated by the Judicial Council last
week. Soleng Tom and Mark Fogel
man will run for Senior Class Presi
dent with their respective running
mates Jere Horwitz and Robin Wise
man for Vice President. Bob Brooks
and Gregg Murphy will vie for the
position of NSA representative.
The new elections were scheduled
because Mark Fogelman appealed the
first balloting on the basis that there
had not been student police manning
all the polling places. The Judicial
Council accepted this appeal and turn
ed down an appeal by Soleng Tom
and Jere Horwitz to deny invalida
tion.

The Judicial Council also consider
ed the objection of the then Election
Commissioner Bill Berry that in the
ASSU primary election of May 3 and
4 there was a discrepancy between
the number of ballots counted and
number of names signed in the elec
tion registration book.
According to Judy Bader, secre
tary of the Judicial Council,"The
night of the election there were two
counts to everyone's satisfaction, and
since there were so many people pres
ent as witnesses there is no reason
to consider the election invalid."
Since the last election there has
been some objection to having the
referendum on the ballot again. Leon
ard Seigal, spokesman for the Anti-
Draft Union, feels the referendum
was an expression of student opinion
and had nothing to do with any of
the candidates.
"There is no legal context, and to
play gajmes with these election rules
is absurd. However, we feel the first

vote should be binding on University
policy." Seigal also stated that if as
many people vote as last time the re
sults will be the same if not stronger
in favor of the referendum.
In response to these objections the
Judicial Council made the following
statement: "The Judicial Council felt
it was necessary to invalidate the en
tire election because of irregularities
concerned with operation of the poll
ing places. The Election Commissioner
failed to arrange to have student po
lice man the polling places, as the
Council had explicitly directed him to
do.
Even though the charges concerned
primarily the Senior Class President
and Vice President elections, because
the whole voting procedure was
brought into question the Council felt
the fairest thing to do was to invali
date the entire ballot. It should be
made quite clear, however, that there
were no irregularities either observed

or reported concerning the class-rank
ing referendum."
Fogelman's platform advocates hav
ing traditional senior functions in pri
vate homes in an effort to eliminate
the necessity of seniors having to
show identification in order to join
the festivities. Fogelman advocates
the initiation of a tutorial program so
that seniors could receive information
about various graduate schools.
Soleng Tom stresses increased so
cial activity and more contact between
seniors and faculty. Tom also suggests
compiling a book of graduate schools.
Also needed are more panel discus
sions, symposiums by admissions offi
cials from graduate schools, and a
greater knowledge of the various
grants, aids, and fellowships available
to graduate students.
Ted Anstedt, Chief of the Student
Police, will serve as Election Commis
sioner for the next two days, and all
voting places will be manned by stu
dent police.

ard Seigal, spokesman for the Anti-
Draft Union, feels the referendum
was an expression of student opinion
and had nothing to do with any of
the candidates.
"There is no legal context, and to
play gajmes with these election rules
is absurd. However, we feel the first

vote should be binding on University
policy." Seigal also stated that if as
many people vote as last time the re
sults will be the same if not stronger
in favor of the referendum.
In response to these objections the
Judicial Council made the following
statement: "The Judicial Council felt
it was necessary to invalidate the en
tire election because of irregularities
concerned with operation of the poll
ing places. The Election Commissioner
failed to arrange to have student po
lice man the polling places, as the
Council had explicitly directed him to
do.
Even though the charges concerned
primarily the Senior Class President
and Vice President elections, because
the whole voting procedure was
brought into question the Council felt
the fairest thing to do was to invali
date the entire ballot. It should be
made quite clear, however, that there
were no irregularities either observed

or reported concerning the class-rank
ing referendum."
Fogelman's platform advocates hav
ing traditional senior functions in pri
vate homes in an effort to eliminate
the necessity of seniors having to
show identification in order to join
the festivities. Fogelman advocates
the initiation of a tutorial program so
that seniors could receive information
about various graduate schools.
Soleng Tom stresses increased so
cial activity and more contact between
seniors and faculty. Tom also suggests
compiling a book of graduate schools.
Also needed are more panel discus
sions, symposiums by admissions offi
cials from graduate schools, and a
greater knowledge of the various
grants, aids, and fellowships available
to graduate students.
Ted Anstedt, Chief of the Student
Police, will serve as Election Commis
sioner for the next two days, and all
voting places will be manned by stu
dent police.
New elections will be held today
and tomorrow for Senior Class Presi
dent, Senior Class Vice President,
NSA Representative, and the class
ranking referendum.
The candidates will be the same as
for the previous election which was
invalidated by the Judicial Council last
week. Soleng Tom and Mark Fogel
man will run for Senior Class Presi
dent with their respective running
mates Jere Horwitz and Robin Wise
man for Vice President. Bob Brooks
and Gregg Murphy will vie for the
position of NSA representative.
The new elections were scheduled
because Mark Fogelman appealed the
first balloting on the basis that there
had not been student police manning
all the polling places. The Judicial
Council accepted this appeal and turn
ed down an appeal by Soleng Tom
and Jere Horwitz to deny invalida
tion.

The Judicial Council also consider
ed the objection of the then Election
Commissioner Bill Berry that in the
ASSU primary election of May 3 and
4 there was a discrepancy between
the number of ballots counted and
number of names signed in the elec
tion registration book.
According to Judy Bader, secre
tary of the Judicial Council,"The
night of the election there were two
counts to everyone's satisfaction, and
since there were so many people pres
ent as witnesses there is no reason
to consider the election invalid."
Since the last election there has
been some objection to having the
referendum on the ballot again. Leon
ard Seigal, spokesman for the Anti-
Draft Union, feels the referendum
was an expression of student opinion
and had nothing to do with any of
the candidates.
