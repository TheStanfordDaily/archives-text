Speech and Drama is Moliere's

Robin Lake. He is a member of
Equity and Resident Director for

Next Monday the "Sunday
Flick" will be La Boheme, ano
ther splendid and outstanding
movie in the new tradition of
Monday evening's Othello. "A
combination of Shakespearean
English, British accent and the
poor location of speakers (Once
In A Lifetime set had been
staged) and we had audio diffi
culties."
Memorial Church will hold A
Service Of Dance on Sunday at
7:30 p.m. Admission is graphic

28 the Philadelphia Orchestra
ar.rives at Stanford under Eu
gene Ormandy's baton. General

Freshman Drama produced a
noteable Under Milk wood earlier

student drama which is being
staged over this w.e.
An extraordinarily brilliant se

Cranes Are Flying. I have seen

movies and can only urge you to
take advantage of the free tick
ets.
