# Hatred Tears Middle East
## 
### WILLIAM RYAN AP Correspondent 
The fierce hatred between
Jews and Arabs in the Middle
East dates back exactly 50 years,
and there is no prospect that it
will abate while Israel remains
an independent state.
That hatred has been responsi
ble for years of turmoil and a
succession of world crises. Now
the world looks at another which
could involve the great powers.
What seems an eternally insol
uble problem had its beginnings
in World War I. Before Ameri
ca lent a hand in 1917, the Allies'
backs were to the wall. Russia
was collapsing in revolution. En
gland looked everywhere for
straws to grasp. The search led
to negotiations with Zionist and
world Jewish leaders in what
Winston Churchill called a
"practical measure" seeking
world Jewry's aid in the war ef
fort.
The result was the Balfour
Declaration, promising Britain's
"best endeavors" to realize what
Zionist leaders dreamt of — a
Jewish nation in the ancient
Biblical "Promised Land" of Is
rael—Palestine.
When the war ended, Britain
received a League of Nations
mandate in Palestine. Zionists
began working and planning for
their national home. Jews flowed
in from Europe. And Arabs
claimed they had been betrayed.
World War II hastened the
pace of history. Nazi Germany's
brutal treatment of Jews
aroused world sympathy and, af
ter the war, applied steam be
hind the Zionist cause. Jewish
immigration increased sharply.
In Palestine, Jews organized
underground terror units to
push their aims—lrgun Zvai
Leumi, the Stern Gang and Hag
anah, the latter the nucleus of
what would be the Israeli Army.
The critical moment came in
November, 1947.
The United Nations, trying to
apply reason to growing chaos,
adopted a partition plan. It
would give 56 per cent of Pales
tine to a proposed Israel, 44 per
cent to a proposed Arab state.
Jerusalem would be internation
alized, accessible to all three
great faiths, Jewish, Christian
and Moslem.
Again the Arabs cried "betray
al." Though the resolution pur
ported to protect the rights of
inhabitants, Arabs said Jews
owned less than 10 per cent of
land which would be given them,
and Jews were by far the mi
nority.
The Zionist underground
mounted a campaign of terror,
against the British to end the
mandate, and against Arab vil
lages and towns, driving out the
inhabitants. Before the British
mandate ended May 14, 1948,
Zionist forces occupied much of
what had been set apart for
Arabs and most of Jerusalem's
proposed international zone.
As the British withdrew, the
Jews proclaimed the state of Is
rael and Jerusalem became a di
vided city. Armies from sur
rounding nations attacked but
fared badly against the well
equipped, modern-minded Jews.
The wily Emir Abdullah, head
of the unlikely little British- cre
ated state of Transjordan, moved
in with his British-trained Arab

Legion and seized all Palestine
east of the Jordan River. He pro
claimed a kingdom of the Jor
dan.
A U.N.-sponsored truce ended
the fighting in mid-1949. Arabs
withdrew in defeat. In Jordan, a
Moslem tailor in 1951 assassi
nated Abdullah, whom many
Arabs called traitor. After a
brief interim young Hussein, Ab
dullah's grandson, mounted the
throne.
In Egypt in 1952, a young offi
cer named Gamal Abdel Nasser
overthrew a corrupt monarch
and Egypt became a Socialist
leaning republic.
The Arabs nursed resentment
of the United States and Britain
for the creation of Israel and de
nounced the power bloc Baghdad
Pact, linking Arab Iraq to the
West, as an instrument of "im
perialism." Little Jordan found
the presence of its British uncle
embarrassing, sent him packing,
and has experienced turmoil
ever since.
The Arab East picture changed
abruptly in 1955 with a sudden
intrusion of Soviet and Commu
nist-block influence in the form
of arms to Egypt. With new
strength, Nasser in 1956 an
nounced nationalization of the
Suez Canal. Britain and France
conspired with Israel to attack
Egypt that fall, and Israelis

drove all the way to the canal
as Egypt's army collapsed. U.S.
and Soviet pressure brought the
ill-starred adventure to an end.
The crisis subsided, but not
Arab hatred.
For two years thereafter, the
Arab east was almost in perma
nent crisis. The climax came in
1958 with a rebellion in Leba
non, which brought a landing of
U.S. Marines, and a bloody revo
lution in Iraq, ending the mon
archy and the Baghdad Pact.
Jordan's throne almost collapsed
along with Iraq's.
Again the area simmered
down.
Egypt turned inward to in
ternal economic difficulties. Sy
ria seceded from Nasser's United
Arab Republic after a brief and
restless union. Arab nations
were too weak and too disunited
to face up to Israel's military
power.
Then internal pressures, food
problems and other woes, possi
bly combined with an urge to
rebuild his image as an all-Arab
leader, appeared to impel Nasser
to support Syria in a quarrel
with Israel over border clashes.
The crisis mounted slowly but
steadily since last fall, as if by
its own momentum.
Now, once again, the Middle
East looks at the unwelcome
prospect of general war.
