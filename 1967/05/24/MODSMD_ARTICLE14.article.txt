An exhibit called "East Palo Alto: Rebellion or Assimilation?" is
on display in the Experiment building. It is a photographic display
of East Palo Alto with an accompanying tape of interviews of East
Palo Alto residents. The exhibit is the product of the Experiment's
East Palo Alto seminar, and will stay on display through Satur
day. The seminar also produced a report on the question of en
franchising East Palo Alto, which will be released next week.
