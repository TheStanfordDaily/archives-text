# Hans Morgenthau:
## Intellectualâ€”Expert, Ideologist, Prophet 
### H. RENTON ROLPH 
llans J. Morgenthau, smiling
to the morning sun while puf
fing on a small after-breakfast
Cigar, ambled down the front
Steps of the St. Francis Hotel
yesterday morning to greet
three Stanford students waiting
to escort him to the campus.
Introductions over, they start
ed toward the freeway and Palo
Alto as Dr. Morgenthau, speak
ing in a resonant German ac
cent, began to respond to stu
dent questions with his quiet,
calm force of mind. The miles
to Stanford began to shoot by.
The speed of the car down the
west shore of the Bay seemed
inconsonant with the measured
pace and control of Morgen
thau's critical mind.
And so one of the students
asked him what is the function
of the intellectual in a society
caught up by speed and change
and what is his relationship
with the Administration.
The Intellectual
"The intellectual's function is
threefold, that is, there are three
types. First, the expert who does

inot question the goals, only
seeks the improvement of the
means. Second, the ideologist
who invests policy with the ap
peal of virtue and wisdom. Third,
the prophet who must serve out
side the policy-making body as
critic and seer. The Defense De
partment's Rand Corporation
does not fulfill this prophetic
role, since we cannot give it the
weight of an outsider."
Speaking specifically about
American mass education and
democracy, Dr. Morgenthau a
verred that education for excel
lence is necessarily an elitist
concept. "We have, in America,
watered down elitist education
and distorted the reality of try
ing to educate everyone. You
need two different types of edu
cation, one for the masses and
one for the elite."
Dr. Morgenthau felt concern
that many universities have be
came so deeply involved with
the execution of government re
search. He explained, "These
universities have become ser
vice institutions. There ought to
be some institutions which re

fuse to work for the govern
ment and defense. If a great
deal of a school's resources
come from the government, it
will be very careful not to em
barrass that government."
Need Teachers
After learning of the Stanford
concept of residence education,
he showed skepticism, recalling
his own experience in college
when he lived in rooms outside
his campuses in Germany and
Geneva. "I am not sure about
gimmickry. If you have teach
ers who deal with the vital prob
lems, you learn. If you don't
have them, residence gimmickry
will not help."
Nearing Redwood City, the
conversation turned to the ques
tion of the generation gap. Dr.
Morgenthau, who was born in
1904, emphasized that the gen
eration gap in 1967 is actually
a value gap, because young peo
ple see corruption of values
throughout society. "This value
gap is much more fundamental,
much more dangerous for
America than any generation
gap," he warned. "The hippies

are not an aberration, they are
indicative of the trend of all
young America. The value gap
today will have a lasting effect
on the nation."
Dr. Morgenthau, for the last
ten years has been a firm oppo
nent of all American military
action on the mainland of Asia.
However, he hesitated to try
to persuade any young man,
even his own son, to any one
position on the draft in the face
of the Vietnam predicament.
"My son has his physical on the
30th of May. But serving or not
is a matter of individual con
science. However, I will say
that I would probably refuse to
go to Vietnam."
Army Problem
Noting the recent defeat of
Senator Hatfield's voluntary
army bill, Dr. Morgenthau
doubted whether this type of
army would be possible in the
United States. "A strong profes
sional army," he continued,
might become a threat to Amer
ican institutions. It would not
be representative. Of course, the
present one isn't either."
As the car turned off the Bay
shox-e at Embarcadero Avenue,
one student asked Dr. Morgen
thau to read the text of the
Campus Coordinating Commit
tee petition which calls for a
selective C.O. classification, spe
cifically against the current war.
"I agree with that statement,"
he commented. "If there were
enough people who would avail
themselves of this, the govern
fment could not pursue its policy
in Vietnam."
Later at lunch in Stern's Ser

ra House dining room, the topic
shifted to the specific American
policy in Vietnam. Dr. Morgen
thau felt that our policy there
is based upon a "psychopatho
logical distortion of reality. At
this point a psychiatrist would
be helpful in analyzing what we
are doing."
Negotiate?
Questions buzzed toward Mor
genthau from around the table.
Negotiations? "We cannot nego
goiate because we deny the re
ality of the Viet Cong. If you
don't want to negotiate with
the Viet Cong, you don't want
to negotiate. Ho Chi Minh won't
negotiate because he remembers
his betrayal by the French in
1954. We are also asking him to
negotiate on the basis of defeat
and he has not yet been de
feated." Escalation? "Escalation
is like Greek tragedy, just in
escapable. You may do it slow
ly, choose this way or that, but
escalate you must."
Morgenthau asserted that we
should completely disengage
from mainland Asia, following
the advice of Eisenhower and
Mac Arthur. "We should hold the
island chain, as Dean Acheson
advised in 1950." But Morgen
thau has been amazed at Soviet
restraint considering the gravity
of what America is doing in
Asia. This is especially so since
Russian friends have told him
that they cannot afford to let
a fellow socialist national fall,
whether China or North Viet
nam. Morgenthau exclaimed, "I
am surprised that the Russians
haven't sold the North a sub
marine."

who invests policy with the ap

the prophet who must serve out
side the policy-making body as
critic and seer. The Defense De
partment's Rand Corporation
does not fulfill this prophetic
role, since we cannot give it the
weight of an outsider."
Speaking specifically about
American mass education and
democracy, Dr. Morgenthau a
verred that education for excel
lence is necessarily an elitist
concept. "We have, in America,
watered down elitist education
and distorted the reality of try
ing to educate everyone. You
need two different types of edu
cation, one for the masses and
one for the elite."
Dr. Morgenthau felt concern
that many universities have be
came so deeply involved with
the execution of government re
search. He explained, "These
universities have become ser
vice institutions. There ought to
be some institutions which re

fuse to work for the govern
ment and defense. If a great
deal of a school's resources
come from the government, it
will be very careful not to em
barrass that government."
Need Teachers
After learning of the Stanford
concept of residence education,
he showed skepticism, recalling
his own experience in college
when he lived in rooms outside
his campuses in Germany and
Geneva. "I am not sure about
gimmickry. If you have teach
ers who deal with the vital prob
lems, you learn. If you don't
have them, residence gimmickry
will not help."
Nearing Redwood City, the
conversation turned to the ques
tion of the generation gap. Dr.
Morgenthau, who was born in
1904, emphasized that the gen
eration gap in 1967 is actually
a value gap, because young peo
ple see corruption of values
throughout society. "This value
gap is much more fundamental,
much more dangerous for
America than any generation
gap," he warned. "The hippies

are not an aberration, they are
indicative of the trend of all
young America. The value gap
today will have a lasting effect
on the nation."
Dr. Morgenthau, for the last
ten years has been a firm oppo
nent of all American military
action on the mainland of Asia.
However, he hesitated to try
to persuade any young man,
even his own son, to any one
position on the draft in the face
of the Vietnam predicament.
"My son has his physical on the
30th of May. But serving or not
is a matter of individual con
science. However, I will say
that I would probably refuse to
go to Vietnam."
Army Problem
Noting the recent defeat of
Senator Hatfield's voluntary
army bill, Dr. Morgenthau
doubted whether this type of
army would be possible in the
United States. "A strong profes
sional army," he continued,
might become a threat to Amer
ican institutions. It would not
be representative. Of course, the
present one isn't either."
As the car turned off the Bay
shox-e at Embarcadero Avenue,
one student asked Dr. Morgen
thau to read the text of the
Campus Coordinating Commit
tee petition which calls for a
selective C.O. classification, spe
cifically against the current war.
"I agree with that statement,"
he commented. "If there were
enough people who would avail
themselves of this, the govern
fment could not pursue its policy
in Vietnam."
Later at lunch in Stern's Ser

ra House dining room, the topic
shifted to the specific American
policy in Vietnam. Dr. Morgen
thau felt that our policy there
is based upon a "psychopatho
logical distortion of reality. At
this point a psychiatrist would
be helpful in analyzing what we
are doing."

Questions buzzed toward Mor
genthau from around the table.
Negotiations? "We cannot nego
goiate because we deny the re
ality of the Viet Cong. If you
don't want to negotiate with
the Viet Cong, you don't want
to negotiate. Ho Chi Minh won't
negotiate because he remembers
his betrayal by the French in
1954. We are also asking him to
negotiate on the basis of defeat
and he has not yet been de
feated." Escalation? "Escalation
is like Greek tragedy, just in
escapable. You may do it slow
ly, choose this way or that, but
escalate you must."
Morgenthau asserted that we
should completely disengage
from mainland Asia, following
the advice of Eisenhower and
Mac Arthur. "We should hold the
island chain, as Dean Acheson
advised in 1950." But Morgen
thau has been amazed at Soviet
restraint considering the gravity
of what America is doing in
Asia. This is especially so since
Russian friends have told him
that they cannot afford to let
a fellow socialist national fall,
whether China or North Viet
nam. Morgenthau exclaimed, "I
am surprised that the Russians
haven't sold the North a sub
marine."
llans J. Morgenthau, smiling
to the morning sun while puf

Cigar, ambled down the front
Steps of the St. Francis Hotel
yesterday morning to greet
three Stanford students waiting
to escort him to the campus.
Introductions over, they start
ed toward the freeway and Palo
Alto as Dr. Morgenthau, speak
ing in a resonant German ac
cent, began to respond to stu
dent questions with his quiet,
calm force of mind. The miles
to Stanford began to shoot by.
The speed of the car down the
west shore of the Bay seemed
inconsonant with the measured

And so one of the students
asked him what is the function

concept of residence education,
he showed skepticism, recalling
his own experience in college
when he lived in rooms outside
his campuses in Germany and
Geneva. "I am not sure about
gimmickry. If you have teach
ers who deal with the vital prob
lems, you learn. If you don't
have them, residence gimmickry
will not help."
Nearing Redwood City, the
conversation turned to the ques
tion of the generation gap. Dr.
Morgenthau, who was born in
1904, emphasized that the gen
eration gap in 1967 is actually
a value gap, because young peo
ple see corruption of values
throughout society. "This value
gap is much more fundamental,
much more dangerous for
America than any generation
gap," he warned. "The hippies

are not an aberration, they are
indicative of the trend of all
young America. The value gap
today will have a lasting effect
on the nation."
Dr. Morgenthau, for the last
ten years has been a firm oppo
nent of all American military
action on the mainland of Asia.
However, he hesitated to try
to persuade any young man,
even his own son, to any one
position on the draft in the face
of the Vietnam predicament.
"My son has his physical on the
30th of May. But serving or not
is a matter of individual con
science. However, I will say
that I would probably refuse to
go to Vietnam."
Army Problem
Noting the recent defeat of
Senator Hatfield's voluntary
army bill, Dr. Morgenthau
doubted whether this type of
army would be possible in the
United States. "A strong profes
sional army," he continued,
might become a threat to Amer
ican institutions. It would not
be representative. Of course, the
present one isn't either."
As the car turned off the Bay
shox-e at Embarcadero Avenue,
one student asked Dr. Morgen
thau to read the text of the
Campus Coordinating Commit
tee petition which calls for a
selective C.O. classification, spe
cifically against the current war.
"I agree with that statement,"
he commented. "If there were
enough people who would avail
themselves of this, the govern
fment could not pursue its policy
in Vietnam."
Later at lunch in Stern's Ser

ra House dining room, the topic
shifted to the specific American
policy in Vietnam. Dr. Morgen
thau felt that our policy there
is based upon a "psychopatho
logical distortion of reality. At
this point a psychiatrist would
be helpful in analyzing what we
are doing."
Negotiate?
Questions buzzed toward Mor
genthau from around the table.
Negotiations? "We cannot nego
goiate because we deny the re
ality of the Viet Cong. If you
don't want to negotiate with
the Viet Cong, you don't want
to negotiate. Ho Chi Minh won't
negotiate because he remembers
his betrayal by the French in
1954. We are also asking him to
negotiate on the basis of defeat
and he has not yet been de
feated." Escalation? "Escalation
is like Greek tragedy, just in
escapable. You may do it slow
ly, choose this way or that, but
escalate you must."
Morgenthau asserted that we
should completely disengage
from mainland Asia, following
the advice of Eisenhower and
Mac Arthur. "We should hold the
island chain, as Dean Acheson
advised in 1950." But Morgen
thau has been amazed at Soviet
restraint considering the gravity
of what America is doing in
Asia. This is especially so since
Russian friends have told him
that they cannot afford to let
a fellow socialist national fall,
whether China or North Viet
nam. Morgenthau exclaimed, "I
am surprised that the Russians
haven't sold the North a sub
marine."
llans J. Morgenthau, smiling
to the morning sun while puf
fing on a small after-breakfast
Cigar, ambled down the front
Steps of the St. Francis Hotel
yesterday morning to greet
three Stanford students waiting
to escort him to the campus.
Introductions over, they start
ed toward the freeway and Palo
Alto as Dr. Morgenthau, speak
ing in a resonant German ac
cent, began to respond to stu
dent questions with his quiet,
calm force of mind. The miles
to Stanford began to shoot by.
The speed of the car down the
west shore of the Bay seemed
inconsonant with the measured
pace and control of Morgen
thau's critical mind.
And so one of the students
asked him what is the function
of the intellectual in a society
caught up by speed and change
and what is his relationship
with the Administration.
The Intellectual
"The intellectual's function is
threefold, that is, there are three
types. First, the expert who does

inot question the goals, only
seeks the improvement of the
means. Second, the ideologist
who invests policy with the ap
peal of virtue and wisdom. Third,
the prophet who must serve out
side the policy-making body as
critic and seer. The Defense De
partment's Rand Corporation
does not fulfill this prophetic
role, since we cannot give it the
weight of an outsider."
Speaking specifically about
American mass education and
democracy, Dr. Morgenthau a
verred that education for excel
lence is necessarily an elitist
concept. "We have, in America,
watered down elitist education
and distorted the reality of try
ing to educate everyone. You
need two different types of edu
cation, one for the masses and
one for the elite."
Dr. Morgenthau felt concern
that many universities have be
came so deeply involved with
the execution of government re
search. He explained, "These
universities have become ser
vice institutions. There ought to
be some institutions which re

fuse to work for the govern
ment and defense. If a great
deal of a school's resources
come from the government, it
will be very careful not to em
barrass that government."
