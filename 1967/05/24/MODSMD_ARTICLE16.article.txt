# Students To Serve In D.C.; Job Competition Increasing
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
More than 70 Stanford stu
dents will spend the summer
'working in Washington, D.C.,
under the auspices of Stanford
p-jn-Washington (SIW) Mike San
:dler, program coordinator, an
nounced yesterday.
At least 46 students will work
ft>n Capitol Hill, for Congress
men, Senators, and Congres
sional committees. Another 25 or
30 students will hold federal
[agency jobs, and 6 or 7 students
'will participate in a new pro
gram in Sacramento. Three oth
,\er possible Capitol Hill jobs
have not been filled yet.
Last year, SIW sent approxi
mately 100 students to summer
jobs in the nation's capital. The
decline in the number placed for
this summer, explained Sandler,
been caused by increased
[competition from other universi
ties that now have intern pro
i grams.
More Competition
With the increased competi
tion making it more difficult to
•find Capitol Hill jobs, Sandler
usaid the SIW committee was
jquite pleased with the place-
Jment of more than 70 students.
»He noted that increased compe
tition means Congressmen are
more likely to choose students
from schools in their areas,
i In total number of students
placed, Stanford usually ranks
near the top, with the Ivy
League schools.
Sandler noted that although
half the SIW interns placed on
the Hill are from California,
only slightly more than one
third of the jobs have come from
the California delegation to Con
gress.
In this state, Berkeley, UCLA,
Fresno State, Occidental Col
lege, and others have initiated
programs similar to SIW in re
cent years. Like SIW, most of
these programs operate under
alumni sponsorship.
Although supported by alum
ni, SIW is organized by student
volunteers. This year, Mike San
dler has been assisted by Craig
Murphy, Bill Rosenfeld, Chuck
Ludlam, Sue Meyer, and Bob
> Nakatani.
, Financially, SIW is supported
solely by private contributions.
Often, interns will not be able
to get salaried jobs from a Con
gressman, but will receive a stip
end from SIW. Sandler observed
that this year subsidies have had
to be increased, because the com
petition for the limited number
of paying jobs was so keen.
"Currently, we're $1300 short

of funds," said Sandler. SIW will
try to raise the additional mon
ey, above the $5000 now commit
ted, to cover the deficit, but if a
deficit remains, interns will be
asked to help balance the books.
The reason for the deficit, ex
plained Sandler, was that "a ten
tative offer for financial assist
ance was subsequently with
drawn."
"Stanford has a fine reputa
tion on the Hill," said Sandler.
With competition as it now
exists, internships might remain
as SIW jobs year after year.
"At the end of each summer
we ask each Congressman and
Senator to send in an evaluation
sheet. With only one exception,
the evaluation sheets were fa
vorable last summer," he said.
Three former interns now have
permanent jobs on the Hill.
The federal agency jobs range
from a rating of GS3 to GS9.
Typical jobs might be with the
Peace Corps, The Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity, of the State
Department. Many of these jobs
require specialized training, and
are designed for graduate stu
dents.
Special Seminars
The SIW summer program
will offer seminars and meetings
with prominent men in public
life in Washington. The Berkeley
and UCLA programs provide
similar opportunities. Between
the three programs, one can
probably find a good speaker
any day of the week, Sandler
noted.
The final meeting for SIW in
terns will be Thursday at 4:15
p.m. in Tresidder Union. Sum
mer plans will be discussed, and
summer officers elected.
Students working for Con
gressmen are: Carl Anduri,
Ralph Baxter, Chuck Bell, Bill
Berry, Ron Bogard, Walt Car
penti, John Chakmak, Tracy
Chapman, Mike Daly, Penny
Forney, Jim Fotenos, Jay Ed

Students working for Senators
are: Robert Cheek, James Ching,
Chris Hailwood, Howard Holme,
Jon Littlefield, Jim Marlar, John
Mundt, Paul Randau, Sandy Sha

, Financially, SIW is supported
solely by private contributions.
Often, interns will not be able
to get salaried jobs from a Con
gressman, but will receive a stip
end from SIW. Sandler observed
that this year subsidies have had
to be increased, because the com
petition for the limited number
of paying jobs was so keen.
"Currently, we're $1300 short

of funds," said Sandler. SIW will
try to raise the additional mon
ey, above the $5000 now commit
ted, to cover the deficit, but if a
deficit remains, interns will be
asked to help balance the books.
The reason for the deficit, ex
plained Sandler, was that "a ten
tative offer for financial assist
ance was subsequently with
drawn."
"Stanford has a fine reputa
tion on the Hill," said Sandler.
With competition as it now
exists, internships might remain
as SIW jobs year after year.
"At the end of each summer
we ask each Congressman and
Senator to send in an evaluation
sheet. With only one exception,
the evaluation sheets were fa
vorable last summer," he said.
Three former interns now have
permanent jobs on the Hill.
The federal agency jobs range
from a rating of GS3 to GS9.
Typical jobs might be with the
Peace Corps, The Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity, of the State
Department. Many of these jobs
require specialized training, and
are designed for graduate stu
dents.
Special Seminars
The SIW summer program
will offer seminars and meetings
with prominent men in public
life in Washington. The Berkeley
and UCLA programs provide
similar opportunities. Between
the three programs, one can
probably find a good speaker
any day of the week, Sandler
noted.
The final meeting for SIW in
terns will be Thursday at 4:15
p.m. in Tresidder Union. Sum
mer plans will be discussed, and
summer officers elected.
Students working for Con
gressmen are: Carl Anduri,

More than 70 Stanford stu
dents will spend the summer
'working in Washington, D.C.,
under the auspices of Stanford
p-jn-Washington (SIW) Mike San
:dler, program coordinator, an
nounced yesterday.
At least 46 students will work
ft>n Capitol Hill, for Congress
men, Senators, and Congres
sional committees. Another 25 or
30 students will hold federal
[agency jobs, and 6 or 7 students
'will participate in a new pro
gram in Sacramento. Three oth
,\er possible Capitol Hill jobs
have not been filled yet.
Last year, SIW sent approxi
mately 100 students to summer
jobs in the nation's capital. The
decline in the number placed for
this summer, explained Sandler,
been caused by increased
[competition from other universi
ties that now have intern pro
i grams.
More Competition
With the increased competi
tion making it more difficult to
•find Capitol Hill jobs, Sandler
usaid the SIW committee was
jquite pleased with the place-
Jment of more than 70 students.
»He noted that increased compe
tition means Congressmen are
more likely to choose students
from schools in their areas,
i In total number of students
placed, Stanford usually ranks
near the top, with the Ivy
League schools.
Sandler noted that although
half the SIW interns placed on
the Hill are from California,
only slightly more than one
third of the jobs have come from
the California delegation to Con
gress.
In this state, Berkeley, UCLA,
Fresno State, Occidental Col
lege, and others have initiated
programs similar to SIW in re
cent years. Like SIW, most of
these programs operate under
alumni sponsorship.

volunteers. This year, Mike San

More than 70 Stanford stu
dents will spend the summer
'working in Washington, D.C.,
under the auspices of Stanford
p-jn-Washington (SIW) Mike San
:dler, program coordinator, an
nounced yesterday.
At least 46 students will work
ft>n Capitol Hill, for Congress
men, Senators, and Congres
sional committees. Another 25 or
30 students will hold federal
[agency jobs, and 6 or 7 students
'will participate in a new pro
gram in Sacramento. Three oth
,\er possible Capitol Hill jobs
have not been filled yet.
Last year, SIW sent approxi
mately 100 students to summer
jobs in the nation's capital. The
decline in the number placed for
this summer, explained Sandler,
been caused by increased
[competition from other universi
ties that now have intern pro
i grams.
More Competition
With the increased competi
tion making it more difficult to
•find Capitol Hill jobs, Sandler
usaid the SIW committee was
jquite pleased with the place-
Jment of more than 70 students.
»He noted that increased compe
tition means Congressmen are
more likely to choose students
from schools in their areas,
i In total number of students
placed, Stanford usually ranks
near the top, with the Ivy
League schools.
Sandler noted that although
half the SIW interns placed on
the Hill are from California,
only slightly more than one
third of the jobs have come from
the California delegation to Con
gress.
In this state, Berkeley, UCLA,
Fresno State, Occidental Col
lege, and others have initiated
programs similar to SIW in re
cent years. Like SIW, most of
these programs operate under
alumni sponsorship.
Although supported by alum
ni, SIW is organized by student
volunteers. This year, Mike San
dler has been assisted by Craig
Murphy, Bill Rosenfeld, Chuck
Ludlam, Sue Meyer, and Bob
> Nakatani.
, Financially, SIW is supported
solely by private contributions.
Often, interns will not be able
to get salaried jobs from a Con
gressman, but will receive a stip
end from SIW. Sandler observed
that this year subsidies have had
to be increased, because the com
petition for the limited number
of paying jobs was so keen.
"Currently, we're $1300 short

of funds," said Sandler. SIW will
try to raise the additional mon
ey, above the $5000 now commit
ted, to cover the deficit, but if a
deficit remains, interns will be
asked to help balance the books.
The reason for the deficit, ex
plained Sandler, was that "a ten
tative offer for financial assist
ance was subsequently with
drawn."
"Stanford has a fine reputa
tion on the Hill," said Sandler.
With competition as it now
exists, internships might remain
as SIW jobs year after year.
"At the end of each summer
we ask each Congressman and
Senator to send in an evaluation
sheet. With only one exception,
the evaluation sheets were fa
vorable last summer," he said.
Three former interns now have
permanent jobs on the Hill.
The federal agency jobs range
from a rating of GS3 to GS9.
Typical jobs might be with the
Peace Corps, The Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity, of the State
Department. Many of these jobs
require specialized training, and
are designed for graduate stu
dents.
Special Seminars
The SIW summer program
will offer seminars and meetings
with prominent men in public
life in Washington. The Berkeley
and UCLA programs provide
similar opportunities. Between
the three programs, one can
probably find a good speaker
any day of the week, Sandler
noted.
The final meeting for SIW in
terns will be Thursday at 4:15
p.m. in Tresidder Union. Sum
mer plans will be discussed, and
summer officers elected.
