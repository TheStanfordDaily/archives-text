Stanford - in - San Francisco?
Yoice Project writer - teacher
Mitchell Goodman has proposed
tfie establishment of a student
oenter in The City.
I Goodman explained that
though many Stanford students
s&end six months at a Euro
pean campus, unfortunately few
tyecome well acquainted with
San Francisco during their four
fjr more years here. He empha
sized the rich cultural diver-
and charm of San Fran
cisco, and strongly advocates
its integration into the Stanford
( "For a minimal cost the Uni
versity could buy several old
ijouses and convert them into
attractive place for students
to stay when they come to the
city," Goodman suggested. "It
could be a small-scale foreign
campus program enabling pro
fessors and their classes to

move into the city for a w k
or more to study certain scoii
logical problems, for instance.
I would also set up a coffee
house and promote cross-fertili
zation with students and faculty
from Berkeley, Mills, and other
neighboring campuses. Team
teaching could be arranged," he
added.
Goodman points out that the
"whole academic construction
from first grade on is so defec
tive and institutionalized that by
the time a student reaches col
lege, he has to free himself
from the structure in order to
be himself â€” which is why he
comes to college. When stu lents
can get out ot the rigid struc
ture, they begin to liberate
themselves in interesting ways."
San Francisco could provide a
valuable educational alternative,
according to Goodman.
Though his contact with stu
dents has been limited during

his one quarter here, Goodman
has noticed "a good deal of
provincialism in the student
body. Many come from small
towns and have never been in
a city in any sense. Students
are isolated here and don't know
how to approach another world.

They should be exposed to a
larger community ... to the
dark side of a city, otherwise
they are absenting themselves
from reality."
The Filmore Anditorium
seems to be one of the only parts
of San Francisco that students

frequent, said Goodman. He re
ferred to "A Poem with a Foot
note," a work praising San Fran
cisco by Andrei Voznesensky.
"San Francisco is a significant
point of reference for this most
important Russian contempor
ary poet," Goodman explained.
"There's hardly any need to
go into the opportunities avail
able in that city. Golden Gate
Park is a great work of art in
the most literal sense . . . San
Francisco is the most walkable
city with numerous possibilities
for sheer surprise. The move
ment up and down the hills is
sensual, aesthetic experience;
the view changes constantly,"
Goodman emphasized.
Goodman said that the chang
ing forms of American life ap
parent in the Haight-Ashbury
district are another reason for
students "to get behind the
myth" and actively observe and
study. "San Francisco is a whole
to relate to, not an ingrown ex
perience as campus life tends
to be. The vocabulary and points
of reference here are too limit
ed. The deep split between peo
ple of central cities and those
from suburban communities is
an old problem more sharply
drawn now. A city experience
can more quickly alert students
to new sociological and aesthetic
possibilities," Goodman stated.
