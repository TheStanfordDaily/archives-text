# Professors Review Science Requisites
## 
### CHARLES THIERIOT 
It became apparent at a re
cent faculty meeting of the
School of Humanities and Scien
ces that students are not the
only ones who feel a change or
possible broadening of the pres
ent general studies science re
quirements is in order.
Professor Konrad Krauskopf,
associate dean of the School of
Earth Sciences and member of
the National Academy of Scien
ces, said in an interview yester
day that a science requirement
is good for most students, but
should not necessarily be en
forced on all. However, those
excused from a science require
ment should have a rigorous
substitute. Krauskopf comment
ed, "The basic course selection
is good, but it might be useful
to experiment with other cour
ses dealing with the history of
science and the relation of sci
ence to social problems."
' He felt that since the empha
*sis today is on research in
specialized fields that it would
be difficult to find the money or
• the professors with incentive to
; teach a historically orientated
survey course, for example. It
is a great mistake to try to set
•up one definite method to fit
the needs of all students.
Among others concerned with
this problem is Professor Don
ald Kennedy, executive head of
the Biological Sciences Depart
ment, who feels that all stu
dents should have some science
background because all our mod
ern social problems relate to
science in some way. "The inter
phase between science and so
ciety has been greatly neglect
ed."
Kennedy feels that you do not
.necessarily achieve a proper
understanding by simply saying
take 17 units including a lab.
-"We should look for a different
format to achieve this. There is
no such thing as scientific meth
odology, there is just good think
ing and bad thinking."
He said it would be better to
give students a few relevant
facts about science and society
because the sciences in them
selves have become so compli
cated. "There should be a rigor
ous system for those interested
and a general course composed
,for the general studies students.
Although, Biology 4 and 5 and
the Physical Science series are
fin a sense survey courses de

signed for general studies right
now."
Professor Page of the Geo
logy Department feels that the
science requirements should be
changed because they force stu
dents to take courses they re
bel against. "We would like to
build enthusiasm and interest
in science, but this is stultified
by coercion."
He went on to say that when
a teacher confronts a class
where the vast majority of stu
dents are not interested in the
course and are only taking it
as a means to fulfill their re
quirement it becomes dull and
boring for both student and pro
fessor as well as being a great
waste of time.
"We should minimize forcing
students to take specific cour
ses and try to encourage initia
tive on their part."
Humanities and Science Dean
Robert Sears said students
should simply be allowed to
take courses they are interested
in. However, students must be
made aware of other fields as
a supplement to their specific
field.
Dean Sears feels the present
General Studies Program should
be abandoned and a totally new
system adopted. "We should
start with a whole new general
studies system rather than simp
ly enlarging the alternatives."
