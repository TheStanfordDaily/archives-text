# SES Entertains New Proposals
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Six more members of the Stanford
community presented their views to
the Study of Education last night on
the subjects of general studies, ma
jors and the freshman year.
Only one member of the Steering
Committee was present at the open
hearings — the staff director, Dean
Robert Hind. The remarks were tape
recorded and will be transcribed in
summary for distribution to the other
members of the Steering Committee.
Classics Professor Brooks Otis pro
posed that the present General Stu
dies program be scrapped completely
and replaced by something else. He
cited a need for better personal rela
tions between students and teachers
such as one finds in a small college
general education program. He added
there has been no real investigation
of what is in the courses meeting
general studies requirements.
Study in Depth
Otis suggested students should take
courses introducing them to what is
going on in all departments of the
University, to be followed by study
in depth of each survey. He critcized
the present trend of taking one ele
mentary course after another.
Students should not be forced to
take courses they don't want, Otis
said. If a student begins a certain
course of study, he went on, he should
be able to drop it easily if he decides
he doesn't like it. The small college
system at Oxford and Cambridge,
Otis said, should be tried out at Stan
ford. He said it may not suit all stu
dents but those who want it should
have the option.
History Professor Paul Seaver
spoke specifically about the Western
Civilization program and made a
"plea for change." The present pro
gram, he said, is based on two ques
tionable premises. First he said he
doubted there is any discreet thing
which one can define as "Western
civilization."He said there is no agree
ment, when the subject is discussed
among Western Civ instructors, about
what it is or should be.
Second, he questioned the idea of

a "great books" course, saying it was
impossible to define and should not,
in any case, necessarily be taught by
historians. The idea of Western Civ
as a common course for all freshmen
is false, he said. Instructors have dif
ferent methods of teaching and em
phasize different areas of the "com
mon" syllabus. In addition, he said,
he saw no good argument for the
need of a common intellectual experi
ence for all freshmen.
Freshman Susan Ott spoke first of
the freshman English program, say
ing that more choice is needed as to
subject matter. For examples, she
said, students should have the op
portunity to qmphasize drama or
creative writing in their freshman
year. She also suggested that there
be separate classes for students with
no particular interest in English ex
cept to fulfill General Studies require
ments.
Failure to Unify
She said if Western Civ is an at
tempt to unify the freshman experi
ence, it is failing. All instructors are
different, she said, but the problem
might be lessened by scheduling more
lectures.
She added that there is an uneven
emphasis on subject matter from sec
tion to section.
Miss Ott praised the freshman semi
nars, citing their smallness, informal
ity and lack of emphasis on grades.
Grades, she said, should be eliminated
for the freshman year, because stu
dents are often silent in class for fear
of hurting their grades. Moreover, she
said, it was not her impression that
graduate schools screening applicants
cared much about one's freshiman
grades.
She criticized the science require
ments for General Studies as "totally
irrelevant" for many people. She sug
gested more study of the thought
processes and scientific theory.
Get Away
Len Strauss, graduate in the School
of Education and veteran of the Peace
Corps, said he has been "amazed at
how many students feel they learned

more out of the classroom." He said
it was good for students to get out of
the college routine and spend more
time away from college. He proposed
a five year undergraduate program
in which time off from classes would
be considered part of one's education
and make one therefore exempt from
the draft.
He also proposed complete auto
nomy in living conditions, citing Hos
kins House (women's apartments) as
an example. He said there should be
more self-determination in course
work and active participation in the
classroom. He said college teachers
should be taught to teach better.
Freshman David Pugh emphasized
a need for a common core of study
in the freshman year. He said com
pletely free choice does not make a
student confront many possible cour
ses. Western Civ is necessary, he said,
to unify the freshman experience and
thus has something of a social func
tion.
Pugh said the generalized sequence
of study should be spread out over a

college student's four-year career and
the sequence should not have to be
strictly followed. Science requirements
he said, should proceed from the
overview and promote critical think
ing ability rather than the learning
of a body of facts which quickly be
comes outdated.
SES open hearings will continue
today. The Residence Policies Com
mittee, headed by History Professor
Lewis Spitz, will hold sessions in
Room 143 of the Undergraduate Li
brary today from 7:30 to 10 p.m. and
tomorrow from 4 to 6 p.m. Ideas and
proposals may also be submitted in
writing.

the Study of Education last night on
the subjects of general studies, ma
jors and the freshman year.
Only one member of the Steering
Committee was present at the open
hearings — the staff director, Dean
Robert Hind. The remarks were tape
recorded and will be transcribed in
summary for distribution to the other
members of the Steering Committee.
Classics Professor Brooks Otis pro
posed that the present General Stu
dies program be scrapped completely
and replaced by something else. He
cited a need for better personal rela
tions between students and teachers
such as one finds in a small college
general education program. He added
there has been no real investigation
of what is in the courses meeting
general studies requirements.
Study in Depth
Otis suggested students should take
courses introducing them to what is
going on in all departments of the
University, to be followed by study
in depth of each survey. He critcized
the present trend of taking one ele
mentary course after another.
Students should not be forced to
take courses they don't want, Otis
said. If a student begins a certain
course of study, he went on, he should
be able to drop it easily if he decides
he doesn't like it. The small college
system at Oxford and Cambridge,
Otis said, should be tried out at Stan
ford. He said it may not suit all stu
dents but those who want it should
have the option.
History Professor Paul Seaver
spoke specifically about the Western
Civilization program and made a
"plea for change." The present pro
gram, he said, is based on two ques
tionable premises. First he said he
doubted there is any discreet thing
which one can define as "Western
civilization."He said there is no agree
ment, when the subject is discussed
among Western Civ instructors, about
what it is or should be.
Second, he questioned the idea of

a "great books" course, saying it was
impossible to define and should not,
in any case, necessarily be taught by
historians. The idea of Western Civ
as a common course for all freshmen
is false, he said. Instructors have dif
ferent methods of teaching and em
phasize different areas of the "com
mon" syllabus. In addition, he said,
he saw no good argument for the
need of a common intellectual experi
ence for all freshmen.
Freshman Susan Ott spoke first of
the freshman English program, say
ing that more choice is needed as to
subject matter. For examples, she
said, students should have the op
portunity to qmphasize drama or
creative writing in their freshman
year. She also suggested that there
be separate classes for students with
no particular interest in English ex
cept to fulfill General Studies require
ments.
Failure to Unify
She said if Western Civ is an at
tempt to unify the freshman experi
ence, it is failing. All instructors are
different, she said, but the problem
might be lessened by scheduling more
lectures.
She added that there is an uneven
emphasis on subject matter from sec
tion to section.
Miss Ott praised the freshman semi
nars, citing their smallness, informal
ity and lack of emphasis on grades.
Grades, she said, should be eliminated
for the freshman year, because stu
dents are often silent in class for fear
of hurting their grades. Moreover, she
said, it was not her impression that
graduate schools screening applicants
cared much about one's freshiman
grades.
She criticized the science require
ments for General Studies as "totally
irrelevant" for many people. She sug
gested more study of the thought
processes and scientific theory.
Get Away
Len Strauss, graduate in the School
of Education and veteran of the Peace
Corps, said he has been "amazed at
how many students feel they learned

more out of the classroom." He said
it was good for students to get out of
the college routine and spend more
time away from college. He proposed
a five year undergraduate program
in which time off from classes would
be considered part of one's education
and make one therefore exempt from
the draft.
He also proposed complete auto
nomy in living conditions, citing Hos
kins House (women's apartments) as
an example. He said there should be
more self-determination in course
work and active participation in the
classroom. He said college teachers
should be taught to teach better.
Freshman David Pugh emphasized
a need for a common core of study
in the freshman year. He said com
pletely free choice does not make a
student confront many possible cour
ses. Western Civ is necessary, he said,
to unify the freshman experience and
thus has something of a social func
tion.
Pugh said the generalized sequence
of study should be spread out over a

college student's four-year career and
the sequence should not have to be
strictly followed. Science requirements
he said, should proceed from the
overview and promote critical think
ing ability rather than the learning
of a body of facts which quickly be
comes outdated.
SES open hearings will continue
today. The Residence Policies Com
mittee, headed by History Professor
Lewis Spitz, will hold sessions in
Room 143 of the Undergraduate Li
brary today from 7:30 to 10 p.m. and
tomorrow from 4 to 6 p.m. Ideas and
proposals may also be submitted in
writing.

jors and the freshman year.
Only one member of the Steering
Committee was present at the open
hearings — the staff director, Dean
Robert Hind. The remarks were tape
recorded and will be transcribed in
summary for distribution to the other
members of the Steering Committee.
Classics Professor Brooks Otis pro
posed that the present General Stu
dies program be scrapped completely
and replaced by something else. He
cited a need for better personal rela
tions between students and teachers
such as one finds in a small college
general education program. He added
there has been no real investigation
of what is in the courses meeting
general studies requirements.
Study in Depth
Otis suggested students should take
courses introducing them to what is
going on in all departments of the
University, to be followed by study
in depth of each survey. He critcized
the present trend of taking one ele
mentary course after another.
Students should not be forced to
take courses they don't want, Otis
said. If a student begins a certain
course of study, he went on, he should
be able to drop it easily if he decides
he doesn't like it. The small college
system at Oxford and Cambridge,
Otis said, should be tried out at Stan
ford. He said it may not suit all stu
dents but those who want it should
have the option.
History Professor Paul Seaver
spoke specifically about the Western
Civilization program and made a
"plea for change." The present pro
gram, he said, is based on two ques
tionable premises. First he said he
doubted there is any discreet thing
which one can define as "Western
civilization."He said there is no agree
ment, when the subject is discussed
among Western Civ instructors, about
what it is or should be.
Second, he questioned the idea of

a "great books" course, saying it was
impossible to define and should not,
in any case, necessarily be taught by
historians. The idea of Western Civ
as a common course for all freshmen
is false, he said. Instructors have dif
ferent methods of teaching and em
phasize different areas of the "com
mon" syllabus. In addition, he said,
he saw no good argument for the
need of a common intellectual experi
ence for all freshmen.
Freshman Susan Ott spoke first of
the freshman English program, say
ing that more choice is needed as to
subject matter. For examples, she
said, students should have the op
portunity to qmphasize drama or
creative writing in their freshman
year. She also suggested that there
be separate classes for students with
no particular interest in English ex
cept to fulfill General Studies require
ments.
Failure to Unify
She said if Western Civ is an at
tempt to unify the freshman experi
ence, it is failing. All instructors are
different, she said, but the problem
might be lessened by scheduling more
lectures.
She added that there is an uneven
emphasis on subject matter from sec
tion to section.
Miss Ott praised the freshman semi
nars, citing their smallness, informal
ity and lack of emphasis on grades.
Grades, she said, should be eliminated
for the freshman year, because stu
dents are often silent in class for fear
of hurting their grades. Moreover, she
said, it was not her impression that
graduate schools screening applicants
cared much about one's freshiman
grades.
She criticized the science require
ments for General Studies as "totally
irrelevant" for many people. She sug
gested more study of the thought
processes and scientific theory.
Get Away
Len Strauss, graduate in the School
of Education and veteran of the Peace
Corps, said he has been "amazed at
how many students feel they learned

more out of the classroom." He said
it was good for students to get out of
the college routine and spend more
time away from college. He proposed
a five year undergraduate program
in which time off from classes would
be considered part of one's education
and make one therefore exempt from
the draft.
He also proposed complete auto
nomy in living conditions, citing Hos
kins House (women's apartments) as
an example. He said there should be
more self-determination in course
work and active participation in the
classroom. He said college teachers
should be taught to teach better.
Freshman David Pugh emphasized
a need for a common core of study
in the freshman year. He said com
pletely free choice does not make a
student confront many possible cour
ses. Western Civ is necessary, he said,
to unify the freshman experience and
thus has something of a social func
tion.
Pugh said the generalized sequence
of study should be spread out over a

college student's four-year career and
the sequence should not have to be
strictly followed. Science requirements
he said, should proceed from the
overview and promote critical think
ing ability rather than the learning
of a body of facts which quickly be
comes outdated.
SES open hearings will continue
today. The Residence Policies Com
mittee, headed by History Professor
Lewis Spitz, will hold sessions in
Room 143 of the Undergraduate Li
brary today from 7:30 to 10 p.m. and
tomorrow from 4 to 6 p.m. Ideas and
proposals may also be submitted in
writing.
