# Institute Emphasizes Total Education
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
Despite our generation's talk
of the mean and proper goals
of education, most "innovations"
have remained essentially at
the intellectual level. This is not
so at the Esalen Institute at
Big Sur, which is attracting an
increasing number of Stanford
students.
While accepting the intellec
tual as a basis for education,
Esalen supplements it with emo
tional and physical education.
This program, in which the only
subject one may study is him
self, has drawn widespread en
thusiasm in its relatively short
existence.
President of the American
Psychological Association, Ab
raham Maslow, describes it as
the most exciting experiment
in education in this country.
This article will deal with the
educational goals of Esalen and
the methods used in its semi
nars.

The Esalen program is de
signed to provide "exploration
of the Self, development of
awareness, further realization of
the human potential, and dis
covery of the essential whole
ness and unity which must
characterize any effective and
vital approach to learning."
If this sounds like an ambi
tious goal, Esalen's advocates
are quick to explain that the
goal is well founded upon ex
traordinary techniques, "gener
ally unknown to the public and
to much of the intellectual com
munity . . . many more are pres
ently under development."

How does the Esalen approach
to the individual differ from
Stanford's? In the words of Bill
Shurleff, who is in the group
planning the Esalen-at-Stanford
program, "At Stanford the pri
mary concern with the indivi
dual is intellectual. The intellec
tual is important but should not
be pursued exclusively."

to measure an object without

much to the social sciences as
to the physical sciences. Thus
the way in which we can under
stand ourselves is not merely to

measure but to experience to
tally. The Esalen program en
ables the individual to do just
that."
What is it that Esalen offers
to provide a new focus on edu
cation? Fritz Perls, the founder
of Gestalt therapy, for one
thing. Talking with one student
at a time as the others watch,
he has each describe one of his
dreams from the viewpoint of
every person and object in the
dream.
Gestalt Theory
The theory behind this ap
proach is that a dream consti
tutes an existential part of one's
life. Since the mind imposes a
meaningful whole on seemingly
disjointed objects, the various
parts of the dream can be inte
grated through an identification
process. The purpose is not to
change the individual's identity
but rather to make him identify
with aspects of his personality
which he has avoided and which
the dream brought out.
Another technique develops
sensory awareness or "physical
resensitization". Just as an artist
must "learn to see," Bernard
Gunther, the instructor of this
course, makes people learn to
use fully all of their senses. His

program comprises various ex
ercises for the senses.

Esalen At Stanford
The Esalen program at Stan
ford next fall will offer eight
weekends of seminars with in
structors affiliated with Esalen.
(Instructors at Esalen do not
teach there regularly, but visit
it for anywhere from a weekend
to a month.) Participating Stan
ford students, faculty, and staff
will be able to choose any four
of the weekends.
The tickets are currently on
sale in the Grove House, Room
9, between 5 and 6:30, and will
also be available on Reg Day of
Fall Quarter. Kathy Golding and
Bill Shurtleff are in charge of
sales. A brochure describing the
program will be distributed this
week.
The Esalen Institute has set
for itself a difficult task: the
realization of human potential.
Stanford students will have the
opportunity to judge its success
by participating in its unusual
seminars. In doing so they will

undergo at least a novel experi

dents claim they have, the ex
perience of their lives.

life. Since the mind imposes a

process. The purpose is not to
change the individual's identity
but rather to make him identify
with aspects of his personality

The Esalen program at Stan

(Instructors at Esalen do not
teach there regularly, but visit
it for anywhere from a weekend
to a month.) Participating Stan
ford students, faculty, and staff
will be able to choose any four
of the weekends.
The tickets are currently on
sale in the Grove House, Room

also be available on Reg Day of
Fall Quarter. Kathy Golding and
Bill Shurtleff are in charge of
sales. A brochure describing the

The Esalen Institute has set
for itself a difficult task: the
realization of human potential.
Stanford students will have the
opportunity to judge its success

undergo at least a novel experi

Despite our generation's talk
of the mean and proper goals

students.
While accepting the intellec
tual as a basis for education,

The Esalen program is de
signed to provide "exploration
of the Self, development of
awareness, further realization of
the human potential, and dis
covery of the essential whole

If this sounds like an ambi
