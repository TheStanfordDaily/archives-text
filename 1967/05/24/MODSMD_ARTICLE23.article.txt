# Crew Flashes Best In Western Sprints
## 
### JOHN HOTSON 
The Stanford crew drove to
the best team performance of
the Western Sprints and of the
history of Stanford oarsmen this
weekend in Los Angeles.
The Indians won both the
freshman and junior varsity
events and took a strong third
behind second place University
of Washington. A powerful
UCLA crew won the varsity
race.
The fourteen top collegiate
crews on the west coast partici
pated in the Sprints. Friday
and Saturday morning con
sisted of elimination heats with
the best six teams racing in
the finals Saturday afternoon.
The Frosh crew, stroked by
Nick Farwell, began the day
for Stanford by sweeping to a
two length victory before 4,000
spectators.

Stanford's junior varsity,
stroked by Mckim Barnes, then
came through in a nerve-wrack
ing race to out drive California
by inches in the last few
strokes.
Stanford's varsity rowed a
fine race but were simply out
powered by the best crew
UCLA has ever seen and prob
ably the best in the country.
Will Condon, Stanford coach,
was quite pleased with the
team performance. He stated,
"every man put out a tremend
ous effort and I am very proud
of the entire team."
The varsity boats now get
a few days to "relax" before
beginning training for the final
race in New York. Stanford, the
U. of W., and UCLA will all
travel east to challenge the
eastern crews to a three mile
dual June 17.
