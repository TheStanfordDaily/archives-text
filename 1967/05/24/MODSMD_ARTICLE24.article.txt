# Five Indian Linkmen To Shoot In NCAA's
## 
### 
Stanford will send five players
to the NCAA championships at
Shawnee - on - the â€¢ Deleware
CC and Pennsylvania U., Jiyie
21-24.
The Indians will play Cal to
day at Mira Vista CC for their
ninth victory against four dual
meet defeats this season. Last
year Stanford dropped five
matches, but almost took the
conference championship, losing
by three strokes. The Tribe also
placed seventh in the NCAA.
The NCAA team champion
ship is decided over the first 36
holes of the 72-hole individual
championship. Stanford took
second place to USC in the
AAWU meet last weekend 1146-

1170, while beating SC by eight
strokes in the last 36 holes.
The Trojans, conference cham
pions for four years and third
place finishers in the NCAA the
last three years, figure as a top
contender. The Trojans won 22
out of 24 matches this year.
Stanford lost to Troy,
on the Stanford course earlier
this year, though the match
could have been decided in favor
of Stanford on the last hole.
Tournament favorite in the
NCAA will be three-time de
fending champion Houston, win
ner in 7 of the last 9 champion
ships. Houston, however, lost
two Walker Cup players from
last year's team, Jim Grant and
Marty Fleckman.
