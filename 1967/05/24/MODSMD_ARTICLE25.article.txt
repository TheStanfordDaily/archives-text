Sports Editor, The Daily:
I (and quite a few others) am
at a loss for understanding why
our athletic department has vir
tually ignored soccer. While the
football team has at its aid at
least a half dozen fulltime
coaches, the soccer team enjoys
one coach, Mr Priddle, who has
found time off from his job as
grounds commissioner to train
the team on much less than the
salary of a p.e. instructor. Mr.
Priddle also singlehandedly
schedules as many games as he
can, and, to add injury to insult,
some of the cost of equipment
comes out of his own pocket.
One can safely say that the
Stanford soccer team's existence
rests on the unrewarded kind
ness of Mr. Priddle alone. And
when one says "unrewarded
kindness", bear in mind the
modesty of such an appraisal.
Now, I could somewhat under
stand the athletic department's
lack of interest in soccer if only
a dozen or so players ever came
out, but the team has been
known to have on its roster as
many as ninety very eager
members. Surely this is reason
enough to give Mr. Priddle at
least one full-time, experienced
soccer coach as his assistant.
Why does the athletic depart
ment, whose supposed goals are
to instill into students the vir
tues of fair play, leadership,
discipline, and a healthy body,
discriminate against the so
called minor sports like crew,
lacrosse, and soccer, many of

whose members have honorably
carried Stanford colors in na
tional competition? Is it the
somewhat foreign character of
soccer as a sport that accounts
ifor the athletic department's
lack of concern? Or is it just
that soccer is no money-making
sport?
What is the answer, Athletic
Department?
