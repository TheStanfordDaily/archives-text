# Legalize Marijuana
## 
### 
The divergence of values, standards and ideas
that passes under the handy title of "generation
gap" is perhaps nowhere so clearly exemplified
as in the markedly differing attitudes of today's
students and their elders toward the use of mari
juana. The scare headlines in the newspapers,
the sometimes angry, sometimes anguished quer
ies of parents, teachers and alumni, the closed
iftinded intransigence of public officials—all at
test to the horror with which the "over 30" gen
eration views the practice.
And seldom have so many been so wrong.
(J-
For it is hardly unfair to say that most fears
marijuana result from a smear campaign
equaled in recent times perhaps only by J. Edgar
Hoover's assault on Communism. The effects
produced by smoking or eating the flowering
tops of the hemp plant have been known for
several thousand years. More recently, extensive
2(
investigation has established quite precisely the
nature of these effects. Yet, overwhelming evi
dence to the contrary notwithstanding, the cham
pions of the established morality continue to
claim that marijuana is a narcotic, which it is
not, that it causes addiction, which it does not,
and that it leads to crime, insanity and heroin,
though all objective research shows these charges
to be without foundation.
In fact, the use of marijuana results in neither
addiction nor a need for ever increasing quan
tities to produce the desired effects. Nor do the
arguments that marijuana usually leads to real
narcotics stand up under scrutiny. By such rea
soning, one should also conclude that since most
criminals read comic books in their youth, comic

books lead to crime. All research on the matter
shows no such causal relationship exists and
most conclude as categorically as did Mayor La-
Guardia's special committee which in 1938 pro
duced the first carefully documented report on
the subject that "the use of marijuana does not
lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction."
The facts could hardly be clearer. At worst,
marijuana is a minor vice, no more deleterious
than tobacco, and no more debilitating than al
cohol. And to a growing number of people ques
tioning the long-standing Western myth that
Man at his most rational is Man at his highest,
it is an aid to a new level of consciousness, to a
new understanding of themselves.
Yet marijuana is everywhere treated as a dan
gerous drug and lumped together in legislation
with narcotics. In California the penalty for pos
sessing marijuana is one to ten years in prison;
for selling or giving it to a minor, 10 years to life.
In Colorado, the second offense of giving mari
juana to a person under 25 is a capital crime.
The injustice of such laws is widely recognized,
but prospects for their repeal are presently dim.
Misinformation, willful ignorance, and a
belief, common to every generation, that to move
the line of morality back one more step is to
break it —all these help explain the continued
intransigence. None justify it.
We therefore call for an end to the unwise and
often barbaric laws concerning marijuana. But
we do not look for their early repeal. For we
suspect that not until the "now" generation be
comes the "then" generation will today's sin
become the new standard of morality.
