## Vietnam: Why Not Build A Wall Now? 
### Fritz Schaefer 
In the Johns Hopkins Speech
qt April, 1965, President John
son stated clearly the American
purpose in Vietnam: "Our ob
jective is the independence of
.South Vietnam, and its freedom
from attack.' Although opinions
as to the actual conduct of the
War in Vietnam vary consider
ably, it is a fact that no matter
what measuring device is used,
the people of the United States
overwhelmingly support Presi
dent Johnson's limited anti-
Communist objective in Viet
nam.
For example, at the time of
the last full blown congressional
idebate on Vietnam, March 1966,
the House of Representatives
voted approval of the $4.8 bil
'lion military authorization bill
for Vietnam by a margin of
392 to 4. The Senate passed the
same bill 93 to 2.
At the same time, a move by
Wayne Morse to repeal the
broad grant of powers given
to President Johnson under the
August, 1964, "Tonkin Gulf Reso
lution" was defeated by a vote
of 92 to 5. On the somewhat
less informed level, the May
15, 1957 Gallup Poll shows that
74% of the American people
either feel that the War in
Vietnam is morally justified
(59%) or have no opinion on
the morality of the War (15%).
Appropriate Action
With these facts in mind,
wouldn't a reasonable question
for discussion and debate among
Stanford's "community of scho
lars" be: within the confines of
our limited objective in Viet
nam, what military action is
appropriate in order to bring
about a victory over the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong pres
ently in South Vietnam?
As an answer to this question,
I would like to suggest an alter
native which has been mention
ed in such bourgeois publica
tions as Time magazine, but has
not yet been given any signifi
cant attention by Stanford's
"Community of Scholars." This
alternative, first proposed by our
military men and discussed re
cently in Newsweek (May 15,
1967 pg. 43), consists of build
ing an impenetrable "wall" a
few (miles south of the Demili
tarized Zone and extending
across Laos to Savannakhet on

the border between Laos and
Thailand.
Our present victory plan cen
ters around the idea that if we
bomb the supply links in North
Vietnam harder, North Vietnam
will be forced to stop sending
men and supplies to South Viet
nam. This policy has made it
vastly more difficult for the
Communists to continue their
aggression, and it has punished
the North Vietnamese for that
aggression. But the bombing
has not accomplished its main
purpose, and the flow of men
and arms to South Vietnam in
creases day by day. And there
is considerable question as to
whether further increases in the
bombing will halt the aggression
frdm the north.
Impenetrable
It is my firm conviction that
once the influx from the North
is curtailed, the goal of inde
pendence for South Vietnam
will come into clear view. And
the only sure-fire way to stop
the infiltration is to build an
impenetrable wall. After the Ho
Chi Minh Trail is closed off, it
will be unnecessary to continue
the bombing of North Vietnam.
Since our military men appar
ently support the plan to build
the wall ,it is somewhat unclear
why the idea hasn't been
brought to fruition. One prob
lem is that roughly 150,000 men
would be needed to man the
wall. The May 19 Time says
"The U.S. command in Saigon
feels that the large number of
men required for a barrier can
be better used to hit the enemy
when he enters South Vietnam."
'Hiis is a valid point if the pur
pose of the war is to kill as
many North Vietnamese as pos
sible.
But if we are actually seek
ing a victory in South Vietnam,
the infiltration from the north
must be stopped, and since
President Johnson is going to
raise the number of U.S. troops
in South Vietnam to 600,000 any
way, it seems reasonable to
suggest that our 150,000 addi
tional men be employed in a
manner that will accomplish
some definite purpose.
In the struggle for victory
in Vietnam it is a must, to halt
the Communist aggression from
North Vietnam. TTie construc

tion of a defensive wall across
Vietnam and Laos seems to be
more in keeping with our limit
ed objective than another in
crease in the intensity of the
bombing. Since our government,

with the backing of the Ameri
can people, is clearly going to
take one of these two actions
in the near future, is this not
a worthwhile topic for debate at
Stanford? The real world calls.
