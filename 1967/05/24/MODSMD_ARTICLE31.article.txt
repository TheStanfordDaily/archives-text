# Oh Christ!
## Be Ent-like; Feed Your Head 
### Paul Rupert 
"When asked his name, the re
flective Ent (which is to say, in
the realm of Middle Earth, a
spirited or spirit of or inspired
tree) replied to the precocious
Hobbit (a critter given to hu
man frailties and capacities)
that it would take, at the very
least, three days to begin an ac
count of his name. But in the
interest of Brevity and bowing
to the inferior mental prowess
of this poor creature (all in a
certain merciful tone) he al
lowed himself to be called Tree
beard, for short.
"Characteristically, Treebeard
listened wisely and said little.
Not only was his silence pleas
ant, but his words were weighty
â€”weighed in the spirit rather
than the delivery. And when ac
tion against the Dark Lord be
came appropriate and necessary,
it was fully debated and thor
oughly executed. That it had to
be violent was frightening, and
might be informative in its own
desperate way.
Unlike Most Ents
"But to return to the problem
of the student. Being variations
on the Hobbit theme, we are
more inclined to talk, eat, drink,
shout, and abbreviate truth than
are most Ents. As well, we are
less inclined to significant ac
tion, mercy, and peace. It follows
that in our overwhelming orali
ty, we are unused to and un
comfortable in silence.
"That silence is a pre-requi
site to listening is an obvious
point much in need of re-state
ment. The fact that reasoned
words and considered action,
calmly uttered and executed,
might penetrate the vociferous
shouts and cold stares of "oppo

nents" on any given issue is a
perennial possibility, seldom rea
lized.
"Amidst the clamor for new
forms in the Vietnam debate,
gimmickry rears. As well, it
strikes me that there is great
need of a full silence growing
out of the clatter. But most say
that there can be no moment of
silence: for urgent problems are
upon us and consciences scream.
What is to be done?
"In the presence of music, I
am generally silent. I never con
verse with my record player in
any disruptive way, and talk to
myself as little as possible. What
may well be an escape, a frivoli
ty, a salve or solace, often is.
But in the silence of music, I
have begun to find better
thoughts as well. In this world
not my own, but not unlike it, I
find predicaments, foods, and
resolutions that we might do
well to share.
"Consider Alice as experienced
by the Jefferson Airplane. Chaos
abounds, but is not foreign. Wo
know the failures of logic and
proportion, the arrogant chess
pieces who tell us where to go,
and the White Knight who talks
backwards. We feel the shrink
and explosion of self reading the
daily paper. We sense the decible
as a threat, both daily and ulti
mately.
"But in all this we are spared
the roar of Vietnam. Our world
is apart from that, and from
Alice and the Ent. While Alice's
Pill and Houkah have become
household itoms, we know nei
ther peace nor silence in our
music or our - day. All that re
mains ignored Is the Mushroom.
"Mushrooms seem food for the

mind. They grow silently. They
are non-violent. They teach in
odd ways, engaging the mouth
while the mind and the soul
must listen. Eating a sauteed
mushroom, listening to a har
mony of his choice, one might
discover a new thought. He
might feel and be generous if he
honestly heard himself.
And The Doonnouse
"The Doormouse said, oddly
enough, "Feed your head!" In
so saying, he may have seen
more to the head than the
mouth, more to the expression
of concern than debate, more to
us than we know. Be with us to
morrow on the Plaza, and open
your head."
The idea was nice. Joel Kugel
mass, Sue Horst, Amy Newell,
Summers GofT, Nan Goldie, Ka
thy Golding, everyone and I
were going to sautee mush
rooms, play music on the plaza,
and accept contributions to the
Canadian Friends or the Com
mittee of Responsibility to alle
viate the suffering of North
and South Vietnamese. There
would bo music, discussion, giv
ing, thought, a form of peace,
and imagination.
California health regulations
require that mushrooms sold to
the public: 1) be cooked in an
approved kitchen 2) be packaged
in separate, covered containers
3) be kept at a temperature
greater than 170 degrees 4) be
sold in a sheltered place 5) be
tested for bacteria and other sub
versive stuff 6) ad infinitum.
Money cannot be sent to the
Canadian Friends.
We are in the Demilitarized
Zone.
Alice has no comment.
