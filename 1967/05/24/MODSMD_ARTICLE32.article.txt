## Invasion Of North Vietnam 'Possible' 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
About a week ago a friend
of mine (whose identity I do
not feel free to divulge but who
is knowledgeable on the sub
ject of government policy re
garding Vietnam) informed me
that plans have been made in
Washington for an invasion of
North Vietnam to occur around
the end of June. He said that
this invasion may or may not
take place depending upon
whether the administration feels
it can afford the risks of 1)
Chinese intervention and 2) do
mestic political repercussions.
I found this information hor
rifying but a bit incredible at
the time. Since then we have
bombed central Hanoi, hitting
a power station and the diplo
matic section and we have
moved troops into the southern
portion of the De-Militarized
Zone. Military authorities have
not denied the possibility of our
moving into the northern half
of the DMZ (this is North Viet
namese territory) and even
further if it becomes "neces
sary."
These events are disturbing
enough by themselves, but all
the more so in light of the in
formation of our possible inva
sion of the North. It would ap
pear that the situation is being
engineered in such a way that
by the end of June the "neces
sity" of invading the North will
be justified.
I therefore urge all those who
are distressed by recent devel
opments in this war, if not by
the war in general, to please
write or telegram your President
or Congressman in Washington.
Ask them to do what they can
to see that there is no invasion.
All you have to do is phone
Western Union and you can
send a fifteen word public opin
ion message for 92 cents.

Editor, The Daily:
The case for confusion and
deception in Johnson's "hand
ling" of the Vietnam war con
tinues to become stronger. De
spite tacit agreements between
government and press to keep
vital information secret, all of
the following has been in the
past week's Chronicle:
Friday — Johnson asked for
understanding of his difficult
and lonely task of winning the
war. For two days running, he
was quoted as having felt sad
that he may be starting (or
have started) World War Three.
Saturday — U.S. bombing of
"military" targets in Hanoi was
coupled with the second "rocket
ing" of Hanoi's diplomatic sec
tor, between the Communist

Chinese and Soviet embassies,
(if the diplomatic leaders of the
North are now military targets,
where is the validity of any
U.S. desire to negotiate with
them?)
'Clean' Bombs
Sunday — Several reports of
development of "clean" nuclear
bombs, as well as plans to equip
U.S. cities with missile defense
systems, were given.
Monday — The "Tuesday
Lunch Group" of Johnson, Ros
tow, Rusk and McNamara
"creates what order there is in
the production of decisions that
direct the war." "But there is
no record for history of who
took what position on what is
sue." Rusk disseminates infor
mation to the State Department
on a "need-to-know" basis. In
formed thus are W. Bundy (Sec
retary for the Far East), Harri
man (peace probes) and Gold
berg. Because of the secrecy "a
policy decision reaches much of
the governmental structure
through the press", by official
pronouncement or leaks.
Keeping Order
One "operating bureaucrat"
complained that "officials can
not carry out top-level public
relations guidance on Vietnam
when recommendations do not
move up through channels in
any systematic way. Only by
such orderly procedure . . . can
an insider follow and explain
the direction in which policy is
moving."
Furthermore, men who have
visited Hanoi, or have been ob
serving there for years, are not
being permitted to report per
sonally to Johnson, Rusk, et al.
They are often ignored (Reeves)
or delegated to lower "operat
ing bureaucrats."
This weekend, Mr. Eisenhow
er asked the "misguided" anti
war demonstrators "if 'any of
us knows enough to be a tacti
cian, a political expert and a
master of this situation.' 'It's
only the people getting infor
mation every minute' who can
make sound judgments."

Editor, The Daily:
To set the record straight on
Bob Stone's column, "To Please
Alums, Hide the Students:"
1. Over 1,000 attended the cam
pus conference, not 300.
2. While there was some con
fusion and delay in extending in
vitation, Daily Editor Henry
Muller, Student Body President-
Elect Peter Lyman, and Vice
President C e s a r e Massarenti
were invited to participate in
"The Student and The Univer
sity" panel several days in ad
vance.
Unfortunately, none was able
to take part due to prior com
mitments, but both Muller and
Massarenti participated in an in
formal news preview of the cam
pus conference a week ago Mon
day. This featured "The Student
and The University" portion of
the program.
3. At the request of local con
ference chairmen, students have
been included in nearly all the
Stanford Conference programs
this year, as they have been in
the past.
4. All students were invited to

participate in the conference free
of charge, as reported in ad
vance in The Daily. Members of
the senior class received copies
of the program with an invita
tion. Between 25 and 50 came.
5. Trustee President Parmer
Fuller did not receive any "roar
of approval" from his audience.
When he said his colleagues held
"very strong opinions" about
student membership in the trus
tees, a round of applause fol
lowed.
6. Reporting his own reaction
to being informed of his nomi
nation as trustee president while
travelling in Beirut, Fuller said
he thought it was "a dirty trick,
a great compliment" and vowed
"never to leave home again."
The audience caught his humor,
but Stone did not.
7. Of students, Mr. Fuller said
"I have high confidence in and
great admiration for Stanford
students generally. Almost with
out exception, they are excellent,
marvelous human beings." No
great gap exists between the
substance of his remarks and
those of Provost Lyman.
Paranoic plots die hard, but
anyone who becomes acquainted
with the Alumni Association
staff will quickly discover
they're not trying to hide future
members from public view.

• Righteous Wrath
Editor, The Daily:
Monday The Daily set forth
the findings of the Judicial
Council as regards a campaign
letter of Mark Fogelman, candi
date for Senior Class President.
That letter set forth a list of
facts which indicated that, quite
aside from any "collusion" be
tween the other candidate (Mr.
Tom) and anyone else, certain
occurrences had prejudiced the
run-off campaign as a contest on
equal terms with equal resour
ces.
The letter, as I understood,
had been a reply to Mr. Tom's
own allegation (in his own cam
paign sheet) that most of the
points brought before the Coun
cil after the first run-off election
were mere "misunderstandings"
on Fogelman's part and were
"cleared up" by the Council.
(They were not.)
The letter was well calculated,
I think, to show that there had
been questions of basic fairness
in a campaign at stake and not
merely, as Mr. Tom suggested,
the deluded and slightly pathetic
quibblings of a defeated candi
date who would stand in the
way of student government with
carpings over mere procedure.
No Allegations
As far as I can see, Mr. Fogel
man, in his letter, had no inten
tion to, and in fact did not allege
"collusion" between The Daily
and Mr. Tom. (If the Council
infers that from the facts Fo
gelman's letter puts forth, that's
its own business.) Nor does he
allege that the other candidates
were personally responsible for
the other irregularities: matters
of "personal responsibility" are
irrelevant to the fact that such
circumstances really did preju
dice the fairness of the first elec
tion and were not merely the
creatures of a "misunderstand
ing" by Mr. Fogelman.
How the Council can itself in
fer "allegations" of "collusion"
or "design to injure" from sim
ple facts and then conclude that
the facts are insufficient to prove
the "allegation" and that there
fore the facts must be with
drawn—all that is a little be
yond me.
This is quite a different thing
from a demonstration that a
fact is not true —that is, that
Miss Wiseman was wrong in
reading the words "dirty" and
"counter-charge" into the lec
ture Mr. Horwitz delivered to
her. As far as I can see from
The Daily's coverage of the
Council session, that was the
only error of fact established.
I can hardly blame Mr. Fogel
man for backing down before
the wrath (though questionable
wisdom) of Mr. Tom and the
Council: the possibility of a suit
for libel, with or without
grounds, is a formidable deter

rent to advocacy of a lonely
cause. But I, for one, am grate
ful that someone had the nerve
to press my right for a new elec
tion where the integrity of pro
cedures is not left to chance.
May I note in passing that
there's a real irony in yester
day's letter from four poll-work
ers at the run-off election, who
first indignantly deny that vigi
lance over their activities by Stu
dent Police was necessary, and
then proceed to give proof of
their impartiality by urging the
election of Tom and Horwitz in
the new election.

• White On Black
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to propose that
all graduating seniors join me
in wearing a white arm band
to Commencement exercises on
June 18. There are some who
will say that graduation is neith
er the proper place nor the
proper time to protest the war
in Vietnam. I can only answer
that the war is the most impor
tant question facing us today.
If a simple white arm band
causes trauma it • vill do so only
for those who have been avoid
ing making their own decision
on Vietnam or for those whose
priority scale ranks the possi
bility of World War 111 'for
which the U.S. would have
bear the major responsibiln
below such "important" items a.
a pleasant graduation.
Conflict is never particularly
pleasant, especially during sup
posedly "happy" times like grad
uation. But to avoid conflict also
avoids the issue. We are at war.
The draft summons allows no
time out, no rest period for re
flection and decision making. 1
do not pretend that wearing a
white arm band to graduation
will end the war.
It will stir sqme needed dis
cussion between students and
others not directly connected
with the university. For seniors
the days of mutual reinforce
ment at Stanford are over. New
efforts should be aimed at per
suading parents, graduates, and
others in the great middle who
refuse to defend any stand at
all. Graduation is a good place
to start.

Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Merry, Beta Chi's
song at Spring Sing was not
about marijuana. Your careless
assumption, indicative of the
one-dimensional way the stu
dent body views Beta Chi, is not
justified here.
Our song was written in an
effort to bring musical life and
lyrical originality to Spring
Sing. Like most traditions,
Spring Sing has structured and
narrowed herself in a rut, in
volving a miniscule number o'
topics (dollies, the ratio, etc.)
and music lifted from KFRC.
Out of endless hours came our
song, and integration of folk
rock harmony, counterpoint, and
calculated ambiuous lyrics.
Like an abstract painting, it
should evoke different response.'
from different listeners. Mr.
Merry's own reaction (note that
not a single line in the song
alludes to a "trip") is only as
valid as "love," "nature," or &•
hundred other possibilities.
Beta Chi hopes that other
groups will in the future ignore
the simpy criterion for success
with which Spring Sing shack
les its participants, and attempt
original verbal-musical composi
tions, reflecting a creative stu
dent body.

• Righteous Wrath
Editor, The Daily:
Monday The Daily set forth
the findings of the Judicial
Council as regards a campaign
letter of Mark Fogelman, candi
date for Senior Class President.
That letter set forth a list of
facts which indicated that, quite
aside from any "collusion" be
tween the other candidate (Mr.
Tom) and anyone else, certain
occurrences had prejudiced the
run-off campaign as a contest on
equal terms with equal resour
ces.
The letter, as I understood,
had been a reply to Mr. Tom's
own allegation (in his own cam
paign sheet) that most of the
points brought before the Coun
cil after the first run-off election
were mere "misunderstandings"
on Fogelman's part and were
"cleared up" by the Council.
(They were not.)
The letter was well calculated,
I think, to show that there had
been questions of basic fairness
in a campaign at stake and not
merely, as Mr. Tom suggested,
the deluded and slightly pathetic
quibblings of a defeated candi
date who would stand in the
way of student government with
carpings over mere procedure.
No Allegations
As far as I can see, Mr. Fogel
man, in his letter, had no inten
tion to, and in fact did not allege
"collusion" between The Daily
and Mr. Tom. (If the Council
infers that from the facts Fo
gelman's letter puts forth, that's
its own business.) Nor does he
allege that the other candidates
were personally responsible for
the other irregularities: matters
of "personal responsibility" are
irrelevant to the fact that such
circumstances really did preju
dice the fairness of the first elec
tion and were not merely the
creatures of a "misunderstand
ing" by Mr. Fogelman.
How the Council can itself in
fer "allegations" of "collusion"
or "design to injure" from sim
ple facts and then conclude that
the facts are insufficient to prove
the "allegation" and that there
fore the facts must be with
drawn—all that is a little be
yond me.
This is quite a different thing
from a demonstration that a
fact is not true —that is, that
Miss Wiseman was wrong in
reading the words "dirty" and
"counter-charge" into the lec
ture Mr. Horwitz delivered to
her. As far as I can see from
The Daily's coverage of the
Council session, that was the
only error of fact established.
I can hardly blame Mr. Fogel
man for backing down before
the wrath (though questionable
wisdom) of Mr. Tom and the
Council: the possibility of a suit
for libel, with or without
grounds, is a formidable deter

rent to advocacy of a lonely
cause. But I, for one, am grate
ful that someone had the nerve
to press my right for a new elec
tion where the integrity of pro
cedures is not left to chance.
May I note in passing that
there's a real irony in yester
day's letter from four poll-work
ers at the run-off election, who
first indignantly deny that vigi
lance over their activities by Stu
dent Police was necessary, and
then proceed to give proof of
their impartiality by urging the
election of Tom and Horwitz in
the new election.

that the war is the most impor

If a simple white arm band
causes trauma it • vill do so only
for those who have been avoid

a pleasant graduation.
Conflict is never particularly
pleasant, especially during sup

avoids the issue. We are at war.
The draft summons allows no
time out, no rest period for re
flection and decision making. 1
do not pretend that wearing a
white arm band to graduation
will end the war.
It will stir sqme needed dis
cussion between students and

with the university. For seniors
the days of mutual reinforce

Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Merry, Beta Chi's
song at Spring Sing was not
about marijuana. Your careless
assumption, indicative of the
one-dimensional way the stu
dent body views Beta Chi, is not
justified here.
Our song was written in an
effort to bring musical life and
lyrical originality to Spring
Sing. Like most traditions,
Spring Sing has structured and
narrowed herself in a rut, in
volving a miniscule number o'
topics (dollies, the ratio, etc.)
and music lifted from KFRC.
Out of endless hours came our
song, and integration of folk
rock harmony, counterpoint, and
calculated ambiuous lyrics.
Like an abstract painting, it
should evoke different response.'
from different listeners. Mr.
Merry's own reaction (note that
not a single line in the song
alludes to a "trip") is only as
valid as "love," "nature," or &•
hundred other possibilities.
Beta Chi hopes that other
groups will in the future ignore
the simpy criterion for success
with which Spring Sing shack
les its participants, and attempt
original verbal-musical composi
tions, reflecting a creative stu
dent body.

Editor, The Dally:
About a week ago a friend
of mine (whose identity I do
not feel free to divulge but who
is knowledgeable on the sub
ject of government policy re
garding Vietnam) informed me
that plans have been made in
Washington for an invasion of
North Vietnam to occur around
the end of June. He said that
this invasion may or may not
take place depending upon
whether the administration feels
it can afford the risks of 1)
Chinese intervention and 2) do
mestic political repercussions.
I found this information hor
rifying but a bit incredible at
the time. Since then we have
bombed central Hanoi, hitting
a power station and the diplo
matic section and we have
moved troops into the southern
portion of the De-Militarized
Zone. Military authorities have
not denied the possibility of our
moving into the northern half
of the DMZ (this is North Viet
namese territory) and even
further if it becomes "neces
sary."
These events are disturbing
enough by themselves, but all
the more so in light of the in
formation of our possible inva
sion of the North. It would ap
pear that the situation is being
engineered in such a way that
by the end of June the "neces
sity" of invading the North will
be justified.
I therefore urge all those who
are distressed by recent devel
opments in this war, if not by
the war in general, to please
write or telegram your President
or Congressman in Washington.
Ask them to do what they can
to see that there is no invasion.
All you have to do is phone
Western Union and you can
send a fifteen word public opin

• Information, Please!
Editor, The Daily:
The case for confusion and
deception in Johnson's "hand
ling" of the Vietnam war con
tinues to become stronger. De
spite tacit agreements between
government and press to keep
vital information secret, all of
the following has been in the
past week's Chronicle:
Friday — Johnson asked for
understanding of his difficult
and lonely task of winning the
war. For two days running, he
was quoted as having felt sad
that he may be starting (or
have started) World War Three.
Saturday — U.S. bombing of
"military" targets in Hanoi was
coupled with the second "rocket
ing" of Hanoi's diplomatic sec
tor, between the Communist

Chinese and Soviet embassies,
(if the diplomatic leaders of the
North are now military targets,
where is the validity of any
U.S. desire to negotiate with
them?)
'Clean' Bombs
Sunday — Several reports of
development of "clean" nuclear
bombs, as well as plans to equip
U.S. cities with missile defense
systems, were given.
Monday — The "Tuesday
Lunch Group" of Johnson, Ros
tow, Rusk and McNamara
"creates what order there is in
the production of decisions that
direct the war." "But there is
no record for history of who
took what position on what is
sue." Rusk disseminates infor
mation to the State Department
on a "need-to-know" basis. In
formed thus are W. Bundy (Sec
retary for the Far East), Harri
man (peace probes) and Gold
berg. Because of the secrecy "a
policy decision reaches much of
the governmental structure
through the press", by official
pronouncement or leaks.
Keeping Order
One "operating bureaucrat"
complained that "officials can
not carry out top-level public
relations guidance on Vietnam
when recommendations do not
move up through channels in
any systematic way. Only by
such orderly procedure . . . can
an insider follow and explain
the direction in which policy is
moving."
Furthermore, men who have
visited Hanoi, or have been ob
serving there for years, are not
being permitted to report per
sonally to Johnson, Rusk, et al.
They are often ignored (Reeves)
or delegated to lower "operat
ing bureaucrats."
This weekend, Mr. Eisenhow
er asked the "misguided" anti
war demonstrators "if 'any of
us knows enough to be a tacti
cian, a political expert and a
master of this situation.' 'It's
only the people getting infor
mation every minute' who can
make sound judgments."

will say that graduation is neith

that the war is the most impor

Conflict is never particularly

avoids the issue. We are at war.

do not pretend that wearing a

will end the war.
It will stir sqme needed dis

No, Mr. Merry, Beta Chi's

about marijuana. Your careless
assumption, indicative of the
one-dimensional way the stu

justified here.
Our song was written in an
effort to bring musical life and
lyrical originality to Spring
Sing. Like most traditions,
Spring Sing has structured and
narrowed herself in a rut, in
volving a miniscule number o'
topics (dollies, the ratio, etc.)
and music lifted from KFRC.
Out of endless hours came our
song, and integration of folk
rock harmony, counterpoint, and
calculated ambiuous lyrics.
Like an abstract painting, it
should evoke different response.'
from different listeners. Mr.
Merry's own reaction (note that
not a single line in the song
alludes to a "trip") is only as
valid as "love," "nature," or &•
hundred other possibilities.
Beta Chi hopes that other
groups will in the future ignore
the simpy criterion for success
with which Spring Sing shack

original verbal-musical composi

Editor, The Dally:
About a week ago a friend
of mine (whose identity I do
not feel free to divulge but who
is knowledgeable on the sub
ject of government policy re
garding Vietnam) informed me
that plans have been made in
Washington for an invasion of
North Vietnam to occur around
the end of June. He said that
this invasion may or may not
take place depending upon
whether the administration feels
it can afford the risks of 1)
Chinese intervention and 2) do
mestic political repercussions.
I found this information hor
rifying but a bit incredible at
the time. Since then we have
bombed central Hanoi, hitting
a power station and the diplo
matic section and we have
moved troops into the southern
portion of the De-Militarized
Zone. Military authorities have
not denied the possibility of our
moving into the northern half
of the DMZ (this is North Viet
namese territory) and even
further if it becomes "neces
sary."
These events are disturbing
enough by themselves, but all
the more so in light of the in
formation of our possible inva
sion of the North. It would ap
pear that the situation is being
engineered in such a way that
by the end of June the "neces
sity" of invading the North will
be justified.
I therefore urge all those who
are distressed by recent devel
opments in this war, if not by
the war in general, to please
write or telegram your President
or Congressman in Washington.
Ask them to do what they can
to see that there is no invasion.
All you have to do is phone
Western Union and you can
send a fifteen word public opin

Editor, The Daily:
The case for confusion and
deception in Johnson's "hand
ling" of the Vietnam war con
tinues to become stronger. De
spite tacit agreements between
government and press to keep
vital information secret, all of
the following has been in the
past week's Chronicle:
Friday — Johnson asked for
understanding of his difficult
and lonely task of winning the
war. For two days running, he
was quoted as having felt sad
that he may be starting (or
have started) World War Three.
Saturday — U.S. bombing of
"military" targets in Hanoi was
coupled with the second "rocket
ing" of Hanoi's diplomatic sec
tor, between the Communist

Chinese and Soviet embassies,
(if the diplomatic leaders of the
North are now military targets,
where is the validity of any
U.S. desire to negotiate with
them?)
'Clean' Bombs
Sunday — Several reports of
development of "clean" nuclear
bombs, as well as plans to equip
U.S. cities with missile defense
systems, were given.
Monday — The "Tuesday
Lunch Group" of Johnson, Ros
tow, Rusk and McNamara
"creates what order there is in
the production of decisions that
direct the war." "But there is
no record for history of who
took what position on what is
sue." Rusk disseminates infor
mation to the State Department
on a "need-to-know" basis. In
formed thus are W. Bundy (Sec
retary for the Far East), Harri
man (peace probes) and Gold
berg. Because of the secrecy "a
policy decision reaches much of
the governmental structure
through the press", by official
pronouncement or leaks.
Keeping Order
One "operating bureaucrat"
complained that "officials can
not carry out top-level public
relations guidance on Vietnam
when recommendations do not
move up through channels in
any systematic way. Only by
such orderly procedure . . . can
an insider follow and explain
the direction in which policy is
moving."
Furthermore, men who have
visited Hanoi, or have been ob
serving there for years, are not
being permitted to report per
sonally to Johnson, Rusk, et al.
They are often ignored (Reeves)
or delegated to lower "operat
ing bureaucrats."
This weekend, Mr. Eisenhow
er asked the "misguided" anti
war demonstrators "if 'any of
us knows enough to be a tacti
cian, a political expert and a
master of this situation.' 'It's
only the people getting infor
mation every minute' who can
make sound judgments."

Editor, The Daily:
To set the record straight on
Bob Stone's column, "To Please
Alums, Hide the Students:"
1. Over 1,000 attended the cam
pus conference, not 300.
2. While there was some con
fusion and delay in extending in
vitation, Daily Editor Henry
Muller, Student Body President-
Elect Peter Lyman, and Vice
President C e s a r e Massarenti
were invited to participate in
"The Student and The Univer
sity" panel several days in ad
vance.
Unfortunately, none was able
to take part due to prior com
mitments, but both Muller and
Massarenti participated in an in
formal news preview of the cam
pus conference a week ago Mon
day. This featured "The Student
and The University" portion of
the program.
3. At the request of local con
ference chairmen, students have
been included in nearly all the
Stanford Conference programs
this year, as they have been in
the past.
4. All students were invited to

participate in the conference free
of charge, as reported in ad
vance in The Daily. Members of
the senior class received copies
of the program with an invita
tion. Between 25 and 50 came.
5. Trustee President Parmer
Fuller did not receive any "roar
of approval" from his audience.
When he said his colleagues held
"very strong opinions" about
student membership in the trus
tees, a round of applause fol
lowed.
6. Reporting his own reaction
to being informed of his nomi
nation as trustee president while
travelling in Beirut, Fuller said
he thought it was "a dirty trick,
a great compliment" and vowed
"never to leave home again."
The audience caught his humor,
but Stone did not.
7. Of students, Mr. Fuller said
"I have high confidence in and
great admiration for Stanford
students generally. Almost with
out exception, they are excellent,
marvelous human beings." No
great gap exists between the
substance of his remarks and
those of Provost Lyman.
Paranoic plots die hard, but
anyone who becomes acquainted

staff will quickly discover
they're not trying to hide future

• Righteous Wrath
Editor, The Daily:
Monday The Daily set forth
the findings of the Judicial
Council as regards a campaign
letter of Mark Fogelman, candi
date for Senior Class President.
That letter set forth a list of
facts which indicated that, quite
aside from any "collusion" be
tween the other candidate (Mr.
Tom) and anyone else, certain
occurrences had prejudiced the
run-off campaign as a contest on
equal terms with equal resour
ces.
The letter, as I understood,
had been a reply to Mr. Tom's
own allegation (in his own cam
paign sheet) that most of the
points brought before the Coun
cil after the first run-off election
were mere "misunderstandings"
on Fogelman's part and were
"cleared up" by the Council.
(They were not.)
The letter was well calculated,
I think, to show that there had
been questions of basic fairness
in a campaign at stake and not
merely, as Mr. Tom suggested,
the deluded and slightly pathetic
quibblings of a defeated candi
date who would stand in the
way of student government with
carpings over mere procedure.
No Allegations
As far as I can see, Mr. Fogel
man, in his letter, had no inten
tion to, and in fact did not allege
"collusion" between The Daily
and Mr. Tom. (If the Council
infers that from the facts Fo
gelman's letter puts forth, that's
its own business.) Nor does he
allege that the other candidates
were personally responsible for
the other irregularities: matters
of "personal responsibility" are
irrelevant to the fact that such
circumstances really did preju
dice the fairness of the first elec
tion and were not merely the
creatures of a "misunderstand
ing" by Mr. Fogelman.
How the Council can itself in
fer "allegations" of "collusion"
or "design to injure" from sim
ple facts and then conclude that
the facts are insufficient to prove
the "allegation" and that there
fore the facts must be with
drawn—all that is a little be
yond me.
This is quite a different thing
from a demonstration that a
fact is not true —that is, that
Miss Wiseman was wrong in
reading the words "dirty" and
"counter-charge" into the lec
ture Mr. Horwitz delivered to
her. As far as I can see from
The Daily's coverage of the
Council session, that was the
only error of fact established.
I can hardly blame Mr. Fogel
man for backing down before
the wrath (though questionable
wisdom) of Mr. Tom and the
Council: the possibility of a suit
for libel, with or without
grounds, is a formidable deter

rent to advocacy of a lonely
cause. But I, for one, am grate
ful that someone had the nerve
to press my right for a new elec
tion where the integrity of pro
cedures is not left to chance.
May I note in passing that
there's a real irony in yester
day's letter from four poll-work
ers at the run-off election, who
first indignantly deny that vigi
lance over their activities by Stu
dent Police was necessary, and
then proceed to give proof of
their impartiality by urging the
election of Tom and Horwitz in
the new election.

have started) World War Three.
Saturday — U.S. bombing of
"military" targets in Hanoi was
coupled with the second "rocket
ing" of Hanoi's diplomatic sec
tor, between the Communist

Chinese and Soviet embassies,
(if the diplomatic leaders of the
North are now military targets,
where is the validity of any
U.S. desire to negotiate with
them?)
'Clean' Bombs
Sunday — Several reports of
development of "clean" nuclear
bombs, as well as plans to equip
U.S. cities with missile defense
systems, were given.
Monday — The "Tuesday
Lunch Group" of Johnson, Ros
tow, Rusk and McNamara
"creates what order there is in
the production of decisions that
direct the war." "But there is
no record for history of who
took what position on what is
sue." Rusk disseminates infor
mation to the State Department
on a "need-to-know" basis. In
formed thus are W. Bundy (Sec
retary for the Far East), Harri
man (peace probes) and Gold
berg. Because of the secrecy "a
policy decision reaches much of
the governmental structure
through the press", by official
pronouncement or leaks.
Keeping Order
One "operating bureaucrat"
complained that "officials can
not carry out top-level public
relations guidance on Vietnam
when recommendations do not
move up through channels in
any systematic way. Only by
such orderly procedure . . . can
an insider follow and explain
the direction in which policy is
moving."
Furthermore, men who have
visited Hanoi, or have been ob
serving there for years, are not
being permitted to report per
sonally to Johnson, Rusk, et al.
They are often ignored (Reeves)
or delegated to lower "operat
ing bureaucrats."
This weekend, Mr. Eisenhow
er asked the "misguided" anti
war demonstrators "if 'any of
us knows enough to be a tacti
cian, a political expert and a
master of this situation.' 'It's
only the people getting infor
mation every minute' who can
make sound judgments."

To set the record straight on

• Righteous Wrath
Editor, The Daily:
Monday The Daily set forth
the findings of the Judicial
Council as regards a campaign
letter of Mark Fogelman, candi
date for Senior Class President.
That letter set forth a list of
facts which indicated that, quite
aside from any "collusion" be
tween the other candidate (Mr.
Tom) and anyone else, certain
occurrences had prejudiced the
run-off campaign as a contest on
equal terms with equal resour
ces.
The letter, as I understood,
had been a reply to Mr. Tom's
own allegation (in his own cam
paign sheet) that most of the
points brought before the Coun
cil after the first run-off election
were mere "misunderstandings"
on Fogelman's part and were
"cleared up" by the Council.
(They were not.)
The letter was well calculated,
I think, to show that there had
been questions of basic fairness
in a campaign at stake and not
merely, as Mr. Tom suggested,
the deluded and slightly pathetic
quibblings of a defeated candi
date who would stand in the
way of student government with
carpings over mere procedure.
No Allegations
As far as I can see, Mr. Fogel
man, in his letter, had no inten
tion to, and in fact did not allege
"collusion" between The Daily
and Mr. Tom. (If the Council
infers that from the facts Fo
gelman's letter puts forth, that's
its own business.) Nor does he
allege that the other candidates
were personally responsible for
the other irregularities: matters
of "personal responsibility" are
irrelevant to the fact that such
circumstances really did preju
dice the fairness of the first elec
tion and were not merely the
creatures of a "misunderstand
ing" by Mr. Fogelman.
How the Council can itself in
fer "allegations" of "collusion"
or "design to injure" from sim
ple facts and then conclude that
the facts are insufficient to prove
the "allegation" and that there
fore the facts must be with
drawn—all that is a little be
yond me.
This is quite a different thing
from a demonstration that a
fact is not true —that is, that
Miss Wiseman was wrong in
reading the words "dirty" and
"counter-charge" into the lec
ture Mr. Horwitz delivered to
her. As far as I can see from
The Daily's coverage of the
Council session, that was the
only error of fact established.
I can hardly blame Mr. Fogel
man for backing down before
the wrath (though questionable
wisdom) of Mr. Tom and the
Council: the possibility of a suit
for libel, with or without
grounds, is a formidable deter

rent to advocacy of a lonely
cause. But I, for one, am grate
ful that someone had the nerve
to press my right for a new elec
tion where the integrity of pro
cedures is not left to chance.
May I note in passing that
there's a real irony in yester
day's letter from four poll-work
ers at the run-off election, who
first indignantly deny that vigi
lance over their activities by Stu
dent Police was necessary, and
then proceed to give proof of
their impartiality by urging the
election of Tom and Horwitz in
the new election.

I would like to propose that

will say that graduation is neith
er the proper place nor the
proper time to protest the war
in Vietnam. I can only answer
that the war is the most impor

If a simple white arm band
causes trauma it • vill do so only
for those who have been avoid

which the U.S. would have

below such "important" items a.
a pleasant graduation.
Conflict is never particularly
pleasant, especially during sup
posedly "happy" times like grad
uation. But to avoid conflict also
avoids the issue. We are at war.
The draft summons allows no
time out, no rest period for re
flection and decision making. 1
do not pretend that wearing a
white arm band to graduation
will end the war.
It will stir sqme needed dis
cussion between students and
others not directly connected
with the university. For seniors
the days of mutual reinforce

efforts should be aimed at per

No, Mr. Merry, Beta Chi's

about marijuana. Your careless
assumption, indicative of the
one-dimensional way the stu

justified here.
Our song was written in an
effort to bring musical life and
lyrical originality to Spring
Sing. Like most traditions,
Spring Sing has structured and
narrowed herself in a rut, in
volving a miniscule number o'
topics (dollies, the ratio, etc.)
and music lifted from KFRC.
Out of endless hours came our
song, and integration of folk
rock harmony, counterpoint, and
calculated ambiuous lyrics.
Like an abstract painting, it
should evoke different response.'
from different listeners. Mr.
Merry's own reaction (note that
not a single line in the song
alludes to a "trip") is only as
valid as "love," "nature," or &•
hundred other possibilities.
Beta Chi hopes that other
groups will in the future ignore
the simpy criterion for success
with which Spring Sing shack

original verbal-musical composi

Editor, The Dally:
About a week ago a friend
of mine (whose identity I do
not feel free to divulge but who
is knowledgeable on the sub
ject of government policy re
garding Vietnam) informed me
that plans have been made in
Washington for an invasion of
North Vietnam to occur around
the end of June. He said that
this invasion may or may not
take place depending upon
whether the administration feels
it can afford the risks of 1)
Chinese intervention and 2) do
mestic political repercussions.
I found this information hor
rifying but a bit incredible at
the time. Since then we have
bombed central Hanoi, hitting
a power station and the diplo
matic section and we have
moved troops into the southern
portion of the De-Militarized
Zone. Military authorities have
not denied the possibility of our
moving into the northern half
of the DMZ (this is North Viet
namese territory) and even
further if it becomes "neces
sary."
These events are disturbing
enough by themselves, but all
the more so in light of the in
formation of our possible inva
sion of the North. It would ap
pear that the situation is being
engineered in such a way that
by the end of June the "neces
sity" of invading the North will
be justified.
I therefore urge all those who
are distressed by recent devel
opments in this war, if not by
the war in general, to please
write or telegram your President
or Congressman in Washington.
Ask them to do what they can
to see that there is no invasion.
All you have to do is phone
Western Union and you can
send a fifteen word public opin

points brought before the Coun
cil after the first run-off election
were mere "misunderstandings"
on Fogelman's part and were
"cleared up" by the Council.
(They were not.)
The letter was well calculated,
I think, to show that there had
been questions of basic fairness
in a campaign at stake and not
merely, as Mr. Tom suggested,
the deluded and slightly pathetic
quibblings of a defeated candi
date who would stand in the
way of student government with
carpings over mere procedure.
No Allegations
As far as I can see, Mr. Fogel
man, in his letter, had no inten
tion to, and in fact did not allege
"collusion" between The Daily
and Mr. Tom. (If the Council
infers that from the facts Fo
gelman's letter puts forth, that's
its own business.) Nor does he
allege that the other candidates
were personally responsible for
the other irregularities: matters
of "personal responsibility" are
irrelevant to the fact that such
circumstances really did preju
dice the fairness of the first elec
tion and were not merely the
creatures of a "misunderstand
ing" by Mr. Fogelman.
How the Council can itself in
fer "allegations" of "collusion"
or "design to injure" from sim
ple facts and then conclude that
the facts are insufficient to prove
the "allegation" and that there
fore the facts must be with
drawn—all that is a little be
yond me.
This is quite a different thing
from a demonstration that a
fact is not true —that is, that
Miss Wiseman was wrong in
reading the words "dirty" and
"counter-charge" into the lec
ture Mr. Horwitz delivered to
her. As far as I can see from
The Daily's coverage of the
Council session, that was the
only error of fact established.
I can hardly blame Mr. Fogel
man for backing down before
the wrath (though questionable
wisdom) of Mr. Tom and the
Council: the possibility of a suit
for libel, with or without
grounds, is a formidable deter

rent to advocacy of a lonely
cause. But I, for one, am grate
ful that someone had the nerve
to press my right for a new elec
tion where the integrity of pro
cedures is not left to chance.
May I note in passing that
there's a real irony in yester
day's letter from four poll-work
ers at the run-off election, who
first indignantly deny that vigi
lance over their activities by Stu
dent Police was necessary, and
then proceed to give proof of
their impartiality by urging the
election of Tom and Horwitz in
the new election.

Our song was written in an

Editor, The Dally:
About a week ago a friend
of mine (whose identity I do
not feel free to divulge but who
is knowledgeable on the sub
ject of government policy re
garding Vietnam) informed me
that plans have been made in
Washington for an invasion of
North Vietnam to occur around
the end of June. He said that
this invasion may or may not
take place depending upon
whether the administration feels
it can afford the risks of 1)
Chinese intervention and 2) do
mestic political repercussions.
I found this information hor
rifying but a bit incredible at
the time. Since then we have
bombed central Hanoi, hitting
a power station and the diplo
matic section and we have
moved troops into the southern
portion of the De-Militarized
Zone. Military authorities have
not denied the possibility of our
moving into the northern half
of the DMZ (this is North Viet
namese territory) and even
further if it becomes "neces
sary."
These events are disturbing
enough by themselves, but all
the more so in light of the in
formation of our possible inva
sion of the North. It would ap
pear that the situation is being
engineered in such a way that
by the end of June the "neces
sity" of invading the North will
be justified.
I therefore urge all those who
are distressed by recent devel
opments in this war, if not by
the war in general, to please
write or telegram your President
or Congressman in Washington.
Ask them to do what they can
to see that there is no invasion.
All you have to do is phone
Western Union and you can
send a fifteen word public opin

• Information, Please!
Editor, The Daily:
The case for confusion and
deception in Johnson's "hand
ling" of the Vietnam war con
tinues to become stronger. De
spite tacit agreements between
government and press to keep
vital information secret, all of
the following has been in the
past week's Chronicle:
Friday — Johnson asked for
understanding of his difficult
and lonely task of winning the
war. For two days running, he
was quoted as having felt sad
that he may be starting (or
have started) World War Three.
Saturday — U.S. bombing of
"military" targets in Hanoi was
coupled with the second "rocket
ing" of Hanoi's diplomatic sec
tor, between the Communist

Chinese and Soviet embassies,
(if the diplomatic leaders of the
North are now military targets,
where is the validity of any
U.S. desire to negotiate with
them?)
'Clean' Bombs
Sunday — Several reports of
development of "clean" nuclear
bombs, as well as plans to equip
U.S. cities with missile defense
systems, were given.
Monday — The "Tuesday
Lunch Group" of Johnson, Ros
tow, Rusk and McNamara
"creates what order there is in
the production of decisions that
direct the war." "But there is
no record for history of who
took what position on what is
sue." Rusk disseminates infor
mation to the State Department
on a "need-to-know" basis. In
formed thus are W. Bundy (Sec
retary for the Far East), Harri
man (peace probes) and Gold
berg. Because of the secrecy "a
policy decision reaches much of
the governmental structure
through the press", by official
pronouncement or leaks.
Keeping Order
One "operating bureaucrat"
complained that "officials can
not carry out top-level public
relations guidance on Vietnam
when recommendations do not
move up through channels in
any systematic way. Only by
such orderly procedure . . . can
an insider follow and explain
the direction in which policy is
moving."
Furthermore, men who have
visited Hanoi, or have been ob
serving there for years, are not
being permitted to report per
sonally to Johnson, Rusk, et al.
They are often ignored (Reeves)
or delegated to lower "operat
ing bureaucrats."
This weekend, Mr. Eisenhow
er asked the "misguided" anti
war demonstrators "if 'any of
us knows enough to be a tacti
cian, a political expert and a
master of this situation.' 'It's
only the people getting infor
mation every minute' who can
make sound judgments."

To set the record straight on
Bob Stone's column, "To Please

1. Over 1,000 attended the cam

2. While there was some con
fusion and delay in extending in
vitation, Daily Editor Henry
Muller, Student Body President-
Elect Peter Lyman, and Vice
President C e s a r e Massarenti
were invited to participate in
"The Student and The Univer

Unfortunately, none was able
to take part due to prior com
mitments, but both Muller and
Massarenti participated in an in
formal news preview of the cam
pus conference a week ago Mon
day. This featured "The Student

3. At the request of local con

this year, as they have been in
the past.
4. All students were invited to

participate in the conference free

the senior class received copies
of the program with an invita
tion. Between 25 and 50 came.
5. Trustee President Parmer
Fuller did not receive any "roar
of approval" from his audience.
When he said his colleagues held
"very strong opinions" about
student membership in the trus

lowed.
6. Reporting his own reaction

nation as trustee president while

he thought it was "a dirty trick,

"never to leave home again."
The audience caught his humor,

7. Of students, Mr. Fuller said
"I have high confidence in and

Editor, The Daily:
Monday The Daily set forth
the findings of the Judicial
Council as regards a campaign
letter of Mark Fogelman, candi
date for Senior Class President.
That letter set forth a list of
facts which indicated that, quite
aside from any "collusion" be
tween the other candidate (Mr.
Tom) and anyone else, certain
occurrences had prejudiced the
run-off campaign as a contest on
equal terms with equal resour
ces.
The letter, as I understood,
had been a reply to Mr. Tom's
own allegation (in his own cam
paign sheet) that most of the
points brought before the Coun
cil after the first run-off election
were mere "misunderstandings"

Editor, The Dally:
About a week ago a friend
of mine (whose identity I do
not feel free to divulge but who
is knowledgeable on the sub
ject of government policy re
garding Vietnam) informed me
that plans have been made in
Washington for an invasion of
North Vietnam to occur around
the end of June. He said that
this invasion may or may not
take place depending upon
whether the administration feels
it can afford the risks of 1)
Chinese intervention and 2) do
mestic political repercussions.
I found this information hor
rifying but a bit incredible at
the time. Since then we have
bombed central Hanoi, hitting
a power station and the diplo
matic section and we have
moved troops into the southern
portion of the De-Militarized
Zone. Military authorities have
not denied the possibility of our
moving into the northern half
of the DMZ (this is North Viet
namese territory) and even
further if it becomes "neces
sary."
These events are disturbing
enough by themselves, but all
the more so in light of the in
formation of our possible inva
sion of the North. It would ap
pear that the situation is being
engineered in such a way that
by the end of June the "neces
sity" of invading the North will
be justified.
I therefore urge all those who
are distressed by recent devel
opments in this war, if not by
the war in general, to please
write or telegram your President
or Congressman in Washington.
Ask them to do what they can
to see that there is no invasion.
All you have to do is phone
Western Union and you can
send a fifteen word public opin
ion message for 92 cents.

• Information, Please!
Editor, The Daily:
The case for confusion and
deception in Johnson's "hand
ling" of the Vietnam war con
tinues to become stronger. De
spite tacit agreements between
government and press to keep
vital information secret, all of
the following has been in the
past week's Chronicle:
Friday — Johnson asked for
understanding of his difficult
and lonely task of winning the
war. For two days running, he
was quoted as having felt sad
that he may be starting (or
have started) World War Three.
Saturday — U.S. bombing of
"military" targets in Hanoi was
coupled with the second "rocket
ing" of Hanoi's diplomatic sec
tor, between the Communist

Chinese and Soviet embassies,
(if the diplomatic leaders of the
North are now military targets,
where is the validity of any
U.S. desire to negotiate with
them?)
'Clean' Bombs
Sunday — Several reports of
development of "clean" nuclear
bombs, as well as plans to equip
U.S. cities with missile defense
systems, were given.
Monday — The "Tuesday
Lunch Group" of Johnson, Ros
tow, Rusk and McNamara
"creates what order there is in
the production of decisions that
direct the war." "But there is
no record for history of who
took what position on what is
sue." Rusk disseminates infor
mation to the State Department
on a "need-to-know" basis. In
formed thus are W. Bundy (Sec
retary for the Far East), Harri
man (peace probes) and Gold
berg. Because of the secrecy "a
policy decision reaches much of
the governmental structure
through the press", by official
pronouncement or leaks.
Keeping Order
One "operating bureaucrat"
complained that "officials can
not carry out top-level public
relations guidance on Vietnam
when recommendations do not
move up through channels in
any systematic way. Only by
such orderly procedure . . . can
an insider follow and explain
the direction in which policy is
moving."
Furthermore, men who have
visited Hanoi, or have been ob
serving there for years, are not
being permitted to report per
sonally to Johnson, Rusk, et al.
They are often ignored (Reeves)
or delegated to lower "operat
ing bureaucrats."
This weekend, Mr. Eisenhow
er asked the "misguided" anti
war demonstrators "if 'any of
us knows enough to be a tacti
cian, a political expert and a
master of this situation.' 'It's
only the people getting infor
mation every minute' who can
make sound judgments."

Editor, The Daily:
To set the record straight on
Bob Stone's column, "To Please
Alums, Hide the Students:"
1. Over 1,000 attended the cam
pus conference, not 300.
2. While there was some con
fusion and delay in extending in
vitation, Daily Editor Henry
Muller, Student Body President-
Elect Peter Lyman, and Vice
President C e s a r e Massarenti
were invited to participate in
"The Student and The Univer
sity" panel several days in ad
vance.
Unfortunately, none was able
to take part due to prior com
mitments, but both Muller and
Massarenti participated in an in
formal news preview of the cam
pus conference a week ago Mon
day. This featured "The Student
and The University" portion of
the program.
3. At the request of local con
ference chairmen, students have
been included in nearly all the
Stanford Conference programs
this year, as they have been in
the past.
4. All students were invited to

participate in the conference free
of charge, as reported in ad
vance in The Daily. Members of
the senior class received copies
of the program with an invita
tion. Between 25 and 50 came.
5. Trustee President Parmer
Fuller did not receive any "roar
of approval" from his audience.
When he said his colleagues held
"very strong opinions" about
student membership in the trus
tees, a round of applause fol
lowed.
6. Reporting his own reaction
to being informed of his nomi
nation as trustee president while
travelling in Beirut, Fuller said
he thought it was "a dirty trick,
a great compliment" and vowed
"never to leave home again."
The audience caught his humor,
but Stone did not.
7. Of students, Mr. Fuller said
"I have high confidence in and
great admiration for Stanford
students generally. Almost with
out exception, they are excellent,
marvelous human beings." No
great gap exists between the
substance of his remarks and
those of Provost Lyman.
Paranoic plots die hard, but
anyone who becomes acquainted
with the Alumni Association
staff will quickly discover
they're not trying to hide future

• Righteous Wrath
Editor, The Daily:
Monday The Daily set forth
the findings of the Judicial
Council as regards a campaign
letter of Mark Fogelman, candi
date for Senior Class President.
That letter set forth a list of
facts which indicated that, quite
aside from any "collusion" be
tween the other candidate (Mr.
Tom) and anyone else, certain
occurrences had prejudiced the
run-off campaign as a contest on
equal terms with equal resour
ces.
The letter, as I understood,
had been a reply to Mr. Tom's
own allegation (in his own cam
paign sheet) that most of the
points brought before the Coun
cil after the first run-off election
were mere "misunderstandings"
on Fogelman's part and were
"cleared up" by the Council.
(They were not.)
The letter was well calculated,
I think, to show that there had
been questions of basic fairness
in a campaign at stake and not
merely, as Mr. Tom suggested,
the deluded and slightly pathetic
quibblings of a defeated candi
date who would stand in the
way of student government with
carpings over mere procedure.
No Allegations
As far as I can see, Mr. Fogel
man, in his letter, had no inten
tion to, and in fact did not allege
"collusion" between The Daily
and Mr. Tom. (If the Council
infers that from the facts Fo
gelman's letter puts forth, that's
its own business.) Nor does he
allege that the other candidates
were personally responsible for
the other irregularities: matters
of "personal responsibility" are
irrelevant to the fact that such
circumstances really did preju
dice the fairness of the first elec
tion and were not merely the
creatures of a "misunderstand
ing" by Mr. Fogelman.
How the Council can itself in
fer "allegations" of "collusion"
or "design to injure" from sim
ple facts and then conclude that
the facts are insufficient to prove
the "allegation" and that there
fore the facts must be with
drawn—all that is a little be
yond me.
This is quite a different thing
from a demonstration that a
fact is not true —that is, that
Miss Wiseman was wrong in
reading the words "dirty" and
"counter-charge" into the lec
ture Mr. Horwitz delivered to
her. As far as I can see from
The Daily's coverage of the
Council session, that was the
only error of fact established.
I can hardly blame Mr. Fogel
man for backing down before
the wrath (though questionable
wisdom) of Mr. Tom and the
Council: the possibility of a suit
for libel, with or without
grounds, is a formidable deter

rent to advocacy of a lonely
cause. But I, for one, am grate
ful that someone had the nerve
to press my right for a new elec
tion where the integrity of pro
cedures is not left to chance.
May I note in passing that
there's a real irony in yester
day's letter from four poll-work
ers at the run-off election, who
first indignantly deny that vigi
lance over their activities by Stu
dent Police was necessary, and
then proceed to give proof of
their impartiality by urging the
election of Tom and Horwitz in
the new election.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to propose that
all graduating seniors join me

June 18. There are some who
will say that graduation is neith
er the proper place nor the
proper time to protest the war
in Vietnam. I can only answer
that the war is the most impor
tant question facing us today.
If a simple white arm band
causes trauma it • vill do so only
for those who have been avoid

on Vietnam or for those whose
priority scale ranks the possi

below such "important" items a.
a pleasant graduation.
Conflict is never particularly
pleasant, especially during sup

avoids the issue. We are at war.
The draft summons allows no
time out, no rest period for re
flection and decision making. 1
do not pretend that wearing a
white arm band to graduation
will end the war.
It will stir sqme needed dis
cussion between students and

with the university. For seniors
the days of mutual reinforce
