# Tension Increases As Sides Are Chosen In Arab-Israeli Conflict
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Presi
dent Johnson backed Israel and the
Soviet Union offered support to the
Arabs Tuesday night as the explo
sive Middle East crisis headed for
urgent consideration by the United
Nations Security Council. War fever
mounted in Cairo with broadcasts
calling for invasion of Israel.
Johnson labeled Egypt's threat to
blockade the Gulf of Aqaba, Israel's
trading lifeline to the Red Sea and
Indian Ocean, "illegal and potentially
disastrous to the cause of peace."
He said the United States considers
the gulf to be an international water
way and added that "the right of

free, innocent passage ... is a vital
interest of the international commu
nity."
A Soviet government statement is
sued in Moscow warned that "aggres
sion" in the Middle East "would en
counter not only the united strength
of the Arab countries, but also reso
lute resistance ... on the part of the
Soviet Union."
In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Levi
Ashkol stood firm on Israel's 10-year
old pledge to defend its gulf shipping
and declared "a fateful hour, not only
for Israel but for the whole world,"
is at hand.
Denmark and Canada, with strong
support from the United States, ask
ed for an urgent meeting of the U.N.
Security Council in New York.
U.N. Withdrawal
In Ottawa, the House of Commons

was told Canada is pressing for estab
lishment of a new U.N. presence along
the war-threatened Egyptian-Israeli
border. The U.N. is withdrawing, at
the request of Egypt, the peacekeep
ing force that patrolled the border
since the end of the Suez war in 1956.
Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson
confirmed reports that Canada has
suggested expansion of the U.N.
Truce Supervisory Organization in
Palestine.
President Johnson said the United
States urged U.N. Secretary-General
U Thant, now in Cairo on a peace
mission, to give the Gulf of Aqaba
question "the highest priority in his
discussions."
Observers believed Thant would
have little success on his mission.
