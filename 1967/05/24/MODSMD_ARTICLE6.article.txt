# Morgenthau Declares U.S. Policy Obsolete
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
"American foreign policy is obso
lescent," stated Hans J. Morgenthau
in a foreign policy speech last night.
The problems of the Vietnam war can
be directly traced to the underlying
rigidities of American foreign policy
for the last 20 years.
Morgenthau, a University of Chi
cago Professor of Political Science,
claimed, "The successes of our Euro
pean policies of 20 years ago are the
curse of our foreign policy today."
The United States is today applying
the policy of containment to utterly
different circumstances in Vietnam.
Morgenthau forsees the re-election
of President Johnson in 1968 as a
"wartime President." Called a "con
genital pessimist," by McGeorge
Bundy, he sees greater escalation in
the Vietnam War, leading to an in
vasion of North Vietnam and a for
mal declaration war prior to the
1968 election.
'Concrete Problems'
In his speech, Morgenthau out
lined five areas of "concrete prob
lems in the contemporary world." He
traced American relations with allies,
communist nations, and the uncom
mitted countries for the last 20 years.
Then he dicussed the problems of
nuclear power, and American identity
crisis.
Using a rejection of the "repres
sive force of outworn ideas that have
become dogma," he challenged the
NATO bloc concept as the most effec
tive way to protect allies and main
tain relations with Communist powers.
After Soviet Union nuclear capa-

bilities developed in the 1950'5, the
nuclear umbrella concept of NATO
was doomed. The Western European
countries began to doubt U.S. pro
tection. On the other hand, "the
Western Europeans didn't want to be
destroyed in a nuclear war over who
is going to rule Cuba, either," he said.
Unilateral Ccimmitment?
"I believe today NATO, as a very
complex instrument, could be re
placed by an American unilateral
commitment. The guarantee against
a Soviet military attack is the pres
ence of American troops east of the
Rhine," he said.
"We tend to talk in terms of con
ventional warfare. We threaten the
Soviet Union over Cuba, or they
threaten us over Berlin. We're still
talking as if nuclear weapons were
merely quantitatively large conven
tional weapons," he warned.
The non-nuclear countries have a
right to complain that they are being
discriminated against. But if one re
moves nuclear weapons from the nu
clear power, guarantees are needed
so non-nuclear powers are not sub
ject to blackmail.
On nuclear power, Morgenthau sees
proliferation as a tremendous threat.
He asks what will happen in 10 or 15
years, if an unidentified submarine
should wipe out a city of a major
power. "Who do you attack? Do you
blow up the whole world?" he asked.
Communists Divided
Morgenthau challenged the concept
of a monolithic communist bloc. "It is
obsolescent to talk about stopping
communism in Southeast Asia. Is it
North Vietnamese, Chinese, Russian,
or Viet Cong communism?" he said.
Calling Ho Chi Minh "a natural Tito
of Southeast Asia," he noted that we
are destroying the nationalism which
could be used in following the policy
of containment.
The Chicago professor urged sup
port of revolutions. "Since we want to
contain communism, we tend to op
pose revolution. But the choice before
us is between communist-dominated
revolution, and non-communist revo
lution. Otherwise, we will maneuver
ourselves into a counter-revolutionary
stance, per se," he said.
The most important problem the
United States faces is itself, he said.
Thomas Paine said the American
Revolution was made for humanity.
The rest of the world has tried to
emulate America."The great tragedy
of our present foreign policy is that
we have lost sight of this fact," he
said.
Prof. Morgenthau will participate
in a faculty panel discussion on the
U.S. in Southeast Asia at 3:15 p.m. to
day in Tresidder Large Lounge. The
moderator will be Prof. Robert C.
North.
