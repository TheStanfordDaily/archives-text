# Judicial Council Members:
## Fun Stan Now A Legalistic Tool 
### HENRY MULLER 
Two Judicial Council members yes
terday said that the approach taken
to the Fundamental Standard by the
recent Interim Judicial Board (IJB)
decision on Marc Sapir is leading to a
schism in the community.
"Instead of faculty and students
working together to figure out how to
revitalize the Fundamental Standard
and make it a working internalized
mechanism for students, they have
manipulated it into a legalistic tool."
Council members Judy Bader and
Dan Lewis made this statement in
reference to the IJB's decision that
violations of University law, policy,
and regulations are also violations of
the Fundamental Standard.
Lewis expressed his disappointment
with the ruling by explaining that
separating University policy as one
sphere of activity and Fundamental
Standard violations as another would
lead to a situation in which the Fun
damental Standard no longer would
bo a regulating device over a student's
attitude toward his activities.
Some IMseretinn
In other words, according to Miss
Bader, "students are given discretion
with respect to one broad area (where

there are no University regulations),
but in the areas where the University
has established a policy, they are not
given any discretion."
"Consequently the Fundamental
Standard loses all semblance of a con
science device because students are
only trusted in some areas," said
Lewis. "The legalistic rational ap
proach to the Standard misses the
whole point; if you are going to make
it into a strictly legal document, then
you might as well codify 8000 rules
and have this mean the Fun Stan."
The result, he said, is that students
will be drifting away from the spirit
of responsibility and good citizenship
demanded by the Standard.
New Structure Necessary
Lewis and Miss Bader were pessi
mistic about any solution to the imme
diate problem, but expressed the hope
that, since the present judicial struc
ture was bad, it might be restructured
by either the Study of Education
(SES> or Student Body President-
Elect Peter Lyman's administration.
Lewis suggested that the best solu
tion might lie in having a decentral
ized system with judicial bodies in
each living group and graduate school.
This, he said, would give more mean
ing to judicial proceedings because a

student would feel responsible to those
he is close to rather than to an ex
ternal body like Judicial Council.
Both Miss Bader and Lewis con
demned the present structure of IJB.
They pointed out that it should con
sist of at least as many students as
faculty and that the faculty members
should be appointed by the Academic
Council, not the president of the Uni
versity.
Faculty Cooperation
In emphasizing the importance of
obtaining student and faculty coopera
tion in a judicial system, Lewis point
ed to the value of Professor Lorie
Tarshis' participation with the Coun
cil."The Council and everyone appear
ing before it have benefited from his
presence," he said.
Lewis and Miss Bader agree that
faculty members in a decentralized
system should assist local councils,
but insist that they should first be
asked to do so by the students.
When asked how Judicial Coun
cil could function next year when it
must operate under principles its
members may not agree with, Lewis
said that it would depend on how well
they can "submerge their personal
feelings."
