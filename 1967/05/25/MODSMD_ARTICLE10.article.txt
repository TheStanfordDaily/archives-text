## 'Mafia' Show Hits Season Low 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Last Saturday night and Sun
day morning, at Dinkelspiel after
the Men's Glee Club Concert, we
were treated to the Mafia Ex
travaganza.
This, with Inadmissible Evi
dence, I rate as the all-time low
of this season. Rather inept im
provisations, for the most part,
and some unbelievably trite
clowning dragged wearily on till
about two in the small hours.
What was strange about the
show is that it began so prom
isingly. Carrillo Gantner and
Jennifer Haefele imitated a sing
ing recital. Other Mafia mem
• bers then walked on and splodged
pies all over their faces.
My only reaction to this ted
ious slapstick was a certain com
[ passion for the nicely fitting
| tuxedo that the hero had been
wearing.
Amusing Parody
Later in the show, Steven New
man was consistently amusing
in his parody of My Secret San
Francisco about Palo Alto sex
life, etc. The übiquitous Feldner
was all right in an inexplicable
mime sequence. Ellen Perry ap
peared in her usual black danc
ing kit, and put that little bit
extra into her work which makes
it too earnest.
What else was there in Satur

day night's Mafia? Edelman and
Feldner doing the over-adver
tised Pope In Yankee Stadium,
plenty of music, some original
and very striking (though out of
place in connection with drama
graduates and their self-con
fessed "skits."
John Wright and Doug John
son (the latter possibly the Cam
pus' best director of shows) were
involved, with a score of helpers
and harmers and other Mafia
fellow travellers.
As a vehicle for dramatic self
expression and vivacious stage
virtuosite, The Mafia has indubit
ably confirmed many of us in our
belief that Sheldon Feldner and
Steve Newman are brilliant
show-offs.
Hyper-Talented Comic
While I admire Charles Edel
man and Joseph Medalis most of
all in their troupe (the latter
particularly, though not yet as
a playwright) and find Carrillo
Gantner a hyper-talented comic
actor, I feel it is only fair to point
out that Newman and Feldner
are in high demand as profes

sional actors and have even
turned down offers to stay at
Stanford.
Their involvement with S.R.T.
commits them to heavy duties
such as Once In A Lifetime, in
which they were both well-re
hearsed and convincing; perhaps
the diminution of their Mafia
appearances and an increase in
those of Miss Haefele, of Mssrs.
Gantner, Edelman and Tschern
isch, would benefit the Mafia in
histrionic no less than financial
terms.
In the Nitery, and with Pint
er's The Dumb Waiter, if not
with Brecht's The Jewish Wife,
the Mafia were a pleasant suc
cess. Dinkelspiel and $1.50 per
ticket eluded the good start. The
Mafia will be intelligent if they
do what S.R.T. has declared that
it will do next season: clip its
wings and operate on a much
tighter budget.

Facetiousness should never bo
substituted for intellectual
amusement; while there is much
that is good in an instant parody
on, for example, "chewing-gum,"
one might hope that sheer quan
tity of drama on Campus could
be replaced by a serious and elec
tic ideal of adult evening enter
tainment.
