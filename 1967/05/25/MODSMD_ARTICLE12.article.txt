# Wild West
## Cows Outnumber Faculty 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
There are more cows than
faculty members at Stanford.
Though the University open
ed more than 76 years ago, 4000
acres, nearly half of its land,
is still used for agriculture.
This land is rented to a dozen
tenants who raise everything
from cows to gladiolas, the cows
totalling over 1500, compared
with 1000 faculty members.
The largest plot is rented by
Manuel Piers, owner of Piers'
Dairy in Palo Alto. He owns
2300 acres and raises over 1000
head of cattle. He has been
renting Stanford land for 46
years, beginning with a 75 acre
plot near Page Mill Road and
Junipero Serra. His holdings
now stretch from there up to
Felt Lake and down to Lake
Lagunita.
Wild West
His headquarters are located
at Felt Ranch, boardering La
dera and near Felt Lake, but he
was found yesterday afternoon
near his original plot oversee
ing a resurrection of the wild
west. One hundred calves were
being branded, de-horned, and
vaccinated.
The calves were crowded to
gether in two make-shift corrals
which stood in contrast to the
adjacent sleek, black belt of
highway.
Doing the work were a half
dozen cowboys from the area,
dressed in boots, stirrups, ten
gallon hats, jeans, and chaps.
In introduction, it was discover
ed three were doctors, two were
lawyers, and one was a real
estate agent.
Arrival
They began arriving at 1:00
p.m., bringing their horses with
them in trailers. As each pulled
into the corral area, they stop
ped by Piers' Lincoln Continen
tal to say hello. Piers, who says
he usually rides with the boys,
was resting in the car, disabled
by a broken arm, suffered when
he was thrown off a horse re
cently.
With mounts ready and lassos
in hand, the doctors, lawyers,
and real-estate agent entered
the corral and began rounding
up the calves, sending them into
the branding area ten at a time.
Once in the area, the calves
were lassoed by two riders and
hauled to the ground, where
their legs were tied together.
The first process was de-horn
ing. A clipper was brought over
and the two small horns on each
calf were quickly severed, re
sulting in a very unhappy cow
and a blood stained clipper.
Vaccination
One of the doctors, who is a
vet, then injected the vaccina
tion and the calf was ready for
branding. The red-hot iron was
efficiently utilized, creating the
usual scene of smoking and
burning flesh on a squirming
and bellowing calf.
After the first calf got the
treatment, the others, who had
sensed what it entailed, became
harder to bring down. One ob
server, five year old Mike Acker,
whose face was nearly obscured
under a ten-gallon hat noted,
"There are some real meanies
out there." It was unclear wheth
er he was referring to the cattle
or the men.
When one calf was brought
down by the tail, Mike said, with
a grin across his face, "that's
the funniest part when they pull
them down by the tails." He
then walked off to get a better
view, circling his miniature las
so above his head.
The action proceeded for sev
eral hours, with Piers looking

on all the time, often offering
words of advice and enthusiasm.
During a pause, he recounted
some of the major developments
on his Stanford land during the
past 45 years. "I began with
100 dairy cattle, and by 1960,
had over 700. They used to sup
ply me with a lot of milk for
the dairy. But seven years ago
I switched to beef cattle, selling
all the dairy cows. I now get
most of my milk from up in
Marin County."
He explained that his holdings
grew as other tenants relin
quished theirs to the Univer
sity and he bought them. At this
point, the real-estate agent rode
over. Asked how he got inter
ested in cows and horses, he
answered, "I've always been in
terested in them. It's real-estate
I've got interested in. I was
born in New Mexico and moved
out here 12 years ago. Up to 2
years ago I was a professional
rodeo cowboy."
Mount Patrol
One of the doctors joined the
group, adding that he rides as
a hobby, but takes it very seri
ously. Still sitting on his dark
brown horse, he said, "I'm a
member of the Mount Patrol. It
was set up during World War II
to scout the West Coast for
enemy ships or submarines.
We're on 24 hour a day call, and
now spend most of our time
searching for escaped convicts
or lost hikers. We've never lost
a man yet."
Piers nodded in agreement
and noted that he was a found
ing member of the Patrol. Roger
Piers, his son, called from the
corral that the irons were hot
again and he was ready to re
sume. Left with a know-nothing
college student, the elder Piers
explained the operation of his
ranch. "It's part of the original
Stanford Ranch, and we use the
same barns and stables. I've got
about three or four men work
ing for me, fixing fences, and
caring for cows and horses. I've
got fifteen horses."
University
Asked whether the University
ever got in his way, he said,
"No, not at all. My cows aren't
bothered by a radar scope."
"What about students?"
"Oh, it's private property and
they aren't allowed on. The po
lice patrol the roads and Felt
Lake to be sure they don't hang
around. Sure, some take hikes,
but there aren't many and they
don't do much harm."
Saying he wanted to sit down,

the short, fairly rotund man
headed off toward his car. At
last sight he was still sitting
there, obviously enjoying his
view of Stanford University.
The Stanford Business Office
reports that Piers and the other

tenants pay $40,000 a year for
the land, but the University in
turn has to pay $160,000 in
taxes. And if Piers ever failed
to pay, which is considered an
impossibility, the Board of Trus
tees would inherit 1000 cows.

ever got in his way, he said,
"No, not at all. My cows aren't
bothered by a radar scope."
"What about students?"
"Oh, it's private property and
they aren't allowed on. The po
lice patrol the roads and Felt
Lake to be sure they don't hang
around. Sure, some take hikes,
but there aren't many and they
don't do much harm."
Saying he wanted to sit down,

the short, fairly rotund man
headed off toward his car. At
last sight he was still sitting
there, obviously enjoying his
view of Stanford University.
The Stanford Business Office
reports that Piers and the other

tenants pay $40,000 a year for
the land, but the University in
turn has to pay $160,000 in
taxes. And if Piers ever failed
to pay, which is considered an
impossibility, the Board of Trus
tees would inherit 1000 cows.
There are more cows than
faculty members at Stanford.
Though the University open
ed more than 76 years ago, 4000
acres, nearly half of its land,
is still used for agriculture.
This land is rented to a dozen
tenants who raise everything
from cows to gladiolas, the cows
totalling over 1500, compared
with 1000 faculty members.
The largest plot is rented by
Manuel Piers, owner of Piers'
Dairy in Palo Alto. He owns
2300 acres and raises over 1000
head of cattle. He has been
renting Stanford land for 46
years, beginning with a 75 acre
plot near Page Mill Road and
Junipero Serra. His holdings
now stretch from there up to
Felt Lake and down to Lake
Lagunita.
Wild West
His headquarters are located
at Felt Ranch, boardering La
dera and near Felt Lake, but he
was found yesterday afternoon
near his original plot oversee
ing a resurrection of the wild
west. One hundred calves were
being branded, de-horned, and
vaccinated.
The calves were crowded to
gether in two make-shift corrals
which stood in contrast to the
adjacent sleek, black belt of
highway.
Doing the work were a half
dozen cowboys from the area,
dressed in boots, stirrups, ten
gallon hats, jeans, and chaps.
In introduction, it was discover
ed three were doctors, two were
lawyers, and one was a real
estate agent.
Arrival
They began arriving at 1:00
p.m., bringing their horses with
them in trailers. As each pulled
into the corral area, they stop
ped by Piers' Lincoln Continen
tal to say hello. Piers, who says
he usually rides with the boys,
was resting in the car, disabled
by a broken arm, suffered when
he was thrown off a horse re
cently.
With mounts ready and lassos
in hand, the doctors, lawyers,
and real-estate agent entered
the corral and began rounding
up the calves, sending them into
the branding area ten at a time.
Once in the area, the calves
were lassoed by two riders and
hauled to the ground, where
their legs were tied together.
The first process was de-horn
ing. A clipper was brought over
and the two small horns on each
calf were quickly severed, re
sulting in a very unhappy cow
and a blood stained clipper.
Vaccination
One of the doctors, who is a
vet, then injected the vaccina
tion and the calf was ready for
branding. The red-hot iron was
efficiently utilized, creating the
usual scene of smoking and
burning flesh on a squirming
and bellowing calf.
After the first calf got the
treatment, the others, who had
sensed what it entailed, became
harder to bring down. One ob
server, five year old Mike Acker,
whose face was nearly obscured
under a ten-gallon hat noted,
"There are some real meanies
out there." It was unclear wheth
er he was referring to the cattle
or the men.
When one calf was brought
down by the tail, Mike said, with
a grin across his face, "that's
the funniest part when they pull
them down by the tails." He
then walked off to get a better
view, circling his miniature las
so above his head.
The action proceeded for sev
eral hours, with Piers looking

on all the time, often offering
words of advice and enthusiasm.
During a pause, he recounted
some of the major developments
on his Stanford land during the
past 45 years. "I began with
100 dairy cattle, and by 1960,
had over 700. They used to sup
ply me with a lot of milk for
the dairy. But seven years ago
I switched to beef cattle, selling
all the dairy cows. I now get
most of my milk from up in
Marin County."
He explained that his holdings
grew as other tenants relin
quished theirs to the Univer
sity and he bought them. At this
point, the real-estate agent rode
over. Asked how he got inter
ested in cows and horses, he
answered, "I've always been in
terested in them. It's real-estate
I've got interested in. I was
born in New Mexico and moved
out here 12 years ago. Up to 2
years ago I was a professional
rodeo cowboy."
Mount Patrol
One of the doctors joined the
group, adding that he rides as
a hobby, but takes it very seri
ously. Still sitting on his dark
brown horse, he said, "I'm a
member of the Mount Patrol. It
was set up during World War II
to scout the West Coast for
enemy ships or submarines.
We're on 24 hour a day call, and
now spend most of our time
searching for escaped convicts
or lost hikers. We've never lost
a man yet."
Piers nodded in agreement
and noted that he was a found
ing member of the Patrol. Roger
Piers, his son, called from the
corral that the irons were hot
again and he was ready to re
sume. Left with a know-nothing
college student, the elder Piers
explained the operation of his
ranch. "It's part of the original
Stanford Ranch, and we use the
same barns and stables. I've got
about three or four men work
ing for me, fixing fences, and
caring for cows and horses. I've
got fifteen horses."
University

ever got in his way, he said,
"No, not at all. My cows aren't

brown horse, he said, "I'm a
member of the Mount Patrol. It
was set up during World War II
to scout the West Coast for
enemy ships or submarines.
We're on 24 hour a day call, and
now spend most of our time
searching for escaped convicts
or lost hikers. We've never lost
a man yet."
Piers nodded in agreement
and noted that he was a found
ing member of the Patrol. Roger
Piers, his son, called from the
corral that the irons were hot
again and he was ready to re
sume. Left with a know-nothing
college student, the elder Piers
explained the operation of his
ranch. "It's part of the original
Stanford Ranch, and we use the
same barns and stables. I've got
about three or four men work
ing for me, fixing fences, and
caring for cows and horses. I've
got fifteen horses."
University
Asked whether the University
ever got in his way, he said,
"No, not at all. My cows aren't
bothered by a radar scope."
"What about students?"
"Oh, it's private property and
they aren't allowed on. The po
lice patrol the roads and Felt
Lake to be sure they don't hang
around. Sure, some take hikes,
but there aren't many and they
don't do much harm."
Saying he wanted to sit down,

the short, fairly rotund man
headed off toward his car. At
last sight he was still sitting
there, obviously enjoying his
view of Stanford University.
The Stanford Business Office
reports that Piers and the other

tenants pay $40,000 a year for
the land, but the University in
turn has to pay $160,000 in
taxes. And if Piers ever failed
to pay, which is considered an
impossibility, the Board of Trus
tees would inherit 1000 cows.
There are more cows than
faculty members at Stanford.
Though the University open
ed more than 76 years ago, 4000
acres, nearly half of its land,
is still used for agriculture.
This land is rented to a dozen
tenants who raise everything
from cows to gladiolas, the cows
totalling over 1500, compared
with 1000 faculty members.
The largest plot is rented by
Manuel Piers, owner of Piers'
Dairy in Palo Alto. He owns
2300 acres and raises over 1000
head of cattle. He has been
renting Stanford land for 46
years, beginning with a 75 acre
plot near Page Mill Road and
Junipero Serra. His holdings
now stretch from there up to
Felt Lake and down to Lake
Lagunita.
Wild West
His headquarters are located
at Felt Ranch, boardering La
dera and near Felt Lake, but he
was found yesterday afternoon
near his original plot oversee
ing a resurrection of the wild
west. One hundred calves were
being branded, de-horned, and
vaccinated.
The calves were crowded to
gether in two make-shift corrals
which stood in contrast to the
adjacent sleek, black belt of
highway.
Doing the work were a half
dozen cowboys from the area,
dressed in boots, stirrups, ten
gallon hats, jeans, and chaps.
In introduction, it was discover
ed three were doctors, two were
lawyers, and one was a real
estate agent.
Arrival
They began arriving at 1:00
p.m., bringing their horses with
them in trailers. As each pulled
into the corral area, they stop
ped by Piers' Lincoln Continen
tal to say hello. Piers, who says
he usually rides with the boys,
was resting in the car, disabled
by a broken arm, suffered when
he was thrown off a horse re
cently.
With mounts ready and lassos
in hand, the doctors, lawyers,
and real-estate agent entered
the corral and began rounding
up the calves, sending them into
the branding area ten at a time.
Once in the area, the calves
were lassoed by two riders and
hauled to the ground, where
their legs were tied together.
The first process was de-horn
ing. A clipper was brought over
and the two small horns on each
calf were quickly severed, re
sulting in a very unhappy cow
and a blood stained clipper.
Vaccination
One of the doctors, who is a
vet, then injected the vaccina
tion and the calf was ready for
branding. The red-hot iron was
efficiently utilized, creating the
usual scene of smoking and
burning flesh on a squirming
and bellowing calf.
After the first calf got the
treatment, the others, who had
sensed what it entailed, became
harder to bring down. One ob
server, five year old Mike Acker,
whose face was nearly obscured
under a ten-gallon hat noted,
"There are some real meanies
out there." It was unclear wheth
er he was referring to the cattle
or the men.
When one calf was brought
down by the tail, Mike said, with
a grin across his face, "that's
the funniest part when they pull
them down by the tails." He
then walked off to get a better
view, circling his miniature las
so above his head.
The action proceeded for sev
eral hours, with Piers looking

on all the time, often offering
words of advice and enthusiasm.
During a pause, he recounted
some of the major developments
on his Stanford land during the
past 45 years. "I began with
100 dairy cattle, and by 1960,
had over 700. They used to sup
ply me with a lot of milk for
the dairy. But seven years ago
I switched to beef cattle, selling
all the dairy cows. I now get
most of my milk from up in
Marin County."
He explained that his holdings
grew as other tenants relin
quished theirs to the Univer
sity and he bought them. At this
point, the real-estate agent rode
over. Asked how he got inter
ested in cows and horses, he
answered, "I've always been in
terested in them. It's real-estate
I've got interested in. I was
born in New Mexico and moved
out here 12 years ago. Up to 2
years ago I was a professional
rodeo cowboy."
Mount Patrol
One of the doctors joined the
group, adding that he rides as
a hobby, but takes it very seri
ously. Still sitting on his dark
brown horse, he said, "I'm a
member of the Mount Patrol. It
