# Louis Lomax
## Best Vietnam Solution: 'Get Out' 
### CICELY BATES 
The best solution for the war
in Vietnam is to "get out" ex
claimed Louis Lomax at dinner
in Rinconada last night.
Mr. Lomax is opposed to the
war and gained much publicity
several months ago when he
flew to Cambodia with the in
tention of visiting North Viet
nam. He had been invited to the
North by Ho Chin Minh to get
the straight facts. However with
no official explanation, he was
denied entrance to the country
and was forced to return to the
United States without having
visited the country.
The proposed Vietnam Sum
mer will do little more than vent
feelings of those opposed to the
war but will have no influence
on American Policy, stated Mr.
Lomax, the rumor of detention
camps being started by the
Americans and other "scare

rumors" spread by so-called
peace advocates accomplish
nothing. These rumors are be
ing spread by a sort of "Left-
Wing Birch Society" and until
the exact spots of these camps
can be pointed out, Mr. Lomax
said that he would refuse to be
lieve such reports. The only
peace movement that can be in
fluencing are voter registration
and political education for 1968,
Mr. Lomax added. Until the av
erage American can understand
the war, peace movements will
have no effects.
No "Declared War"
Even though it would make
no difference, Mr. Lomax be
lieves, a "declared war" is un
likely in Vietnam as is any ma
jor invasion of the North. "I
can't see Johnson asking for it."
"Stokely Carmichael is insane
to call Vietnam a race war," as

serted Mr. Lomax. There is a
higher percentage of Negroes in
Vietnam than in the United
States because the Negroes
themselves have volunteered.
There is no discriminating in
volved in their selection. The
duty is hazardous but the mili
tary can be an easier career to
tackle than others in the United
States, he added. The Wilbur-
Guest-in Residence nodded in
agreement when asked if it was,
for many Negroes, the "lesser
of two evils."
The expert in race issues also
stated that Black Power is only
a scare phrase and "makes no
sense what so ever." He went on
to say that to think of the Ne
groes as having "leaders" is a
subservient assumption and
each individual Negro is doing
for himself."
Mr. Lomax said he had re

spect for Muhammed Ali for
giving up fame for his con
science. He believes that Mu
hammad Ali had not legitimate
claim for deferrment but be
lieves that everyone has the
right to oppose the draft, but
then must be willing to accept
the consequences.
"The Arabs will back down,"
advised the authority on Asian
and African nations in response
to the newly-developed Egypt-
Israel conflict. "There will not
be a war at this time but it
could conceivably come later."
All the nations in Asia and Afri
ca will have a strong voice in
the future because in sheer num
bers they are important and
even now they hold a majority
in the United Nations. Their
governments will be neither
Democratic or Capitalistic. Each
government will be individual

istic and can not and should
not be labeled. This labeling is
what is wrong with the war in
Vietnam right now, feels Mr.
Lomax.
Looking ahead to the 1968
presidential elections, Mr. Lo
max feels that no one knows
what will happen. However it
is his opinion that the Demo
crats will be obligated to re
nominate Lyndon Johnson and
Richard Nixon and Ronald Rea
gan could be strong contenders
for the Republican bid. The war
in Vietnam will definitely be the
major issue, he exclaimed.
While Mr. Lomax considers
hi'mself to be chiefly a writer
with his fourth book coming out
next September, he has lectured
in every major American city
and university. He also con
ducts his own twice-weekly tele
vision program in Los Angeles.

Although Mr. Lomax has dedi
cated a great part of his life
to writing, he started out his
professional career as an As
sistant Professor of Sociology
at Georgia State College, after
graduating from Paine College
in George and doing graduate
work at the American Univer
sity in Washington, D.C. and
Yale University in Connecticut.

and political education for 1968,
Mr. Lomax added. Until the av
erage American can understand
the war, peace movements will
have no effects.
No "Declared War"
Even though it would make
no difference, Mr. Lomax be
lieves, a "declared war" is un
likely in Vietnam as is any ma
jor invasion of the North. "I
can't see Johnson asking for it."
"Stokely Carmichael is insane
to call Vietnam a race war," as

serted Mr. Lomax. There is a
higher percentage of Negroes in
Vietnam than in the United
States because the Negroes
themselves have volunteered.
There is no discriminating in
volved in their selection. The
duty is hazardous but the mili
tary can be an easier career to
tackle than others in the United
States, he added. The Wilbur-
Guest-in Residence nodded in
agreement when asked if it was,
for many Negroes, the "lesser
of two evils."
The expert in race issues also
stated that Black Power is only
a scare phrase and "makes no
sense what so ever." He went on
to say that to think of the Ne
groes as having "leaders" is a
subservient assumption and
each individual Negro is doing
for himself."
Mr. Lomax said he had re

spect for Muhammed Ali for
giving up fame for his con
science. He believes that Mu
hammad Ali had not legitimate
claim for deferrment but be
lieves that everyone has the
right to oppose the draft, but
then must be willing to accept
the consequences.
"The Arabs will back down,"
advised the authority on Asian
and African nations in response
to the newly-developed Egypt-
Israel conflict. "There will not
be a war at this time but it
could conceivably come later."
All the nations in Asia and Afri
ca will have a strong voice in
the future because in sheer num
bers they are important and
even now they hold a majority
in the United Nations. Their
governments will be neither
Democratic or Capitalistic. Each
government will be individual

istic and can not and should
not be labeled. This labeling is
what is wrong with the war in
Vietnam right now, feels Mr.
Lomax.
Looking ahead to the 1968
presidential elections, Mr. Lo
max feels that no one knows
what will happen. However it
is his opinion that the Demo
crats will be obligated to re
nominate Lyndon Johnson and
Richard Nixon and Ronald Rea
gan could be strong contenders
for the Republican bid. The war
in Vietnam will definitely be the
major issue, he exclaimed.
While Mr. Lomax considers
hi'mself to be chiefly a writer
with his fourth book coming out
next September, he has lectured
in every major American city
and university. He also con
ducts his own twice-weekly tele
vision program in Los Angeles.

Although Mr. Lomax has dedi
cated a great part of his life
to writing, he started out his
professional career as an As
sistant Professor of Sociology
at Georgia State College, after
graduating from Paine College
in George and doing graduate
work at the American Univer
sity in Washington, D.C. and
Yale University in Connecticut.
The best solution for the war
in Vietnam is to "get out" ex
claimed Louis Lomax at dinner
in Rinconada last night.
Mr. Lomax is opposed to the
war and gained much publicity
several months ago when he
flew to Cambodia with the in
tention of visiting North Viet
nam. He had been invited to the
North by Ho Chin Minh to get
the straight facts. However with
no official explanation, he was
denied entrance to the country
and was forced to return to the
United States without having
visited the country.
The proposed Vietnam Sum
mer will do little more than vent
feelings of those opposed to the
war but will have no influence
on American Policy, stated Mr.
Lomax, the rumor of detention
camps being started by the
Americans and other "scare

rumors" spread by so-called
peace advocates accomplish
nothing. These rumors are be
ing spread by a sort of "Left-
Wing Birch Society" and until
the exact spots of these camps
can be pointed out, Mr. Lomax
said that he would refuse to be
lieve such reports. The only
peace movement that can be in
fluencing are voter registration
and political education for 1968,
Mr. Lomax added. Until the av
erage American can understand
the war, peace movements will
have no effects.
