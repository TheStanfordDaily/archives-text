# Music Department Announces Opera Workshop To Be Instituted Next Year
## 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
The Stanford Music Depart
ment has recently voted to put
into effect an opera workshop
to be instituted next year. The
workshop will center around
four areas of instruction: 1) a
foundation class in acting for
singers, to be taught by Gerald
Hiken of the drj<ma department;
2) a movement and dance class
to be taught by Inga Weiss; 3)
a course in repertory, and 4)
individual and ensemble coach
ing. The latter two areas will
be taught by music department
faculty, notably Sandor Salgo,
conductor of the Stanford Sym
phony, and Ivan Rasmussen,
lecturer in voice.
The workshop will culminate
in at least one performance per
quarter, featuring either opera
scenes or a short opera, and one
major production per year, sche
duled presently for spring quar
ter, 1968. The smaller produc
tions will probably consist of
scenes from several of the ma
jor operatic works, whereas for
the large production, the depart
ment would like to present less
well-known works, such as new
American operas or modern
ones that have not been exten
sively performed. The purpose
will be to introduce these works

to the public and the perform
ers, and to avoid duplication
with the Sam Francisco opera
/company. Admission to the
workshop will be by audition
only.
Interest In Opera
Contrary to much rumor and
speculation, the workshop, ac
cording to Dr. William L. Cro
sten, head of the music depart
ment, is not a response or a re
sult of the recent production of
Gianni Schicchi, successful both
musically and financially. Rath
er, Crosten stated, this made
the department aware of the
amount of interest that existed
for such projects and reinforced
their already present desire to
stage operas.
Unknown to most, Stanford
has had a fairly long tradition
of opera presentation. Whereas
most of the Eastern Universities
have concentrated on theory
and history, deliberately elimi
nating performance from their
programs, the Western Univer
sities have tended to incorpor
ate performance as much as
possible. The first year that the
Stanford music department was
in existence it sponsored an
opera and then regularly con
tinued the practice. These op
era performances featured stu
dent soloists "in so far as stu
dents were to sing the
roles," Crosten emphasized. The
chorus and orchestra were com
posed entirely of students. The
object was to choose works of
musical and dramatic value and
to try to do justice to them. Un
fortunately, Crosten said, the

students often were not capable
of the leading roles, and thus
professionals were brought in
to perform these parts "in order
to keep the artistic validity with
a benefit for the community and
the participants."
Danger To Voices
He went on to cite reasons for
the need for the professionals.
It is obviously more difficult to
perform demanding works with
a large body, such as a chorus
or an orchestra, than with solo
singers. Furthermore, singers,
in general, begin to study seri
ously much later than instru
mental players in order not to

harm their voices. Crosten
stated that there might even be
a danger to student voices, if
they were forced into something
beyond their capabilities.
Three basic objectives for the
productions were at that time
cited and they are still sup
ported by members of the fac
ulty: 1) To give the students an
inside view of opera through
participation; 2) To produce
works of value outside the regu
lar repertory of the few Ameri
can professional houses; and 3)
To develop and demonstrate
methods of opera production
which respond to aesthetic and

economic problems of our day.
At that time, the performances
were apparently excellent as
Viigil Thomson commented in
the New York Herald Tribune
several years ago, "Opera pro
duction, long a custom at Stan
ford, is nowhere in our colleges
more carefully done. . . . We
are little accustomed in the East
to this kind of college produc
tion." Unfortunately, these pro
ductions stopped about four
years ago.
