# Freshmen Present Bawdy Satire
## 
### MARTA MAHONEY 
The Freshman Drama Group's
spring production, The Knight
of the Burning Pestle, will be
presented next Sunday and
Monday nights, May 28 and 29,
at 8 p.m. in the Branner dining
room. Admission is free.
The Knight of the Burning
Pestle is a bawdy, satiric come
dy written in 1607 by Beaumont
and Fletcher. It is considered
Jacobean drama. Hazelton Spen
cer of Johns Hopkins Univer
sity calls it,"The earliest first
rate burlesque piece of the En
glish stage; unequaled in its
kind until our own time." Knight
parodies English plays of the
period, chivalry, the nobility, the
common people, and Don Qui
xote, which was published a few
years earlier. It concerns a
grocer and his wife who attend
a play called The London Mer
chant, become disgusted with
the play and the actors, and

insist that their apprentice
Ralph be allowed to take a
part, with hilariously disastrous
results. Ralph becomes the
Knight of the Burning Pestle
and performs heroic feats, cheer
ed on by the grocer and his
wife.
During intermission Paul
Hertzog will present a musical
program featuring recorders
and other instruments of the
period. He will play medieval
music and several specially-ar
ranged modern songs.
Sort Of Wild
"We picked this play," said
Ken King, president of the
group, "because it is funny and
requires a fairly large cast.
We're keeping it light; the play
has deeper levels of satire, but
we're not emphasizing that. We
do best with things that are
sort of wild — we don't have
the background as people or
actors, to do a really serious or
tragic play."

Freshman Drama grew out of
a project conceived by Voice
Project Instructor Mark Mirsky
for his freshman seminar. Mir
sky wanted each of the eight
seminar members to direct a
play, and suggested that they
form a drama group for this
purpose. There are now about
twenty students in the group,
which is entirely independent
of faculty or university support.
Previous Work
Fall quarter Freshman Drama
presented two medieval miracle
plays, sponsored jointly by the
English Department and the
Dean of the Chapel's office.
These were the first plays ever
staged in Memorial Church. As
a result of these plays, the group
was mentioned in Time maga
zine's November 28 issue. They
went on to produce an original
short film and six plays during
winter quarter: Under Milk
Wood by Dylan Thomas, This
Property is Condemned by Ten
nessee Williams, The Lesson by
lonesco, Riders to the Sea by
J. M. Synge, The Death of the
Hired Man by .Robert Frost, and
their much-acclaimed produc
tion of T. S. Eliot's The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.
Although the majority of their
audience are freshmen, the fac
ulty response has been highly
enthusiastic. English Professor
Larry Friedlander calls them,
"A fresh and original group; a
surprisingly polished perform
ance." Professor Thomas C.

Moser, head of the English De
partment, says, "Freshman
Drama has succeeded remark
ably well in demonstrating the
enduring vitality and delight
of communal theater; superb
theatrical talent," and Mirsky
characterizes them as "a wild,
zestful group of madcaps; an
evening of student dynamite."
The group is entirely student
run; Mirsky and Friedlander at
tend rehearsals once a week,
but only in a nominal advisory
capacity. "We learn from each
other," says Mark Griffiths, who
directed Prufrock winter quar
ter and is directing Knight of
the Burning Pestle. Criticism
and suggestions are welcomed
from any member of the group.
No formal dramatic training is
involved; the group exists solely
for the pleasure of its members.
Residence Drama
"Our aim is to bring drama
into the residences," says Dilip
Mirchandani. Ken King calls it
"intimate drama," and adds, "At
Harvard each residence has its
own drama group. This is the
type of thing, mainly oriented
towards the freshman dorms."
The group feels it is making
a definite contribution to cam
pus dratma. "We are able to pre
sent a larger variety of perfor
mances than other groups on
campus because we are auto
nomous and are free to experi
ment," comments Mark Grif
fiths. "We're not tied to any
particular type of drama. Our

only probem is that we can't
sing."
Any freshman student may
try out for the group. All who
tried out were given parts, but
as someone noted, "All those
who tried out were extremely
talented." Students receive ac
tivity credit for participating.
The group plans to continue
next year as an unaffiliated
drama organization.
Support Of Group
The consistent success of
Freshman Drama has sparked
plans for a similar group next
year, with an allotment of $1000
toward production costs from
the English Department. This
year the group is supporting
itself, except for $200 from the
fund that also sponsors Fresh
man Voices magazine and the
Freshman Seminar program.
They raised most of their money
at a dance held several months
ago in the Experiment building.
Props and costumes are either
made by the members or bor
rowed from the Stanford Rep
ertory Theater, which gives the
group considerable help in this
area. Plays are held in the Bran
ner dining hall because of the
lack of suitable university fa
cilities for small drama groups.
Despite these drawbacks, the
members of the group prefer to
continue as a completely inde
pendent organization. Their suc
cess proves that an entirely stu
dent-run group is able to sur
vive at Stanford.

J. M. Synge, The Death of the
Hired Man by .Robert Frost, and
their much-acclaimed produc
tion of T. S. Eliot's The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.
Although the majority of their
audience are freshmen, the fac
ulty response has been highly
enthusiastic. English Professor
Larry Friedlander calls them,
"A fresh and original group; a
surprisingly polished perform
ance." Professor Thomas C.

Moser, head of the English De
partment, says, "Freshman
Drama has succeeded remark
ably well in demonstrating the
enduring vitality and delight
of communal theater; superb
theatrical talent," and Mirsky
characterizes them as "a wild,
zestful group of madcaps; an
evening of student dynamite."
The group is entirely student
run; Mirsky and Friedlander at
tend rehearsals once a week,
but only in a nominal advisory
capacity. "We learn from each
other," says Mark Griffiths, who
directed Prufrock winter quar
ter and is directing Knight of
the Burning Pestle. Criticism
and suggestions are welcomed
from any member of the group.
No formal dramatic training is
involved; the group exists solely
for the pleasure of its members.
Residence Drama
"Our aim is to bring drama
into the residences," says Dilip
Mirchandani. Ken King calls it
"intimate drama," and adds, "At
Harvard each residence has its
own drama group. This is the
type of thing, mainly oriented
towards the freshman dorms."
The group feels it is making
a definite contribution to cam
pus dratma. "We are able to pre
sent a larger variety of perfor
mances than other groups on
campus because we are auto
nomous and are free to experi
ment," comments Mark Grif
fiths. "We're not tied to any
particular type of drama. Our

only probem is that we can't
sing."
Any freshman student may
try out for the group. All who
tried out were given parts, but
as someone noted, "All those
who tried out were extremely
talented." Students receive ac
tivity credit for participating.
The group plans to continue
next year as an unaffiliated
drama organization.
Support Of Group
The consistent success of
Freshman Drama has sparked
plans for a similar group next
year, with an allotment of $1000
toward production costs from
the English Department. This
year the group is supporting
itself, except for $200 from the
fund that also sponsors Fresh
man Voices magazine and the
Freshman Seminar program.
They raised most of their money
at a dance held several months
ago in the Experiment building.
Props and costumes are either
made by the members or bor
rowed from the Stanford Rep
ertory Theater, which gives the
group considerable help in this
area. Plays are held in the Bran
ner dining hall because of the
lack of suitable university fa
cilities for small drama groups.
Despite these drawbacks, the
members of the group prefer to
continue as a completely inde
pendent organization. Their suc
cess proves that an entirely stu
dent-run group is able to sur
vive at Stanford.
The Freshman Drama Group's
spring production, The Knight
of the Burning Pestle, will be
presented next Sunday and
Monday nights, May 28 and 29,
at 8 p.m. in the Branner dining
room. Admission is free.
The Knight of the Burning
Pestle is a bawdy, satiric come
dy written in 1607 by Beaumont
and Fletcher. It is considered
Jacobean drama. Hazelton Spen
cer of Johns Hopkins Univer
sity calls it,"The earliest first
rate burlesque piece of the En
glish stage; unequaled in its
kind until our own time." Knight
parodies English plays of the
period, chivalry, the nobility, the
common people, and Don Qui
xote, which was published a few
years earlier. It concerns a
grocer and his wife who attend
a play called The London Mer
chant, become disgusted with
the play and the actors, and

insist that their apprentice
Ralph be allowed to take a
part, with hilariously disastrous
results. Ralph becomes the
Knight of the Burning Pestle
and performs heroic feats, cheer
ed on by the grocer and his
wife.
During intermission Paul
Hertzog will present a musical
program featuring recorders
and other instruments of the
period. He will play medieval
music and several specially-ar
ranged modern songs.
Sort Of Wild
"We picked this play," said
Ken King, president of the
group, "because it is funny and
requires a fairly large cast.
We're keeping it light; the play
has deeper levels of satire, but
we're not emphasizing that. We
do best with things that are
sort of wild — we don't have
the background as people or
actors, to do a really serious or
tragic play."

Freshman Drama grew out of
a project conceived by Voice
Project Instructor Mark Mirsky
for his freshman seminar. Mir
sky wanted each of the eight
seminar members to direct a
play, and suggested that they
form a drama group for this
purpose. There are now about
twenty students in the group,
which is entirely independent
of faculty or university support.
Previous Work
Fall quarter Freshman Drama
presented two medieval miracle
plays, sponsored jointly by the
English Department and the
Dean of the Chapel's office.
These were the first plays ever
staged in Memorial Church. As
a result of these plays, the group
was mentioned in Time maga
zine's November 28 issue. They
went on to produce an original
short film and six plays during
winter quarter: Under Milk
Wood by Dylan Thomas, This
Property is Condemned by Ten
nessee Williams, The Lesson by
lonesco, Riders to the Sea by
J. M. Synge, The Death of the

rowed from the Stanford Rep
ertory Theater, which gives the
group considerable help in this
area. Plays are held in the Bran
ner dining hall because of the
lack of suitable university fa
cilities for small drama groups.
Despite these drawbacks, the
members of the group prefer to
continue as a completely inde
pendent organization. Their suc
cess proves that an entirely stu
dent-run group is able to sur
vive at Stanford.
The Freshman Drama Group's
spring production, The Knight
of the Burning Pestle, will be
presented next Sunday and
Monday nights, May 28 and 29,
at 8 p.m. in the Branner dining
room. Admission is free.
The Knight of the Burning
Pestle is a bawdy, satiric come
dy written in 1607 by Beaumont
and Fletcher. It is considered
Jacobean drama. Hazelton Spen
cer of Johns Hopkins Univer
sity calls it,"The earliest first
rate burlesque piece of the En
glish stage; unequaled in its
kind until our own time." Knight
parodies English plays of the
period, chivalry, the nobility, the
common people, and Don Qui
xote, which was published a few
years earlier. It concerns a
grocer and his wife who attend
a play called The London Mer
chant, become disgusted with
the play and the actors, and

insist that their apprentice
Ralph be allowed to take a
part, with hilariously disastrous
results. Ralph becomes the
Knight of the Burning Pestle
and performs heroic feats, cheer
ed on by the grocer and his
wife.
During intermission Paul
Hertzog will present a musical
program featuring recorders
and other instruments of the
period. He will play medieval
music and several specially-ar
ranged modern songs.
Sort Of Wild
"We picked this play," said
Ken King, president of the
group, "because it is funny and
requires a fairly large cast.
We're keeping it light; the play
has deeper levels of satire, but
we're not emphasizing that. We
do best with things that are
sort of wild — we don't have
the background as people or
actors, to do a really serious or
tragic play."

Freshman Drama grew out of
a project conceived by Voice
Project Instructor Mark Mirsky
for his freshman seminar. Mir
sky wanted each of the eight
seminar members to direct a
play, and suggested that they
form a drama group for this
purpose. There are now about
twenty students in the group,
which is entirely independent
of faculty or university support.
Previous Work
Fall quarter Freshman Drama
presented two medieval miracle
plays, sponsored jointly by the
English Department and the
Dean of the Chapel's office.
These were the first plays ever
staged in Memorial Church. As
a result of these plays, the group
was mentioned in Time maga
zine's November 28 issue. They
went on to produce an original
short film and six plays during
winter quarter: Under Milk
Wood by Dylan Thomas, This
Property is Condemned by Ten
nessee Williams, The Lesson by
lonesco, Riders to the Sea by
J. M. Synge, The Death of the
Hired Man by .Robert Frost, and
their much-acclaimed produc
tion of T. S. Eliot's The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.
Although the majority of their
audience are freshmen, the fac
ulty response has been highly
enthusiastic. English Professor
Larry Friedlander calls them,
"A fresh and original group; a
surprisingly polished perform
ance." Professor Thomas C.

Moser, head of the English De
partment, says, "Freshman
Drama has succeeded remark
ably well in demonstrating the
enduring vitality and delight
of communal theater; superb
theatrical talent," and Mirsky
characterizes them as "a wild,
zestful group of madcaps; an
evening of student dynamite."
The group is entirely student
run; Mirsky and Friedlander at
tend rehearsals once a week,
but only in a nominal advisory
capacity. "We learn from each
other," says Mark Griffiths, who
directed Prufrock winter quar
ter and is directing Knight of
the Burning Pestle. Criticism
and suggestions are welcomed
from any member of the group.
No formal dramatic training is
involved; the group exists solely
for the pleasure of its members.
Residence Drama
"Our aim is to bring drama
into the residences," says Dilip
Mirchandani. Ken King calls it
"intimate drama," and adds, "At
Harvard each residence has its
own drama group. This is the
type of thing, mainly oriented
towards the freshman dorms."
The group feels it is making
a definite contribution to cam
pus dratma. "We are able to pre
sent a larger variety of perfor
mances than other groups on
campus because we are auto
nomous and are free to experi
ment," comments Mark Grif
fiths. "We're not tied to any
particular type of drama. Our

only probem is that we can't
sing."
Any freshman student may
try out for the group. All who
tried out were given parts, but
as someone noted, "All those
who tried out were extremely
talented." Students receive ac
tivity credit for participating.
The group plans to continue
next year as an unaffiliated
drama organization.
Support Of Group
The consistent success of
Freshman Drama has sparked
plans for a similar group next
year, with an allotment of $1000
toward production costs from
the English Department. This
year the group is supporting
itself, except for $200 from the
fund that also sponsors Fresh
man Voices magazine and the
Freshman Seminar program.
They raised most of their money
at a dance held several months
ago in the Experiment building.
Props and costumes are either
made by the members or bor
rowed from the Stanford Rep
ertory Theater, which gives the
group considerable help in this
area. Plays are held in the Bran
