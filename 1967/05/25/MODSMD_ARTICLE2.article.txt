# Faculty Rally Supports 'Won't Go' Petitioners

### DAN SNELL 
At a noon rally yesterday in White
Plaza sponsored by the Faculty-Staff
Committee for Peace in Vietnam Jay
Nugeboren, lecturer in English told
the 300 students present, "1 am in
effect violating a law. I am urging
you not to serve in the United States
military."
The rally was also addressed by
Julian Ripley, professor of physical
science; David Berlinski, assistant
professor of philosophy; John Mc-
Carthy, professor of computer sci
ence; and Paul Seaver, associate pro
fessor of history. The faculty mem
bers expressed their support of the
approximately 300 Stanford men who
have signed a petition stating that
they will not serve in the military in
Vietnam.
It was announced at the rally that
there were 344 signatures on a wom
en's petition expressing support for
the men. This petition was soon to
be run in a metropolitan newspaper.
U.S. and Nazi Germany
Nugeboren also said that the United
States has done recently more lying
and committed more brutal acts "in
a larger way than anything Germany
did throughout the '30's."
He said the Defense Department
probably would not draft college stu
dents because, in columnist James
Reston's estimate, 25% of all college
men would refuse to go to Vietnam.
In a final reference to German af
fairs during the Nazi period Nuge
boren said that the Nuremburg sta
tute under which war criminals were
tried stated that the fact that orders
come from one's superior does not
eliminate one's responsibility for the
morality of the order's effect. He im
plied that serving in the military in
Vietnam was thus immoral.
Nugeboren also made a plea that
members of the Stanford community
accompany four Stanford men whose
induction physical was to take place
this morning in Oakland.
"We Won't Go" Students
Ripley, the first to speak, said he
was skeptical of arguments on both
sides of the Vietnam question but
said he felt he should speak out in
favor of the action of the "we won't
go" students. "I applaud in my mind

and in my heart the students who
resist the draft... their courage and
their patriotism," he said.
Noting that recently there had been
a "growing desperation in our mili
tary actions, a growing inhumanity
toward the very civilians whose free
dom we are supposedly protecting,"
Ripley said that it was time the United
States find "a more desperate method
of arriving at peace."
Bombing To Save Faee
David Berlinski expressed the opi
nion that nowadays "effective politi
cal action lie outside accepted
political action." He called the draft
"an immoral institution," and said
that refusal to participate in the pro
test against the war implied accept
ance of the government's policy.
The assistant professor admitted
that the protest might have little ef
fect upon the war, but he said, "In
the poverty of this time we dare
do nothing less than make this at
tempt."
McCarthy reviewed some of the
history of the United States involve
ment in Vietnam and pointed out that
bombing seems to have been started
merely as a morale-booster for the
South Vietnamese regime. He labelled
as paranoid what he called "the main
argument for staying in Vietnam,"
that we are in a desperate position in
the world-wide struggle against Com
munism.
A second objection to an immediate
pull-out, according to McCarthy, is
that the United States cannot get out
now without "losing face." He replied
to this argument, "There is no excuse
for killing hundreds of thousands of
people just to have face."
Call For Communal Action
McCarthy urged that students sign
the "we won't go" petition on the
grounds that "Anyone who has the
slightest doubt about the justice of
the war in Vietnam should refuse to
be a killer there."
Seaver, who went to jail in 1950
for refusing to register for the draft,
emphasized the help given him by his
fellow members in the Quaker com
munity at the time. He called for
creation of a "community of con
cern" at Stanford for those who sign
ed the petition and for those who are
drafted against their will.
