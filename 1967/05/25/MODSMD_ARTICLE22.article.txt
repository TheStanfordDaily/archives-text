# Letters To The Editor
## 'Morgenthau—Cold Warrior' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Hans Morgenthau has just
come to our campus and given
his customary lucid criticism of
American policy. His analysis
is careful and controlled; his
composure and wit easily trimph
over the objects of his ques
tioners. His arguments cannot
be countered by moral hysteria,
because, as he says, they are
objective and based on the
United States' objective self-in
terest.
But there is a danger in his
lucidity, because it covers, as
does aimost all lucidity, several
important moral preconceptions.
Because his criticism challenges
the State Department on its
own ground, because he works
within the framework of his
opponents, it will in the long
run be ineffective. Eventually his
Realpolitik defeats itself. For it
is not a tactical move that must
be demanded of the State De
partment. A cessation of bomb
ing and subsequent successful
negotiations would be a wonder
ful thing, to be sure. But if they
were achieved as a tactical ma
neuver, in defense of America's
self-interest, then they would
only be a temporary success, a
temporary deferment of Ameri
ca's role of world policeman.
Instead, the consciousness and
the morality of our policy
makes must be changed. Com
munism must not be seen as a
concept. Other countries must
be judged not on the name of
their political systems, but rath
er on their fulfillment of ab
stract moral principles, such as
justice and liberty. If the occa
sion arises where our self-inter
est conflicts with the fulfillment
of these principles, then our self
interest must be discarded or
re-defined.
Professor Morgenthau says
that we must become a revo
lutionary country in relation to
our Latin American policy. We
must do this, he says, so that
we can replace the communists
as the partial manipulators of
future Latin American govern
ments. I maintain that this kind
of liberalism is incorrect and
immoral, and will lead us down
the path we have just come. We
must become a revolutionary
country in Latin America not
for our own self interest, but
because in many countries one
must be revolutionary if one is
to seriously defend a morality
of justice and liberty. If the
Communists are the party of
justice and liberty, I suggest
that we support them and quit
viewing them as inimical to our
country.
The myths of the Cold War
have permeated the minds of
Ainerica. In order to destroy
these myths we must seek a to
tal conversion. The government,
for example, must seek to dis
associate itself from a tremen
dous military establishment. Our
recognize some basic inconsis
military budget must be reduced
drastically.
The economic philosophy of
this country must recognize
some basic inconsistencies be
tween present economic struc
ture and moral principles. Un
less such drastic changes take
place, America's present imperi
alistic nature cannot be changed.
I think we place too much
trust in reason, without ques

tioning underlying assumptions.
Morgenthau is a Cold Warrior.

It is most important that the
LASSU representative for each
living group attend the Legisla
ture meeting tonight. Under con
sideration is the $112,000 budget
of the A.S.S.U. for next year,
which comes from the $3 each
student pays every quarter.
The leaders for educational
reform will present their ideas
for new activities next fall. In
order to finance those new pro
jects, attempts are being made
to reduce the A.S.S.U. support
of such activities as the Speech
Association, the Institute of In
ternation Relations, the National
Student Association, and the
Big Game Bonfire through the
Cardinals Board. The issue is
whether the University should
support these activities directly,
freeing student money for sup
port of broad educational re
form Priorities and politics will
make for spirited debate, as the
Axe Contmission appropriation
did last week.
Whatever position your living
group takes on this issue, it is
imperative that your voice be
heard at the meeting this week.
Full attendance will insure the
full review of student opinion,
and hopefully, a solution agree
able to all segments of the
student community.

Editor, The Daily:
I was struck by a comment
from one of the leaders of the
East Palo Alto group that re
cently picketed the Medical
School over Upward Bound:
"Most of the things for our de
liverance are in violation of the
... guidelines."
Her feelings are shared by
many concerned citizens of
South-West Pittsburgh (where
I am a VISTA worker) — and
not only about Upward Bound.
This and many other programs
of the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity (OEO) are designed in
Washington, forced on the pop
ulation, smothered by guidelines,
and given to local authorities to
direct — all in the name of
"maximum feasible participa
tion of the poor."
As funds decline and criticism
mounts, OEO is becoming stead
ily more service-oriented and
less concerned with real involve
ment of the poor in our society
(which can only occur when
they have as many material ad
vantages as the rest of us.) The
American public can feel a warm
glow for Head Start centers but
not for welfare rights groups
demanding higher welfare
grants. Consequently we are los
ing the war on poverty.
I don't mean to overly criti
cize the OEO. Really it is too
much to expect of an agency
with such limited powers that
it could actually wipe out pov
erty. In general the OEO's ser
vices have been good; they have
injected into many institutions
a great awareness of the spe
cial problems and needs of low
income people. But since its
services are available only to
low-income people, it has the

stigma of poverty, like the wel
fare system, another notorious
failure.
The OEO's income require
ments divide people along lines
of class — necessarily, since
funds are limited and the poor
need the services most. The divi
sion is unfortunate, however, be
cause when poor do effectively
organize, the changes they ask
for often would benefit other
classes as well: improvements
in education, housing, medical
care, etc. Greater citizen partici
pation in setting and evaluating
policies of local institutions is
needed on all levels, not just
among the poor — although
they are hardest hit by the lack
of it.
I would like to call attention
to a book put out by the A.
Philip Randolph Institute called
A "Freedom Budget" for All
Americans. It outlines a ten
year program for the cirtual eli
mination of poverty from the
U.S. It suggests economic means
to assure full employment; a
higher rate of economic growth;
and decent housing, modern
health services, and full educa
tional opportunity for all. Their
projected budget shows that our
economy has the resources for
this (even if the war continues,
which God forbid) and calls for
a massive commitment to get
it done.
This book is endorsed by a
long list of economists, histor
ians, labor and civil right lead
ers, and others, including I. W.
Abel, Stokely Carmichael, J. K.
Galbraith, Michael Harrington.
Leon Keyserling, Martin Luther
King, Gunnar Myrdal, Walter
Reuther, and C. Van Woodward.
The point is that poverty can
be cured not by piecemeal ser
vices alone but by substantial
across-the-board raises in the in
comes of poor people — in the
form of expanded employment
opportunities, guaranteed decent
incomes for those unable to
work, and subsidies to prevent
economic discrimination in
health and education.

• No Hatred
Editor, The Daily:
The (Associated Press) article
on the Middle East crisis appear
ing in Wednesday's Daily began
with the seriously misleading
statement that "The fierce hatred
between Jews and Arabs in th
Middle East dates back exactly
fifty years."
As Israelis, we have never feit
personally nor seen among our
fellow Israelis any hatred for
the Arabs but, on the contrary,
a deep desire for peaceful coex
istence. The Arabs within Israel
possess full citizen rights equal
to those of the Jewish inhabit
ants, and the general feeling of
the country, repeatedly publi
cized by its government, is the
hope that one day Israel will be
able to offer its advanced tech
nical knowledge in the areas of
medicine, engineering, and water
conservation to help raise the
standard of living in the Arab
countries as it has assisted so
many of the new African states.
Isreal must insist, if necessary
by force, on preserving its terri
torial integrity and use of inter
national waterways. But to con
fuse self-defense with implacable

hatred of the Arabs is a sad case
of journalistic ignorance.

• Mild Statement
Editor, The Daily:
An article in Monday's Daily
quoted me as supporting the
"Selective Objection" petition,
which I do with the strong hope
that people will understand the
mildness of this statement and
realize that signing it is at best
a first step toward the kind of
radical reactions that alone will
affect the course of the war. I
fear that many will consider it
a satisfactory device for opening
debate or for registering dissent,
when in fact it may very easily
be misconstrued and ignored,
serving little purpose but demon
strating the impotence of "lib
eral democratic" forms of pro
test in the face of impending
war with North Vietnam and
China.
As well, it could happen that
such a petition will be a release
valve, draining off the frustra
tions and realizations about the
dire predicament of a student
now, that can best lead to more
effective and imaginative forms
of protest. However, I assume
that most signers will see this
minimal step as the first in their
summer of increasingly pointed
and vociferous stands against an
escalating atrocity.
More importantly, I wish to
say that the paraphrase of Mar
tin Luther King's remarks at
tributed to me, was not mine.
It is a factual error and a dis
tortion of Dr. King's remarks re
ported to Miss Anderson (the
reporter) by a person standing
nearby. To my knowledge, Dr.
King approves this position as an
acceptable step, but does not
consider it or "serving overseas
as a conscientious objector 'the
most important political move'
that a person could presently
take." I refer persons interested
in his position on the war and
political action opposed to it to
his remarks at Riverside which
are reprinted in Ramparts.

PAUL RUPERT

Editor, The Daily:
Hans Morgenthau has just
come to our campus and given
his customary lucid criticism of
American policy. His analysis
is careful and controlled; his
composure and wit easily trimph
over the objects of his ques
tioners. His arguments cannot
be countered by moral hysteria,
because, as he says, they are
objective and based on the
United States' objective self-in
terest.
But there is a danger in his
lucidity, because it covers, as
does aimost all lucidity, several
important moral preconceptions.
Because his criticism challenges
the State Department on its
own ground, because he works
within the framework of his
opponents, it will in the long
run be ineffective. Eventually his
Realpolitik defeats itself. For it
is not a tactical move that must
be demanded of the State De
partment. A cessation of bomb
ing and subsequent successful
negotiations would be a wonder
ful thing, to be sure. But if they
were achieved as a tactical ma
neuver, in defense of America's
self-interest, then they would
only be a temporary success, a
temporary deferment of Ameri
ca's role of world policeman.
Instead, the consciousness and
the morality of our policy
makes must be changed. Com
munism must not be seen as a
concept. Other countries must
be judged not on the name of
their political systems, but rath
er on their fulfillment of ab
stract moral principles, such as
justice and liberty. If the occa
sion arises where our self-inter
est conflicts with the fulfillment
of these principles, then our self
interest must be discarded or
re-defined.
Professor Morgenthau says
that we must become a revo
lutionary country in relation to
our Latin American policy. We
must do this, he says, so that
we can replace the communists
as the partial manipulators of
future Latin American govern
ments. I maintain that this kind
of liberalism is incorrect and
immoral, and will lead us down
the path we have just come. We
must become a revolutionary
country in Latin America not
for our own self interest, but
because in many countries one
must be revolutionary if one is
to seriously defend a morality
of justice and liberty. If the
Communists are the party of
justice and liberty, I suggest
that we support them and quit
viewing them as inimical to our
country.
The myths of the Cold War
have permeated the minds of
Ainerica. In order to destroy
these myths we must seek a to
tal conversion. The government,
for example, must seek to dis
associate itself from a tremen
dous military establishment. Our
recognize some basic inconsis
military budget must be reduced
drastically.
The economic philosophy of
this country must recognize
some basic inconsistencies be
tween present economic struc
ture and moral principles. Un
less such drastic changes take
place, America's present imperi
alistic nature cannot be changed.
I think we place too much
trust in reason, without ques

tioning underlying assumptions.
Morgenthau is a Cold Warrior.

It is most important that the

ture meeting tonight. Under con

of the A.S.S.U. for next year,
which comes from the $3 each
student pays every quarter.
The leaders for educational
reform will present their ideas
for new activities next fall. In
order to finance those new pro

to reduce the A.S.S.U. support
of such activities as the Speech
Association, the Institute of In

Big Game Bonfire through the
Cardinals Board. The issue is
whether the University should
support these activities directly,
freeing student money for sup
port of broad educational re
form Priorities and politics will
make for spirited debate, as the
Axe Contmission appropriation
did last week.
Whatever position your living
group takes on this issue, it is

I was struck by a comment
from one of the leaders of the
East Palo Alto group that re
cently picketed the Medical
School over Upward Bound:
"Most of the things for our de
liverance are in violation of the
... guidelines."
Her feelings are shared by
many concerned citizens of
South-West Pittsburgh (where
I am a VISTA worker) — and
not only about Upward Bound.
This and many other programs
of the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity (OEO) are designed in
Washington, forced on the pop
ulation, smothered by guidelines,
and given to local authorities to
direct — all in the name of
"maximum feasible participa
tion of the poor."
As funds decline and criticism
mounts, OEO is becoming stead
ily more service-oriented and
less concerned with real involve
ment of the poor in our society
(which can only occur when
they have as many material ad
vantages as the rest of us.) The
American public can feel a warm
glow for Head Start centers but
not for welfare rights groups
demanding higher welfare
grants. Consequently we are los
ing the war on poverty.
I don't mean to overly criti
cize the OEO. Really it is too
much to expect of an agency
with such limited powers that
it could actually wipe out pov
erty. In general the OEO's ser
vices have been good; they have
injected into many institutions
a great awareness of the spe
cial problems and needs of low
income people. But since its
services are available only to
low-income people, it has the

stigma of poverty, like the wel
fare system, another notorious
failure.
The OEO's income require
ments divide people along lines
of class — necessarily, since
funds are limited and the poor
need the services most. The divi
sion is unfortunate, however, be
cause when poor do effectively
organize, the changes they ask
for often would benefit other
classes as well: improvements
in education, housing, medical
care, etc. Greater citizen partici
pation in setting and evaluating
policies of local institutions is
needed on all levels, not just
among the poor — although
they are hardest hit by the lack
of it.
I would like to call attention
to a book put out by the A.
Philip Randolph Institute called
A "Freedom Budget" for All
Americans. It outlines a ten
year program for the cirtual eli
mination of poverty from the
U.S. It suggests economic means
to assure full employment; a
higher rate of economic growth;
and decent housing, modern
health services, and full educa
tional opportunity for all. Their
projected budget shows that our
economy has the resources for
this (even if the war continues,
which God forbid) and calls for
a massive commitment to get
it done.
This book is endorsed by a
long list of economists, histor
ians, labor and civil right lead
ers, and others, including I. W.
Abel, Stokely Carmichael, J. K.
Galbraith, Michael Harrington.
Leon Keyserling, Martin Luther
King, Gunnar Myrdal, Walter
Reuther, and C. Van Woodward.
The point is that poverty can
be cured not by piecemeal ser
vices alone but by substantial
across-the-board raises in the in
comes of poor people — in the
form of expanded employment
opportunities, guaranteed decent
incomes for those unable to
work, and subsidies to prevent
economic discrimination in
health and education.

The (Associated Press) article
on the Middle East crisis appear

with the seriously misleading
statement that "The fierce hatred

As Israelis, we have never feit

the Arabs but, on the contrary,
a deep desire for peaceful coex
istence. The Arabs within Israel
possess full citizen rights equal
to those of the Jewish inhabit

the country, repeatedly publi

hope that one day Israel will be
able to offer its advanced tech
nical knowledge in the areas of
medicine, engineering, and water
conservation to help raise the
standard of living in the Arab
countries as it has assisted so
many of the new African states.
Isreal must insist, if necessary
by force, on preserving its terri

hatred of the Arabs is a sad case

Editor, The Daily:
An article in Monday's Daily
quoted me as supporting the
"Selective Objection" petition,
which I do with the strong hope
that people will understand the
mildness of this statement and
realize that signing it is at best
a first step toward the kind of
radical reactions that alone will
affect the course of the war. I
fear that many will consider it
a satisfactory device for opening
debate or for registering dissent,
when in fact it may very easily
be misconstrued and ignored,
serving little purpose but demon
strating the impotence of "lib
eral democratic" forms of pro
test in the face of impending
war with North Vietnam and
China.
As well, it could happen that
such a petition will be a release
valve, draining off the frustra
tions and realizations about the
dire predicament of a student
now, that can best lead to more
effective and imaginative forms
of protest. However, I assume
that most signers will see this
minimal step as the first in their
summer of increasingly pointed
and vociferous stands against an
escalating atrocity.
More importantly, I wish to
say that the paraphrase of Mar
tin Luther King's remarks at
tributed to me, was not mine.
It is a factual error and a dis
tortion of Dr. King's remarks re
ported to Miss Anderson (the
reporter) by a person standing
nearby. To my knowledge, Dr.
King approves this position as an
acceptable step, but does not
consider it or "serving overseas
as a conscientious objector 'the
most important political move'
that a person could presently
take." I refer persons interested
in his position on the war and
political action opposed to it to
his remarks at Riverside which
are reprinted in Ramparts.
PAUL RUPERT

Editor, The Daily:
Hans Morgenthau has just
come to our campus and given
his customary lucid criticism of
American policy. His analysis
is careful and controlled; his
composure and wit easily trimph
over the objects of his ques
tioners. His arguments cannot
be countered by moral hysteria,
because, as he says, they are
objective and based on the
United States' objective self-in
terest.
But there is a danger in his
lucidity, because it covers, as
does aimost all lucidity, several
important moral preconceptions.
Because his criticism challenges
the State Department on its
own ground, because he works
within the framework of his
opponents, it will in the long
run be ineffective. Eventually his
Realpolitik defeats itself. For it
is not a tactical move that must
be demanded of the State De
partment. A cessation of bomb
ing and subsequent successful
negotiations would be a wonder
ful thing, to be sure. But if they
were achieved as a tactical ma
neuver, in defense of America's
self-interest, then they would
only be a temporary success, a
temporary deferment of Ameri
ca's role of world policeman.
Instead, the consciousness and
the morality of our policy
makes must be changed. Com
munism must not be seen as a
concept. Other countries must
be judged not on the name of
their political systems, but rath
er on their fulfillment of ab
stract moral principles, such as
justice and liberty. If the occa
sion arises where our self-inter
est conflicts with the fulfillment
of these principles, then our self
interest must be discarded or
re-defined.
Professor Morgenthau says
that we must become a revo
lutionary country in relation to
our Latin American policy. We
must do this, he says, so that
we can replace the communists
as the partial manipulators of
future Latin American govern
ments. I maintain that this kind
of liberalism is incorrect and
immoral, and will lead us down
the path we have just come. We
must become a revolutionary
country in Latin America not
for our own self interest, but
because in many countries one
must be revolutionary if one is
to seriously defend a morality
of justice and liberty. If the
Communists are the party of
justice and liberty, I suggest
that we support them and quit
viewing them as inimical to our
country.
The myths of the Cold War
have permeated the minds of
Ainerica. In order to destroy
these myths we must seek a to
tal conversion. The government,
for example, must seek to dis
associate itself from a tremen
dous military establishment. Our
recognize some basic inconsis
military budget must be reduced
drastically.
The economic philosophy of
this country must recognize
some basic inconsistencies be
tween present economic struc
ture and moral principles. Un
less such drastic changes take
place, America's present imperi
alistic nature cannot be changed.
I think we place too much
trust in reason, without ques

tioning underlying assumptions.

It is most important that the
LASSU representative for each
living group attend the Legisla
ture meeting tonight. Under con
sideration is the $112,000 budget
of the A.S.S.U. for next year,
which comes from the $3 each
student pays every quarter.
The leaders for educational
reform will present their ideas
for new activities next fall. In
order to finance those new pro

to reduce the A.S.S.U. support
of such activities as the Speech
Association, the Institute of In

Student Association, and the
Big Game Bonfire through the
Cardinals Board. The issue is
whether the University should
support these activities directly,
freeing student money for sup
port of broad educational re
form Priorities and politics will
make for spirited debate, as the
Axe Contmission appropriation
did last week.
Whatever position your living

Editor, The Daily:
I was struck by a comment
from one of the leaders of the
East Palo Alto group that re
cently picketed the Medical
School over Upward Bound:
"Most of the things for our de
liverance are in violation of the
... guidelines."
Her feelings are shared by
many concerned citizens of
South-West Pittsburgh (where
I am a VISTA worker) — and
not only about Upward Bound.
This and many other programs
of the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity (OEO) are designed in
Washington, forced on the pop
ulation, smothered by guidelines,
and given to local authorities to
direct — all in the name of
"maximum feasible participa
tion of the poor."
As funds decline and criticism
mounts, OEO is becoming stead
ily more service-oriented and
less concerned with real involve
ment of the poor in our society
(which can only occur when
they have as many material ad
vantages as the rest of us.) The
American public can feel a warm
glow for Head Start centers but
not for welfare rights groups
demanding higher welfare
grants. Consequently we are los
ing the war on poverty.
I don't mean to overly criti
cize the OEO. Really it is too
much to expect of an agency
with such limited powers that
it could actually wipe out pov
erty. In general the OEO's ser
vices have been good; they have
injected into many institutions
a great awareness of the spe
cial problems and needs of low
income people. But since its
services are available only to
low-income people, it has the

stigma of poverty, like the wel
fare system, another notorious
failure.
The OEO's income require
ments divide people along lines
of class — necessarily, since
funds are limited and the poor
need the services most. The divi
sion is unfortunate, however, be
cause when poor do effectively
organize, the changes they ask
for often would benefit other
classes as well: improvements
in education, housing, medical
care, etc. Greater citizen partici
pation in setting and evaluating
policies of local institutions is
needed on all levels, not just
among the poor — although
they are hardest hit by the lack
of it.
I would like to call attention
to a book put out by the A.
Philip Randolph Institute called
A "Freedom Budget" for All
Americans. It outlines a ten
year program for the cirtual eli
mination of poverty from the
U.S. It suggests economic means
to assure full employment; a
higher rate of economic growth;
and decent housing, modern
health services, and full educa
tional opportunity for all. Their
projected budget shows that our
economy has the resources for
this (even if the war continues,
which God forbid) and calls for
a massive commitment to get
it done.
This book is endorsed by a
long list of economists, histor
ians, labor and civil right lead
ers, and others, including I. W.
Abel, Stokely Carmichael, J. K.
Galbraith, Michael Harrington.
Leon Keyserling, Martin Luther
King, Gunnar Myrdal, Walter
Reuther, and C. Van Woodward.
The point is that poverty can
be cured not by piecemeal ser
vices alone but by substantial
across-the-board raises in the in
comes of poor people — in the
form of expanded employment
opportunities, guaranteed decent
incomes for those unable to
work, and subsidies to prevent
economic discrimination in
health and education.

The (Associated Press) article

As Israelis, we have never feit

a deep desire for peaceful coex

possess full citizen rights equal

The (Associated Press) article
on the Middle East crisis appear
ing in Wednesday's Daily began
with the seriously misleading
statement that "The fierce hatred
between Jews and Arabs in th
Middle East dates back exactly
fifty years."
As Israelis, we have never feit
personally nor seen among our
fellow Israelis any hatred for
the Arabs but, on the contrary,
a deep desire for peaceful coex
istence. The Arabs within Israel
possess full citizen rights equal
to those of the Jewish inhabit
ants, and the general feeling of
the country, repeatedly publi
cized by its government, is the
hope that one day Israel will be
able to offer its advanced tech
nical knowledge in the areas of
medicine, engineering, and water
conservation to help raise the
standard of living in the Arab
countries as it has assisted so
many of the new African states.
Isreal must insist, if necessary
by force, on preserving its terri

hatred of the Arabs is a sad case

• Mild Statement
Editor, The Daily:
An article in Monday's Daily
quoted me as supporting the
"Selective Objection" petition,
which I do with the strong hope
that people will understand the
mildness of this statement and
realize that signing it is at best
a first step toward the kind of
radical reactions that alone will
affect the course of the war. I
fear that many will consider it
a satisfactory device for opening
debate or for registering dissent,
when in fact it may very easily
be misconstrued and ignored,
serving little purpose but demon
strating the impotence of "lib
eral democratic" forms of pro
test in the face of impending
war with North Vietnam and
China.
As well, it could happen that
such a petition will be a release
valve, draining off the frustra
tions and realizations about the
dire predicament of a student
now, that can best lead to more
effective and imaginative forms
of protest. However, I assume
that most signers will see this
minimal step as the first in their
summer of increasingly pointed
and vociferous stands against an
escalating atrocity.
More importantly, I wish to
say that the paraphrase of Mar
tin Luther King's remarks at
tributed to me, was not mine.
It is a factual error and a dis
tortion of Dr. King's remarks re
ported to Miss Anderson (the
reporter) by a person standing
nearby. To my knowledge, Dr.
King approves this position as an
acceptable step, but does not
consider it or "serving overseas
as a conscientious objector 'the
most important political move'
that a person could presently
take." I refer persons interested
in his position on the war and
political action opposed to it to
his remarks at Riverside which
are reprinted in Ramparts.
PAUL RUPERT
Senior, History
Editor, The Daily:
Hans Morgenthau has just
come to our campus and given
his customary lucid criticism of
American policy. His analysis
is careful and controlled; his
composure and wit easily trimph
over the objects of his ques
tioners. His arguments cannot
be countered by moral hysteria,
because, as he says, they are
objective and based on the
United States' objective self-in
terest.
But there is a danger in his
lucidity, because it covers, as
does aimost all lucidity, several
important moral preconceptions.
Because his criticism challenges
the State Department on its
own ground, because he works
within the framework of his
opponents, it will in the long
run be ineffective. Eventually his
Realpolitik defeats itself. For it
is not a tactical move that must
be demanded of the State De
partment. A cessation of bomb
ing and subsequent successful
negotiations would be a wonder
ful thing, to be sure. But if they
were achieved as a tactical ma
neuver, in defense of America's
self-interest, then they would
only be a temporary success, a
temporary deferment of Ameri
ca's role of world policeman.
Instead, the consciousness and
the morality of our policy
makes must be changed. Com
munism must not be seen as a
concept. Other countries must
be judged not on the name of
their political systems, but rath
er on their fulfillment of ab
stract moral principles, such as
justice and liberty. If the occa
sion arises where our self-inter
est conflicts with the fulfillment
of these principles, then our self
interest must be discarded or
re-defined.
Professor Morgenthau says
that we must become a revo
lutionary country in relation to
our Latin American policy. We
must do this, he says, so that
we can replace the communists
as the partial manipulators of
future Latin American govern
ments. I maintain that this kind
of liberalism is incorrect and
immoral, and will lead us down
the path we have just come. We
must become a revolutionary
country in Latin America not
for our own self interest, but
because in many countries one
must be revolutionary if one is
to seriously defend a morality
of justice and liberty. If the
Communists are the party of
justice and liberty, I suggest
that we support them and quit
viewing them as inimical to our
country.
The myths of the Cold War
have permeated the minds of
Ainerica. In order to destroy
these myths we must seek a to
tal conversion. The government,
for example, must seek to dis
associate itself from a tremen
dous military establishment. Our
recognize some basic inconsis
military budget must be reduced
drastically.
The economic philosophy of
this country must recognize
some basic inconsistencies be
tween present economic struc
ture and moral principles. Un
less such drastic changes take
place, America's present imperi
alistic nature cannot be changed.
I think we place too much
trust in reason, without ques

tioning underlying assumptions.
Morgenthau is a Cold Warrior.

It is most important that the
LASSU representative for each
living group attend the Legisla
ture meeting tonight. Under con
sideration is the $112,000 budget
of the A.S.S.U. for next year,
which comes from the $3 each
student pays every quarter.
The leaders for educational
reform will present their ideas
for new activities next fall. In
order to finance those new pro

to reduce the A.S.S.U. support
of such activities as the Speech
Association, the Institute of In

Student Association, and the
Big Game Bonfire through the
Cardinals Board. The issue is
whether the University should
support these activities directly,
freeing student money for sup
port of broad educational re
form Priorities and politics will
make for spirited debate, as the
Axe Contmission appropriation
did last week.
Whatever position your living

I was struck by a comment
from one of the leaders of the
East Palo Alto group that re
cently picketed the Medical
School over Upward Bound:
"Most of the things for our de
liverance are in violation of the
... guidelines."
Her feelings are shared by
many concerned citizens of
South-West Pittsburgh (where
I am a VISTA worker) — and
not only about Upward Bound.
This and many other programs
of the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity (OEO) are designed in
Washington, forced on the pop
ulation, smothered by guidelines,
and given to local authorities to
direct — all in the name of
"maximum feasible participa
tion of the poor."
As funds decline and criticism
mounts, OEO is becoming stead
ily more service-oriented and
less concerned with real involve
ment of the poor in our society
(which can only occur when
they have as many material ad
vantages as the rest of us.) The
American public can feel a warm
glow for Head Start centers but
not for welfare rights groups
demanding higher welfare
grants. Consequently we are los
ing the war on poverty.
I don't mean to overly criti
cize the OEO. Really it is too
much to expect of an agency
with such limited powers that
it could actually wipe out pov
erty. In general the OEO's ser
vices have been good; they have
injected into many institutions
a great awareness of the spe
cial problems and needs of low
income people. But since its
services are available only to
low-income people, it has the

stigma of poverty, like the wel
fare system, another notorious
failure.
The OEO's income require
ments divide people along lines
of class — necessarily, since
funds are limited and the poor
need the services most. The divi
sion is unfortunate, however, be
cause when poor do effectively
organize, the changes they ask
for often would benefit other
classes as well: improvements
in education, housing, medical
care, etc. Greater citizen partici
pation in setting and evaluating
policies of local institutions is
needed on all levels, not just
among the poor — although
they are hardest hit by the lack
of it.
I would like to call attention
to a book put out by the A.
Philip Randolph Institute called
A "Freedom Budget" for All
Americans. It outlines a ten
year program for the cirtual eli
mination of poverty from the
U.S. It suggests economic means
to assure full employment; a
higher rate of economic growth;
and decent housing, modern
health services, and full educa
tional opportunity for all. Their
projected budget shows that our
economy has the resources for
this (even if the war continues,
which God forbid) and calls for
a massive commitment to get
it done.
This book is endorsed by a
long list of economists, histor
ians, labor and civil right lead
ers, and others, including I. W.
Abel, Stokely Carmichael, J. K.
Galbraith, Michael Harrington.
Leon Keyserling, Martin Luther

for often would benefit other
classes as well: improvements
in education, housing, medical
care, etc. Greater citizen partici
pation in setting and evaluating
policies of local institutions is
needed on all levels, not just
among the poor — although
they are hardest hit by the lack
of it.
I would like to call attention
to a book put out by the A.
Philip Randolph Institute called
A "Freedom Budget" for All
Americans. It outlines a ten
year program for the cirtual eli
mination of poverty from the
U.S. It suggests economic means
to assure full employment; a
higher rate of economic growth;
and decent housing, modern
health services, and full educa
tional opportunity for all. Their
projected budget shows that our
economy has the resources for
this (even if the war continues,
which God forbid) and calls for
a massive commitment to get
it done.
This book is endorsed by a
long list of economists, histor
ians, labor and civil right lead
ers, and others, including I. W.
Abel, Stokely Carmichael, J. K.
Galbraith, Michael Harrington.
Leon Keyserling, Martin Luther
King, Gunnar Myrdal, Walter
Reuther, and C. Van Woodward.
The point is that poverty can
be cured not by piecemeal ser
vices alone but by substantial
across-the-board raises in the in
comes of poor people — in the
form of expanded employment
opportunities, guaranteed decent
incomes for those unable to
work, and subsidies to prevent
economic discrimination in
health and education.

Editor, The Daily:
The (Associated Press) article
on the Middle East crisis appear
ing in Wednesday's Daily began
with the seriously misleading
statement that "The fierce hatred
between Jews and Arabs in th
Middle East dates back exactly
fifty years."
As Israelis, we have never feit
personally nor seen among our
fellow Israelis any hatred for
the Arabs but, on the contrary,
a deep desire for peaceful coex
istence. The Arabs within Israel
possess full citizen rights equal
to those of the Jewish inhabit
ants, and the general feeling of
the country, repeatedly publi
cized by its government, is the
hope that one day Israel will be
able to offer its advanced tech
nical knowledge in the areas of
medicine, engineering, and water
conservation to help raise the
standard of living in the Arab
countries as it has assisted so
many of the new African states.
Isreal must insist, if necessary
by force, on preserving its terri
torial integrity and use of inter
national waterways. But to con
fuse self-defense with implacable

hatred of the Arabs is a sad case
of journalistic ignorance.

• Mild Statement
Editor, The Daily:
An article in Monday's Daily
quoted me as supporting the
"Selective Objection" petition,
which I do with the strong hope
that people will understand the
mildness of this statement and
realize that signing it is at best
a first step toward the kind of
radical reactions that alone will
affect the course of the war. I
fear that many will consider it
a satisfactory device for opening
debate or for registering dissent,
when in fact it may very easily
be misconstrued and ignored,
serving little purpose but demon
strating the impotence of "lib
eral democratic" forms of pro
test in the face of impending
war with North Vietnam and
China.
As well, it could happen that
such a petition will be a release
valve, draining off the frustra
tions and realizations about the
dire predicament of a student
now, that can best lead to more
effective and imaginative forms
of protest. However, I assume
that most signers will see this
minimal step as the first in their
summer of increasingly pointed
and vociferous stands against an
escalating atrocity.
More importantly, I wish to
say that the paraphrase of Mar
tin Luther King's remarks at
tributed to me, was not mine.
It is a factual error and a dis
tortion of Dr. King's remarks re
ported to Miss Anderson (the
reporter) by a person standing
nearby. To my knowledge, Dr.
King approves this position as an
acceptable step, but does not
consider it or "serving overseas
as a conscientious objector 'the
most important political move'
that a person could presently
take." I refer persons interested
in his position on the war and
political action opposed to it to
his remarks at Riverside which
are reprinted in Ramparts.
PAUL RUPERT
Senior, History
Editor, The Daily:
Hans Morgenthau has just
come to our campus and given
his customary lucid criticism of
American policy. His analysis
is careful and controlled; his
composure and wit easily trimph
over the objects of his ques
tioners. His arguments cannot
be countered by moral hysteria,
because, as he says, they are
objective and based on the
United States' objective self-in
terest.
But there is a danger in his
lucidity, because it covers, as
does aimost all lucidity, several
important moral preconceptions.
Because his criticism challenges
the State Department on its
own ground, because he works
within the framework of his
opponents, it will in the long
run be ineffective. Eventually his
Realpolitik defeats itself. For it
is not a tactical move that must
be demanded of the State De
partment. A cessation of bomb
ing and subsequent successful
negotiations would be a wonder
ful thing, to be sure. But if they
were achieved as a tactical ma
neuver, in defense of America's
self-interest, then they would
only be a temporary success, a
temporary deferment of Ameri
ca's role of world policeman.
Instead, the consciousness and
the morality of our policy
makes must be changed. Com
munism must not be seen as a
concept. Other countries must
be judged not on the name of
their political systems, but rath
er on their fulfillment of ab
stract moral principles, such as
justice and liberty. If the occa
sion arises where our self-inter
est conflicts with the fulfillment
of these principles, then our self
interest must be discarded or
re-defined.
Professor Morgenthau says
that we must become a revo
lutionary country in relation to
our Latin American policy. We
must do this, he says, so that
we can replace the communists
as the partial manipulators of
future Latin American govern
ments. I maintain that this kind
of liberalism is incorrect and
immoral, and will lead us down
the path we have just come. We
must become a revolutionary
country in Latin America not
for our own self interest, but
because in many countries one
must be revolutionary if one is
to seriously defend a morality
of justice and liberty. If the
Communists are the party of
justice and liberty, I suggest
that we support them and quit
viewing them as inimical to our
country.
The myths of the Cold War
have permeated the minds of
Ainerica. In order to destroy
these myths we must seek a to
tal conversion. The government,
for example, must seek to dis
associate itself from a tremen
dous military establishment. Our
recognize some basic inconsis
military budget must be reduced
drastically.
The economic philosophy of
this country must recognize
some basic inconsistencies be
tween present economic struc
ture and moral principles. Un
less such drastic changes take
place, America's present imperi
alistic nature cannot be changed.
I think we place too much
trust in reason, without ques

tioning underlying assumptions.
Morgenthau is a Cold Warrior.

It is most important that the
LASSU representative for each
living group attend the Legisla
ture meeting tonight. Under con
sideration is the $112,000 budget
of the A.S.S.U. for next year,
which comes from the $3 each
student pays every quarter.
The leaders for educational
reform will present their ideas
for new activities next fall. In
order to finance those new pro
jects, attempts are being made
to reduce the A.S.S.U. support
of such activities as the Speech
Association, the Institute of In
ternation Relations, the National
Student Association, and the
Big Game Bonfire through the
Cardinals Board. The issue is
whether the University should
support these activities directly,
freeing student money for sup
port of broad educational re
form Priorities and politics will
make for spirited debate, as the
Axe Contmission appropriation
did last week.
Whatever position your living
group takes on this issue, it is
imperative that your voice be
heard at the meeting this week.
Full attendance will insure the
full review of student opinion,
and hopefully, a solution agree
able to all segments of the
student community.

I was struck by a comment
from one of the leaders of the
East Palo Alto group that re
cently picketed the Medical
School over Upward Bound:
"Most of the things for our de
liverance are in violation of the
... guidelines."
Her feelings are shared by
many concerned citizens of
South-West Pittsburgh (where
I am a VISTA worker) — and
not only about Upward Bound.
This and many other programs
of the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity (OEO) are designed in
Washington, forced on the pop
ulation, smothered by guidelines,
and given to local authorities to
direct — all in the name of
"maximum feasible participa
tion of the poor."
As funds decline and criticism
mounts, OEO is becoming stead
ily more service-oriented and
less concerned with real involve
ment of the poor in our society
(which can only occur when
they have as many material ad
vantages as the rest of us.) The
American public can feel a warm
glow for Head Start centers but
not for welfare rights groups
demanding higher welfare
grants. Consequently we are los
ing the war on poverty.
I don't mean to overly criti
cize the OEO. Really it is too
much to expect of an agency
with such limited powers that
it could actually wipe out pov
erty. In general the OEO's ser
vices have been good; they have
injected into many institutions
a great awareness of the spe
cial problems and needs of low
income people. But since its
services are available only to
low-income people, it has the

stigma of poverty, like the wel
fare system, another notorious
failure.
The OEO's income require
ments divide people along lines
of class — necessarily, since
funds are limited and the poor
need the services most. The divi
sion is unfortunate, however, be
cause when poor do effectively
organize, the changes they ask
for often would benefit other
classes as well: improvements
