## Community Government-Ideas Or Constituencies? 
### Maggie McComas 
The right to academic freedom
is no longer being questioned.
But what is largely being ig
nored is the responsibility which
that freedom carries with it
and the lack of conviction that
open debate and discussion is
a right which can sustain itself
only with frequent exercise and
interpretation.
Scare tactics by office-holders

and elements of the Establish
ment whose values may be
threatened by the kind of dis
cussion which has barely begun
in this community can to some
degree pose a threat to the
freedom which is inherent in
the academic community. The
most recent example is the Cali
fornia State Senate bill which
would prohibit the advocacy of
communism on any state cam
pus.
The most obvious challenge
to this limitation of rights is
met by the sponsors of the bill
with the argument that it is not
a violation of academic freedom
since it would restrict only out
side speakers, not faculty mem
bers.
Self-Sustaining
Naturally the assumption that
the world of academics is self
sustaining and that the kind of
stimulation which the classroom
grind so badly needs will always
come from within the restricted
community is a weakly-based
one. And such periodic threats
as this type of legislation quite
often stimulate the academic
community itself to face a com
prehensive re-evaluation of goals
and values.
Yet the real threat to freedom
lies not in such extreme ex
amples but on a much subtler
level where such freedom de
pends less upon legalities for the
definition of the rights of speech
than upon the assumption of
responsibility which is implied
within those rights.
Too often the obligation to a
fragmented constituency pre
vents the free flow of ideas and
dialogue rather than providing
a varied range of views and a
broad base of support for deci
sions. Thus the rationale for
the method of selection of stu
dent "representatives" on com
mittees earlier this year.
Fragmented Constituency
The ideal of a community of
scholars is in one sense an at
tempt to eliminate this kind of
fragmented constituency, and to
provide a community in which
the fermentation of ideas is a
continuous process. The absence
of such constituencies will pre
vent the self-gratifying motiva
tion upon which so many "ac
complishments" of each year are
based.
As ASSU president, David
Harris did not speak for a seg
ment of the community in the
same sense that representative
leaders usually do. He spoke for
ideas which had a chance of
standing by themselves, and his
manner of presentation preclu
ded the usual inhibitions which
accompany offices held by stu
dents or administrators.
The obligation to constitu
encies with narrowly defined
limits has been not so much an
assumed responsibility as a pla
gue to administrators and fac
ulty as well as students. In
fear of speaking as representa
tives, and not having the con
fidence to speak as individuals,
such persons have bypassed
chances for the communication
needed so badly in this commu
nity.
While the Harris method is
not always adaptable, it should
be a precedent in that ideas on
acadeimics and university gov
ernment are most representative
when they cut across a broad
segment of the community and
can stand by themselves. At no
time has this independence
from constituency been more
necessary than now.
