# Lomax: New Asian War
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
"Since ours is the age where the ir
real is reality, it is difficult for you to
admit to yourselves that the United
States is involved in another war in
Southeast Asia."
Louis fcomax, Wilbur's Guest-in-
Residence, told an audience in Dinkel
spiel last night, "Before this time
next year, young men, such as you,
will be dying i*n Thailand."
"Vietnam is just the beginning,"
Lomax continued. "And we are al
ready involved in Thailand."
As evidence of the United States'
"involvement", Lomax pointed out
there are "nine air bases", "a major
shipping port for the Navy," and
"50,000 United States servicemen in
Thailand today." With 35,000 members
of the United States Air Force in Thai
land, "four-fifths of the bombing of
North Vietnam takes place with
planes taking off from Thailand
bases."
The agreements granting the
United States these bases date back
to 1956, "when America was preoccu
pied with the menace of spreading
Communism."
Present As Advisers
Dean Rusk, when speaking with
Lomax, stated, 'We are there as ad
visers." But of crucial importance to
Lomax was the fact that the United
States "trains Thai counter-insur

gents, puts them in helicopters, and
flies them into jungles" to fight the
Thai insurgents.
Lomax estimates that there are 5000
Thai insurgents in the northern moun
tains and another 1000 in southern
Thailand. Last year these insurgents
"assassinated 2800 Thai officials,"
which is the "exact rate in Vietnam
five years ago."
Although these insurgents, up to
now, have not attacked any United
States servicemen, Lomax says the
policy is changing. "Just Monday," he
said, "I received word from the Thai
leaders that a bounty has been put
on the heads of American service
men."
Referring to the present leaders of
the insurgents, Lomax admitted that
"many of them have gone to Peking,
and even Moscow, because they had
nowhere else to go" to be trained.
"The rising tide of expectation
which exists in Asia today," is a feel
ing among the people of the world
that they are oppressed, stated Lo
max.
Brainwashed Public
"The American public is so brain
washed it can not believe that the
oppressed haven't enough brains to
rise up" without Communist backing.
"Whereas I bear no grief for the
Communists, I am not willing to let
my son die defending a government
which stands for the antitheses of
everything I believe in," Lomas stated.

The United States justifies its posi
tion in Southeast Asia on a "theology
of Americanism." This belief has the
United States' belief "equated with
God Almighty. He who opposes this is
the Devil."
Lomax went on to insist, "Martin
Luther King is absolutely correct" in
taking the position he has. "A nation
has never been able to effect internal
change while trying to force external
change," he stated.
"I, for one, nave no intention of be
ing silent," Lomax concluded. "For I
believe the American people basically
are a great people who can accom
plish great things, if only we are
given a clear clarion call of what we
are doing and why we are doing it."

Residence, told an audience in Dinkel
spiel last night, "Before this time
next year, young men, such as you,
will be dying i*n Thailand."
"Vietnam is just the beginning,"
Lomax continued. "And we are al
ready involved in Thailand."
As evidence of the United States'
"involvement", Lomax pointed out
there are "nine air bases", "a major
shipping port for the Navy," and
"50,000 United States servicemen in
Thailand today." With 35,000 members
of the United States Air Force in Thai
land, "four-fifths of the bombing of
North Vietnam takes place with
planes taking off from Thailand
bases."
The agreements granting the
United States these bases date back
to 1956, "when America was preoccu
pied with the menace of spreading
Communism."
Present As Advisers
Dean Rusk, when speaking with
Lomax, stated, 'We are there as ad
visers." But of crucial importance to
Lomax was the fact that the United
States "trains Thai counter-insur

gents, puts them in helicopters, and
flies them into jungles" to fight the
Thai insurgents.
Lomax estimates that there are 5000
Thai insurgents in the northern moun
tains and another 1000 in southern
Thailand. Last year these insurgents
"assassinated 2800 Thai officials,"
which is the "exact rate in Vietnam
five years ago."
Although these insurgents, up to
now, have not attacked any United
States servicemen, Lomax says the
policy is changing. "Just Monday," he
said, "I received word from the Thai
leaders that a bounty has been put
on the heads of American service
men."
Referring to the present leaders of
the insurgents, Lomax admitted that
"many of them have gone to Peking,
and even Moscow, because they had
nowhere else to go" to be trained.
"The rising tide of expectation
which exists in Asia today," is a feel
ing among the people of the world
that they are oppressed, stated Lo
max.
Brainwashed Public
"The American public is so brain
washed it can not believe that the
oppressed haven't enough brains to
rise up" without Communist backing.
"Whereas I bear no grief for the
Communists, I am not willing to let
my son die defending a government
which stands for the antitheses of
everything I believe in," Lomas stated.

The United States justifies its posi
tion in Southeast Asia on a "theology
of Americanism." This belief has the
United States' belief "equated with
God Almighty. He who opposes this is
the Devil."
Lomax went on to insist, "Martin
Luther King is absolutely correct" in
taking the position he has. "A nation
has never been able to effect internal
change while trying to force external
change," he stated.
"I, for one, nave no intention of be
ing silent," Lomax concluded. "For I
believe the American people basically
are a great people who can accom
plish great things, if only we are
given a clear clarion call of what we
are doing and why we are doing it."

"Since ours is the age where the ir
real is reality, it is difficult for you to
admit to yourselves that the United
States is involved in another war in
Southeast Asia."
