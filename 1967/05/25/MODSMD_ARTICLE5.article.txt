# Academic Council Votes End To Undergrad Class Ranking
## 
### 
The Academic Council yesterday
passed a resolution that University
wide undergraduate class ranking be
abolished.
The recommendation now goes to
President Wallace Sterling for con
sideration by the Board of Trustees.
The Board's next meeting is June
15th. The action followed the recom

mendation of the Council's executive
committee.
The resolution did not specifically
mention Selective Service.
The Council recommended that
rankings be done away with begin
ning in September. Presently students
may request that their class stand
ings be sent to their draft boards. At

registration this quarter, 3059 out of
3967 undergraduate men did so, in
addition to 2054 out of 4214 graduate
men.
Rankings If Desired
Discussion at the council meeting
yesterday made it clear that class
rankings could still be maintained for
graduate students and for undergrad

uates by individual departments and
schools, if they so desired.
The executive committee's recom
mendation to the council, adopted in
March, noted that "the present sys
tem of class rankings does not serve
the purposes for which it was de
signed" and "as a measuring device
.... is of questionable validity."
Economics Professor Kenneth Ar
row, who presented the recommenda
tion, told the Council that the "mean
inglessness" of university-wide class
ranking was "especially striking" in
the middle range, where a small dif
ference in grade point average can
mean a large difference in class stand
ing.
Selective Service Request
Professor Arrow said the Univer
sity began the practice of class rank
ing by sex at the request of the Selec
tive Service. This information was
also made available to other outside
agencies with the consent of the in
dividual students.
University Relations Director Lyle
Nelson, speaking to the Council by
invitation, reported that the House
passed version of the new draft law
provides that undergraduates be de
ferred if their work is "satisfactory"
regardless of class standing. He added
that chances that this will prevail in
the final bill are "better than even."
Referendum
In an ASSU referendum this month,
men students voted 863 to 589 against
the University's providing rankings
to local draft boards. Because that
entire election run-off was invalidated
by the Judicial Council, the referen
dum appears again on yesterday's
and today's ballot with candidates for
Senior Class President, Vice Presi
dent and National Student Associa
tion representative.
Leonard Siegel, spokesman for the
student Anti-Draft Union, commented
on the council's action: "I hope that
this will prove that faculty and stu
dents can make progress with the
Administration without having to re
sort to extrerne actions." He added
the Union will ask Sterling to recom
mend the Council's resolution affir
matively to the Trustees.

uates by individual departments and
schools, if they so desired.
The executive committee's recom
mendation to the council, adopted in
March, noted that "the present sys
tem of class rankings does not serve
the purposes for which it was de
signed" and "as a measuring device
.... is of questionable validity."
Economics Professor Kenneth Ar
row, who presented the recommenda
tion, told the Council that the "mean
inglessness" of university-wide class
ranking was "especially striking" in
the middle range, where a small dif
ference in grade point average can
mean a large difference in class stand
ing.
Selective Service Request
Professor Arrow said the Univer
sity began the practice of class rank
ing by sex at the request of the Selec
tive Service. This information was
also made available to other outside
agencies with the consent of the in
dividual students.
University Relations Director Lyle
Nelson, speaking to the Council by
invitation, reported that the House
passed version of the new draft law
provides that undergraduates be de
ferred if their work is "satisfactory"
regardless of class standing. He added
that chances that this will prevail in
the final bill are "better than even."
Referendum
In an ASSU referendum this month,
men students voted 863 to 589 against
the University's providing rankings
to local draft boards. Because that
entire election run-off was invalidated
by the Judicial Council, the referen
dum appears again on yesterday's
and today's ballot with candidates for
Senior Class President, Vice Presi
dent and National Student Associa
tion representative.
Leonard Siegel, spokesman for the
student Anti-Draft Union, commented
on the council's action: "I hope that
this will prove that faculty and stu
dents can make progress with the
Administration without having to re
sort to extrerne actions." He added
the Union will ask Sterling to recom
mend the Council's resolution affir
matively to the Trustees.
The Academic Council yesterday
passed a resolution that University
wide undergraduate class ranking be
abolished.
The recommendation now goes to
President Wallace Sterling for con
sideration by the Board of Trustees.
The Board's next meeting is June
15th. The action followed the recom

mendation of the Council's executive
committee.
The resolution did not specifically
mention Selective Service.
The Council recommended that
rankings be done away with begin
ning in September. Presently students
may request that their class stand
ings be sent to their draft boards. At

registration this quarter, 3059 out of
3967 undergraduate men did so, in
addition to 2054 out of 4214 graduate
men.
Rankings If Desired
Discussion at the council meeting
yesterday made it clear that class
rankings could still be maintained for
graduate students and for undergrad

uates by individual departments and
schools, if they so desired.

mendation to the council, adopted in
