## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The list of coeducational residences
is steadily growing.
A report issued by the Dean of Stu
dents Office yesterday indicated that
two houses of Wilbur Hall and one
house of Stern Hall will include wom
en as well as men this September.
Known officially as the "Demonstra
tion Houses," they will offer varied"
academic programs as well as coedu
cational living.
One Wilbur House, Otero, will fea
ture an international program. Ap
proximately 25 percent of the Otero
residents next fall are expected to be
foreign students.
In Soto House, also located in Wil
bur, John Chowning, a Music Instruc
tor, will lead a program in creativity.
The lone coeducational Stern House,
Serra, will be the center of a program
in community action.
Grove House
The present Grove House, now lo
cated in a fraternity cluster, was ex
pected to be named as the fourth Dem
onstration House, which would be
located in Stern Hall. It was not in
cluded in the list released by the
Dean's Office yesterday, however, and
Dean of Students Joel Smith has re
fused to comment on the future of
Grove House.
Student observers speculate that
present Grove members would rather
move into Lagunita, but the Dean's
Office is attempting to relocate the
Grove House in Stern. The contro
versy is expected to be settled to
night.

Students will be selected for the
Demonstration Houses in a draw to
be held June 1. Applications will be
accepted for only one house.
Applications for the Demonstration
Houses are available In the Dean of
Students Office and should be re
turned by 5 p.m. May 31.
The draw will be completely ran
dom, except that 10 percent of Otero
and Soto may be selected by the Fac
ulty Residents to insure a balance of
majors and interests. The names will
be drawn by class to provide ade
quate representation of all classes in
the houses.
Freshmen
Eight freshmen women and 16
freshmen men will live in each of the
three houses. No plan has been de
termined yet for their selection, ac
cording to Miss Sally Mahoney, As
sistant Dean of Students.
Martin Evans, Assistant Professor
of English, will be the Otero Faculty
Resident. In addition to the freshmen,
39 upperclass men and 22 upperclass
women are scheduled to live in Otero,
and will participate in an International
program. Academic credit will be
given for the various house seminars.
The Soto house program in crea
tivity will focus on modes of creativi
ty in the sciences and the arts. Soto's
Faculty Resident, John Chowning,
hopes that a cross section of the aca
demic community — engineers, musi
cians, scientists, and writers — will
apply for the program.

Both Evans and Chowning will dis
cuss the programs with students to
night at 9 p.m. in the Soto Lounge.
Forty upperclass men and 25 upper
class women will live in Serra House
and participate in the community ac
tion program, led by Robert Freelen,
Sorra's Faculty Resident. A group of
faculty fellows will also participate in
the program, which will be directed
toward "life styles" in America. Prob
lems of minority groups will also be
discussed.
Each student living in Serra will be
expected to participate in one house
seminar for which three to five units
of credit will be given. Three hours
of community sen/ice work will also
be a requirement. Present Serra resi
dents will be given priority in the
draw next week.
Freelen will be available to discuss
the community service program to
night at 7:15 in the Serra Lounge.
Students who will attend a foreign
campus during part of next year may
apply for one of the Demonstration
Houses, but according to the state
ment released by the Deans' Office,
"such students should recognize that
continuity is a significant value in
creating strong house programs."
Any student is eligible for the pro
gram, even if he is not registered this
quarter.
A separate application will be
available for the fourth demonstration
house, which will probably be the
Grove House, as soon as plans are
completed. A decision is expected to
night.

The Soto house program in crea
tivity will focus on modes of creativi
ty in the sciences and the arts. Soto's
Faculty Resident, John Chowning,
hopes that a cross section of the aca
demic community — engineers, musi
cians, scientists, and writers — will
apply for the program.

Both Evans and Chowning will dis
cuss the programs with students to

lems of minority groups will also be
discussed.
Each student living in Serra will be
expected to participate in one house

Students who will attend a foreign
campus during part of next year may
