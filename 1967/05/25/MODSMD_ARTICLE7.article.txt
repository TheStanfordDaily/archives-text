# Academic Council Advisory Committee Soon To Seek Successor To Sterling
## 
### PAT MeMAHON 
Suggestions for a successor to
President Sterling are being sought
"from all segments of the University
community, faculty, students, and
staff," announced Professor William
F. Baxter, newly elected chairman of
the Advisory Committee on Presi
dential Selection.
In a letter to members of the Aca
demic Council Tuesday, the Commit
tee announced that Baxter would head
the group and that they "are very
conscious of the fact that the aggre
gate knowledge of the community of
appropriate candidates vastly exceeds

their own, and they wish to stress
not merely their willingness to re
ceive such suggestions but their
heavy dependence upon them."
Baxter said yesterday that the
mechanics of this process had not
been worked out.
Communication Network
He did however cite the letter which
said the Committee "will attempt to
establish the most effective commu
nication network possible for the in
flow of such information although it
recognizes that the substantive delib
erations of the Committee on indivi
dual names will necessarily remain
confidential."
Baxter felt that a new President
probably will be selected by the end
of the calendar year since "anyone
we get will have sizable commit
ments" he will have to break in order
to take office by September, 1968.

This faculty advisory group has
met with the Trustees once and plans
to meet "regularly in the months
ahead," the letter to the Academic
Council pointed out.
Ultimate Responsibility
Board of Trustee President W.
Parmer Fuller contacted yesterday
said "the ultimate responsibility for
selecting a President lies with the
Board of Trustees and the faculty
has been asked to provide suggestions
and is an advisory committee."
"We are looking for advice, sugges
tions, and help from this group," he
said, adding "we expect to work hand
and glove with them."
He also said that the Trustee com
mittee does not have any specific
guidelines drawn up on what Stan
ford needs in the President's office.
Fuller also said that the University
hoped "to draw up a list of candi

dates of considerable magnitude and
then winnow it down from there."
Another Function
Baxter also considered one function
of the faculty committee to be "to
present the role of the President as
perceived from the inside" by the fac
ulty, in addition to the role as per
ceived from the outside.
Professor of Physics Leonard I.
Schiff was selected as Vice Chairman
of the Committee, and the Committee
did not wish to "exercise its authority
to co-opt additional members," the let
ter revealed.
Speculation in the past on possible
successors to President Sterling has
included Health, Education, and Wel
fare Secretary John W. Gardner, Sec
retary of Defense Robert McNamara,
Clark Kerr, Provost Richard Lyman,
and David Truman of Columbia.
