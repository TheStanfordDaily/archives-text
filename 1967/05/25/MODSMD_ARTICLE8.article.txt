## LASSU To Elect New Speaker 
### 
LASSU will meet tonight to elect a
new speaker and legislative liason
officer.
Other items on the agenda include
by-law amendments which would
abolish the Speech Association and
withdraw Stanford from the Nation
al Student Association.
The Speech Association, which is
ranked among the largest and finest
in the nation, is expected to bring
strong opposition to the former pro
posal.
Running for LASSU Speaker are
junior Craig Venator, freshman
Michael Weinstein, and sophomore
Stephen McMillan. David Stepner, a
graduate student in electrical engi
neering, will run unopposed for legis
lative liaison officer. The position has
been open since Tom Forstenzer va
cated it to become Speaker.
Judicial Action
LASSU will also discuss the In
terim Judicial Board's action invest
ing the Student Judicial Council with
the responsibility to enforce Univer
sity policy not in conflict with the
ASSU Constitution and by-laws.
ASSU President Michael Collins and
Judicial Council Chairman Martin

Gerry are supporting an amendment
to the by-laws which proposes that:
"violations of university regulations
or policy shall not be construed as
per se violations of the Fundamental
Standard." Their grounds are that
"LASSU creates a conflict of law be
tween ASSU by-laws and the pres
ent University policy on (1) campus
demonstrations and (2) women's so
cial regulations."
Richard Gorin has sponsored a reso
lution on the subject that provides a
new definition of the Fundamental
Standard, which would read: "No
member of the University community
shall commit any overt act that sub
stantially hinders any other members
of the University community in the
quiet enjoyment of his rights."
Community Defined
Members of the University commu
nity would be defined to include stu
dents and employees of the university
and the members of the Board of
Trustees, the Office of the President,
and the Academic Council.
Under this proposal, if the Student
Judicial Council is asked to enforce
any law other than the Fundamental
Standard or the Honor Code, laws
violating the Fun Stan shall be de

clared null and void. Others may be
enforced, but their violation will be
less seriously regarded than Fun
Stan offences.
Also on LASSU's agenda is further
discussion of the $112,000 ASSU budg
et. A move is underway to promote
expenditure on educational reform
projects by reducing spending on such
things as Cardinals Board and the In
stitute of International Relations.
The meeting will be at 7 p.m. in
room 370.
