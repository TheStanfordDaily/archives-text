What makes Carlsberg
so expensive is doing things
the way most brewers don't
do things. Like developing
and growing our own spe
cial Danish beer barley.
Waiting some two months
longer than most brewers
before our beer matures.
The result is an expen
sive beer. Yet a beer with
a singular taste and body.
Try it yourself. After you
taste it, you might consider
mellow, flavorful Carlsberg
cheap at twice the price.
Carlsberg: imported from
Copenhagen, Denmark.
