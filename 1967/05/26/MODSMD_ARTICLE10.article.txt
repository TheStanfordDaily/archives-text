Organizers of Mid-Peninsula
Vietnam Summer, the local
branch of the national educa
tional program announced April
23 by Rev. Martin Luther King,
Jr., will hold an open meeting
Sunday night at 8:00 at the
First Presbyterian Church in
Palo Alto (Cowper at Lincoln)
to introduce summer plans and
to begin work.
According to campus minister
Stu McLean, one of the organi

versity of approaches within a
unity of purpose." He says that
the program will work toward
"broadening the base" of oppo

and to consolidate the already
existing opposition.
Programs tentatively planned
by Mid Peninsula Vietnam Sum
mer include draft organization,
political education, and begin
ning a local weekly newspaper.
The draft education project will
probably include disseminating
information about the draft and
alternatives, providing legal as
sistance and conscientious ob
jection and other draft counsel
