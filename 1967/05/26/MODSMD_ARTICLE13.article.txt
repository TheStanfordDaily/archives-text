# Experiment Still Lacks Space
## 
### CHARLES THIERIOT 
The Experiment must vacate
its present location in the old
Western Civ building this Tues
day, and the problem of finding
d new location is still very much
unsolved.
The Administration as well as
The Experiment has been look
ing for a new site but at present
there are very few possibilities.
James Thurber, Assistant to the
Provost, who has been working
with Barry Greenberg, coordina
tor for The Experiment, ex
pressed regret over the situation
as he discussed the problem.
"I cannot just say there is no
at all available, I must
qualify this. There are four pos
sible places where we may have
some space next year: the base
ment of the Undergraduate Li
brary, the basement of the Medi
cal Center, the basement of the
Business School, and the base
ment of the new Biology Build
ing." However, neither Thurber
' nor Greenberg feels that any of
these buildings would be applic
able to The Experiment.
Measured In Feet
Thurber added, "We have
gone through the University in
detail looking for space, and con
ditions are even worse than I

expected. It is not even a ques
tion of square yards, now we are
down to square feet."
Coordinator Greenberg, on the
other hand, had some different
feelings on the matter, "I have
heard from a source that I have
no reason to doubt, a source
very close to the University's
decision makers, that after the
'we accuse' incident, the Admini
stration decided to destroy The
Experiment by 'attrition.'"
Ulterior Motives
"University officials have been
telling me that the only reason
The Experiment has no home
next year is that there is no
place to put it. I have accepted
this explanation. There is clearly
a space problem at Stanford, but
in light of the recent informa
tion in regard to 'attrition' I am
beginning to wonder if more
than just the question of space
is involved."
"In a way the whole matter
of relocating The Experiment is
not that central. We plan to be
back next year, regardless of
whether or not we have a new
home."
Increased Determination
"If the Administration is try
ing to wear us down, it will
learn in the coming months that

the radical community we are
striving to create is already well
under way. The lack of a facility
will only increase our determina
tion to complete what we have
started."
Greenberg feels very strongly
that The Experiment will con
tinue because it has proven it
self to many people. However, it
will require work and patience
from the members.

He also asks that anyone inter
ested in taking a summer or fall
seminar should call him at 328-
4698 or write him at 473 Pepper
Ave., Palo Alto.
The Experiment must move to
make room for thÂ£ Placement
Center which is changing from
Encina. This is part of the plan
to clear the west wing of Encina
which will be filled by the Food
Research Institute.
