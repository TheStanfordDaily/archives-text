# New Program Set Up For Wilbur Associates
## 
### 
Several important changes are
planned in the Wilbur Associate
Program for the coming year in
an attempt to involve upper
classmen, graduate students, and
faculty in the development of the
freshman houses, announced
new head sponsor Steve Tipton
recently.
The program's structure will
no longer consist "simply of eat
ing meals regularly in Wilbur,
but will be directed at the goals
of the integrated demonstration
houses" and will capitalize on
their presence in Wilbur. "As
sociates will take a formative
role with sponsors in planning
and participating in the common
activity of the individual
houses," Tipton noted.
Several houses will be planned
around creative and intellectual
themes which associates will
have a part in determining, Tip
ton reported. Asociates will help
organize and lead informal semi
nars and discussion lectures and
social programs, field trips and
work projects.
A seminar to consider the idea
of community in residential edu
cation and coordinate its imple
mentation through specific proj
ects will be open to all associ
ates interested. It will be run for

academic credit, Itn conjunction
with a hostel prog Yam he added.
The seminar will be sponsored
by Prof. Helen Schrader of the
Speech and Department.
To begin the "sort of "sustain
ed and thoughtful relationships"
which the program intends, all
associates will be asked to re
turn for Pre-Reg Week, he re
ported. They will participate in
orientation as members of small
groups within each house.
University housing will be
provided during this time for
those who forsee the need of it.
All interested members of the
Stanford community should ap
ply within the next week by â€”
I) filling out forms available in
the Wilbur Office; 2) mailing a
brief statement of interest to
Wilbur Director Joseph Higgins
lUniversity extension 4144); 3)
contacting Scott Soames (237-

An organizational meeting is
scheduled for this afternoon at
4:15 in Tresidder rm. 267-8 to

questions. For everyone inter
