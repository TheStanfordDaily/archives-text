## 'Playboy' Is Supreme 
### 
"A great Irish play by a great
Irish playwright" say the post
ers. Indeed Synge's Playboy Of
The Western World, though not
as lurid as Brendan Behan, nor
as moving as Sean O'Casey, pre
cedes all modern Irish realism
and stands supreme in village
portraiture.
Professor Cannon's production
in the Nitery strains every re
source of limited space, unex
ceptional lighting and imagi
native undergraduate acting
with the result that life and
wit are injected into a tragi
comedy nearly sixty years old
today.
The plot is small, innocuous:
Christy Mahon has chopped his
da' on the head; he flees from
the clutches of a domineering
father, only to land up in the
velvet paw of some frustrated
Irish colleens.
Mahon is played throughout
with no less intelligence than
accuracy by Dennis Johnson. He
scares easy, blubbering, trip
ping around the stage, cower
ing behind opening doors that
adtnit his vengeful dad, finally
triumphing over the veritable
pere Karamazov that Jon Hardy
makes of the part until we are
convinced that we are sitting
before the work of an author
who had read his Crime And
Punishment and who appreci
ated the social significance of
a Raskolnikov.
Mahon is occasionally eclip
sed in this production by the
sensitive work of Charles Ho
gan; Oirish blatherer and cow
ard, the exact image of the
nebulous ruffled yeoman is
created for Shawn Keogh's (sec
ondary) part by Mr. Hogan.

Rather too beautiful for the
part of Widow Quiinn, Miss
Waters nevertheless defied her
youth to give the nasty, kind
hearted ex-wife a depth and wis
dom which Synge must have
deliberately denied to all the
other characters in his satire.
Mahon gets adopted by the
Mike, who runs a whiskey par
lour for her perpetually ineb
riated father. When he stumbles
into the Flahertys* inn, he hard
ly realizes how he, a poor and
cynosure of the girls, their last
"playboy of the Western World."
Too Much
Miss Hopkins, who interpreted
the part of Flaherty's daugh
ter Pegeen, was again a little
too touching and spruce for the
role. Judicious daubing and
shocking rags made up for
youth in all the other villagers;
why didn't the same smear cam
paign toughen up Hopkin's bou
doir?
While Paul Schneider was de
lightfully drunk as Flaherty
senior, Wayne Mooney was im
mensely pleasing as Jimmy Far
rel, who has possibly the fun
niest part of the show. Les Krat
ter tucked away the part of
Philly, Farrell's boon compan
ion and fellow-lout, with equal
recklessness.
Throughout the Nitery pro
duction, pleasing use was made
of the outstandingly simple but
opposite set designed by the
undergraduate class for their
teacher's production. Someone
has said that austerity is the
true vein of all art; this, per
haps unconsciously, Professor
Cannon has attractively con
verted into histrionic validity.

Five girls play nicely the
parts of the fellow travellers in
the general Playboy admira
tion: in their morbid and lynch
mentality swing of favors it was
difficult not to detect something
of the grasping old women in
Zorba The Greek.
