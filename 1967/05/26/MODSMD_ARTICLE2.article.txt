## 
### CICELY BATES KIRK HANSON 
Mike Weinstein was elected last
night to succeed Tom Forstenzer as
Speaker of the Legislature. LASSU
also considered and approved much
of next year's ASSU budget.
In the Speaker's report, Forstenzer
described the handling of the future
of the Grove House by Dean Joel
Smith and other administrators as
"dishonest and obstructive." He ques
tioned the commitment of the ad
ministration to educational housing.
Weinstein is a freshman and has
served on LASSU as Lassen House
representative and on the financial
subcommittee this year. He defeated
junior Craig Venator. Assisting Wein
stein as a negotiator with faculty
and administration will be Stephen
McMillan, elected LASSU Liaison Of
ficer. The position has been vacant
since Tom Forstenzer became Speaker
Autumn Quarter.
Weinstein called for a more ex
tensive LASSU committee system.
He supports Legislature's funding of
The Experiment and similar organi
zations. McMillan stated he intends
to treat the administrators as "hu
man beings," but would insist on
LASSU's important role in the Uni
versity.
Budget.
LASSU approved appropriations
for Cardinal's Board, Elections Com
mission, the Graduate Student Asso
ciation, the Political Union, the Pre-
Reg Commission, and the Publica
tions Board. The Legislature also ap
proved the controversial Speech As
sociation appropriation of $6,650 after
$300 of this amount was reappropriat
ed for on-campus debates of educa
tional issues.

Other alterations made included
cutting $2000 from the budget of the
Institute of International Relations
and cutting the allocation to the Judi
cial Council for Women's sign-out ma
terials. The Legislature also turned
down an amendment from Dr. Robert
A. Walker to increase student funds
provided to overseas campus groups.
In his report, Forstenzer question
ed the fact that LASSU had no voice
in determining the new Grove House
site. Forstenzer suggested the Legfs
lature make an offer to purchase the
Phi Delta Theta House or ask to
build their own experimental hous
ing.
Year-end Rush
Forstenzer further attacked the ad
ministration for engaging in "fana
tic activity" near the close of school.
He felt the Legislature was unable
to cope with this increase in policy
making decisions.
Student Body President Michael
Collins also displayed dissatisfaction
with the handling of the Grove House
but commented that if anything, yes
terday's events showed the Dean's
office that students are not "cattle"
to be herded about.
Student Body President -Elect Peter
Lyman outlined a few of his plans
for next year. He stated that the most
important mandate facing all stu
dents is the quality of education. "Stu
dents are the only people solely con
cerned with education," Lyman said.
We must "make sure our voice gets
heard." Lyman expressed the desire
to cooperate with the SES but won
dered if it will be answering ques
tions for or with students.
Lyman expressed his concern over
the budget, saying while he considers
all appropriations legitimate, funds

should be sought from the admini
stration, departments, and alumni so
that LASSU funds could be used for
education projects.
In other business the results from
the re-run of the Senior Class, Class
rankings, and NSA representative
election were certified. Legis'ature
postponed approval of funds for Stan
ford's National Student Association,
pending consideration of Stanford's
membership in NSA.
