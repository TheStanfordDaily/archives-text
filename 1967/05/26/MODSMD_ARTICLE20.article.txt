### BONNIE SELWAY 
It was le jazz hot and le jazz
cool Tuesday night at the I-Cen
ter, as a dozen musicians "jam
med" away.
A pleasant addition to the
combo was the viviacious blond
singer, Wendy Weiner,
In a Carmen McCraesque
voice she began with "Summer
time." John Felder on the drums
backed it up with soft brush
strokes, while Phil Cammerman
on clarinet molded Gilberto-like
fog tones, into which Wendy's
final dissonant ninth settled.
The group then plunged into
a loud, funky rendition of
"Watermelon Man" starting to
gether and then breaking into
solos.
"My Favorite Things" caught
the clarinetist sitting slumped
over on a low coffee table.
Wendy commented on the jazz
workshops. "You can take the
time to experiment and people
are receptive. You've given me
a chance to learn. She aspires to
be "the best female white jazz
singer," and often sings at the
"Half Note" in the city.
The relaxed mood of the au
dience was lifted with dixie
land, big band sounds in "Bye,
Bye Blackbird," and "Mack the
Knife," featuring surprising
quotes from "Nola," by trump
ter Noel Weidkamp, and bassist
Chris Christy's voyages into the
absurd on the kazoo.
The greatest joy in these jazz
sessions is the spontaneous com
munication among musicians
who have never played togeth
er before.
The most vocal praise of the
jam session came from a man
who had been sitting quietly in
the audience. He said abruptly,
"I'm a faculty member in this
damn university, and just walk
ed by, and heard the music and
wandered in. This is the finest
music in the N. Bay or the S.
Bay that I've heard for a whole
damn year. I've really enjoyed
it."
