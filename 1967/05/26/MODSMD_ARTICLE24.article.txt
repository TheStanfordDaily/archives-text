### PAT McMAHON News Analysis 
The committee to find a suc
cessor to President Sterling has
officially begun its work. It will
soon begin considering the
names of candidates, sifting and
assessing and finally developing
a list of acceptable candidates.
Sure to be on this list and the
most likely to succeed is Health,
Education, and Welfare Secre

tary John W. Gardner. Former
president of the Carnegie Foun
dation and a Stanford alumnus,
Gardner has been sought after
by the University of California,
Michigan, and Oklahoma.
Gardner seems uninterested at
present in any of these. He has
said on such reports, "I am not
available. I am heavily occupied
in a job to which I am very
deeply committed."
