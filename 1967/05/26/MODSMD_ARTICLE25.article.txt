# SES To Organize Discussion Groups
## 
### 
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) and the ASSU
will sponsor a meeting Wednes
day to set up discussion groups,
research committees and semin
ars for faculty and students who
have "shown special interest" in
SES but do not belong to its for
mal committees.
This general meeting will also
"inform the University commun
ity on the progress and plans of
the Study," according to the
sponsors of the meeting, which
will begin at 4:15 p.m. in room
124 of the Undergraduate library.
Herbert Packer, chairman of
the SES steering committee, and
Peter Lyman, ASSU President
elect, will be among the speak
ers at the meeting.
Groups On Each Topic
After the prepared speeches
the meeting will break up into
groups of students and faculty
who have expressed interest in
particular topics related to the
SES program. Participants will
be invited to "meet and exchange
ideas with members of the Steer
ing Committee and others who
share your particular interests,"
according to the invitation which
will be mailed to persons who
have written to SES, spoken at
SES open hearings, or filled out
the yellow SES cards on registra
tion day.
The meeting's sponsors hope
the participants will organize
"groups and seminars which will
develop ideas and make reports
to the Study through the com
ing year."
Independent Of SES
Lyman said the ASSU wants
to involve the greatest number
of interested students and fac
ulty in groups which will be in
dependent of SES but will make
recommendations to the formal
SES committees.
Jean England, SES assistant
staff director, said the meeting

will be open to all members of
the University community, as
well as those who will receive in
vitations.
