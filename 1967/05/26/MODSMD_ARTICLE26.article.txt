Rumors however persist.
There are several reasons to
believe that there is still a chance
that Gardner will accept the
Stanford presidency:
• Gardner is an active Stan
ford alumnus and has been on
campus a great deal lately. News
week's Periscope predicted that
the question of Stanford and
Gardner was "not whether, but
when."
• He recently resigned the
Presidency of the Carnegie Foun
dation, which he has held in ab
sentia since he went to Washing
ton, indicating that he may be
interested in something else
after his Secretaryship.
However, should Gardner be
"not available," the selection is
not quite so simple. There are
several areas from which the
Trustees could choose.
They may attempt to secure
another high government official

like Gardner, as Columbia did
with General Eisenhower after
the War. Secretary of Defense
Robert MacNamara and Dean
Rusk have also been mentioned.
Another possible selection
route is luring away a top admin
istrator at another school or ele
vating one here. Included in this
category are Provost Richard W.
Lyman (who recently turned
down the presidency of Haver
ford College;) David B. Truman,
dean of Columbia College; Clark
Kerr, former University of Cali
fornia president; former Trustee
and Dean of the Business School
Ernest Arbuckle; and Professor
of History Gordon Wright.
The Committee may also
choose a lesser known educator
for the top office. Though this is
the most difficult course, Presi
dent Sterling and the current
presidents of Harvard and Yale
were selected in this manner.
