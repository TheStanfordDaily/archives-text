# Stickmen Ready For Last Two
## Tribe, Palo Vie For NorCal Lax 
### 
The Lacrosse team finishes up
its 1967 home season with two
afternoon games this weekend,
the first on Saturday against the
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club, fol
lowed on Sunday with a contest
with the Marin Lacrosse Club.
Both games will start at 1:30
p.m., admission free.
Last Saturday, Stanford took
over first place in the race for
the Northern California cham

pionship, with an 8-7 win over
traditional champion Palo Alto.
This Saturday's game will be
the last meeting between the
two rivals.
The Tribe played its best game
of the Spring in last week's win
over Palo Alto, forcing the oppo
sition into costly errors, as Stan
ford dominated most of the
game with superior condition
ing and bench strength.
But Palo Alto's experienced

stickmen were never out of the
game until the final gun had
sounded, having come back
from an 8-6 deficit to score with
over two minutes remaining,
and narrowly missing the tying
goal on a hard midfield shot less
than thirty seconds later.
Time ran out with Stanford
stalling with the ball in the at
tack zone for Palo Alto's first
loss in California play.
Outstanding for Palo Alto to
morrow will be Bruce Lloyd, a
former All-American attackman
from Yale, who accounted for

three of Palo Alto's goals.
He is the nucleus of the most
effective attack in California,
including Mike Sherwood of Exe
ter and Yale fame, and Bill Oat
way, who played on three na
tional championship teams at
the Naval Academy. The attack
is Palo Alto's strongpoint,
backed up by a better than ade
quate midfield, and a strong de
fense.
Stanford has the best defense
in the league, with 200 pound
speedster Denny McNeely on the
crease, Fleet Will Eakland and

Nat Benchley behind the goal,
and Mel Ellis in the nets. This
quartet held Palo Alto to its
lowest score of the year, includ
ing one minute when Palo Alto
was held scoreless with a two
man advantage.
At midfield, three well-bal
anced and experienced units give
Stanford the depth it needs for
its pressing, ball-control style.
Tony King, George Muser, and
Clay Primrose, winner of last
week's game ball, make up the
attack, which has averaged near
ly nine goals per game.

the last meeting between the
two rivals.
The Tribe played its best game
of the Spring in last week's win
over Palo Alto, forcing the oppo
sition into costly errors, as Stan
ford dominated most of the
game with superior condition
ing and bench strength.
But Palo Alto's experienced

stickmen were never out of the
game until the final gun had
sounded, having come back
from an 8-6 deficit to score with
over two minutes remaining,
and narrowly missing the tying
goal on a hard midfield shot less
than thirty seconds later.
Time ran out with Stanford
stalling with the ball in the at
tack zone for Palo Alto's first
loss in California play.
Outstanding for Palo Alto to
morrow will be Bruce Lloyd, a
former All-American attackman
from Yale, who accounted for

three of Palo Alto's goals.
He is the nucleus of the most
effective attack in California,
including Mike Sherwood of Exe
ter and Yale fame, and Bill Oat
way, who played on three na
tional championship teams at
the Naval Academy. The attack
is Palo Alto's strongpoint,
backed up by a better than ade
quate midfield, and a strong de
fense.
Stanford has the best defense
in the league, with 200 pound
speedster Denny McNeely on the
crease, Fleet Will Eakland and

Nat Benchley behind the goal,
and Mel Ellis in the nets. This
quartet held Palo Alto to its
lowest score of the year, includ
ing one minute when Palo Alto
was held scoreless with a two
man advantage.
At midfield, three well-bal
anced and experienced units give
Stanford the depth it needs for
its pressing, ball-control style.
Tony King, George Muser, and
Clay Primrose, winner of last
week's game ball, make up the
attack, which has averaged near
ly nine goals per game.
