# Professional Jealousy?
## QUAD's Sport Pics 
### Nick Selby 
There comes a time for an end
to professional jealousy. Rival
journalists eventually have to
lay aside their invectives and
congratulate each other on a job
well done.
That time has come. The 1967
QUAD has come out, and I
for Wells Shoemaker,
shorts editor for fall and win
ter, and the rest of the sports
.staff in congratulating the
QUAD staff on a fantastic job.
What interested me most, nat
urally, was the sports section.
Here are, undoubtedly, the best
pictures I have seen on any
sports pages this year, DAILY,
CHRONICLE, and SPORTS IL
LUSTRATED included. The ac
tion shots show keen knowledge
of sport and appreciation for the
drama of competition. The photo
ossay on coach-of-the-year J i m
Gaughran is exceedingly percep
tive.
Success Factors
The success of those pages is
due mainly to three people:
Bruce Howard, the head photog
rapher; Jim Chee, his assistant,
and Art Snyder, the Sports edi
tor. These three are among the
most avid sports fans in the Uni
versity, attending nearly every
game and rooting more than the
hottest red-hot for the Tribe
athletes despite the score or the
team record.
Their concern, their painstak

ing demands for perfection in
photos and layout, really shows
on each page. The pictures (some
are color) aren't bunched or
slapped in, and the captions are
accurate and readable.
A Million Word Debt
They say a picture is worth a
thousand words, and if that's
true, then Bruce Howard prob
ably wrote more copy for the
DAILY sports, or I dare say for
the whole pape*\ than anyone
else. It seems a gross inequality
that photographers, whose work
is what rescues our words from
sinking in a sea of gray, receive
only a miniscule credit beneath
their finished product.
How many of you have noticed
Bruce's or Jim's photo credits
during the year? Many of the
football pictures, almost all of
the basketball pics, and a few
crew, baseball, and tennis
shots this spring came from ei
ther Bruce or Jim. Many were
the times that they dropped
over to fill space for a desperate
desk worker. In fact the out
standing baseball picture on
page seven today came from
Bruce's super lens. We on Daily
Sports are in their debt.
The QUAD people were nice
to give us their pictures, but
never nice enough to give us
their really great pictures.
These they scrupulously saved
for their own product. Now you
can see them all.
