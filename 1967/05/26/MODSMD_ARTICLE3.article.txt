# 45 Faculty, Staff Members Pledge 'Civil Disobedience' Against War
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Forty-five faculty and staff members
have pledged themselves to acts of
mass civil disobedience designed to
stop the war in Vietnam.
Jay Neugeboren, English lecturer
and group spokesman, explained that
this action is the first phase of a na
tionwide movement which will mo
bilize academic, professional, religious
and women's anti-war organizations.
Two weeks ago copies of the pledge
were barred from circulation in the
Inter-Departmental Mail Service. De
spite this action, over 20 per cent
of the faculty and staff who previous
sy expressed war opposition in a let
ter to Vice President Humphrey have
signed the pledge.
Immobilize Pentagon
Neugeboren explained that no plans
arc definite, but possible ideas for
mass civil disobedience include: im
mobilizing the Pentagon for a day;

immobilizing induction centers in ma
jor cities for a day; stopping the
movement of a troop ship, train or
supplies; preventing the production
of napalm for a day by sitting in at
production plants.
In addition, the feasibility of a
limited general strike is being consid
ered as an alternative or supplement
to mass civil disobedience.
A statement released to the press
today states: "We cannot be certain
that such acts will end the war. We
do believe however that nothing less
has any chance of stopping it . . .
the acts of civil disobedience will be
in the spirit of the nonviolent acts
undertaken by Martin Luther King
in the civil rights movement . . . "
Several of the Stanford initiators of
the mass civil disobedience plan have
conferred with tho head of a major
anti-war group with facilities and
contacts sufficient to support the

movement. A memo resulting from
this meeting says:
"The Vietnam war has 'politicized'
large numbers of people who were
previously indifferent to American
foreign policy, by virtue of its sheer
stupidity and inhumanity. The last
two years have also made obvious
the limitations (futility?) of tradi
tional means of protest and attempts
to change policy: simply, marches,
petitions, ads, letters do not seem
to work â€” the war escalates. . . . "
The memo refers to the "We Won't
Go" movement among draft-age youth
and emphasizes the need for an ana
logous activity on the part of those
past draft age: "That action or move
ment might fall under the general
heading of 'civil disobedience' or 'gen
eral strike.' The response that peo
ple at Stanford have had ... to the
notion of civil disobedience against
the war suggests that it is an idea
whose time has come."
Plan Outline
According to Neugehoren, a work
able plan of action has been proposed.
Efforts are currently being made to
recruit a key national figure to lead
the protest, such as Martin Luther
King, Habbi Abraham Tcschel, Rein
hold Niebuhr, or William Sloan Cof
fin. Beginning in mid-June mass mail
ing would be sent to state the case for
civil disobedience, suggesting pos
sible actions and inviting commit
ments.
Following an analysis of mailing
responses, representatives from the
constituencies involved will meet in
late July to select the most appropri
ate action. Neugehoren said the "call
to action'' would hopefully come in
late August or early September.
