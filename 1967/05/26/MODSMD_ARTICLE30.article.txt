# Cards Fight Fresno For Omaha Trip
## Please, Ump? 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Looking back, the Stanford
baseball team has had a tre
mendous season. They finished
with an overall record of 31-3,
won the Pacific Eight title go
ing away, and earned a number
one national ranking.
But, looking forward, it could
be even greater. Today at 3 p.m.
at Stanford's Sunken Diamond,
the Tribe will meet Fresno
State in a best of three series: to
decide who will go to the NCAA
finals in Omaha.
Several outstanding individual
performances highlighted the
past season. Pitcher Rod Poteete
won the conference ERA title
with an amazing 0.33, compiling
a perfect 3-0 record in the proc
ess.
Sandy Vance and Daro Quir
ing also broke into the top ten
with ERAs of 1.35 and 2.37 re
spectively. Vance also tied for
the top spot in complete games
(4) and victories (4).
Mike Schomaker led the Tribe
hitters with an average of .405,
good for third place in the con
ference. Larry Hanson of Ore
gon took the crown with .450.

Mark Marquess was the only
other Indian in the top twenty,
hitting .283.
Schomaker also led the league
in doubles with six, while Ron
Shotts' three home runs tied
him for the top spot in that de
partment.
The rest of the team hit solid
ly, if not spectacularly, and the
Tribe finished third in team bat
ting. The glovemen were the
best in the league. Marquess, for
example, handled 183 chances at
first base without an error.
Fresno State, champions of
the California Collegiate Ath
letic Association and ranked No.
7 in the nation, will not be push
overs by any means. They were
35-8 for the season (16-1 in the
conference), and most of the
players are experienced juniors
and seniors.
The Bulldogs are a lusty hit
ting team, with five regulars
over .300. Larry Gonsalves leads
the mound corps with a 15-2 rec
ord. He recently pitched a per
fect game against Cal Poly,
throwing a grand total of 11
pitches outside of the strike
zone.

Stanford coach Dutch Fehring
has given Sandy Vance the nod
to go against Gonsalves today.
Poteete will work the second
game Saturday at Fresno State.
The Indians do not anticipate
the necessity of a third game.
NCAA Action
The NCAA championship it
self will be a double elimination
affair. The winner will be the
team that can get the farthest
without losing two games. This
should work to Stanford's ad
vantage, for the full strength of
Fehring's tremendously deep
mound staff will come into play.
The Tribe has to rate as the
favorite to win, but fierce com
petition can be expected from all
quarters. Only the best will be
at Omaha, and they're all there
for just one reason—to win. But
it's going to take two victories
over the best Stanford team in
recent history to do it.
Stanford swimmers, move
over!

pire as he applies the tag too late to Stanford's Bob
Gallagher. Gallagher and the rest of the Tribe nine
face Fresno State in Sunken Diamond at 3:00 to
day to decide which team will represent district
eight in the NCAA College World Series in Omaha
June 12-17.
Looking back, the Stanford
baseball team has had a tre
mendous season. They finished
with an overall record of 31-3,
won the Pacific Eight title go
ing away, and earned a number
one national ranking.
But, looking forward, it could
be even greater. Today at 3 p.m.
at Stanford's Sunken Diamond,
the Tribe will meet Fresno
State in a best of three series: to
decide who will go to the NCAA
finals in Omaha.
Several outstanding individual
performances highlighted the
past season. Pitcher Rod Poteete
won the conference ERA title
with an amazing 0.33, compiling
a perfect 3-0 record in the proc
ess.
Sandy Vance and Daro Quir
ing also broke into the top ten
with ERAs of 1.35 and 2.37 re
spectively. Vance also tied for
the top spot in complete games
(4) and victories (4).
Mike Schomaker led the Tribe
hitters with an average of .405,
good for third place in the con
ference. Larry Hanson of Ore
gon took the crown with .450.

Mark Marquess was the only
other Indian in the top twenty,
hitting .283.
Schomaker also led the league
in doubles with six, while Ron
Shotts' three home runs tied
him for the top spot in that de
partment.
The rest of the team hit solid
ly, if not spectacularly, and the
Tribe finished third in team bat
ting. The glovemen were the
best in the league. Marquess, for
example, handled 183 chances at
first base without an error.
Fresno State, champions of
the California Collegiate Ath
letic Association and ranked No.
7 in the nation, will not be push
overs by any means. They were
35-8 for the season (16-1 in the
conference), and most of the
players are experienced juniors
and seniors.
The Bulldogs are a lusty hit
ting team, with five regulars
over .300. Larry Gonsalves leads
the mound corps with a 15-2 rec
ord. He recently pitched a per
fect game against Cal Poly,
throwing a grand total of 11
pitches outside of the strike
zone.

Stanford coach Dutch Fehring
has given Sandy Vance the nod
to go against Gonsalves today.
Poteete will work the second
game Saturday at Fresno State.
The Indians do not anticipate
the necessity of a third game.
NCAA Action
The NCAA championship it
self will be a double elimination
affair. The winner will be the
team that can get the farthest
without losing two games. This
should work to Stanford's ad
vantage, for the full strength of
Fehring's tremendously deep
mound staff will come into play.
The Tribe has to rate as the
favorite to win, but fierce com
petition can be expected from all
quarters. Only the best will be
at Omaha, and they're all there
for just one reason—to win. But
it's going to take two victories
over the best Stanford team in
recent history to do it.
Stanford swimmers, move
over!
