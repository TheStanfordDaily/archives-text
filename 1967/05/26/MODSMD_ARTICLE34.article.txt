# Tenure: 'Security Of Appointment'
## Academic Council Passes Appointment, Tenure Plan 
### MIKE MORTON 
i "Tenure is security of appointment which
<continues to the date of academic retirement
... . Security of appointment is defined as the
3£ht not to be dismissed bi voluntarily, retired
irly, or subjected to discriminatory reduction
<JjT salary before the expiration of the term of
academic appointment . .
The above is taken from the Statement of
Pblicy on Appointment and Tenure at Stanford
University passed yesterday by the Academic
Council.
The statement is the product of over two
years of research by the Executive Committee
during which time several months were de
voted specifically to a study of tenure practices
in the University. Copies of the tentative pro
posal were circulated to members of the Aca
demic Council on May 17, and the final deci
sion was reached yesterday.
Academic Secretary H. Donald Winbigler
said that the new statement is designed to for
malize and regularize "practice which has
been followed informally for years." The pro
posal establishes a uniform policy for the en
tire University, eliminating a number of dis
crepancies previously existing between depart
ments and schooLs.
Winbigler explained the process by which

an individual receives tenure. The recommen
dation is initiated within the particular de
partment or school. From there it goes to the
Advisory Board for consideration.
The Advisory Board, headed by Professor
Leornard Schiff, is comprised of seven full
professors elected from the faculty. After re
view by this committee, a report, in conjunc
tion with a separately prepared report from
the University President, is submitted to the
Board of Trustees for final action.
Tenure may also accrue to the individual
teacher by virtue of the extent of his service
in the University. The new policy statement
says that "any appointment, promotion, or re
appointment . . . which extends the individ
ual's length of full time academic service at
Stanford . . . beyond seven years shall confer
tenure."
Tenure Theory
When asked about the theory behind and
reasons for tenure, Winbigler said that some
appointment policy in the University is "un
avoidable." As soon as a determination is
made between the permanent or transitory
nature of appointments, a tenure policy has
automatically been established.
As to consequences of a tenure policy, Win
bigler stated that conferral of tenure gives

the individual a feeling of security in his ap
pointment, and also that academic freedom is
preserved by removing the threat of reprisals
for espousal of controversial views.
By stating that tenure Ls designed to pro
duce the most competent and desirable facul
ty, Winbigler implied a third reason for ten
ure. Under this program, the junior faculty
member must demonstrate competence to his
superiors through teaching, research, and par
ticipation in the University community. The
system allows for a "careful and systematic
review of individual qualifications" to deter
mine whether or not a permanent appointment
is desirable.
Tenure Effects
When asked whether tenure appreciably af
fected the professor's degree of freedom or
quality of work, he stated that the faculty
members given tenure at Stanford "have inner
drives to academic achievement making them
work hard at their profession." Although he
allowed that exceptions could exist in individ
ual cases, he stated that tenure is generally ir
relevant to this drive.
In an attempt to learn how the other, i.e.,
un-tenured, half views the tenure situation,
The Daily spoke with two members of the
"lower" teaching orders.

Robert Smythe, a grad student teaching in
the Statistics Department, stated that the need
to publish, to "shine up the academic creden
tials," can easily cut down on the time al
lowed for participation in other areas of the
University.
He expressed the hope that tenure would re
lieve the pressure to publish and allow more
time to devote to actual teaching, but feared
that there exist too many cases of professors
receiving tenure and then slacking off.
He stated that tenure is seen by the junior
faculty member as a "vote of confidence" by
the University. He also cited another poten
tially beneficial effect of tenure conferral—
the end of pressure to publish "just any
thing." He said, "An awful lot of trash gets
published because of this pressure."
Tenure Fault
Smythe pointed out what he considers pos
sibly the worst effect of tenure, both on the
individual teacher and the educative process,
i.e., that in a large University emphasizing the
research and scholarly competence necessary
for large-scale graduate work, the status of
tenure need not have any relations to teaching
ability and quality.
Conversation with Gaines Post, Western
Civilization instructor, corroborated the gen

orally held view that there exists a tremen
dous degree of pressure on the un-tenured fac
ulty member to publish. Post agreed that there
is a definite over-emphasis on publishing, par
ticularly in terms of amount of publishing, a
a criterion for granting of tenure, stating tha
universities are interested in "productive
scholars; then 1 is no tenure on potential."
Tenure Pressure
He pointed out that salary and publishing
may be combined as a source of pressure on
the teacher without tenure. While tenure at
Stanford protects the teacher from "discrimi
natory reduction of salary" in effect for .as
long as the individual desires, lack of tenure
exposes the teacher to contract non-renewal
at the end of a definite period.
Also, conferral of tenure generally carrier
with it an increase in salary, and the univer
sity need only demand a degree of publishing
for tenure to place the junior faculty member
in a vise. , v " /0

that there exist too many cases of professors

He stated that tenure is seen by the junior

Tenure Fault
Smythe pointed out what he considers pos
sibly the worst effect of tenure, both on the
individual teacher and the educative process,
i.e., that in a large University emphasizing the
research and scholarly competence necessary
for large-scale graduate work, the status of
tenure need not have any relations to teaching
ability and quality.
Conversation with Gaines Post, Western
Civilization instructor, corroborated the gen

orally held view that there exists a tremen
dous degree of pressure on the un-tenured fac
ulty member to publish. Post agreed that there
is a definite over-emphasis on publishing, par
ticularly in terms of amount of publishing, a
a criterion for granting of tenure, stating tha
universities are interested in "productive
scholars; then 1 is no tenure on potential."
Tenure Pressure
He pointed out that salary and publishing
may be combined as a source of pressure on
the teacher without tenure. While tenure at
Stanford protects the teacher from "discrimi
natory reduction of salary" in effect for .as
long as the individual desires, lack of tenure
exposes the teacher to contract non-renewal
at the end of a definite period.

The above is taken from the Statement of
Pblicy on Appointment and Tenure at Stanford
University passed yesterday by the Academic
Council.
The statement is the product of over two
years of research by the Executive Committee
during which time several months were de
voted specifically to a study of tenure practices
in the University. Copies of the tentative pro
posal were circulated to members of the Aca
demic Council on May 17, and the final deci
sion was reached yesterday.
Academic Secretary H. Donald Winbigler
said that the new statement is designed to for
malize and regularize "practice which has
been followed informally for years." The pro
posal establishes a uniform policy for the en
tire University, eliminating a number of dis
crepancies previously existing between depart
ments and schooLs.
Winbigler explained the process by which

an individual receives tenure. The recommen
dation is initiated within the particular de
partment or school. From there it goes to the
Advisory Board for consideration.
The Advisory Board, headed by Professor
Leornard Schiff, is comprised of seven full
professors elected from the faculty. After re
view by this committee, a report, in conjunc
tion with a separately prepared report from
the University President, is submitted to the
Board of Trustees for final action.
Tenure may also accrue to the individual
teacher by virtue of the extent of his service
in the University. The new policy statement
says that "any appointment, promotion, or re
appointment . . . which extends the individ
ual's length of full time academic service at
Stanford . . . beyond seven years shall confer
tenure."
Tenure Theory
When asked about the theory behind and
reasons for tenure, Winbigler said that some
appointment policy in the University is "un
avoidable." As soon as a determination is
made between the permanent or transitory
nature of appointments, a tenure policy has
automatically been established.
As to consequences of a tenure policy, Win
bigler stated that conferral of tenure gives

the individual a feeling of security in his ap
pointment, and also that academic freedom is
preserved by removing the threat of reprisals
for espousal of controversial views.
By stating that tenure Ls designed to pro
duce the most competent and desirable facul
ty, Winbigler implied a third reason for ten
ure. Under this program, the junior faculty
member must demonstrate competence to his
superiors through teaching, research, and par
ticipation in the University community. The
system allows for a "careful and systematic
review of individual qualifications" to deter
mine whether or not a permanent appointment
is desirable.
Tenure Effects
When asked whether tenure appreciably af
fected the professor's degree of freedom or
quality of work, he stated that the faculty
members given tenure at Stanford "have inner
drives to academic achievement making them
work hard at their profession." Although he
allowed that exceptions could exist in individ
ual cases, he stated that tenure is generally ir
relevant to this drive.

in the University. The new policy statement
says that "any appointment, promotion, or re
appointment . . . which extends the individ
ual's length of full time academic service at
Stanford . . . beyond seven years shall confer
tenure."
Tenure Theory
When asked about the theory behind and
reasons for tenure, Winbigler said that some
appointment policy in the University is "un
avoidable." As soon as a determination is
made between the permanent or transitory
nature of appointments, a tenure policy has
automatically been established.
As to consequences of a tenure policy, Win
bigler stated that conferral of tenure gives

the individual a feeling of security in his ap
pointment, and also that academic freedom is
preserved by removing the threat of reprisals
for espousal of controversial views.
By stating that tenure Ls designed to pro
duce the most competent and desirable facul
ty, Winbigler implied a third reason for ten
ure. Under this program, the junior faculty
member must demonstrate competence to his
superiors through teaching, research, and par
ticipation in the University community. The
system allows for a "careful and systematic
review of individual qualifications" to deter
mine whether or not a permanent appointment
is desirable.
Tenure Effects
When asked whether tenure appreciably af
fected the professor's degree of freedom or
quality of work, he stated that the faculty
members given tenure at Stanford "have inner
drives to academic achievement making them
work hard at their profession." Although he
allowed that exceptions could exist in individ
ual cases, he stated that tenure is generally ir
relevant to this drive.
In an attempt to learn how the other, i.e.,
un-tenured, half views the tenure situation,
The Daily spoke with two members of the
"lower" teaching orders.

Robert Smythe, a grad student teaching in
the Statistics Department, stated that the need
to publish, to "shine up the academic creden
tials," can easily cut down on the time al
lowed for participation in other areas of the
University.
He expressed the hope that tenure would re
lieve the pressure to publish and allow more
time to devote to actual teaching, but feared
that there exist too many cases of professors
receiving tenure and then slacking off.
He stated that tenure is seen by the junior
faculty member as a "vote of confidence" by
the University. He also cited another poten
tially beneficial effect of tenure conferral—
the end of pressure to publish "just any
thing." He said, "An awful lot of trash gets
published because of this pressure."
Tenure Fault
Smythe pointed out what he considers pos
sibly the worst effect of tenure, both on the
individual teacher and the educative process,
i.e., that in a large University emphasizing the
research and scholarly competence necessary
for large-scale graduate work, the status of
tenure need not have any relations to teaching
ability and quality.
Conversation with Gaines Post, Western
Civilization instructor, corroborated the gen

orally held view that there exists a tremen
dous degree of pressure on the un-tenured fac
ulty member to publish. Post agreed that there
is a definite over-emphasis on publishing, par
ticularly in terms of amount of publishing, a
a criterion for granting of tenure, stating tha
universities are interested in "productive
scholars; then 1 is no tenure on potential."
Tenure Pressure
He pointed out that salary and publishing
may be combined as a source of pressure on
the teacher without tenure. While tenure at
Stanford protects the teacher from "discrimi
natory reduction of salary" in effect for .as
long as the individual desires, lack of tenure
exposes the teacher to contract non-renewal
at the end of a definite period.
Also, conferral of tenure generally carrier
with it an increase in salary, and the univer
sity need only demand a degree of publishing
for tenure to place the junior faculty member

the demand for publishing before granting of

Council.
The statement is the product of over two
years of research by the Executive Committee

in the University. Copies of the tentative pro

demic Council on May 17, and the final deci
sion was reached yesterday.
Academic Secretary H. Donald Winbigler
said that the new statement is designed to for
malize and regularize "practice which has
been followed informally for years." The pro
posal establishes a uniform policy for the en
tire University, eliminating a number of dis
crepancies previously existing between depart
ments and schooLs.
Winbigler explained the process by which

an individual receives tenure. The recommen
dation is initiated within the particular de
partment or school. From there it goes to the
Advisory Board for consideration.
The Advisory Board, headed by Professor
Leornard Schiff, is comprised of seven full
professors elected from the faculty. After re
view by this committee, a report, in conjunc

the University President, is submitted to the
