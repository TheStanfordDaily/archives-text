# Professors View Arab-Israeli Crisis
## 
### ROGER LaBRUCHERIE 
jj~.lt seems that the only points
lon which various experts of the
"Arab-Israel crisis express unani
!rhous agreement are that the
ftituation is highly complicated
iand impossible to predict. The
faily has contacted several peo
ple knowledgeable in Middle
'Eastern affairs for their views
ion the causes and implications
'Of the recent developments.
[* These developments, in brief,
4re that President Nasser of the
(inited Arab Republic (U.A.R.)
ftas reoccupied with Egyptian
jorces those regions previously
'patrolled by the United Nations
Emergency Force (UNEF), and
reinstituted a blockade of the
iGulf of Aqaba.
Shades of 1956
I These moves essentially re
turn the Arabs to the position
!they held prior to the Arab-Is
;raeli War of 1956.
' The Arabs claim sovereignty
fover the three-mile wide straits

which lead to the Gulf (the en
tire western shore of the Gulf
is Egyptian soil), and that the
blockade is a legitimate instru
ment of war—the war begun in
1956 and never officially termi
nated by treaty.
The United States, however,
has taken the position that these
straits and the Gulf itself are
international waters. This stand
was first taken in 1957 when the
Western powers were pressur
ing the Israelis to withdraw
from the positions along the
Gulf which they had wrested
from the Egyptians in the Arab-
Israeli War.
Longer Range Factors
While the present crisis has
emphasized Egyptian moves,
Professor Christina Harris of
the Political Science Department
stresses the longer range fac
tors, and especially those actions
by the Israelis, which have led
up to the present situation.
In the first place, she points

out, the Arabs consider Israel
an illegal state because it was
created from the partition of
Palestine—a partition to which
the majority of Palestinians ob
jected—by U.N. resolution.
Another source of irritation
was the unilateral diversion of
water from the Jordan basin to
Israel in 1963; such a diversion
requires by international law
the consent of all nations within
the basin (Syria, Lebanon, Jor
dan, Israel), but the Israelis
failed to receive this consent.
Further, this diversion has
threatened the existence of hun
dreds of thousands of refugees
living along the Jordan in Arab
territory.
Terrorist Raids
Professor Harris points out
that these irritations and long
standing grievances help explain
the terrorist raids which have
been launched against Israel
from Syria and Jordan. The ter
rorist raids have been answered

by Israel with full-fledged mili
tary reprisals against these two
states.
Professor Harris sees in these
evpnts a similar pattern to that
which occurred prior to 1956.
She points out that Nasser may
be foreseeing the same result,
i.e., an Israeli invasion. If this
is the case, than Nasser's actions
can be seen as preparation for
that eventuality.
Blockade
Under Professor Harris's hy
pothesis, the blockade would
serve the primary function of
severing Israel's oil supply route
(from Iran), and the UNEF
withdrawal would prevent any
U.N. deaths on Egyptian soil
should the Israelis invade.
Professor Harris also points
out that Israel is close to
achieving a nuclear capability
(with French assistance), and
that the Arabs may feel that if
a war is inevitable, it had best
be fought now. She also points
out that Israel's swelling popu
lation is land-hungry and that
an expansionist policy is a very
real possibility for Israel.
While she feels that Nasser
will not take further steps—he
has stated several times that he
will not start a War—Professor
Harris feete'- that' Nasser has
taken a stand which he is will
ing to maintain toy force, and
that the United States must
"think twice about aiding Israel
should a conflict develop. 1 "
The Soviet .UniQn has taken a
stand in support of Nasser, and
Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jor
dan, Lebanon, and Algeria have
at this point pledged to come to
Nasser's aid in the event of a
war.
Dr. Rentz
Dr. George Rentz, curator of
the Middle Eastern collection at
the Hoover Institution, agrees
that Nasser is not bluffing in
the stand he has taken, and that
the situation is a dangerous one
for the United States.
Dr. Rentz returned last month
from a trip to the Middle East,
and it is his opinion that the
situation has developed quite
suddenly, that there was then
no indication of serious trouble
in the offing.
While he agrees that the
Arabs may be fearful of an Is
raeli invasion, he also points out
that Nasser's prestige in the
Arab world might have been a
consideration in the reoccupa
tion of the Sinai Peninsula. Nas
ser has been under heavy criti
cism from Jordan and Saudi
Arabia, especially, for "hiding
behind the U.N.," and for failing
to control the Gulf of Aqaba.
The move may also be aimed
at taking Israeli pressure off
Syria, with whom the Egyptians
have a joint defense agreement.
No Backing Out
But, Dr. Rentz points out, this
is not to say that Nasser would
not back his stand, if only be
cause "such situations are hard
to back out of once they reach
a certain point."

Besides, Nasser's military ca
pability has been considerably
improved since 1956, and he may
feel that Israel is considerably
weaker without the French
military assistance she was re
ceiving in 1956.
Nonetheless, Dr. Rentz feels
Nasser does not want war, par
ticularly now when a sizeable
portion of his army is in Yemen
fighting the Royalists. He points
out that Egypt is only returning
to the status quo that existed
prior to the 1956 conflict, and
that the U.N. troops had been
there only with Nasser's permis
sion.
U. S. Position
The U.S.'s position is especial
ly serious because relations with
the Arab world have been espe
cially good of late, comments
Dr. Rentz. "But if the U.S. sided
with Israel in a conflict, Arab
unity and hatred of Israel is so
great that practically the whole
Arab world would be turned
against us."
Dr. Ole Holsti, Assistant Di
rector of International Studies
in Conflict and Integration,
agrees that the situation is one
from which Nasser will have
difficulty in backing down, and
emphasizes the immeasurably
greater danger extant because
of the UNEF withdrawal. This
makes the danger of conflict
through misstep or miscalcula
tion especially great, and gives
the conflict a potential beyond
that of the intents of either side.
Fairly Apprehensive
Dr. Holsti is "fairly apprehen
sive" about the situation, par
ticularly because it will now be
very difficult to get the U.N.
back in.
Professor Murray Roston, an
Israeli citizen and visiting Asso
ciate Professor of English be
lieves that this move by Nasser
is another round of continually
escalating assertions of leader
ship by Arab leaders.
He feels that the demand to
pull the UNEF out was a bluff
which Nasser never expected to
be acted on, and that U Thant
made a drastic mistake in ac
quiescing. The result, says Ros
ton, is that Nasser has been
handed a strong card with which
to bargain.
He feels that a strong stand
by the United States will cause
Nasser to back down.
Not So Optimistic
The others interviewed were
not so optimistic. Professor
Harris, for one, feels that the
Arabs have a case and that the
United States should bring pres
sure on Israel to acquiesce in
the blockade at least until the
crisis atmosphere dissipates. Dr.
Holsti and Dr. Rentz see at the
very least the need for caution,
and feel that the U.S. should
seek to avoid a unilateral stand
which could draw the nation
deeper and deeper into the con
flict, costing us greatly with the
Arab world and raising the pos
sibility of confrontation with the
Soviet Union.
