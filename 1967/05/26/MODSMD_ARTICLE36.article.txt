# SES Hears Living Proposals
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
"I present a very radical view,"
said sophomore Bill Goldie yes
terday in the second day of
open hearings before the Resi
dence Policies Committee of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES).
Gpldie went on: "My goals
are to increase awareness, to
increase social interaction, to
shatter mental constructs . . .
and to build up new, larger
minds." He criticized present
residence policy for promoting
forced social interaction, mak
ing for the formation of cli
ques, perpetuating sexual psy
schosis and forcing a system
of role fulfillment.
"I oppose," he said, "small
standard minds, the perpetua
tion of sexual frustrations, ed
ucation as a goal in itself and
social prejudice," all of which,
he claimed, are the results of
Stanford's residence system.
Goldie, who lived off campus
this year and plans to join
an eating club, proposed that
freshmen should live together.
He said dormitories should de
velop a community atmosphere.
"Stanford is not a community,"
he said, "but a collection of
feuding factors" where living
groups vie in subtle feuds with
each other."
Optional Seminars
Burbank faculty resident
Douglas Wilde, who also spoke
yesterday to the committee, pro
posed that the five-unit semi
nars to be offered in the coed
integrated houses next year have
more variety and not be requir
ed. He added a problem may
arise in getting leaders for such
seminars in the houses. "The
bottleneck may be faculty par
ticipation rather than student
interest."

To solve this problem, Wilde
suggested that faculty who
teach these classes receive teach
ing credit from their depart
ments, some relief from com
mittee assignments and some
credit when a promotion might
be considered.
Wilde also spoke of the need
to improve the physical aspects
of dormitories, emphasizing the
cost per student would be small
for great improvements. He
added that policy control for
house improvement should be
with the residents of the house.
"This money is being spent now
anyway," he said, "and on things
students usually don't want."
class independent men's houses.
Provide Options
Freshman Susan Ott told the
committee she felt "the most
important thing the University
should try to do is provide
choice." All existing types of
housing should stay on campus,
she said, pointing out, however,
that many more students want
to live in demonstration houses
and on-campus apartments than
will be able to.
She said freshmen should live
together for at least one quar
ter and then be able to move
into an integrated dorm, if this
would be possible. She empha
sized the desirability of forming
lasting relationships with one's
classmates.
Karen Hayes, a junior, also
felt, dorms should be kept but
should be greatly improved.
"There is no reason," she said,
"why students have to live in
something of lesser quality
than a motel." She suggested
that the demonstration houses
be smaller and that the academ
ic programs not be required.
This would be fairer, she said,
to engineering and science stu-

dents, whose programs don't
have room for added seminars
in the humanities.
No New Dorms
At Wednesday's committee
hearing, sophomore John Mun
ger of Phi Sigma Kappa frater
nity made a plea for small liv
ing groups with as much variety
as possible and the authority
to set their own standards and
regulations. No new dorms
should be formed, he said, but
Stern and Wilbur should be re
modeled to give them a warmer
atmosphere, three and four-man
rooms and even greater coed fa
cilities than those planned for
next year.
Munger suggested that the
University set up a permanent
organization to help students
find the kind of housing that
suits them. He also proposed
that land be leased to private
contractors to build apartment
buildings on campus.
Gil Toland, a third-year medi
cal student, talked about why
students should make the extra
investment to attend school
away from home. He stressed
the unique and essential experi
ence of living groups, of living
in a society to which one is
committed for more than one
year — for example, fraternities.
He said this commitment could
be developed without the fra
ternity rush system.
Freshman David Pugh said a
system like rush promotes im
mature selectivity rather than
mature selectivity in which one
challenges one's own categories.
Dick Edmonds, president of
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity,
defended the selective system.
He said fraternities come clos
est to fulfilling the residence
goals outlined in the ASSU
Housing Report.

Gil Toland, a third-year medi

students should make the extra
investment to attend school
away from home. He stressed
the unique and essential experi

in a society to which one is
committed for more than one
year — for example, fraternities.
He said this commitment could
be developed without the fra
ternity rush system.
Freshman David Pugh said a
system like rush promotes im
mature selectivity rather than
mature selectivity in which one
challenges one's own categories.

Gpldie went on: "My goals
are to increase awareness, to

minds." He criticized present
residence policy for promoting
forced social interaction, mak

schosis and forcing a system

"I oppose," he said, "small
standard minds, the perpetua
tion of sexual frustrations, ed
ucation as a goal in itself and
social prejudice," all of which,
he claimed, are the results of
Stanford's residence system.
Goldie, who lived off campus
this year and plans to join
an eating club, proposed that
freshmen should live together.
He said dormitories should de
velop a community atmosphere.
"Stanford is not a community,"
he said, "but a collection of
feuding factors" where living
groups vie in subtle feuds with
each other."

Burbank faculty resident
Douglas Wilde, who also spoke
yesterday to the committee, pro
posed that the five-unit semi
nars to be offered in the coed
integrated houses next year have
more variety and not be requir
ed. He added a problem may
arise in getting leaders for such
seminars in the houses. "The
bottleneck may be faculty par

interest."

To solve this problem, Wilde
suggested that faculty who
teach these classes receive teach
ing credit from their depart
ments, some relief from com
mittee assignments and some
credit when a promotion might
be considered.
Wilde also spoke of the need
to improve the physical aspects
of dormitories, emphasizing the

added that policy control for
house improvement should be
with the residents of the house.

Freshman Susan Ott told the
committee she felt "the most
important thing the University
should try to do is provide
choice." All existing types of
housing should stay on campus,
she said, pointing out, however,
that many more students want
to live in demonstration houses
and on-campus apartments than
will be able to.
She said freshmen should live
together for at least one quar
ter and then be able to move
into an integrated dorm, if this
would be possible. She empha
sized the desirability of forming
lasting relationships with one's
classmates.
Karen Hayes, a junior, also
felt, dorms should be kept but
should be greatly improved.
"There is no reason," she said,
"why students have to live in
something of lesser quality
than a motel." She suggested
that the demonstration houses
be smaller and that the academ
ic programs not be required.

than a motel." She suggested
that the demonstration houses
be smaller and that the academ
ic programs not be required.
This would be fairer, she said,
to engineering and science stu-

dents, whose programs don't
have room for added seminars
in the humanities.
No New Dorms
At Wednesday's committee
hearing, sophomore John Mun
ger of Phi Sigma Kappa frater
nity made a plea for small liv
ing groups with as much variety
as possible and the authority
to set their own standards and
regulations. No new dorms
should be formed, he said, but
Stern and Wilbur should be re
modeled to give them a warmer
atmosphere, three and four-man
rooms and even greater coed fa
cilities than those planned for
next year.
Munger suggested that the
University set up a permanent
organization to help students
find the kind of housing that
suits them. He also proposed
that land be leased to private
contractors to build apartment
buildings on campus.
Gil Toland, a third-year medi
cal student, talked about why
students should make the extra
investment to attend school
away from home. He stressed
the unique and essential experi
ence of living groups, of living
in a society to which one is
committed for more than one
year — for example, fraternities.
He said this commitment could
be developed without the fra
ternity rush system.
Freshman David Pugh said a
system like rush promotes im
mature selectivity rather than
mature selectivity in which one
challenges one's own categories.
Dick Edmonds, president of
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity,
defended the selective system.
He said fraternities come clos
est to fulfilling the residence
goals outlined in the ASSU
Housing Report.
