## Victims Of 'The Delusion Of Reprieve' 
### 
Jditor, The Daily:
Bruno Bettelheim in The In
formed Heart describes the re
union of German Jews to Nazi
otalitarianism—from exclusion
rom the civil service, through
separation from the rest of the
population, to attacks by Storm
Troopers and organized pog
roms, and later deportation, con
centration, and, ultimately, ex
termination in the death camps.
At each stage, there was little
resistance, largely due to a fail
're to realize that a catastrophe
vvas approaching.
Bettelheim ascribes this out
look to a "business as usual" at
titude at a time "when a world
goes to pieces, when inhumani
ty reigns supreme . . "The
persecution of the Jews wor
sened, slow step by slow step,
when no violent resistance oc
curred. It may have been the
Jewish acceptance, without
fight, of ever harsher discrimi
nation and degradation that first
Save the SS the idea that they
could be gotten to the point
/here they would walk to the
gas chambers on their own."
Inertia during the 1930's was

the first step to death: "Thus in
the deepest sense the walk to
the gas chamber was only the
last consequence of a philosophy
of business as usual . . ."
As the Vietnam war has esca
lated step by step, no adequate
resistance has been made; nor
has any seemed possible. Rather
than take action, many of us
have been too easily victimized
by the "delusion of reprieve",
clinging to hope, the worst of
the evils which flew from Pan
dora's box, the one that makes
the others bearable.
And what is the new reality?
A strange and frightening amal
gam of arrogance, greed, para
noia, and megalomania has af
flicted this nation. U.S. govern
ment officials have become ex
perts at "doublethink" and
"duckspeak"; for South Viet
nam, 1984 has come seventeen
years too soon. Death points his
forefinger northward, and
laughs hollowly as the President
tells his daughter, "Your daddy
may have started World War
III." Thruston Morton warns of
a "total world holocaust", and
rumors of an invasion of the

North (followed by war with
China and perhaps even by con
centration camps in the U.S.)
are rampant. One wonders about
the declaration of war — will
it be against the whole world?
It seems that Death is winning
the human race.

Three years ago, when I was
taking my first course in philos
ophy, the professor described
moral philosophy as the syste
matic raising and answering of
questions about how we should
act in certain situations before
these situations arise. It was an
introductory course and thus the
characterization was perhaps
not rigorous or complete. Also,
I was pretty young and hadn't
had to face much. Therefore I
was unappreciative.
Whether or not the character
ization has anything to do with
what moral philosophers are do
ing is not important. Whatever
you call the process its impor
tance has become clear to me.

However, if by now I have be
come more appreciative it is at
the cost of a pessimism about
the ability and willingness of
people to confront issues before
they are forced to do so.
I am writing because in the
past week something beautiful
has begun to happen. A large
number of freshmen in my
house are beginning to serious
ly consider and agonize over
the problems and responsibility
that confront every American in
the face of a cruel, immoral
war. They have organized a
group to gather materials on
Vietnam, to learn and talk, and
to examine ways of doing anti
war work this summer. Also,
last night 16 freshmen made
their first public commitment
by signing a we-won't-go state
ment which is appearing in The
Daily today.
I know this doesn't seem so
much, and, of course, more radi
cal and widespread action is
needed. However one thing
about it strikes me as important.
The illusion that the war isn't
a vital concern to people who
have some grounds for believ
ing that they can count on threo

years of deferment if they
choose, has been broken. Per
haps if enough of us confront
issues and act on our convic
tions the series of events that
we abhor can be reversed.
Eighteen year olds are too young
for war, but not for peace.

Editor, The Dally:
There are four assumptions
in Mssrs. Roston's and Solo
mon's letter (Letters to the Edi
tor, Daily, May 25, 1967) which
we would like to remark about.
1) That Israel "desires peace
ful coexistence" with Arab
states: The U.N. records reveal
that since the 1949 Armistice
Agreement, Israel has been "re
buked", "condemned" or "cen
sured" for military aggression
on the Arab states on eleven oc
casions: Five by the Security
Council and Six by the General
Assembly. No Arab state has
ever been condemned by any
organ of the U.N. for military
attacks upon Israel.
2) "That Arabs within Israel
possess full citizen rights equal
to those of the Jews." A mere
reading of Laws of the State of
Israel; Israel Government Year
book (5275); and Statistical Ab
stract of Israel 1965 (all official
publications of the Government
of Israel) reveals the pathetic
degree of discrimination against
Arab students on the primary,
secondary and university levels.
Just for example, we might
mention that of six institutions
of higher learning, only one, the
Hebrew University, admits Arab
students. During 1963-64, of 9266
students in that University, only
135 were Arabs.
3) As for technical aid, we all
know that Israel cannot even
survive without aid given to it.
But we might add, however, that
this "aid" argument is as old
and concomittant with all forms
of colonialism and neo-colonial
ism.
4) As for territorial integrity,
may we remind Mssrs. Roston
and Solomon that in so arguing
they forget a) that the Strait of
Tiran was captured by force
during Israel's, Britain's and
France's tripartite invasion of
Egypt in 1956; b) to go still
further back, they seem to for
get that the whole "state" of
Israel was carved out of Arab
land and by force.

There are four assumptions
in Mssrs. Roston's and Solo
mon's letter (Letters to the Edi
tor, Daily, May 25, 1967) which
we would like to remark about.
1) That Israel "desires peace
ful coexistence" with Arab
states: The U.N. records reveal
that since the 1949 Armistice
Agreement, Israel has been "re
buked", "condemned" or "cen
sured" for military aggression
on the Arab states on eleven oc
casions: Five by the Security
Council and Six by the General
Assembly. No Arab state has
ever been condemned by any
organ of the U.N. for military
attacks upon Israel.
2) "That Arabs within Israel
possess full citizen rights equal
to those of the Jews." A mere
reading of Laws of the State of
Israel; Israel Government Year
book (5275); and Statistical Ab
stract of Israel 1965 (all official
publications of the Government
of Israel) reveals the pathetic
degree of discrimination against
Arab students on the primary,
secondary and university levels.
Just for example, we might
mention that of six institutions
of higher learning, only one, the
Hebrew University, admits Arab
students. During 1963-64, of 9266
students in that University, only
135 were Arabs.
3) As for technical aid, we all
know that Israel cannot even
survive without aid given to it.
But we might add, however, that
this "aid" argument is as old
and concomittant with all forms
of colonialism and neo-colonial
ism.
4) As for territorial integrity,
may we remind Mssrs. Roston
and Solomon that in so arguing
they forget a) that the Strait of
Tiran was captured by force
during Israel's, Britain's and
France's tripartite invasion of
Egypt in 1956; b) to go still
further back, they seem to for
get that the whole "state" of
Israel was carved out of Arab
land and by force.

Bruno Bettelheim in The In

union of German Jews to Nazi
otalitarianism—from exclusion
rom the civil service, through
separation from the rest of the
population, to attacks by Storm
Troopers and organized pog
roms, and later deportation, con
centration, and, ultimately, ex
termination in the death camps.
At each stage, there was little
resistance, largely due to a fail
're to realize that a catastrophe
vvas approaching.
Bettelheim ascribes this out
look to a "business as usual" at
titude at a time "when a world
goes to pieces, when inhumani
ty reigns supreme . . "The
persecution of the Jews wor
sened, slow step by slow step,
when no violent resistance oc
curred. It may have been the
Jewish acceptance, without
fight, of ever harsher discrimi
nation and degradation that first
Save the SS the idea that they
could be gotten to the point

gas chambers on their own."
Inertia during the 1930's was

the first step to death: "Thus in
the deepest sense the walk to
the gas chamber was only the
last consequence of a philosophy
of business as usual . . ."
As the Vietnam war has esca
lated step by step, no adequate
resistance has been made; nor
has any seemed possible. Rather
than take action, many of us
have been too easily victimized
by the "delusion of reprieve",
clinging to hope, the worst of
the evils which flew from Pan
dora's box, the one that makes
the others bearable.
And what is the new reality?
A strange and frightening amal
gam of arrogance, greed, para
noia, and megalomania has af
flicted this nation. U.S. govern
ment officials have become ex
perts at "doublethink" and
"duckspeak"; for South Viet
nam, 1984 has come seventeen
years too soon. Death points his
forefinger northward, and
laughs hollowly as the President
tells his daughter, "Your daddy
may have started World War
III." Thruston Morton warns of
a "total world holocaust", and
rumors of an invasion of the

North (followed by war with
China and perhaps even by con
centration camps in the U.S.)

the declaration of war — will
it be against the whole world?
It seems that Death is winning

Three years ago, when I was
taking my first course in philos
ophy, the professor described
moral philosophy as the syste
matic raising and answering of
questions about how we should
act in certain situations before
these situations arise. It was an
introductory course and thus the
characterization was perhaps
not rigorous or complete. Also,
I was pretty young and hadn't
had to face much. Therefore I
was unappreciative.
Whether or not the character
ization has anything to do with
what moral philosophers are do
ing is not important. Whatever
you call the process its impor
tance has become clear to me.

However, if by now I have be
come more appreciative it is at
the cost of a pessimism about
the ability and willingness of
people to confront issues before
they are forced to do so.
I am writing because in the
past week something beautiful
has begun to happen. A large
number of freshmen in my
house are beginning to serious
ly consider and agonize over
the problems and responsibility
that confront every American in
the face of a cruel, immoral
war. They have organized a
group to gather materials on
Vietnam, to learn and talk, and
to examine ways of doing anti
war work this summer. Also,
last night 16 freshmen made
their first public commitment
by signing a we-won't-go state
ment which is appearing in The
Daily today.
I know this doesn't seem so
much, and, of course, more radi
cal and widespread action is
needed. However one thing
about it strikes me as important.

Three years ago, when I was
taking my first course in philos
ophy, the professor described
moral philosophy as the syste
matic raising and answering of
questions about how we should
act in certain situations before
these situations arise. It was an
introductory course and thus the
characterization was perhaps
not rigorous or complete. Also,
I was pretty young and hadn't
had to face much. Therefore I
was unappreciative.
Whether or not the character
ization has anything to do with
what moral philosophers are do
ing is not important. Whatever
you call the process its impor
tance has become clear to me.

However, if by now I have be
come more appreciative it is at
the cost of a pessimism about
the ability and willingness of
people to confront issues before
they are forced to do so.
I am writing because in the
past week something beautiful
has begun to happen. A large
number of freshmen in my
house are beginning to serious
ly consider and agonize over
the problems and responsibility
that confront every American in
the face of a cruel, immoral
war. They have organized a
group to gather materials on
Vietnam, to learn and talk, and
to examine ways of doing anti
war work this summer. Also,
last night 16 freshmen made
their first public commitment
by signing a we-won't-go state
ment which is appearing in The
Daily today.
I know this doesn't seem so
much, and, of course, more radi
cal and widespread action is
needed. However one thing
about it strikes me as important.
The illusion that the war isn't
a vital concern to people who
have some grounds for believ
ing that they can count on threo

years of deferment if they
choose, has been broken. Per
haps if enough of us confront
issues and act on our convic
tions the series of events that
we abhor can be reversed.
Eighteen year olds are too young
for war, but not for peace.

There are four assumptions
in Mssrs. Roston's and Solo
mon's letter (Letters to the Edi
tor, Daily, May 25, 1967) which
we would like to remark about.
1) That Israel "desires peace
ful coexistence" with Arab
states: The U.N. records reveal
that since the 1949 Armistice
Agreement, Israel has been "re
buked", "condemned" or "cen
sured" for military aggression
on the Arab states on eleven oc
casions: Five by the Security
Council and Six by the General
Assembly. No Arab state has
ever been condemned by any
organ of the U.N. for military
attacks upon Israel.
2) "That Arabs within Israel
possess full citizen rights equal
to those of the Jews." A mere
reading of Laws of the State of
Israel; Israel Government Year
book (5275); and Statistical Ab
stract of Israel 1965 (all official
publications of the Government
of Israel) reveals the pathetic
degree of discrimination against
Arab students on the primary,
secondary and university levels.
Just for example, we might
mention that of six institutions
of higher learning, only one, the
Hebrew University, admits Arab
students. During 1963-64, of 9266
students in that University, only
135 were Arabs.
3) As for technical aid, we all
know that Israel cannot even
survive without aid given to it.
But we might add, however, that
this "aid" argument is as old
and concomittant with all forms
of colonialism and neo-colonial
ism.
4) As for territorial integrity,
may we remind Mssrs. Roston
and Solomon that in so arguing
they forget a) that the Strait of
Tiran was captured by force
during Israel's, Britain's and
France's tripartite invasion of
Egypt in 1956; b) to go still
further back, they seem to for
get that the whole "state" of
Israel was carved out of Arab
land and by force.

Bruno Bettelheim in The In

rom the civil service, through
separation from the rest of the
population, to attacks by Storm
Troopers and organized pog
roms, and later deportation, con
centration, and, ultimately, ex
termination in the death camps.
At each stage, there was little
resistance, largely due to a fail
're to realize that a catastrophe
vvas approaching.
Bettelheim ascribes this out
look to a "business as usual" at
titude at a time "when a world
goes to pieces, when inhumani
ty reigns supreme . . "The
persecution of the Jews wor
sened, slow step by slow step,
when no violent resistance oc
curred. It may have been the
Jewish acceptance, without

nation and degradation that first
Save the SS the idea that they

Inertia during the 1930's was

the gas chamber was only the
last consequence of a philosophy

Just for example, we might
mention that of six institutions
of higher learning, only one, the
Hebrew University, admits Arab
students. During 1963-64, of 9266
students in that University, only
135 were Arabs.
3) As for technical aid, we all
know that Israel cannot even
survive without aid given to it.
But we might add, however, that
this "aid" argument is as old
and concomittant with all forms
of colonialism and neo-colonial
ism.
4) As for territorial integrity,
may we remind Mssrs. Roston
and Solomon that in so arguing
they forget a) that the Strait of
Tiran was captured by force
during Israel's, Britain's and
France's tripartite invasion of
Egypt in 1956; b) to go still
further back, they seem to for
get that the whole "state" of
Israel was carved out of Arab
land and by force.
