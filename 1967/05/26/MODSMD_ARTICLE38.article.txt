# Two Minutes of Haight
## Create A Synthesis Of Love, Society 
### Tim Haight 
Out of the foggy reaches of
memory comes the story of
Ferdinand the bull. My mother
used to read it to me. Ferdi
nand was the bull who, when
put into the bullfight ring, sat
down and sniffed the flowers.
He wouldn't be the bull the bull
fight was supposed to have. He
blew their minds. Ferdinand was
a hippie.
Make love not war. It's more
than a slogan, or a jok& The
reason it's funny is because it
elicits that approach-avoidance
reaction that makes us laugh.
Everybody (well, almost every
body) wants to make love. If
you think that Chronicle story
about the 19-year-old hippie
girl's throwing off her clothes
to sleep with a newcomer fresh
out of Butte, Montana, didn't
titillate John Q. Bourgeois in
Burlingame, think again.
The hippies are having fun.
Turning on is fun. Making love
is fun. Discussing religion,
smelling flowers, not working
much, and lying in the park are
all fun. Groove on your finals,
Stanfordites. It's enough to
make you blow your mind. Peo
ple shouldn't be allowed to get
away with having fun like that.
"Childish pleasures! Socially
irresponsible! Ruining their
lives!" Come off it. You're prob
ably jealous. And what is the
good of being a solid, socially
responsible member of a society
like ours these days?
Not For Us!
Our society makes war, holds
the carrot of material success in
front of us but (by status
changes, planned obsolescence,
advertising, etc.) never lets us
reach it, ignores a person's right
to live where he pleases, cuts
poverty programs, spends vast
amount of valuable police time
busting homosexuals and junk

ies while crimes of violence in
crease.
In Germany, under Hitler, the
socially responsible thing to do
was to be a war criminal. Thus
spake Nuremberg. In Washing
ton last week, it was rumored
there will soon be a reduction of
the bombing in North Vietnam.
Reason: we have run out of new
targets.
In Haight-Ashbury you can
get a free meal and a place to
stay if Doctor LSD Sox doesn't
bust you. In Congress last week
a coalition of House Republi
cans and Southern Democrats
cut all future allocations for the
rent-subsidy program and sliced
back the model cities plan.
Haight-Ashbury shocks us
when the kids block the streets.
In New York two weeks ago, lo
yal Americans tarred and feath
ered a man who had the gall to
oppose the war in Vietnam. At
Texas Southern University as

series of demonstrations clashed
with police and escalated into a
pitched battle on the campus, a
rookie policeman lost his life.
Compassion And Love
Better to sniff the flowers.
Better to heal yourself, so that
you can have the strength of
compassion and love to under
stand and try to solve these
problems, rather than silently
perpetuate them.
A fortiori, the hippies in the
Haight-Ashbury are not all
flower-sniffing. They are making
it economically through a sys
tem of sharing, work, and col
lective effort. The efforts and
the results are mixed, as the
community is mixed. Recently,
pickup-hungry non-hippies have
spoiled the weekend atmosphere
by injecting a note of sexnotlove
into the scene.
Revolution Ahead
The hippies represent a revo
lution of attitudes, which, in less

extreme form, is pervading our
generation. It is more unsettling
than the New Left because it
has a siren call as well as a
critical cry. The sociology of
knowledge in our new consumer
oriented, becoming - automated,
leisure society is moving in
Haight-Ashbury's direction.
The main question is whether
that revolution will happen in
time to save us from world sui
cide. To try to make it happen
in time, we students must act.
We are marginal figures, be
tween cultures. Marginal figures
have always been agents of so
cial change.
We must create the synthesis
of hippie values and educated
methodology. We must translate
love into political programs, eco
nomic policies, diplomatic mis
sions. We must build institu
tions, from the family to the
State, that permit humans to
interact with humans in a mean
ingful, loving way.
