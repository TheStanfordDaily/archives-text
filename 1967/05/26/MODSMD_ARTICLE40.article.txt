The limitations of the term "student activist"
are equalled perhaps only by most people's mis
understanding of those who fall into that cate
gory. For many, the expression automatically
engenders visions of crowds yelling at Hubert
Humphrey or picketing the Stanford Research
Institute. Indeed, these people are activists, but
they do not by any stretch of the imagination
monopolize the label.
The best definition of activism is also the most
inclusive: An activist is a person who through
his actions demonstrates a sincere concern for a
particular cause. It does not matter what this
cause is or how he exhibits his concern.
Student activists are not a rare breed; they
exist on this and other campuses in large num
bers and not all of them wear beards or carry
signs, as our elders would have us believe. While
some speak on White Memorial Plaza every
week, others simply write columns for The Daily;
while some fight outside the University's admin
istrative structure, others work through what
some officials consider the "proper channels."
But whatever the details, they have in common
at least one quality: they are sincere.
This year has seen more student activism at
Stanford than ever before. And at the same time,
there has been a greater misunderstanding and
more abuse of activists. Their goals have been
misinterpreted and their knowledge of the issues
they are concerned with has been underesti
mated. Some people have even gone so far as to
say that activists like to cause trouble just for the
sake of it.
Admittedly, some activists are naive and do
not fully comprehend the questions they are
dealing with. Like everyone else, they make
mistakes which often reduce the credibility of
their cause. But the Establishment is fallible, too,
and cannot honestly pass off the concerns of
activists as easily as they like to. They should
not continuously make hasty judgment on the
basis of firmly molded preconceptions, and
should instead make an effort to understand
activists and the forces which motivate their

actions. Administrators, in short, must stop rely
ing on their power and arrogance and give activ
ists the credit they deserve.
Concern is the lifeblood of any university. Part
of education demands that a person go beyond
the formal structure of classroom education and
develop an interest in his environment, be it the
University, the nation, or the world. The increas
ing number of activists is encouraging, but the
growing fear and misunderstanding of activists
among those who do not agree with them is dis
quieting. A university without activists would be
a dull, stagnant place, perhaps like the apathetic
Stanford of only a few years ago.
The Daily, in its own way, has been an activist
in the last months. It has fought hard for some
causes it dearly believed in and in the process it
has, of course, made its mistakes and offended
some people. But to underestimate its motives
would be a harsh and unfair judgment on a num
ber of students who have acted with a sincerity
at least equal to that of their antagonists.
In the opening editorial of this volume, we
wrote that The Daily "must be a voice on this
campus, always ready to question, to criticize,
or to praise" and added that "we, too, feel a deep
commitment to this University." This we have
done, and we challenge anyone to demonstrate
that we have not acted with the best interests of
the University in mind. In fact, the time may
be appropriate for us to ask others to reevaluate
the sincerity of their commitment.
For the mistakes we have made and to those
we have offended, we apologize. But, above all,
we ask to be understoodâ€”where a University
administrator may have ten years in which to
effect changes with what President Sterling calls
the "gradual approach," a student has at best a
few years and a Daily volume has less than four
months.
To those who will follow, we extend the chal
lenge of continuing to uphold the principles they
believe in, for without the honest views of some
activists the University will be at a great loss.
