# Dr. Maurice Osborne

### 
In the departure of Dr. Maurice Osborne,
Stanford is the victim of an ironic consequence
of its ability to draw great men to the commun
ity. For the University suffers when those very
men it has been able to attract move on to
greener pastures elsewhere. Dr. Osborne feels
that it is best for him to return to teaching and
his profession after the inevitable process of
becoming a university administrator—and for
him we welcome this choice even though we
are the.lesser through it
It is impossible to begin to assess the contri
bution Maurice Osborne has made to Stanford.
Not only was he a prime force in the decision
to construct the Cowell Student Health Center,
but far more important, he has given what would

be just another building in the sandstone jungle
a spirit and a true friendliness of its own. He has
been able to attract an excellent staff—this is
perhaps the most reassuring fact in his de
parture.
Dr. Osborne was instrumental in the work
of the ASSU Housing Commission. His inspira
tion guided the Freshman Year Sub-committee
and the entire Commission through many dark
days.
lalented painter, author (of two prize-win
ning children's books), musician, composer, but
above all, friend, Dr. Osborne and all he brought
to Stanford will be deeply missed for years to
come.
