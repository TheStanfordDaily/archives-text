## INside Info For The Out-Crowd 
### Maggie McComas 
This is the end, almost.
But for the still-confused, a
bit of last minute myth-explod
ing (material which was turned
down by the Stanford Observer*
for anyone who has doubts that
a good time was had by all in
the last few months:
• Contrary to rumors, the "in
crowd" is out. In addition, the
"out-crowd" is still out. Only
three persons in the University
are really "in." And they are
not Robert A. Walker, John
Kaplan, and James T. Watkins.
In fact, one or two of this group
may soon really be "out".
• Stanford does not have a
discriminatory admission pol
icy. Minority groups are very
"in" these days and the admis
sions office heartily believes in
granting preferential rights to
Negroes. Several Caucasian high
school students have caught on
and have been attending their
interviews in blackface. In
formed sources say this practice
is highly frowned upon.

• The "Winds of Freodo m"
group docs not actually control
the selection of the new presi
dent. (The Daily is in charge of
presidential succession — see
"Gruberland," Daily, May 8).
"Winds" is, however, taking
over selection of the 30 fresh
men formerly hand-picked by
the president himself.
• Contrary to what Wally's
poll-takers tell him, his "apol
ogy" to HHH (and to alums and
the public at large) was well
received in very few quarters,
including the offices of other
high administrators.
• Mystery afoot: The anti
sponsor, anti-Grove movement
died a quiet death with the tem
porary hospital confinement of
one high administrator.
• John Gardner has not really
turned down the presidency
twice just because that's the
way the game is played; a friend
of the family recently revealed
that he has a severe allergy to
red tile and blue Cadillacs.

• The "Fort Worth Mother"
isn't really from Texas—she's a
faculty wife, a nice lady who
helpfully steers students away
from things like dirty pictures
in Tresidder.
• The Phi Delta Theta house
is alive and well, not up near
the Knoll, but in Menlo Park.
Just call 323-4217 and the house
manager will answer. Safety in
numbers just guess how many
have stuck together since No
vember?
• A note of encouragement to
all Fort Worth Mothers. Before
the trustees okayed the demon
stration houses, I. L. Parentis
(high administrator) told the
residence subcommittee that the
demonstration houses would
pass only with proctors (paid by
the hour?) to enforce social
regs. One faculty member of the
subcommittee bolted, but even
the students on the committee
would have accepted the stipu
lation.

• Steering Committee selec
tions weren't all that bad, al
though the bearded one has been
warned that it's all over as soon
as he shaves it off.
• YOO HOO TOW—Some peo
ple, the Internal Revenue Ser
vice included, are wondering
about your tax-exempt status,
especially when professional an
ti-communism doesn't have to be
described in the bulletin to be
advertised. Experts galore—one
influential person up there testi
fied at The Hague last year on
behalf of the South African gov
ernment as an expert on apart
heid.
That's all folks. Now that The
Daily has stopped publishing
for one year, the administration
will fly into action again (re
member the timing of the insti
tution of a faculty master and
President Sterling's retirement
announcement?). And perhaps
Young Administrators will be
cured of their verbal constipa
tion.

died a quiet death with the tem
porary hospital confinement of
one high administrator.
• John Gardner has not really
turned down the presidency
twice just because that's the
way the game is played; a friend
of the family recently revealed
that he has a severe allergy to
red tile and blue Cadillacs.

• The "Fort Worth Mother"
isn't really from Texas—she's a
faculty wife, a nice lady who
helpfully steers students away
from things like dirty pictures
in Tresidder.
• The Phi Delta Theta house
is alive and well, not up near
the Knoll, but in Menlo Park.
Just call 323-4217 and the house
manager will answer. Safety in
numbers just guess how many
have stuck together since No
vember?
• A note of encouragement to
all Fort Worth Mothers. Before
the trustees okayed the demon
stration houses, I. L. Parentis
(high administrator) told the
residence subcommittee that the
demonstration houses would
pass only with proctors (paid by
the hour?) to enforce social
regs. One faculty member of the
subcommittee bolted, but even
the students on the committee
would have accepted the stipu
lation.

• Steering Committee selec
tions weren't all that bad, al
though the bearded one has been
warned that it's all over as soon
as he shaves it off.
• YOO HOO TOW—Some peo
ple, the Internal Revenue Ser
vice included, are wondering
about your tax-exempt status,
especially when professional an
ti-communism doesn't have to be
described in the bulletin to be
advertised. Experts galore—one
influential person up there testi
fied at The Hague last year on
behalf of the South African gov
ernment as an expert on apart
heid.
That's all folks. Now that The
Daily has stopped publishing
for one year, the administration
will fly into action again (re
member the timing of the insti
tution of a faculty master and
President Sterling's retirement
announcement?). And perhaps
Young Administrators will be
cured of their verbal constipa
tion.
This is the end, almost.
But for the still-confused, a
bit of last minute myth-explod
ing (material which was turned
down by the Stanford Observer*
for anyone who has doubts that
a good time was had by all in
the last few months:
• Contrary to rumors, the "in
crowd" is out. In addition, the
"out-crowd" is still out. Only
three persons in the University
are really "in." And they are
not Robert A. Walker, John
Kaplan, and James T. Watkins.
In fact, one or two of this group
may soon really be "out".
• Stanford does not have a
discriminatory admission pol
icy. Minority groups are very
"in" these days and the admis
sions office heartily believes in
granting preferential rights to
Negroes. Several Caucasian high
school students have caught on
and have been attending their
interviews in blackface. In
formed sources say this practice
is highly frowned upon.

• The "Winds of Freodo m"
group docs not actually control
the selection of the new presi
dent. (The Daily is in charge of
presidential succession — see
"Gruberland," Daily, May 8).
"Winds" is, however, taking
over selection of the 30 fresh
men formerly hand-picked by
the president himself.
• Contrary to what Wally's
poll-takers tell him, his "apol
ogy" to HHH (and to alums and
the public at large) was well
received in very few quarters,
including the offices of other
high administrators.
• Mystery afoot: The anti
