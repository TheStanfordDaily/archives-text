## O' Imagine The Pleasure Of Peace! 
### Joel Kugelmass 
The consensus of important
America-Watchers is that be
fore the next presidential elec
tion Mr. Johnson will ask Con
gress for a Declaration of War.
If the request is granted, as is
almost certain, individuals and
groups who protest United
States offensive involvement in
Vietnam will be guilty of sedi
tion and probably prosecuted.
Some will defect, others will
continue to criticize; in the de
militarized zone of this moment,
it is opportune to speak loudly
and boldly, protected by the am
bition of a frightening comman
der in chief.
Considered internally, it is
now unthinkable that either
North Vietnam or the United
States can find an excuse to ne
gotiate a settlement. The bomb
ing will not step until the land
is barren, the Viet Cong dead.
There is little to suggest that
the United States will seek an
excuse except for the proclama
tions of a President notorious
for his "ambiguity." Thus, peace
negotiations in Vietnam will be
occasioned by some outside form
of pressure. It is conceivable
that the Middle Eastern conflict
will exert such pressure, since
clearly the Soviet Union is very
much an overseer of the United
Arab Republic; perhaps the Rus

sians will force the United
States to choose between two
wars or none, perhaps our gov
ernment will fear the loss of oil
imminent to such a conflict.
Thus, it might be willing to for
sake domination of South Viet
nam for assurances of a con
tinuing supply of oil and disen
gagement in the Middle East.
Let us, for a moment, use this
possibility, this hypothesis to re
member what, Anally, might be
best for Vietnam. Let us pretend
for an instant that we live in a
world where we can enjoy the
luxury often seized by the in
tellectual to think upon the
good, rather than the merely
"not bad." Let us think of the
Vietnamese.
Image Of Peace
If we try to image the politi
cal structure which would cor
relate the productive capacities
of Vietnam, which would em
brace the divergent levels of
education the people possess,
and which would end the op
pression of a rich, self-interested
upper class dedicated to its own
preservation, we must think of
the National Liberation Front.
The National Liberation Front,
as a whole, is the only political
class which has fought the to
talitarian Diem and which now
fights Ky. General Ky, who

joined the French against his
own people, establishes a gov
ernment whose fascism is mere
ly transparent lined against the
chaos of war. This Vichy of the
South, who praises Hitler and
the United States in the same
breadth, should not have the
right to lose an election, though
let us hope that the world of
Vietnam will grant him the ig
nominy that his political defeat
would entail.
Let us have the pleasure of
imagining that the embittered
anti-American sentiment among
the South Vietnamese, sentiment
reported frequently now by in
dividuals free of mass-media de
mands, will turn to constructive
support of those individuals
whose biography suggests their
allegiance to the people. Neither
the United States leaders here
or there, nor the governments
of the South nurtured by those
leaders can evidence such a
biography. Let us therefore
hope that the NLF can aspire
to a political victory, freed from
the ideological camp bent on
their execution.
If, indeed as I suspect, this
country is positioning itself for
a larger war, a war potential in
the base called South Vietnam, a
war implicit in the calculations
of the government, we must

shift our attention. We must
then become afraid for our
selves.
Love Enough To Resist
Let us, in that eventuality, de
sert our fear in favor of resist
ance. Perhaps then we can love
our country enough to resist our
government. Let us answer its
quest for war with our quest
for peace, its egoism with our
pride, its lies with our truths.
Let us demand that it under
stands than its commitments
are not ours, that its hatreds
are not ours, that perhaps it is
no longer us.
In those times we shall espe
cially cherish the University, for
it shall bring us together, keep
our concerns human concerns,
inform our knowledge with wis
dom, and give us succor when
we may require it.
There will be those and there
are those, conquered by fears of
Communism, of Aggression
from the North, of Oriental
races, who would accuse in their
own self-defense, who would
build walls in Laos so that the
Berliners may jeer, who would
die rather than let others live.
With those we shall come into
conflict. But they shall be, at
least, Americans, and we shall
face them as Americans.
Let there be peace.

allegiance to the people. Neither
the United States leaders here
or there, nor the governments
of the South nurtured by those
leaders can evidence such a
biography. Let us therefore
hope that the NLF can aspire
to a political victory, freed from
the ideological camp bent on
their execution.
If, indeed as I suspect, this
country is positioning itself for
a larger war, a war potential in
the base called South Vietnam, a
war implicit in the calculations
of the government, we must

shift our attention. We must
then become afraid for our
selves.
Love Enough To Resist
Let us, in that eventuality, de
sert our fear in favor of resist
ance. Perhaps then we can love
our country enough to resist our
government. Let us answer its
quest for war with our quest
for peace, its egoism with our
pride, its lies with our truths.
Let us demand that it under
stands than its commitments
are not ours, that its hatreds
are not ours, that perhaps it is
no longer us.
In those times we shall espe
cially cherish the University, for
it shall bring us together, keep
our concerns human concerns,
inform our knowledge with wis
dom, and give us succor when
we may require it.
There will be those and there
are those, conquered by fears of
Communism, of Aggression
from the North, of Oriental
races, who would accuse in their
own self-defense, who would
build walls in Laos so that the
Berliners may jeer, who would
die rather than let others live.
With those we shall come into
conflict. But they shall be, at
least, Americans, and we shall
face them as Americans.
Let there be peace.
The consensus of important
America-Watchers is that be
fore the next presidential elec
tion Mr. Johnson will ask Con
gress for a Declaration of War.
If the request is granted, as is
almost certain, individuals and
groups who protest United
States offensive involvement in
Vietnam will be guilty of sedi
tion and probably prosecuted.
Some will defect, others will
continue to criticize; in the de
militarized zone of this moment,
it is opportune to speak loudly
and boldly, protected by the am
bition of a frightening comman
der in chief.
Considered internally, it is
now unthinkable that either
North Vietnam or the United
States can find an excuse to ne
gotiate a settlement. The bomb
ing will not step until the land
is barren, the Viet Cong dead.
There is little to suggest that
the United States will seek an
excuse except for the proclama
tions of a President notorious
for his "ambiguity." Thus, peace
negotiations in Vietnam will be
occasioned by some outside form
of pressure. It is conceivable
that the Middle Eastern conflict
will exert such pressure, since
clearly the Soviet Union is very
much an overseer of the United
Arab Republic; perhaps the Rus

sians will force the United
States to choose between two
wars or none, perhaps our gov
ernment will fear the loss of oil
imminent to such a conflict.
Thus, it might be willing to for
sake domination of South Viet
nam for assurances of a con
tinuing supply of oil and disen
gagement in the Middle East.
Let us, for a moment, use this
possibility, this hypothesis to re
member what, Anally, might be
best for Vietnam. Let us pretend
for an instant that we live in a
world where we can enjoy the
luxury often seized by the in
tellectual to think upon the
good, rather than the merely
"not bad." Let us think of the
Vietnamese.
Image Of Peace
If we try to image the politi
cal structure which would cor
relate the productive capacities
of Vietnam, which would em
brace the divergent levels of
education the people possess,
and which would end the op
pression of a rich, self-interested
upper class dedicated to its own
preservation, we must think of
the National Liberation Front.
The National Liberation Front,
as a whole, is the only political
class which has fought the to
talitarian Diem and which now
fights Ky. General Ky, who

joined the French against his
own people, establishes a gov
ernment whose fascism is mere
ly transparent lined against the
chaos of war. This Vichy of the
South, who praises Hitler and
the United States in the same
breadth, should not have the
right to lose an election, though
let us hope that the world of
Vietnam will grant him the ig
nominy that his political defeat
would entail.
Let us have the pleasure of
imagining that the embittered
anti-American sentiment among
the South Vietnamese, sentiment
reported frequently now by in
dividuals free of mass-media de
mands, will turn to constructive
support of those individuals
whose biography suggests their
allegiance to the people. Neither
the United States leaders here

nam for assurances of a con
tinuing supply of oil and disen
gagement in the Middle East.
Let us, for a moment, use this
possibility, this hypothesis to re
member what, Anally, might be
best for Vietnam. Let us pretend
for an instant that we live in a
world where we can enjoy the
luxury often seized by the in
tellectual to think upon the
good, rather than the merely
"not bad." Let us think of the
Vietnamese.
Image Of Peace
If we try to image the politi
cal structure which would cor
relate the productive capacities
of Vietnam, which would em
brace the divergent levels of
education the people possess,
and which would end the op
pression of a rich, self-interested
upper class dedicated to its own
preservation, we must think of
the National Liberation Front.
The National Liberation Front,
as a whole, is the only political
class which has fought the to
talitarian Diem and which now
fights Ky. General Ky, who

joined the French against his
own people, establishes a gov
ernment whose fascism is mere
ly transparent lined against the
chaos of war. This Vichy of the
South, who praises Hitler and
the United States in the same
breadth, should not have the
right to lose an election, though
let us hope that the world of
Vietnam will grant him the ig
nominy that his political defeat
would entail.
Let us have the pleasure of
imagining that the embittered
anti-American sentiment among
the South Vietnamese, sentiment
reported frequently now by in
dividuals free of mass-media de
mands, will turn to constructive
support of those individuals
whose biography suggests their
allegiance to the people. Neither
the United States leaders here
or there, nor the governments
of the South nurtured by those
leaders can evidence such a
biography. Let us therefore
hope that the NLF can aspire
to a political victory, freed from
the ideological camp bent on
their execution.
If, indeed as I suspect, this
country is positioning itself for
a larger war, a war potential in
the base called South Vietnam, a
war implicit in the calculations
of the government, we must

shift our attention. We must
then become afraid for our
selves.
Love Enough To Resist
Let us, in that eventuality, de
sert our fear in favor of resist
ance. Perhaps then we can love
our country enough to resist our
government. Let us answer its
quest for war with our quest
for peace, its egoism with our
pride, its lies with our truths.
Let us demand that it under
stands than its commitments
are not ours, that its hatreds
are not ours, that perhaps it is
no longer us.
In those times we shall espe
cially cherish the University, for
it shall bring us together, keep
our concerns human concerns,
inform our knowledge with wis
dom, and give us succor when
we may require it.
There will be those and there
are those, conquered by fears of
Communism, of Aggression
from the North, of Oriental
races, who would accuse in their
own self-defense, who would
build walls in Laos so that the
Berliners may jeer, who would
die rather than let others live.
With those we shall come into
conflict. But they shall be, at
least, Americans, and we shall
face them as Americans.
Let there be peace.
