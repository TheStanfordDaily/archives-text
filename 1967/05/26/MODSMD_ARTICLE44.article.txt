# Oh Christ!
## A 						Scout Pouts; Or, Is Soul Legal Tender? 
### Paul Rupert 
"Education must awaken won
der and insulate one against the
intolerable: we must respond
but not be destroyed." So think
ing, I digit-dialed my mailbox,
haphazardly and half-heartedly.
A lightly bearded man of
about thirty-eight years sobbed
behind me, ripping off a yellow
scarf, cursing campflres and
notching the sandstone pillars
of the Post Office. I whirled non
chalantly, and said, "By God!
It's an over-grown Boy Scout."
Almost automatically I reached
for my wallet and my Life Scout
Membership Card, but found
nothing except a social security
card, a driver's license, and a
draft card. Unable to demon
strate our closeness, I could
only say, "Hello."
"I've been betrayed!" said
he, adamantly. "Oh, yes, I know
what it means. I am not ignor
ant. I am literate, I tie knots,
I build fires, I seek trails — my
compass right or wrong, and
all that."
A novice at counselling, but
remembering my General Stu
dies Advisor, I said, "Hold one,
Friend. Let us begin at the be
ginning. Now, what seems to
be the problem. We're all in

this thing together, hut as Rud
yard Kipling says, we've got to
keep our heads." I think I
chortled.
Our Funny Little Way
His glower faded, he straight
ened his epaulet, anr'. he holster
ed his hatchet. "I'm sorry. I
am under a bit of a strain, as
I guess we all are in our funny
little way. Here I am flying off
the handle in front of a per
fect stranger. Let me tell my
little story, and then when we
have a common body of experi
ence, we might better relate, as
it were.
"I was only eleven. No more,
no less. Impressionable is hard
ly the word for it. Call it aver
age. Dad said, 'you oughta be
a Scout; (hose were great days.'
He likened them to the good old
days in the army. I stopped
buying G.I. Joe comics so I
could afford a uniform, and I
learned the Boy Scout Oath and
Law.
"I remember them — along
with the Prologue to Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales which I me
morized in the seventh grade.
'A Scout is trustworthy, loyal,
helpful, friendly, courteous,

kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty,
brave, clean and reverent.' The
oath was all about God and
Country, and being 'physically
strong, mentally awake and
morally straight.' I say vacuous
now, but I said okay then.
A True Tenderfoot
"Well, in the presence of The
Leader, The Flag, and The
Troop, I became a Tenderfoot.
A Romantic at heart, I saw the
road to Life Scout opening be
fore me, merit badges along the
way and the Law all about me.
We camped, hunted, dug la
trines, trapped, marched, and
saluted. I got a marksmanship
merit badge. Soon, my chest
bulged with medals. I got my
epaulet. I was in a Memorial
Day parade."
"Go no further," said I."I
know the whole thing. We were
all Scouts together. I remember
the Oath and everything." We
hummed it together, and prac
ticed the Second-Class grip. "We
had found the 'Ground of our
Being,' " I thought, excited at
the literary allusion.
"I suppose you think every
thing's just dandy now, don't
you?" he screamed. "I'm a

thirty-eight year-old Boy Scout
with no future, and a regiment
ed past. You're a twenty-year
old student with a 2-S and a
regimented future. We both un
derstand obedience, and worse,
we live it."
Reeling Response
Stunned, shocked, threatened,
I reeled back against the wall.
"Sorry," he said. "That was a
line from a Humphrey Bogart
flick. No harm meant. I'm sort
of out of words, so I borrow a
little more than most. Do you
think maybe we could get a
place off-campus together, and
mull this whole thing over for
a few days?
"Sure," I quipped. "Let me
just check my Box, then we'll
go get a cup of coffee." More
than one little matter had been
settled over a cup of coffee be
fore, I mused.
The letter was not the usual
appeal from Time magazine, or
the credit card cadre. I mum
bled aloud "S.S. Board No. 13.''
"Well, well," I sighed, "it's
come." I turned and the Scout
smiled. Before I could recite the
Law, he had wandered on down
the road.
I was, it seems to me, alone.

"I was only eleven. No more,
no less. Impressionable is hard
ly the word for it. Call it aver
age. Dad said, 'you oughta be
a Scout; (hose were great days.'
He likened them to the good old
days in the army. I stopped
buying G.I. Joe comics so I
could afford a uniform, and I
learned the Boy Scout Oath and
Law.
"I remember them — along
with the Prologue to Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales which I me
morized in the seventh grade.
'A Scout is trustworthy, loyal,
helpful, friendly, courteous,

kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty,
brave, clean and reverent.' The
oath was all about God and
Country, and being 'physically
strong, mentally awake and
morally straight.' I say vacuous
now, but I said okay then.
A True Tenderfoot
"Well, in the presence of The
Leader, The Flag, and The
Troop, I became a Tenderfoot.
A Romantic at heart, I saw the
road to Life Scout opening be
fore me, merit badges along the
way and the Law all about me.
We camped, hunted, dug la
trines, trapped, marched, and
saluted. I got a marksmanship
merit badge. Soon, my chest
bulged with medals. I got my
epaulet. I was in a Memorial
Day parade."
"Go no further," said I."I
know the whole thing. We were
all Scouts together. I remember
the Oath and everything." We
hummed it together, and prac
ticed the Second-Class grip. "We
had found the 'Ground of our
Being,' " I thought, excited at
the literary allusion.
"I suppose you think every
thing's just dandy now, don't
you?" he screamed. "I'm a

thirty-eight year-old Boy Scout
with no future, and a regiment
ed past. You're a twenty-year
old student with a 2-S and a
regimented future. We both un
derstand obedience, and worse,
we live it."
Reeling Response
Stunned, shocked, threatened,
I reeled back against the wall.
"Sorry," he said. "That was a
line from a Humphrey Bogart
flick. No harm meant. I'm sort
of out of words, so I borrow a
little more than most. Do you
think maybe we could get a
place off-campus together, and
mull this whole thing over for
a few days?
"Sure," I quipped. "Let me
just check my Box, then we'll
go get a cup of coffee." More
than one little matter had been
settled over a cup of coffee be
fore, I mused.
The letter was not the usual
appeal from Time magazine, or
the credit card cadre. I mum
bled aloud "S.S. Board No. 13.''
"Well, well," I sighed, "it's
come." I turned and the Scout
smiled. Before I could recite the
Law, he had wandered on down
the road.
I was, it seems to me, alone.
"Education must awaken won
der and insulate one against the
intolerable: we must respond
but not be destroyed." So think
ing, I digit-dialed my mailbox,
haphazardly and half-heartedly.
A lightly bearded man of
about thirty-eight years sobbed
behind me, ripping off a yellow
scarf, cursing campflres and
notching the sandstone pillars
of the Post Office. I whirled non
chalantly, and said, "By God!
It's an over-grown Boy Scout."
Almost automatically I reached
for my wallet and my Life Scout
Membership Card, but found
nothing except a social security
card, a driver's license, and a
draft card. Unable to demon
strate our closeness, I could
only say, "Hello."
"I've been betrayed!" said
he, adamantly. "Oh, yes, I know
what it means. I am not ignor
ant. I am literate, I tie knots,
I build fires, I seek trails — my
compass right or wrong, and
all that."
A novice at counselling, but
remembering my General Stu
dies Advisor, I said, "Hold one,
Friend. Let us begin at the be
ginning. Now, what seems to
be the problem. We're all in

this thing together, hut as Rud
yard Kipling says, we've got to
keep our heads." I think I
chortled.

old student with a 2-S and a
regimented future. We both un
derstand obedience, and worse,
we live it."
Reeling Response
Stunned, shocked, threatened,
I reeled back against the wall.
"Sorry," he said. "That was a
line from a Humphrey Bogart
flick. No harm meant. I'm sort
of out of words, so I borrow a
little more than most. Do you
think maybe we could get a
place off-campus together, and
mull this whole thing over for
a few days?
"Sure," I quipped. "Let me
just check my Box, then we'll
go get a cup of coffee." More
than one little matter had been
settled over a cup of coffee be
fore, I mused.
The letter was not the usual
appeal from Time magazine, or
the credit card cadre. I mum
bled aloud "S.S. Board No. 13.''
"Well, well," I sighed, "it's
come." I turned and the Scout
smiled. Before I could recite the
Law, he had wandered on down
the road.
I was, it seems to me, alone.
"Education must awaken won
der and insulate one against the
intolerable: we must respond
but not be destroyed." So think
ing, I digit-dialed my mailbox,
haphazardly and half-heartedly.
A lightly bearded man of
about thirty-eight years sobbed
behind me, ripping off a yellow
scarf, cursing campflres and
notching the sandstone pillars
of the Post Office. I whirled non
chalantly, and said, "By God!
It's an over-grown Boy Scout."
Almost automatically I reached
for my wallet and my Life Scout
Membership Card, but found
nothing except a social security
card, a driver's license, and a
draft card. Unable to demon
strate our closeness, I could
only say, "Hello."
"I've been betrayed!" said
he, adamantly. "Oh, yes, I know
what it means. I am not ignor
ant. I am literate, I tie knots,
I build fires, I seek trails — my
compass right or wrong, and
all that."
A novice at counselling, but
remembering my General Stu
dies Advisor, I said, "Hold one,
Friend. Let us begin at the be
ginning. Now, what seems to
be the problem. We're all in

this thing together, hut as Rud
yard Kipling says, we've got to
keep our heads." I think I
chortled.
Our Funny Little Way
His glower faded, he straight
ened his epaulet, anr'. he holster
ed his hatchet. "I'm sorry. I
am under a bit of a strain, as
I guess we all are in our funny
little way. Here I am flying off
the handle in front of a per
fect stranger. Let me tell my
little story, and then when we
have a common body of experi
ence, we might better relate, as
it were.
"I was only eleven. No more,
no less. Impressionable is hard
ly the word for it. Call it aver
age. Dad said, 'you oughta be
a Scout; (hose were great days.'
He likened them to the good old
days in the army. I stopped
buying G.I. Joe comics so I
could afford a uniform, and I
learned the Boy Scout Oath and
Law.
"I remember them — along
with the Prologue to Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales which I me
morized in the seventh grade.
'A Scout is trustworthy, loyal,
helpful, friendly, courteous,

kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty,
brave, clean and reverent.' The
oath was all about God and
Country, and being 'physically
strong, mentally awake and
morally straight.' I say vacuous
now, but I said okay then.
A True Tenderfoot
"Well, in the presence of The
Leader, The Flag, and The
Troop, I became a Tenderfoot.
A Romantic at heart, I saw the
road to Life Scout opening be
fore me, merit badges along the
way and the Law all about me.
We camped, hunted, dug la
trines, trapped, marched, and
saluted. I got a marksmanship
merit badge. Soon, my chest
bulged with medals. I got my
epaulet. I was in a Memorial
Day parade."
"Go no further," said I."I
know the whole thing. We were
all Scouts together. I remember
the Oath and everything." We
hummed it together, and prac
ticed the Second-Class grip. "We
had found the 'Ground of our
Being,' " I thought, excited at
the literary allusion.
"I suppose you think every
thing's just dandy now, don't
you?" he screamed. "I'm a

thirty-eight year-old Boy Scout
with no future, and a regiment
ed past. You're a twenty-year
old student with a 2-S and a
regimented future. We both un
derstand obedience, and worse,
we live it."
