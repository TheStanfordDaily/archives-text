# Smith Reveals Grove Move; Stern Residents Indignant
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS HENRY MULLER 
Dean of Students Joel Smith an
nounced last night that the Grove
Project would move to Donnor house
of Stern Hall, but agreed to discuss
the matter further when 50 indignant
Stern residents marched to the Grove
shortly before midnight last night.
Smith and History Professor Mark
Mancall, director of Grove, are meet
ing with delegates from Burbank and
Donner houses this morning.
Smith's decision was made on the
basis of a poll in which the majority
of residents of Donner and Burbank
houses indicated they would prefer to
merge their living groups and live in
Burbank rather than have the option
to participate in the Grove were it to
move to their house.
Those who marched to the Grove

last night expressed their disappoint
ment with the decision and asked to
talk to ASSU President-Elect Peter
Lyman, a Grove tutor.
Not Confrontation
Lyman told them, "this should not
be a confrontation between Grove and
Stern." He said this was another ex
ample of how administrative blunders
can create unnecessary animosity
among students and expressed the
hope that this confusion would not
create ill will between Grove and
Stern residents.
The Donner residents insisted that
they should be allowed preferential
treatment in the draw for the Grove.
They felt they deserved that conces
sion, since they were being moved out
of their house.
The Grove's location had been set
for Burbank Tuesday evening, but
was reconsidered after Burbank resi
dents confronted Smith with a writ
ten protest early yesterday morning.
They protested that their house was
"a living entity of as much value as
any other" and insisted that no group
had the right to displace another.
No Antipathy
Dave Corey of Burbank explained
that the students in his house felt no
antipathy toward the Grove, but re
sented being "rousted about."
Since the beginning of the search
for a new home for the Grove, its
residents have expressed strong dis
satisfaction with the manner in which
the relocation has been handled.
"It seems that of all the constituen
cies on campus, we are the most dis
criminated against," said one Grove
resident. "The people who were sup
posed to be arbitrators in this matter
have been just banging their heads
against the walls and willing to go
whichever way the winds are blow
ing at the moment."

History Professor Mark Mancall, di
rector of the Grove, and several Grove
residents had made a quick tour of
Burbank earlier in the week and
found the facilities to be the best
available in Stern.
At a Grove meeting Wednesday eve
ning, members were asked whether
they would participate in the project
were it to be housed in Burbank.
Twenty-three answered affirmatively
and those not present were contacted
by telephone yesterday morning.
Grove members had expressed dis
satisfaction at having to move to
Stern at a house meeting last week.
At that time, Smith and Provost Rich
ard Lyman told the group that the
Grove would move to Larkin house.
Grove residents reacted by point
ing to the aspects of Larkin which
would prevent the perpetuation of
the kind of residence which has de
veloped in the temporarily vacated
Phi Delt house. They noted that Lar
kin was located on a busy intersec
ticyi and that, being a front house, it
was a thoroughfare for Stern resi
dents.
Plans at that point were still not
final, for the Dean's Office was still
considering two proposals for which
Mancall and a number of Grove mem
bers had expressed a preference,
namely location of the Grove in either
Granada house of Lagunita or in a
combination of Stillman and Hurl
burt houses on the row.
Burbank residents complained yes
terday that they had not been con
tacted about the decision to move
f he Grove into their house. They had
first found out about the proposal
late Wednesday evening when some
residents called Grove house to con
firm rumors about the move.

Several students in Burbank, in
cluding president Bob Ash, Pat Pope
and Dan Johnston, started the "Bur
bank Arise!" movement which re
sulted in the march to Dean Smith's
office Thursday morning.
The statement which they present
ed to Smith read in part: "If the
Grove project replaces us, the mem
bers of Burbank stand to lose the
community we have created together
over so long a period of time. We do
not feel that any group has the right
to displace another. Who is to say
which community is worth more tp
its members and the University at
large?"
Reasons for the Burbank protest in
cluded not being consulted and the
loss of their party room, an $1800
investment.
Disregard
Several Grove residents, upon hear
ing of the plan to change to Donner
yesterday, said that the compliance
of the Dean's Office to this sudden
demand constituted a disregard for
the future of Grove House.
Many Grove members have ob
jected to the proposed move because
of the inequities in physical surround
ings. One resident pointed out that
the Stern facilities would be much
more cramped and far below the
standards of fraternity cluster hous
ing or off-campus housing which can
be obtained for the same price.
Other Grove residents, however,
are determined to stay with the proj
ect regardless of the physical setting.
One freshman who had previously
been dissatisfied with the "elite" at
mosphere of Grove said he felt it
necessary to prove the success of
Grove in different surroundings.

mosphere of Grove said he felt it
necessary to prove the success of
Grove in different surroundings.
Dean of Students Joel Smith an
nounced last night that the Grove
Project would move to Donnor house
of Stern Hall, but agreed to discuss
the matter further when 50 indignant
Stern residents marched to the Grove
shortly before midnight last night.
Smith and History Professor Mark
Mancall, director of Grove, are meet
ing with delegates from Burbank and
Donner houses this morning.
Smith's decision was made on the
basis of a poll in which the majority
of residents of Donner and Burbank
houses indicated they would prefer to
merge their living groups and live in
Burbank rather than have the option
to participate in the Grove were it to
move to their house.
Those who marched to the Grove

last night expressed their disappoint
ment with the decision and asked to
talk to ASSU President-Elect Peter
Lyman, a Grove tutor.
Not Confrontation
Lyman told them, "this should not
be a confrontation between Grove and
Stern." He said this was another ex
ample of how administrative blunders
can create unnecessary animosity
among students and expressed the
hope that this confusion would not
create ill will between Grove and
Stern residents.
The Donner residents insisted that
they should be allowed preferential
treatment in the draw for the Grove.
They felt they deserved that conces
sion, since they were being moved out
of their house.
The Grove's location had been set
for Burbank Tuesday evening, but
was reconsidered after Burbank resi
dents confronted Smith with a writ
ten protest early yesterday morning.
They protested that their house was
"a living entity of as much value as
any other" and insisted that no group
had the right to displace another.
No Antipathy
Dave Corey of Burbank explained
that the students in his house felt no
antipathy toward the Grove, but re
sented being "rousted about."
Since the beginning of the search
for a new home for the Grove, its
residents have expressed strong dis
satisfaction with the manner in which
the relocation has been handled.
"It seems that of all the constituen
cies on campus, we are the most dis
criminated against," said one Grove
resident. "The people who were sup
posed to be arbitrators in this matter
have been just banging their heads
against the walls and willing to go
whichever way the winds are blow
ing at the moment."

History Professor Mark Mancall, di
rector of the Grove, and several Grove
residents had made a quick tour of
Burbank earlier in the week and
found the facilities to be the best
available in Stern.
At a Grove meeting Wednesday eve
ning, members were asked whether
they would participate in the project
were it to be housed in Burbank.
Twenty-three answered affirmatively
and those not present were contacted
by telephone yesterday morning.
Grove members had expressed dis
satisfaction at having to move to
Stern at a house meeting last week.
At that time, Smith and Provost Rich
ard Lyman told the group that the
Grove would move to Larkin house.
Grove residents reacted by point
ing to the aspects of Larkin which
would prevent the perpetuation of
the kind of residence which has de
veloped in the temporarily vacated
Phi Delt house. They noted that Lar
kin was located on a busy intersec
ticyi and that, being a front house, it
was a thoroughfare for Stern resi
dents.
Plans at that point were still not
final, for the Dean's Office was still
considering two proposals for which
Mancall and a number of Grove mem
bers had expressed a preference,
namely location of the Grove in either
Granada house of Lagunita or in a
combination of Stillman and Hurl
burt houses on the row.
Burbank residents complained yes
terday that they had not been con
tacted about the decision to move
f he Grove into their house. They had
first found out about the proposal
late Wednesday evening when some
residents called Grove house to con
firm rumors about the move.

Several students in Burbank, in
cluding president Bob Ash, Pat Pope
and Dan Johnston, started the "Bur
bank Arise!" movement which re
sulted in the march to Dean Smith's
office Thursday morning.
The statement which they present
ed to Smith read in part: "If the
Grove project replaces us, the mem
bers of Burbank stand to lose the
community we have created together
over so long a period of time. We do
not feel that any group has the right
to displace another. Who is to say
which community is worth more tp
its members and the University at
large?"
Reasons for the Burbank protest in
cluded not being consulted and the
loss of their party room, an $1800
investment.
Disregard
Several Grove residents, upon hear
ing of the plan to change to Donner
yesterday, said that the compliance
of the Dean's Office to this sudden
demand constituted a disregard for
the future of Grove House.
Many Grove members have ob
jected to the proposed move because
of the inequities in physical surround
ings. One resident pointed out that
the Stern facilities would be much
more cramped and far below the
standards of fraternity cluster hous
ing or off-campus housing which can
be obtained for the same price.
Other Grove residents, however,
are determined to stay with the proj
ect regardless of the physical setting.

been dissatisfied with the "elite" at
mosphere of Grove said he felt it
necessary to prove the success of
Grove in different surroundings.
Dean of Students Joel Smith an
nounced last night that the Grove
Project would move to Donnor house
of Stern Hall, but agreed to discuss
the matter further when 50 indignant
Stern residents marched to the Grove
shortly before midnight last night.
Smith and History Professor Mark
Mancall, director of Grove, are meet
ing with delegates from Burbank and
Donner houses this morning.
Smith's decision was made on the
basis of a poll in which the majority
of residents of Donner and Burbank
houses indicated they would prefer to
merge their living groups and live in
Burbank rather than have the option
to participate in the Grove were it to
move to their house.
Those who marched to the Grove

last night expressed their disappoint
ment with the decision and asked to
talk to ASSU President-Elect Peter
Lyman, a Grove tutor.
Not Confrontation
Lyman told them, "this should not
be a confrontation between Grove and
Stern." He said this was another ex
ample of how administrative blunders
can create unnecessary animosity
among students and expressed the
hope that this confusion would not
create ill will between Grove and
Stern residents.
The Donner residents insisted that
they should be allowed preferential
treatment in the draw for the Grove.
They felt they deserved that conces
sion, since they were being moved out
of their house.
The Grove's location had been set
for Burbank Tuesday evening, but
was reconsidered after Burbank resi
dents confronted Smith with a writ
ten protest early yesterday morning.
They protested that their house was
"a living entity of as much value as
any other" and insisted that no group
had the right to displace another.
No Antipathy
Dave Corey of Burbank explained
that the students in his house felt no
antipathy toward the Grove, but re
sented being "rousted about."
Since the beginning of the search
for a new home for the Grove, its
residents have expressed strong dis
satisfaction with the manner in which
the relocation has been handled.
"It seems that of all the constituen
cies on campus, we are the most dis
criminated against," said one Grove
resident. "The people who were sup
posed to be arbitrators in this matter
have been just banging their heads
against the walls and willing to go
whichever way the winds are blow
ing at the moment."

History Professor Mark Mancall, di
rector of the Grove, and several Grove
residents had made a quick tour of
Burbank earlier in the week and
found the facilities to be the best
available in Stern.
At a Grove meeting Wednesday eve
ning, members were asked whether
they would participate in the project
were it to be housed in Burbank.
Twenty-three answered affirmatively
and those not present were contacted
by telephone yesterday morning.
Grove members had expressed dis
satisfaction at having to move to
Stern at a house meeting last week.
At that time, Smith and Provost Rich
ard Lyman told the group that the
Grove would move to Larkin house.
Grove residents reacted by point
ing to the aspects of Larkin which
would prevent the perpetuation of
the kind of residence which has de
veloped in the temporarily vacated
Phi Delt house. They noted that Lar
kin was located on a busy intersec
ticyi and that, being a front house, it
was a thoroughfare for Stern resi
dents.
Plans at that point were still not
final, for the Dean's Office was still
considering two proposals for which
Mancall and a number of Grove mem
bers had expressed a preference,
namely location of the Grove in either
Granada house of Lagunita or in a
combination of Stillman and Hurl
burt houses on the row.
Burbank residents complained yes
terday that they had not been con
tacted about the decision to move
f he Grove into their house. They had
first found out about the proposal
late Wednesday evening when some
residents called Grove house to con
firm rumors about the move.

Several students in Burbank, in
cluding president Bob Ash, Pat Pope
and Dan Johnston, started the "Bur
bank Arise!" movement which re
sulted in the march to Dean Smith's
office Thursday morning.
The statement which they present
ed to Smith read in part: "If the
Grove project replaces us, the mem
bers of Burbank stand to lose the
community we have created together
over so long a period of time. We do
not feel that any group has the right
to displace another. Who is to say
which community is worth more tp
its members and the University at
large?"
Reasons for the Burbank protest in
cluded not being consulted and the
loss of their party room, an $1800
investment.
Disregard
Several Grove residents, upon hear
ing of the plan to change to Donner
yesterday, said that the compliance
of the Dean's Office to this sudden
demand constituted a disregard for
the future of Grove House.
Many Grove members have ob
jected to the proposed move because
of the inequities in physical surround
ings. One resident pointed out that
the Stern facilities would be much
more cramped and far below the
standards of fraternity cluster hous
ing or off-campus housing which can
be obtained for the same price.
Other Grove residents, however,
are determined to stay with the proj
ect regardless of the physical setting.
