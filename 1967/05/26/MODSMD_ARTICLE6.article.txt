## Phi Delts To Return Next Fall 
### 
The members of Phi Delta Theta
will move hack to their campus resi
dence next fall, barring any serious
incidents before the end of this quar
ter.
Dean of Students Joel Smith has not
confirmed this decision, although in
formed sources say it has been made
long ago.
The Phi Delts will be living in the
cluster house which they vacated after
their suspension last November and
which is presently occupied by the
Grove Project.
Judicial Council Chairman Martin
Gerry yesterday expressed his disap
pointment at the fact that a letter he
had sent Smith and Interfraternity
Board (IFB) President Michael Quinn
on this question had not elicited a reply
from either of them at the time.
The letter, written on April 25,

stated in part that four members of
Phi Delta Theta had been found guilty
of Fundamental Standard .violations
and that the IFB should consider tak
ing "further disciplinary action."
Smith told one Judicial Council
member that the letter would be taken
into consideration before a final de
cision was made. He is reported to have
said, however, that the decision has
been made and that only a serious in
fraction on the part of the Phi Delts
would be a cause for reconsideration.
The University has been under sub
stantial pressure from Phi Delta Theta
alumni since the beginning of the sus
pension, according to one source.
Suspension Stipulations
One of the stipulations of the suspen
sion, according to Gerry, was that
"violations by any member (of Phi
Delta Theta) of the Honor Code or any
offense against public order during the
period of suspension or probation, be
considered grounds for further disci
plinary action." Former Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler had in
formed the members of this provision
at the time.
Gerrys letter to Smith and Quinn
stated that "the Judicial Council
wishes to notify the Interfraternity
Board that during the last four months
following the suspension the Council
has found four members of Phi Delia
Theta fraternity guilty of violations of
the Fundamental Standard. These vio
lations, we feel, do constitute 'grounds
for considering further disciplinary
action' and urge the Board to take
serious heed of these infractions.
"The fact that three of the four in
dividuals who violated the Funda
mental Standard were members of the
sophomore and junior class, we feel,
speaks even more seriously for the
need for Interfraternity Board action."
Considerable Potential
YVinbigler's statement in November
had said of the suspension that "im
plicit in the nature and duration of the
action taken is a recognition of con
siderable potential in the sophomore

and junior class of the chapter for the
eventual reconstruction of a sound fra
ternity. This recognition . . . has un
doubtedly tempered the sanctions
placed on the chapter."
A steeling committee was formed
this quarter to advise the Phi Delts

about their return to campus. Profes
sor of political science James T. Wat
kins IV, who has been the Phi Delts'
faculty adviser, is chairman of the
committee. Sources claim he has been
exerting considerable influence with
the administration to allow them back.

fraction on the part of the Phi Delts
would be a cause for reconsideration.
The University has been under sub
stantial pressure from Phi Delta Theta
alumni since the beginning of the sus
pension, according to one source.
Suspension Stipulations
One of the stipulations of the suspen
sion, according to Gerry, was that
"violations by any member (of Phi
Delta Theta) of the Honor Code or any
offense against public order during the
period of suspension or probation, be
considered grounds for further disci
plinary action." Former Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler had in
formed the members of this provision
at the time.
Gerrys letter to Smith and Quinn
stated that "the Judicial Council
wishes to notify the Interfraternity
Board that during the last four months
following the suspension the Council
has found four members of Phi Delia
Theta fraternity guilty of violations of
the Fundamental Standard. These vio
lations, we feel, do constitute 'grounds
for considering further disciplinary
action' and urge the Board to take
serious heed of these infractions.
"The fact that three of the four in
dividuals who violated the Funda
mental Standard were members of the
sophomore and junior class, we feel,
speaks even more seriously for the
need for Interfraternity Board action."
Considerable Potential
YVinbigler's statement in November
had said of the suspension that "im
plicit in the nature and duration of the
action taken is a recognition of con
siderable potential in the sophomore

and junior class of the chapter for the
eventual reconstruction of a sound fra
ternity. This recognition . . . has un
doubtedly tempered the sanctions
placed on the chapter."
A steeling committee was formed
this quarter to advise the Phi Delts

about their return to campus. Profes
sor of political science James T. Wat
kins IV, who has been the Phi Delts'
faculty adviser, is chairman of the
committee. Sources claim he has been
exerting considerable influence with
the administration to allow them back.
The members of Phi Delta Theta
will move hack to their campus resi
dence next fall, barring any serious
incidents before the end of this quar
ter.
Dean of Students Joel Smith has not
confirmed this decision, although in
formed sources say it has been made
long ago.
The Phi Delts will be living in the
cluster house which they vacated after
their suspension last November and
which is presently occupied by the
Grove Project.
Judicial Council Chairman Martin
Gerry yesterday expressed his disap
pointment at the fact that a letter he
had sent Smith and Interfraternity
Board (IFB) President Michael Quinn
on this question had not elicited a reply
from either of them at the time.
The letter, written on April 25,

stated in part that four members of
Phi Delta Theta had been found guilty
of Fundamental Standard .violations
and that the IFB should consider tak
ing "further disciplinary action."
Smith told one Judicial Council
member that the letter would be taken
into consideration before a final de
cision was made. He is reported to have
said, however, that the decision has
been made and that only a serious in
fraction on the part of the Phi Delts
would be a cause for reconsideration.
