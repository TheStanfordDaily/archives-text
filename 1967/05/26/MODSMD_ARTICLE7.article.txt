### MICHAEL KUHL 
In a second run-off of the final
ASSU elections, Stanford juniors
once again elected Soleng Tom and
Jere Horwitz Senior Class President
and Vice-President, and called on the
University to cease supplying academ
ic standing to draft boards. Bob
Brooks was elected National Student
Association representative.
The first run-off was declared in
valid because ASSU Elections Com
missioner Bill Berry had failed to
man the polls with members of the
Student Police.
After Berry's resignation at last
week's LASSU meeting, ASSU Presi
dent Michael Collins appointed Stu
dent Police Chief Ted Anstedt to
serve as the Election Commissioner
for the run-off.
Since the Student Police were al
ready scheduled to man the polls and
count the votes, Anstedt was able to
assume the added role of Election
Commissioner without formal LASSU
approval.
Tom, who defeated Mark Fogelman
by a count of 262 to 113, stated that
he would continue with the work he
and Jere Horwitz had started during
the week before the Judicial Council's
invalidation When they were con
sidered the new Senior Class officers.
"I think that this election definitely

shows that the senior class is not apa
thetic," Tom said last night. He added
that students who are either inter
ested in serving on the Senior Execu
tive Committee or in the five positions
as permanent class representatives to
the Alumni Association can sign up
in Bowman Alumni House beginning
today.
Bob Brooks, who defeated Gregg
Murphy 283 votes to 221, will be un
able to attend NSA's convention be
cause he will be in Brazil on the Guan
abara Exchange. He stated that if
Stanford does choose to retin in NSA,
"I will feel it incumbent on myself to
find students who are interested in
NSA to attend the convention."
The referendum dealing with re
leasing class ranking to draft boards
had 419 votes urging the University
to discontinue its present policy of
compliance as opposed to 285 for con
tinuation of the policy.
I*eonz.-d Siegel, spokesman of the
Stanford Anti-Draft Union, the group
which campaigned for passage of the
referendum, stated that he already
wrote to President Wallace Sterling
about the subject of class ranking yes
terday.
In that letter, he requested that
President Sterling "promise us that
the issue be brought before the Board
of Trustees at its June meeting."

Brooks was elected National Student
Association representative.
The first run-off was declared in
valid because ASSU Elections Com
missioner Bill Berry had failed to
man the polls with members of the
Student Police.
After Berry's resignation at last
week's LASSU meeting, ASSU Presi
dent Michael Collins appointed Stu
dent Police Chief Ted Anstedt to
serve as the Election Commissioner
for the run-off.
Since the Student Police were al
ready scheduled to man the polls and
count the votes, Anstedt was able to
assume the added role of Election
Commissioner without formal LASSU
approval.
