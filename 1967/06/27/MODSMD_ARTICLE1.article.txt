# Stanford Welcomes Summer Festival
## Focus on America To Host Joffrey, Count Basie, ACT 
### 
The curtain goes up tonight on Stan
ford's fourth annual Summer Festi
val, Focus on America, with the open
ing of the City Center JofTrey Ballet
in Memorial Auditorium at 8 p.m.
The Joffrey Ballet comes to Stan
ford after stunning international suc
cesses which caused the New Yortc
Times to comment, "There is not a
company in the world to match it."
Ballet, however, is not all that Focus
on America has to offer. Producer
Steve Baffrey has put together a Festi

val which promises to offer the best
America has to offer in the fields of
Jazz, Theatre and Music.
For Jazz Huffs
In the Jazz area a delightful com
bination of groups will be presented,
including the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, old masters who play the old
tunes in a soulful manner, and Count
Basie and his Orchestra, the group
that made the "big band" sounds
which underscored the '30's and '40's
famous.
For those who prefer the more
modern jazz stylings, the Festival will
offer the Denny Zeitlin Trio, a group
recognized as one of the country's
most expressive, and the John Hen
dricks Quartet, which specializes in
the writing and singing of lyrics to
jazz solos.
On the stage, Focus on America will
present the American Conservatory
Theatre. ACT was introduced to
Northern California by last year's
Festival and returns with a repertory
of six plays, including three totally
new productions.
And Music Lovers
In the world of Music the Festival,
in conjunction with the Stanford Mu
sic Department, will present two
soloists and two groups. The con
cert portion of this summer's Festi
val will focus on American works,
but will also scan a broad repertory to
spotlight appropriately the distinction
of the performers.
Included in the music calendar are
soloists Grant Johannesen who is re
turning for his second appearance
at Stanford, and Zara Nelsova, "a cel
list of consumate skill and magical
musicianship."
Other musical attractions are the
New York Pro Musica, perhaps Ameri
ca's most widely acclaimed musical
organization, and the Philadelphia
Quartet, appearing in its Northern
California debut.
The Daily will provide a calendar of
coming events in each issue in order
to inform students, faculty and staff
of the magnificent entertainment
which Focus on America has in store.
