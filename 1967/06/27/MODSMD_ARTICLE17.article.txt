# Stanford Ends Class Rankings
## 
### 
University-wide class ranking
for undergraduates will end at
Stanford in September, as rec
ommended by the Academic
Council.
Class rankings may still be
kept for graduate students and
for undergraduate students by
individual departments and
schools, if they so desire.
President Wallace Sterling re
ported the Academic Council's
recommendation for abolishing
university-wide rankings to the
Board of Trustees at their regu
lar meeting June 15.
The previous day, Congress
agreed on a new draft bill which
eliminates class rank as a cri
terion for possible deferment by
local draft boards. The new legis
lation provides that undergrad
uates making satisfactory prog
gress toward their degree shall
be deferred.
The Academic Council's rec
ommendation was made by voice
vote May 20. It made no specific
reference to selective service.
In June 1966, the Academic
Council sharply criticized the
use of class ranking as a basis
for draft deferment. The use of
academic criteria by selective
service "raises problems of con
science and of pratice affecting
the conduct of higher educa
tion," the Council said.
"The grading system and stu
dent curricular choices may be
distorted by pressures extrinsic
to the purposes and function of
a university . . .
"We therefore strongly urge
on the government that ... se
lective service . . . not call for
indices of academic perfor
mance."
At last month's meeting of the
Council, Economics Prof. Ken
neth Arrow said the University
started class ranking by sex in
response to outside requests
from selective service.
Once this information was
compiled, it was made available
to other outside agencies â€” but
only with the consent of the in
dividual students concerned.
In recommending the change
to the Council, the executive
committee said the "present sys
tem of class rankings does not
serve the purposes for which it
was designed" and "as a mea
suring device ... is of question
able validity."
Approximately 130 of the
Council's 900 members were
present when the vote was
taken.
