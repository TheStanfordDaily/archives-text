# Tunes Change
## 
### 
For the first time since 1958,
the carillon atop the Hoover In
stitution will ring out some new
songs at noon and 6 p.m.
Stanford Carillonneur James
B. Angell, professor of electrical
engineering, and his assistant,
Mrs. Margot A. Halsted, spent
three afternoons last week
changing the cogs on the giant
drum which plays automatically
at noon and evening.
At noon, the carillon now plays
Handel's "Harmonious Black
smith" and a Stanford football
song, "The Cardinal is Waving."
At 6 p.m. it now plays "America"
and "Come Join the Band."
