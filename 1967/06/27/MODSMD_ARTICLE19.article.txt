## Not Again J. Egbert!

It's national Hire The Mor
ally Handicapped Week again;
time to give a junkie a job.
Which isn't so surprising when
you remember that the U.S.
Government's been doing it for
years now.
After all, they gave us J. Ed
gar Hoover, didn't they? If he
isn't morally handicapped, we're
a nation of angels.
Don't get me wrong. I think
it's good that these people
should have a chance to make
an honest living. But why does
the Government always put
them in positions of responsi
bility?
My big complaint against Hoo
ver is that he has a Godlike
image of himself: He wants to
decide what is good for the
American people, because Ho
thinks they're totally incapable
of taking care of themselves.
Such faith.
A case in point: When Mark
Lane was trying to get his best
selling Rush To Judgment pub
lished by the firm of Holt, Rino
hart, and Winston, who had ex
pressed an interest in the manu
script, Hoover had his first as
sistant Deke Le Roach summon
Holt executive Frank Close into
the FBl's offices on 69th Street
in Manhattan. Close was told
that Hoover felt very strongly
that the book should not be pub
lished.

Naturally, the story has a
smile at the end. Holt et al
brought out the book, even
though they had previously pub
lished Hoover's Muster of I)e
-eiet, which would have been a
good title for his autobiography.
This kind of attempted sup
pression has a precedent, though.
Of course, we don't hoar about
all, or even most of the cases
of the Government's clogging
of the news channels, but one
especially distressing example
comes to mind.
In 1920, Professor William
Estabrook Chancellor of YVoo
ster (Ohio) College wrote and
somehow published (the book
bore no copyright information)
a tract which said that Warren
G. Harding was part Negro. Ac
cording to Harding biographers,
the book was peddled mostly by
criminal types on a door-to-door
basis. When the Department of
Justice got news of this, Attor
ney General A. Palmer Mitchell
sent agents to Ohio to check out
Professor Chancellor and to find
out where the book was being
printed. When they did, they
bought or "borrowed" every
copy they came across, sent
them to Washington in a guard
ed express car, and then burned
them. When a back-up force of
agents got through, there wasn't
a copy to be had in the whole
state of Ohio. (All of which
only suggests that in those days
they believed in subsequent
punishment rather than prior re
straint.)
What about J. Edgar Hoover?
Recently a noted social critic
said, "Well, you've got to ad
mit, he is the greatest Director
the Fedeural Bureau of Investi
gation has ever had."
I looked at him with a dumb
expression for about thirty sec
onds before I realized why I had
to agree.
He's come a long way for a
man whose I.Q. is less than his
body temperature.
