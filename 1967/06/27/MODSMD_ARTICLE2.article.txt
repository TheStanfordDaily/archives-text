# C15 Acts To End Discrimination
## 
### 
It will not come as a big surprise
that the Committee of 15 has dis
covered discriminatory practices in
Stanford's admissions practices. The
types of discrimination are well
known to most students, one of the
best known being the clear discrimina
tion against women.
At its June 6th meeting the Com
mittee of 15 passed the following res
olution, thereby taking the first step
in correcting the many discriminatory
practices of the Admissions Office.
1. The Legislature of ASSU has re
ferred to the Committee of Fifteen
"the question of discrimination in
University admissions policy." We
have made a preliminary study of the

matter which has indicated that there
are some areas of clear discrimination
and that there may be other areas of
conscious or unconscious discrimina
tion in University admissions policy.
2. The Committee of Fifteen does
not ordinarily act when there is an
other organ of the University which
is empowered to act with regard to
the matter involved, unless one or
more constituencies is dissatisfied with
action which has been taken. Since

undergraduate admission policy has
not, to our knowledge, been compre
hensively reviewed for Home time by
the Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions of the Academic Council, the
Committee of Fifteen believes that a
review of the question of established
and possible discrimination in fresh
man admissions should be undertaken.
3. In our opinion, any review of the
question of discrimination in fresh
man admissions should include con

sideration of at least the following:
(a) Whther the Admissions staff
does not recruit vigorously from
Eastern public secondary schools
or any other category of second
tion in favor of "legacies" and the
children of faculty, staff and trus
ary schools and, if so, whether
this may result in defacto dis
crimination in freshman admis
sions.
(b) Whether the clear discrimina
tion against women which is pres
ently part of the University's un
dergraduate admissions policy Is
desirable.

(c) Whether the clear discrimina
tees which is presently part of the
University's undergraduate ad
missions policy is desirable.
(d) Whether the de facto extensive
discretion now accorded the Ad
missions staff in selecting stu
dents to be admitted has resulted
in or creates an undue risk of con
scious or unconscious discrimina
tion in freshman admissions.
4. The Committee of Fifteen re
spectfully requests the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council
to ask the Committee on Undergrad
uate Admissions to undertime such a
review.

It will not come as a big surprise
that the Committee of 15 has dis
covered discriminatory practices in
Stanford's admissions practices. The
types of discrimination are well
known to most students, one of the
best known being the clear discrimina
tion against women.
At its June 6th meeting the Com
mittee of 15 passed the following res
olution, thereby taking the first step
in correcting the many discriminatory
practices of the Admissions Office.
1. The Legislature of ASSU has re
ferred to the Committee of Fifteen
"the question of discrimination in
University admissions policy." We
have made a preliminary study of the

matter which has indicated that there
are some areas of clear discrimination
and that there may be other areas of
conscious or unconscious discrimina
tion in University admissions policy.
2. The Committee of Fifteen does
not ordinarily act when there is an
other organ of the University which
is empowered to act with regard to
the matter involved, unless one or
more constituencies is dissatisfied with
action which has been taken. Since

undergraduate admission policy has
not, to our knowledge, been compre
hensively reviewed for Home time by
the Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions of the Academic Council, the
Committee of Fifteen believes that a
review of the question of established
and possible discrimination in fresh
man admissions should be undertaken.
3. In our opinion, any review of the
question of discrimination in fresh
man admissions should include con

sideration of at least the following:
(a) Whther the Admissions staff
does not recruit vigorously from
Eastern public secondary schools
or any other category of second
tion in favor of "legacies" and the
children of faculty, staff and trus
ary schools and, if so, whether
this may result in defacto dis
crimination in freshman admis
sions.
(b) Whether the clear discrimina
tion against women which is pres
ently part of the University's un
dergraduate admissions policy Is
desirable.

(c) Whether the clear discrimina
tees which is presently part of the
University's undergraduate ad
missions policy is desirable.
(d) Whether the de facto extensive
discretion now accorded the Ad
missions staff in selecting stu
dents to be admitted has resulted
in or creates an undue risk of con
scious or unconscious discrimina
tion in freshman admissions.
4. The Committee of Fifteen re
spectfully requests the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council
to ask the Committee on Undergrad
uate Admissions to undertime such a
review.
