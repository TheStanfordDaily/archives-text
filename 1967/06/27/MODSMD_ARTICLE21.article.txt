# Changing Of The Guard

It is traditional that the first editorial of each
volume be set aside to explain what that volume
hopes to accomplish. Volume 151 A is an experi
ment, an experiment we strongly support, and
one which we hope will succeed.
Until 13 years ago, the student newspaper for
Summer Quarter was published twice a week
and was called the Stanford Daily. Then, out
of the labyrinth of the ASSU, the Stanford
Summer Weekly was born. Independent of the
Daily, the Weekly has tried its best, and
failed.
We do not feel that a weekly publication is
adequate to meet the needs of this community.
Too much happens at Stanford during the sum
mer. We believe the community deserves bet
ter coverage than a weekly can provide.
Therefore, our experiment. This summer's
newspaper shall be called the Stanford Daily.
It shall be produced in full rather than tabloid
size. It will be published twice a week on Tues
days and Fridays.
Through these innovations, we hope to take
one more step in making the summer newspaper
a summer volume of the Daily. Our ultimate
goal is to have a daily for all four quarters of

the year. As many distinguished displomats have
pointed out in recent weeks, this is only a first
step.
The obstacles between us and our goal are
not great, but whether or not they fall depends
in great part upon whether or not we succeed
this summer.
Our success or failure will be measured on
many levels. The most important level for us is
how we serve the community. We will not be
come identified with any campus organization.
We will not be a spokesman for narrow in
terests. We will make every attempt to cover
and report the news in a fair and accurate man
ner.
Your readership of our product is our most
valued asset. We are well aware that many
people in the community have stopped read
ing the Daily. We know that your judgment of
our product will decide whether our ultimate
goal will be achieved.
Your suggestions and criticisms will be heart
ily welcomed for this is your journal, not ours.
We hope to provide you with the paper we
think you deserve. If we succeed, we have made
the next step possible.
