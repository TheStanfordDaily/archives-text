# Beyond The Classroom
## 
### 
Stanford is a recognized and accredited Uni
versity, and like all similar universities, Stan
ford offers a great deal of knowledge through
its courses and programs. There is, however, a
great deal more that can be learned outside of
the formal program.
Nearly 50 per cent of Stanford's summer
students are new to the University. A great
many of these students are here to take ad
vanced work or add another degree to the
list at the end of their names.
During the summer many things happen at
Stanford, events which provide opportunities for

learning outside of the academic community.
Among these is the Stanford Summer Festival.
This year's Festival will focus on the "American
creative spirit," and in so doing will bring to
campus a myriad of artists who represent that
spirit.
We urge all members of the community to in
vestigate the offerings of the Festival and of
other campus organizations most carefully. Sum
mer education need not end at the classroom
door and the life of the Universiy need not be
limited to academe just because it is summer.
