## Stanford's Essence 
### Steve Gruber 
What is the essence of a Stan
ford education?
• 1. Put all your eggs in one
basket.
• 2. Lock the basket and hide
it.
• 3. Don't tell anyone where
you put your basket.
•4. Don't even mention the
word "basket."
What is in the hidden basket?
One of the things is the mone
tary aspirations of the students
—a diploma from Stanford will
be rewarded with a well-paying
job. Deep-rooted conservative
beliefs, a pervading puritanism,
and middle-class ideologies are
also in the basket.
Stanford students are expected
to hide these baskets for four
years, exhuming them only when
they graduate. And during their
Stanford careers, the students
try to affect exactly the oppo
site attitudes than those left in
their buried baskets.
This is not the case for all
Stanford students, of course, but
it does seem to be true for a sig
nificant number.
The events of graduation
weekend were geared to helping
graduating seniors bring their
baskets out into the open.
The senior class day ever
cises, held June 17, are a good
example. Each year the senior
class committee selects three
professors to speak to the se
niors and their parents on the
day before graduation. The class
of '67 picked B. Davie Napier,
Dean of the Chapel; David Pot
ter, Professor of History; and

Michael Novak, Assistant Pro
fessor of .Religion.
Both Napier and Potter seem
ed to think that the senior class
had invited them to give humor
ous, unoffensive lectures. Per
haps this is what the seniors
wanted. At any rate, that is
what they got. Napier offended
neither the seniors nor their pa
rents, and after he had finished,
perhaps a few seniors had al
ready brought their baskets out
of hiding.
Potter certainly offended no
one. His slighting references to
Chief Justice Earl Warren
brought applause from the au
dience. Not only were the bas
kets out of hiding now, but they
were being unlocked.
Novak, however, ignored the
parents, instead choosing to
speak directly to the students.
Considering that his topic was
Vietnam and the coming revo
lution in the United States, his
lecture must have been a sur
prise to the senior class com
mittee. He was one of the few
who spoke sincerely during
graduation weekend and he must
have driven a few baskets back
into hiding.
Graduation is over now, and
most of the baskets have been
unlocked. Novak couldn't stop
this annual process, which fol
lows every graduation, and nei
ther could anyone else. The con
tents of the baskets are an in
tegral part of the students be
fore they come to Stanford and
cannot be expected to change
as long as they are hidden.
