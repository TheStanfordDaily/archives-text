# More Than 3800 Degrees Given In 76th Annual Commencement
## 
### 
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
awarded more than 3800 degrees and
shook more than 1000 hands at the
University's 76th annual commence
ment exercises, June 18.
Well over 9000 persons packed into
Frost Amphitheatre to participate and
observe the pageantry that is gradu
ation. The pageantry was highlighted
this year by the addition of ten special
heraldic banners designed by Profes
sor Eric Hutchinson of the Chemistry
Department.
Displayed for the first time at grad
uation, the banners combine the colors
normally used on academic robes and
hoods of the various disciplines and

derive from the history of each de
partment, with a few special Stanford
touches.
The graduates were addressed by
John Fischer, editor-in-chief of Har
per's Magazine. Fischer's address,
"Four Choices for Young People,"
set about to tell the Class of '67 how
to reshape the world.
Four Choices
Fischer's four choices were to Drop
Out, Flee, Plot a Revolution, and Try
to Change the World Gradually, One
Clod at a Time. Urging the assembled
students to adopt the fourth strategy,
Fischer said, . . you many succeed
in reshaping the world considerably

more than you now expect."
President Sterling took much the
same line in addressing the under
graduate degree candidates. Warning
that division invites extremism, Ster
ling asked the candidates to choose
carefully the stars by which they
would be guided "so that the dangers
that lurk in extremism may be abat
ed."
Sterling concluded by summing up
the substance of the "generation gap."
"Time will bring to Stanford changes
in program and personnel, but not in
central purpose. And when you re
turn for a visit five, 10, or 20 years
hence, please don't be too critical of
the students."

Stanford only gives one award at its
Commencement exercises; the Lloyd
W. Dinkelspiel Award.
The award is given annually to the
one member of the Faculty and the
two members of the Senior Class who
have performed the most outstanding
service to Undergraduate Education
at Stanford University.
This year's recipients of the Dink
elspiel Award were Professor John
Wendell Dodds of the English De
partment, and Seniors Mary Swenson
and Michael Roster.


What is four years at Stanford all about? Ifs a big: smile and "tossing the
tassle" after shaking hands with University President J. E. Wallace Sterling:
and receiving the treasured sheepskin. The two girls pictured above are Laurie

education see "Gruberland" on page four.
