# Typhoid Ends
## 
### 
The recent typhoid outbreak here
at Stanford now appears closed, ac
cording to Dr. Maurice Osborne, execu
tive director of the Health Center.
All 18 students who were hospital
ized with the disease have now been
released in good condition. In all, 38
students and a fraternity cook were
infected.
The students who had the disease
were informed that they can't swim,
baby-sit, or work in food handling
jobs until cleared by health officers.
This in spite of the fact that the incu
bation period for further infection has
passed with no new cases reported.
All those infected were members or
close associates of Beta Theta Pi Fra
ternity. The outbreak of the disease
was first confirmed on May 26 when
the fraternity kitchen, believed to be
the source of the infection, was closed.
The injunction against swimming
will keep Olympic swimmer Dick
Roth out of the water for a few more
weeks. Those affected by the disease
must report periodically to public
health officials until it is certain that
they have no typhoid bacilli in their
systems.
Dr. Osborne said that this clear
ance to resume normal activities will
come within a few weeks for most of
the students.
