# Joffrey Ballet: After 14 Years--Success
## 
### 
After 14 years of struggle, the City
Center Joffrey Ballet now represents
one of the greatest success stories of
the American dance world.
The Joffrey Company began in 1952
when Robert Joffrey founded the
American Ballet Center in New York
City. In 1956, Joffrey and six dancers
jammed into the back of a rented sta
tion wagon and started out on the
company's first U.S. tour —23 one
night stands in 11 states.
From this modest beginning the
company danced its way to interna
tional distinction, finally bursting up
on the American dance world last
spring in New York. There, in an
eclipsed one-week stand, major Amer
ican dance critics were unanimous
in their constant and lavish praise of
the ensemble.

comes to the Stanford Summer Festi
val direct from its second season in
New York. The just concluded three
weeks of performance saw ticket lines

kolow, Gerald Arpino, and Robert
Joffrey himself.
