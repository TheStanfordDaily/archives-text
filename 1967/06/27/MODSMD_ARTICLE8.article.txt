"The Experiment and The Free Uni
versity have morged," according to
Experiment coordinator Barry Green
berg, "because both groups share a
common vision of radical community,
a community in which individuals can
honestly and fearlessly explore them
selves, their society, and the relation
ship between the two. We propose
nothing less than the creation of a
cogent and comprehensive alternative
to the indoctrination and emasculation
which is euphemistically known as
American higher education."
