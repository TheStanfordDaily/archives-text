IF YOU STAY HOME—You'll have time to shop for furniture and household equip
ment. Stop in for the money you need for your painting and fix-it projects. If the
time has come, look around for a good car trade.
IF YOU TRAVEL—You'II need money to get your car in shape or to buy tickets before
you start the trip. Maybe you need camping or boating supplies, too.
DON'T GO TOO FAR with you vacation/travel plans before checking with your
