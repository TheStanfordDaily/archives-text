# Int'l Film Series Set For Fridays At TMU
## 
### 
An international film series to
be run on Friday nights through
out the Summer Quarter has
been announced under the co
sponsorship of Tresidder Union
and the Bechtel International-
Center.
The first film of the series,
"Woman in the Dunes," will be
shown tonight at Tresidder. An
Academy Award Nominee and
winner of awards at the New
York and Cannes Film Festivals,
"Woman in the Dunes" is direct
ed by Hiroshi Teshigahara and
was judged by Bosley Crowther
of the New York Times to be
"One of the Best Ten Films of
the Year."
Michael Kustow, of "Sight and
Sound," writes: "The camera
hangs inches away from skin;
pores are the same as grains of
sand. Hair against skin makes
a shape like the streams of sand.
Everything is interfused. And
against this metamorphosis we
see the irreducible signs of hu
man need; we learn again the
sheer delight of soap over an
encrusted body, drinking be
comes almost a sacrament when
the woman grips the spout of

the kettle between her teeth.
And when the man makes a bea
con to signal for help by wrap
ping burning cloth around a long
bamboo pole and waving it in
the air, we are brought back to
all our fears of the dark and
our cry for recognition . . . This
film has the stark, irrefutable
quality of a Beckett play, the
severe intransigence of myth."
Other films presented during
the Quarter will include "Une
Femme est une Femme" (God
ard), "The Cabinet of Dr. Cali
gari," "To Die in Madrid," and
"Smiles of a Summer Night,"
(Bergman). Viewing times will
be at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30 when
shown at Tresidder, and at 8:30
and 9:30 when shown outside in
the courtyard of the Internation
al-Center.
Times and location will be an
nounced each Friday in The
Daily. The films will be open to
faculty, staff, and students of
the University, and an admission
of 50 cents will be charged. Tick
ets may be purchased for each
weeks performance at the Tres
idder box office on the second
