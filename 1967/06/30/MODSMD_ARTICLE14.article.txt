# Fire, Flood, Quake OK, But Parking Meters Shake Mint

Washington (National Geo
graphic Society) — The United
States Mint has withstood fire,
earthquake, and rebellion, but
it almost crumbled before the
voracious parking meter.
The demands of meters and
vending machines helped to cre
ate severe coin shortages in the
1960'5. The situation was so bad
in 1961 that a Connecticut bank
was reduced to advertising in
trade journals for any spare
pennies that neighboring banks
might part with.
Accordingly, the Mint increas
ed production and took other
steps to meet the demand for
small change.
The San Francisco branch
mint, closed in 1955, was re
opened after 10 years to coin
nickels and pennies. The historic
facility still is hard at work,
turning out coins of all denomi
nations.
An 89-year-old coin press pre
served in the Nevada State Mu
seum in Carson City was shipped
back to work at the Denver
mint in 1964. Within a month,
Old No. 5 was stamping out
coins. The museum — housed
in a former mint building — is
patiently awaiting the return of
its prize exhibit.
In the calendar year 1966, the
main mint in Philadelphia and
the two branches in Denver and
San Francisco turned out a rec
ord 9.5 billion coins. The coin
shortage was over.
The Mint had coped with the
crisis without resorting to mea
sures employed early in its his
tory. Then the makeshift copper
supply came from nails, kettles,
and bands from powder kegs.
In 1792, Congress authorized
the first United States Mint to be
built in Philadelphia. The act
establishing the mint specified
the death penalty for officers or
employees who debased, reduced

the weight of, or stole coins.
The mint filled an urgent need,
for as George Washington
wrote, "Without a coinage . . .
a man must travel with a pair
of scales in his pocket or run
the risk of receiving gold at
one-fourth less than it counts."
Tradition says that Washington
himself contributed his personal
tableware for the "half-dismes"
that were the United States
Mint's first coins.
In 1838, branch mints were
started in Charlotte, North Caro
line; Dahlonega, Georgia; and
New Orleans. The Civil War
closed the first two. The Confed
erates ran the New Orleans mint
until the city fell to Northern
forces in 1862. The New Orleans
mint reopened in 1879 and closed
again in 1909.
The California gold rush led
to the establishment of the San
Francisco mint in 1854. Pros
pectors with pokes of gold dust
and nuggets were its best cus

tomers. In four years, the San
Francisco mint produced more
gold coins than all United States
mints had turned out before the
discovery of gold in California.
The second San Francisco
mint building withstood the 1906
earthquake and fire. The $200
million in currency and specie
stored in its vaults helped the
city revive business after the
disaster.
A mint operated in Carson
City from 1870 to 1893 for the
convenience of nearby silver
miners. The coin most in de
mand was a 20-cent piece — it
bought two shots of whisky in
mining towns. The Denver mint
was established in 1906.
The main Philadelphia mint,
now housed in a 1901 building,
will move into a modern new
home late in 1968. Automated
production lines will spew out
10,000 coins a minute — enough
for the hungriest parking me
ters.
