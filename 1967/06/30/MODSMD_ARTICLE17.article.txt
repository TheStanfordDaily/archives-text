# Free Wine Waiting Near Napa
## 
### STEVE GRUBER (First in a series) 
Only 90 minutes from Palo
Alto is the finest wine-producing
area in California.
A leisurely tour can be made
of the Napa Valley in a half
day. It is an uncluttered area,
replete with miles of vineyards
and wine-tasting rooms.
With roadmap in hand, drive
up the Bayshore Freeway, across
the Bay Bridge, and through
Vallejo. Your destination is St.
Helena, center of boozeland.
Just before you reach St.
Helena, on Highway 29, you
will come to a small town,
Rutherford. On your right will
be the first stop, the Beaulieu
Vineyard winery.
Free Wine
Beaulieu is what this writer
would term a "friendly winery."
Visitors are invited to drink
nearly as much free wine as
they want, the management is
informative, and their winery
tour is optional. However, the
tasting room is small and vis
itors would be wise to stop
there early or late in the day.
Now drive to St. Helena. On
the northern edge of the city
you will find the Berringer
Brothers Winery, allegedly the
only winery in that area that
has been on constant operation
since it was built in 1879. Don't
forget that this time span in
cludes the 1906 earthquake and
prohibition. As the story goes,

the Berringer Brothers stayed
in business during prohibition
by selling alter wine to religious
groups.
Mandatory Tour
The Berringer Brothers have
tours leaving every fifteen min
utes from the "Rhine House."
Note that there is no other way
to get to the tasting room, ex
cept by going on the tour. It
will take about thirty minutes
and can prove to be interesting.
Once you get to the tasting
room, you will be allowed three
glasses of wine. If your hands
are quicker than their eyes,
you can probably get six glasses.
Remember, too, that these
glasses are approximately half
the size of the ones at Beaulieu.
After soaking up the Ber
ringer Brothers' booze, drive
about a half mile up the road
and you will find the Charles
Krug winery on the right and
the Christian Brothers winery
on the left. It is one of the
finest intersections in the entire
state.
More Tours
Both Krug and Christian
Brothers demand tours before
the wine tasting can begin. In
both cases the wait is worth
while. One note here: don't start
buying the wine they will try
to sell you unless there is a sub
stantial difference in price be
tween their shops and the local
liquor store. Since most wine is
fair-traded, don't expect any sav

ings through buying directly
from the winery.
If you can still drive, go
further north until you see a
sign to your right for the Hans
Kornell Champagne winery. No,
they won't serve you any cham
pagne. To do so, according to
the lady who owns the place,
would be to invite the whole Bay
Area to drop in once a week. The
wine is good and the winery tour
is optional.
More Free Juice
If you can remember which
way is south, or for that matter,
how to start your car, head

back through St. Helena and
Rutherford. You might stop at
Beaulieu for a few more snorts
if you have a large capacity.
Take route 12-121 at Napa
and drive west toward Scheriville
and Sonoma. Just outside Sono
ma you will see the Sebastiani
win?ry. If you still have a thirst
for wine, they may be able to
help you.
Continue over Highway 16 to
Petaluma and turn left onto
101. Keep driving south until
you find Palo Alto â€” you can't
miss it.
