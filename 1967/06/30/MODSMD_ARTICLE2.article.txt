# Picketing SU Prof Arrested
## 
### JOEL KUGELMASS 
Yesterday morning at the Oakland
Induction Center Professor Charles
v Stein of the Department of Statistics
and 19 other persons were arrested.
They were blocking the entrances
through which inductees must pass in
protest of the draft and of the war
in Vietnam. Their protest and sub
sequent arrest was entirely orderly.
Across the street from the Center
was a support march of over 300 war
protestors. Although most of the
demonstrators were students, there
was a number of housewives, work
ers, and business men marching. They
kept walking to avoid arrest for un
lawful assembly.
The civil disobedience and support
ing march was organized by various
ad hoc committees started at San
Francisco State College. Those arrest
ed identified themselves as the Draft
Action-day Committee. In a state
ment given to the press, they explain
ed that they were committing civil
disobedience because "it is our non
violent means of placing ourselves
between the war system and the peo
ple it is killing and training to be
„ killers."
The protestors began arriving at
about six o'clock in the morning; by
eight o'clock all arrests had been
made, amidst the cheering of specta
, tors. The support march continued
throughout the morning. Until the
arrests were completed, no inductee
entered the eight story building; from
the windows officials and inductees ob
served until about nine thirty.
The police made the arrests very
slowly; each protestor was allowed
to leave freely, though all refused. At
the peak there were about forty po
licemen, without riot sticks or other
anti-riot equipment. Policemen inter
viewed at th<» beginning of the demon
stration said they expected "no
trouble."
