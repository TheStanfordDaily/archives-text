## Story Of A Non-Graduate 
### 
Editor's Note:
The author composed this tale
after being fired from his posi
tion as a graduate student at
Stanford University, in the mid
dle of his third year, under
truly remarkable conditions for
reasons that were never made
quite clear.
Editor, The Daily:
Once upon a time, a long, long
time ago, a human being con
ceived of the University, where
students and faculty could join
in the pursuit of knowledge (at
different levels, of course).
Whether or not this noble ideal
was ever attained is not now
easy to say, since the concept
of the University was in time
perverted to ignoble ends by
persons who merely professed
to have knowledge.
This perversion was made
manifest, in part, by professors
who move through the mechani
cal motions of "teaching" in a
dull and routine pattern, there
by inhibiting questions from stu
dents and repressing the desire
to learn, and, at the graduate
level, when a student is accepted
for research by such a professor,
he is subject to a distinctly im
polite and domineering first in
terview which further effectively
inhibits any questions from the
student and thereby interdicts
any possible learning from the
professor.
Following the initial interview
the student is given routine or
preliminary work to do, and, as
a very junior member of the re
search group, usually does not
speak to the professor again for
the next six months. At the be
ginning of the student's sec
ond year the professor conde
scends occasionally to stop by,
although he is careful never to
tarry for more than a minute
or two at a time, and only at
rare intervals at that.
He never looks directly at the
student when he does stop, hr

has very little to say, and no
matter how much work the stu
dent has done, or of what qual
ity, it is never enough, not even
enough for an intelligible com
ment: all the student can hope
for is a grunt (hmg) or a mum
ble (mightbeallright) as the
mentor acts out the part of the
wool-gathering, absent-minded
professor who never remembers
what the student has done be
fore and apparently never hears
an argument, or at least does
not understand. Since the pro
fessor never does anything, he
never makes a mistake, and
thereby maintains a very thin
illusion of infallibility.
In the second year the student
is also required to partake of
irrationally abstruse "problem
sets" which are deliberately writ
ten to cover material not pre
sented in any course, which ma
terial the student is supposed
to have gleaned on his own from
the vast stores of data accumu
lated in the library: these prob
lem sets are never returned
graded, and they are rarely re
turned at all. In this way the
student has no way to check
his work on the "problem sets"
that he is required to pass, and
no discernable credit for what
ever research he has done.
Meanwhile, the attitude of the
professor toward the group col
lectively is one of gay repartee
and snide remarks, designed to
produce a superficial atmosphere
of cheer and also to establish a
cascade of disdain, to drive each
student toward frantic endeav
ors to avoid oppobrium among
his fellows. The contrast be
tween the disparate attitudes of
the professor toward the indivi
dual and the group produces an
irreconcilable Alicein-Wonder
land effect whereby each student
is lead to believe that he is the
only one having some unspeci
fied "trouble" with problem sets
and research, while everyone

else is having a good time.
The upshot of this is that each
individual student falsely con
cludes that getting a Ph.D. has
turned out to be too difficult for
him, even though he has in
vested at least two years' work,
and most often the student
breaks under the strain, con
fesses to his professor, and
either threatens, or begs, to quit.
The professor forgives him.
There's a purpose to this.
After the professor says, well,
he'll see what he can do about
the problem sets, the student
hobbles away to continue re
search under conditions much as
before, until, about the fourth
year, the professor suddenly pre
tends to become "aware" of him
again, he shows increasing im
patience and voices concern
about the quality of the pro
posed thesis. In any case, the
student writes his thesis and is
then subject to an oral exami
nation by faculty members, from
which examination other stu
dents are excluded.
Now, horror of horrors, at the
end of four years' work, the
student flunks his orals. This
flunking of the orals is often ac
complished by one of the pro
fessors, not the student's major
professor asking exhaustive
questions, such as, "Who do
you think should win a Nobel
prize? — Who else? — Who
else?" and after the student has
exhausted his stock, the profes
sor. who has been reading the
literature longer and more
thoroughly than the student,
demands, "What about Suchand
such? — Suchandsuch? — Such
andsuch?" thus forcing the stu
dent to say, "I don't know ... I
don't know ... I don't know,"
until the professor can say,
"You don't know much of any
thing, do you?" (this has actual
ly happened).
And, in general, said professor
raises his voice, acts indignant,

and otherwise pretends to be
shocked and disgusted at how
little the student knows. The mo
jor professor looks embarrassed.
After the show is over they
send him out of the room, they
let him sweat awhile, and then
the major professor "saves" him
from orals the same way he had
"saved" him from the problem
sets — he comes down, hands
him the copies of his thesis, and
says, "Okay, you passed."
In other words, the student
is supposed to think that he got
through somehow by mistake,
on the good graces or the error
of the professor, and thus he
passes into the "real" world
equipped with a life-long neuro
sis, fraudulently convinced that
he has no real ability, feeling
that he's failed in life at the one
point where he wanted most to
succeed, congratulated by his
family for a degree he "knows"
he didn't earn, unable to explain
to himself or to others just why
things turned out so different
from what they'd seemed to
promise, and as a finale, his syn
thetic feelings of guilt, or grati
tude, are used to extract the
maximum amount of money
from him in his subsequent em
ployment, payable to the Uni
versity.
The refinements and varia
tions of this technique are truly
remarkable to see, and the stu
dent, you will recall, thinks he
is the only member of his class
to "flunk" this way. After pass
ing through such an experience
the student (product) has no
confidence in himself, doubts his
own judgment, lives in fear of
having his "incompetency" found
out again, and is strongly sus
ceptible to suggestion from pro
fessors, whom he regards as
being far superior to himself:
he's just one little lemming, and
he goes where all the others go.
