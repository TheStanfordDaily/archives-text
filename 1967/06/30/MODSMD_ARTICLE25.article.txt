# The
						Movie Scene
## Another 'Massage' 
### Jurgen Wolff 
Walt Disney's film company,
long noted for "message" pic
tures, has done it again with
"Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs", now playing at Palo
Alto's Varsity Theatre. In this
thinly - disguised propaganda
movie, distinguished government
figures are insultingly repre
sented by cartoon dwarfs; there
is little doubt, for example, that
the bald, big-eared Dopey is a
caricature of Dean Rusk.
But the most vicious represen
tation is of the evil witch, who
has an unmistakable LBJ nose
and chin. Throughout the pic
ture she offers delicious apples
with poison cores, an obvious
reference to our President's for
eign aid program.
Goodbye Witch
The most blatant part of the
picture is the downfall of the
witch (LBJ) at the hands of a
pretty person who can sing and
dance and act. Although she may
be called "Snow White" in the
picture, there is little doubt that
the Disney people are in fact
boosting the presidential candi
dacy of Ronald Reagan.
In a lighter vein is "You Only
Live Twice" at the Stanford
Theatre, also in Palo Alto. Plot
wise it seems that someone is
stealing U.S. and Russian space
ships while they orbit. Since the
FBI can't figure it out, James
Bond is called to solve the case,
as he indeed does, some twenty
girls, two hundred villans, and
two hours later.
This is the last Bond flick to
star Sean Connery, and an enter
taining way to kill time.
What's It All About?
At the Bijou, Michael Caine
is "Alfie", and a cast, of thou
sands ask the musical question
"Is Paris Burning?". It takes
entirely too long to ascertain
that Paris isn't and won't, but
"Alfie" is highly recommended.
Alfie begins the movie as a
handsome rat who goes after
and gets every skirt in town
(London). This affords him great
pleasure, but slowly he sees how
his activities are hurting the
girls who can't understand his
desire not to get involved with
things like marriage.
The End
Finally, in a lustful moment,
he seduces the wife of an ill
friend, duly making an abortion
necessary. He decides to settle
down with a former female com
panion, only to find that she has

thrown him over for a younger
man. As he walks off into the
fog we presume that he has
finally realized that good is
nicer than evil.
The movie brings up some
relevant points about human re
lations, and is worth seeing if
only to hear the title song again.
