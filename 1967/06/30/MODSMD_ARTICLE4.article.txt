# Anti-War Groups Protest Current Draft Policy
## 
### DEBORAH KAPLAN 
Students for a Democratic Society
at Stanford and the Anti-Draft Union
kicked-off this summer's protest ac
tivities Wednesday in White Plaza.
The main anti-war program, Viet
nam Summer, was described by Peter
Ware of the SDS as, "a project to
reach the millions of citizens in com
munities across the nation who op
pose the war in Vietnam but whose
voices have not yet been heard."
Ware went on to outline the new
draft law and its effect on those op
posing the draft. He called it "an at
tempt to crackdown on anyone who
is against the draft." The new law,
according to Ware, does not allow ap
peals of one's draft classification, and

does not permit conscientious ob
jectors a waiting period while they
are being investigated.
"We can't afford to give in, to let
the government coerce us into fight
ing an unjust war," Ware said.
Mix-Up
There had been a mix-up as to
date of the rally, which was blamed on
the University's "rigid Bureaucracy"
by John Saari, SDS organizer of the
protest.
Other speakers at the rally describ
ed their part in Vietnam Summer and
related organizations.
Mary Lou Greenberg introduced the
newly-formed Women Against the
Draft, which is planning a picket pro
test to be held today at the Army Re

cruiting Center in Palo Alto from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m.
Non-Cooperation
Stuart Mcßae estimated that about
1,000 men will announce their inten
tions of non-cooperation with the Se
lective Service this October.
Mcßae explained that men taking
part in this plan must be willing, to
face five years of imprisonment and
heavy fines. According to Mcßae, the
group seeks, "not martyrdom, not
moral witness, but a real resistance."
Kit Anderton called for volunteers
to go door-to-door, lead discussions,
coordinate residential areas in the
mid-peninsula, and work in the Viet
nam Summer Project's office.
Dave Ranson, an editor of The Mid
peninsula Observer, promised publi
cation of stories about world events
so far never printed. "We've got the
material and we're going to print it,"
he said, referring also to certain pic
tures of the anti-Johnson rally last
week in Los Angeles.


The Lomita Mall as it is supposed to appear when the new buildings are completed. In addition to walks and trees,
the area will be graced by an absence of cars. Campus drive will be congested all day long. Hooray!

Non-Cooperation
Stuart Mcßae estimated that about
1,000 men will announce their inten
tions of non-cooperation with the Se
lective Service this October.
Mcßae explained that men taking
part in this plan must be willing, to
face five years of imprisonment and
heavy fines. According to Mcßae, the
group seeks, "not martyrdom, not
moral witness, but a real resistance."
Kit Anderton called for volunteers
to go door-to-door, lead discussions,
coordinate residential areas in the
mid-peninsula, and work in the Viet
nam Summer Project's office.
Dave Ranson, an editor of The Mid
peninsula Observer, promised publi
cation of stories about world events
so far never printed. "We've got the
material and we're going to print it,"
he said, referring also to certain pic
tures of the anti-Johnson rally last
week in Los Angeles.

the area will be graced by an absence of cars. Campus drive will be congested all day long. Hooray!
Students for a Democratic Society
at Stanford and the Anti-Draft Union
kicked-off this summer's protest ac
tivities Wednesday in White Plaza.
The main anti-war program, Viet
nam Summer, was described by Peter
Ware of the SDS as, "a project to
reach the millions of citizens in com
munities across the nation who op
pose the war in Vietnam but whose
voices have not yet been heard."
Ware went on to outline the new
draft law and its effect on those op
posing the draft. He called it "an at
tempt to crackdown on anyone who
is against the draft." The new law,
according to Ware, does not allow ap
peals of one's draft classification, and

does not permit conscientious ob
jectors a waiting period while they
are being investigated.
"We can't afford to give in, to let
the government coerce us into fight
ing an unjust war," Ware said.
Mix-Up
There had been a mix-up as to
date of the rally, which was blamed on
the University's "rigid Bureaucracy"
by John Saari, SDS organizer of the
protest.
Other speakers at the rally describ
ed their part in Vietnam Summer and
related organizations.
Mary Lou Greenberg introduced the
