# BALLET REVIEW
## Joffrey Offers Inspiring Show 
### PENNY NILAND 
My entirely uncritical and amazed
reaction to rhe Joffrey Ballet which
opened the Stanford Summer Festi
val Tuesday night was — WOW!
Having never seen a ballet before,
I may, perhaps, be allowed so simple
a reaction.
However, faced with the necessity
of producing a review, I am forced to
expand a little on the WOW!
Viva Vivaldi
Tuesday's program consisted of
four ballets. The first, Viva Vivaldi
was a visualization in black and white
of a piece by Antonio Vivaldi. The
predominately gentle mood of the
piece was broken in the fourth and
final movement by the almost dem
onic dancing of Robert Blankshine.
Opus 65 was a harshly beautiful
"modern" dance done with the per
formers clad in variations on blue
jeans and sweat shirts.
Sea Shadow, danced by Lisa Brad
ley and Dermot Burke, was a ballet
of love between two undersea crea
tures who moved like fish in human
form.
For the finale of the evening, the

entire company assembled for a min
strel show. Cakewalk showed off the
humorous talents of the company as
they spoofed romantic ballet and
stalked the stage as magicians.
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect
of the ballet for a beginning observer
is the constant tension between the
dancer's desire for perfect grace and
fluidity and the limitations imposed
by gravity and their own bodies.
Grace — Sweat
One hears the thunk of feet on the
stage, sees the heavy breathing and
the sweat. The grace of the dancer is
not the natural grace of humans but
a grace acquired by incredible work.
But their grace is something which
most of us would like to share —
something we wish were our natural
way.
"Mommy, wouldn't you like to be
able to do that?" whispered a little
boy sitting in back of me.
Imaginary Dancers
Perhaps we all carry in our minds
the image of ourselves as dancers —
working and eating and loving and
walking, to music which only we can
hear.

A ballet is, for this reason, both a
beautiful and a terrible experience.
We see objectified our own at
tempts to escape the physical limits
of our bodies. We see that their at
tempts also fail in the end. And we
see real dancers moving to real mu
sic and we realize that our dance is
only in our minds.

But the beauty of the ballet is in
knowing that if we ourselves are not
dancers — other members of our
species are.
This year's Summer Festival has
opened magnificantly. We hope that
it will continue throughout the sum
mer on the same level.
