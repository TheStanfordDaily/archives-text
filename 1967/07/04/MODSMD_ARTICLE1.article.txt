Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
THE DAILY: As you know, the Columbia
Broadcasting System recently presented its
study of the Warren Commission Report —
a study designed to clear up all doubts about
the death of John F. Kennedy. What would
be your short analysis of their efforts?
MR. LANE: It was the Mickey Mouse version
of the Warren Report.
THE DAILY: What about Walter Cronkite?
MR. LANE: Ah — Walter Cronkite. . . . View
ers telephoned last Thursday when I was on
the CBS television affiliate in Pittsburgh
the day after the CBS "epic" had been con
cluded. One lady called and asked — "Why
would Walter Cronkite say anything that was
untrue?" Well, he has been presenting the
CBS version of the news for years and he is
used to that position. But I think it's un
fortunate that CBS presented its star for the
purpose of endorsing the Warren Report —
like Stan Musial vouching for Wheaties. How
ever, one cannot really be too angry with
Walter Cronkite for presenting the false
statements, any more than one would be angry
with Charlie McCarthy for doing the same
thing. If CBS had concluded that 12 men
killed President Kennedy and that Lee Harvey
Oswald was in Podunk when the shots were
fired, you can just imagine how Walter Cronk
ite, speaking intimately yet forcefully, would
have presented that information: "Ladies and
gentlemen, 12 men killed your President at

the time that Lop Harvey Oswald, whom the
Commission said was guilty, was actually in
Podunk."
THE DAILY: What else happened in Pitts
burgh ?
MR. LANE: They were kind enough to give
me one hour to answer some of the false
statements made by Mr. Cronkite and other
CBS employees. It was a contact program
where the viewers called in. The majority of
them did not believe the CBS version of the
events. As a result, CBS' Pittsburgh affiliate
has decided to conduct a poll among its
listeners, and has asked those who watched
the four-hour program to write in and express
their position. Perhaps in two or three weeks
we will have the results of that CBS survey,
which they have said they will make available
to me.
THE DAILY: How did it strike you that one of
CBS' exi>ert witnesses was Lawrence Schiller,
author of "The Scavengers," a book that has,
as you know, been highly critical of "Rush To
Judgment"?
MR. LANE: CBS had one photographic ex
pert on its program to deal with the question
of the evident disparity of the shadow forma
tions in the Life cover photo which alleged
ly showed Oswald holding a rifle. CBS referred
to Lawrence Schiller as a "photographic ex
pert" who had made an "independent study."
CBS never told its viewers that Lawrence

Schiller is none other than Jack Ruby's for
mer business agent; the gentlemen who sold
Jack Ruby's story to the Hearst publications,
keeping one-third of the proceeds for himself,
and who then went around calling other peo
ple scavengers. Of all the photographers in
the United States available to CBS, I think
it is startling that they picked a person who
is so tainted by bias, and then presented him
as an independent expert.
THE DAILY: What about some of the other
tests conducted in the CBS analysis?
MR. LANE: CBS concluded that their exami
nation of the Zapruder film showed that one
shot was fired at frame 186, when the Presi
dential limousine was emerging from two
branches — insofar as the view from the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository is
concerned — and that the next shot was fired
37 frames thereafter. But CBS never indicated
that this conclusion — if true — proved that
Oswald could not possibly have been the lone
assassin. According to the PBI expert who
tested the alleged assassination weapon, not
a similar one, but the alleged assassination
weapon itself, the rifle required an absolute
minimum of 2.3 seconds for reloading. In
terms of the Zapruder film, this means that
there must be an absolute minimum, between
one shot and another, of 42 frames. The rifle
just could not work any faster than that. If
CBS was right that one shot was fired at
frame 186, and the next shot was fired 37

frames thereafter, CBS did render a valuable
service after all. It proved conclusively that
Oswald could not have been the lone assassin
with the alleged murder weapon. But CBS
neglected to share the implications of its con
clusions when that would not have suited its
purposes. Another test was supposed to find
out whether one bullet — Commission Ex
hibit 399 — could have gone through the
President's neck, the Governor's back, shat
tered the Governor's fifth rib, shattered the
Governor's right wrist and then made its way
into his left thigh. This, of course, is the
Commission's case, and CBS said rightly that
if one bullet did not do that, then the only
other alternative was that there was more
than one assassin. CBS then set about trying
to prove that one bullet could have performed
all the feats that the Commission attributed
to it. You may recall the full-page ads in the
New York Times and other newspapers which
showed Commission Exhibit 399. It appears to
have an almost pure and pristine shape —
certainly the nose of it was completely un
damaged. In the ads, CBS said: "This is the
bullet that struck both men. Or did it?"
THE DAILY: How did they perform the
test you refer to?
MR. LANE: They used the so-called "gelatin
test." It was conducted in this fashion: A
gelatin block was constructed to represent
President Kennedy's neck. The bullet was to
be fired through this. Another gelatin block

was constructed to represent Governor Con
nally's chest. But it is interesting to note here
that there was no substance in the block to
represent the rib shattered by the bullet. Dr.
Olivier, who supervised the test for CBS —
and who, incidentally, is a veterinarian — ad
mitted this, but said the test would show how
the bullet proceeded through the flesh any
way. If Governor Connally's flesh was made
out of gelatin, I suppose that would be so.
In any event, the bullet went through that
gelatin block. However, instead of the wrist of
a cadaver, which is what the Commission used,
CBS used a piece of masonite in a gelatin
block to simulate Connally's wrist. In some
cases, the bullet made its way into that sub
stance, but not a single bullet went through
those substances and then found its way into
the gelatin block CBS used for Governor
Connally's thigh. This was in the absence of
any bullet having to strike a bone substance
simulating the Governor's badly-shattered fifth
rib. What did the CBS test prove? It proved
that no matter how many times they tried,
they could not get a bullet to do what the
Commission said Exhibit 399 did. Secondly,
CBS refused to show its viewers what those
bullets looked like after they had been spent
in their efforts.
THE DAILY: Is that why you refer to Exhibit
399 as the "Magic Bullet"?
