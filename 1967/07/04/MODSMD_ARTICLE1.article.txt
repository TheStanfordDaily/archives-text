# A 						Victim Analyzes CBS' 'Warren' Report
## 
### 
Copyright 1967, The Stanford Daily
THE DAILY: As you know, the Columbia
Broadcasting System recently presented its
study of the Warren Commission Report —
a study designed to clear up all doubts about
the death of John F. Kennedy. What would
be your short analysis of their efforts?
MR. LANE: It was the Mickey Mouse version
of the Warren Report.
THE DAILY: What about Walter Cronkite?
MR. LANE: Ah — Walter Cronkite. . . . View
ers telephoned last Thursday when I was on
the CBS television affiliate in Pittsburgh
the day after the CBS "epic" had been con
cluded. One lady called and asked — "Why
would Walter Cronkite say anything that was
untrue?" Well, he has been presenting the
CBS version of the news for years and he is
used to that position. But I think it's un
fortunate that CBS presented its star for the
purpose of endorsing the Warren Report —
like Stan Musial vouching for Wheaties. How
ever, one cannot really be too angry with
Walter Cronkite for presenting the false
statements, any more than one would be angry
with Charlie McCarthy for doing the same
thing. If CBS had concluded that 12 men
killed President Kennedy and that Lee Harvey
Oswald was in Podunk when the shots were
fired, you can just imagine how Walter Cronk
ite, speaking intimately yet forcefully, would
have presented that information: "Ladies and
gentlemen, 12 men killed your President at

the time that Lop Harvey Oswald, whom the
Commission said was guilty, was actually in
Podunk."
THE DAILY: What else happened in Pitts
burgh ?
MR. LANE: They were kind enough to give
me one hour to answer some of the false
statements made by Mr. Cronkite and other
CBS employees. It was a contact program
where the viewers called in. The majority of
them did not believe the CBS version of the
events. As a result, CBS' Pittsburgh affiliate
has decided to conduct a poll among its
listeners, and has asked those who watched
the four-hour program to write in and express
their position. Perhaps in two or three weeks
we will have the results of that CBS survey,
which they have said they will make available
to me.
THE DAILY: How did it strike you that one of
CBS' exi>ert witnesses was Lawrence Schiller,
author of "The Scavengers," a book that has,
as you know, been highly critical of "Rush To
Judgment"?
MR. LANE: CBS had one photographic ex
pert on its program to deal with the question
of the evident disparity of the shadow forma
tions in the Life cover photo which alleged
ly showed Oswald holding a rifle. CBS referred
to Lawrence Schiller as a "photographic ex
pert" who had made an "independent study."
CBS never told its viewers that Lawrence

Schiller is none other than Jack Ruby's for
mer business agent; the gentlemen who sold
Jack Ruby's story to the Hearst publications,
keeping one-third of the proceeds for himself,
and who then went around calling other peo
ple scavengers. Of all the photographers in
the United States available to CBS, I think
it is startling that they picked a person who
is so tainted by bias, and then presented him
as an independent expert.
THE DAILY: What about some of the other
tests conducted in the CBS analysis?
MR. LANE: CBS concluded that their exami
nation of the Zapruder film showed that one
shot was fired at frame 186, when the Presi
dential limousine was emerging from two
branches — insofar as the view from the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository is
concerned — and that the next shot was fired
37 frames thereafter. But CBS never indicated
that this conclusion — if true — proved that
Oswald could not possibly have been the lone
assassin. According to the PBI expert who
tested the alleged assassination weapon, not
a similar one, but the alleged assassination
weapon itself, the rifle required an absolute
minimum of 2.3 seconds for reloading. In
terms of the Zapruder film, this means that
there must be an absolute minimum, between
one shot and another, of 42 frames. The rifle
just could not work any faster than that. If
CBS was right that one shot was fired at
frame 186, and the next shot was fired 37

frames thereafter, CBS did render a valuable
service after all. It proved conclusively that
Oswald could not have been the lone assassin
with the alleged murder weapon. But CBS
neglected to share the implications of its con
clusions when that would not have suited its
purposes. Another test was supposed to find
out whether one bullet — Commission Ex
hibit 399 — could have gone through the
President's neck, the Governor's back, shat
tered the Governor's fifth rib, shattered the
Governor's right wrist and then made its way
into his left thigh. This, of course, is the
Commission's case, and CBS said rightly that
if one bullet did not do that, then the only
other alternative was that there was more
than one assassin. CBS then set about trying
to prove that one bullet could have performed
all the feats that the Commission attributed
to it. You may recall the full-page ads in the
New York Times and other newspapers which
showed Commission Exhibit 399. It appears to
have an almost pure and pristine shape —
certainly the nose of it was completely un
damaged. In the ads, CBS said: "This is the
bullet that struck both men. Or did it?"
THE DAILY: How did they perform the
test you refer to?
MR. LANE: They used the so-called "gelatin
test." It was conducted in this fashion: A
gelatin block was constructed to represent
President Kennedy's neck. The bullet was to
be fired through this. Another gelatin block

was constructed to represent Governor Con
nally's chest. But it is interesting to note here
that there was no substance in the block to
represent the rib shattered by the bullet. Dr.
Olivier, who supervised the test for CBS —
and who, incidentally, is a veterinarian — ad
mitted this, but said the test would show how
the bullet proceeded through the flesh any
way. If Governor Connally's flesh was made
out of gelatin, I suppose that would be so.
In any event, the bullet went through that
gelatin block. However, instead of the wrist of
a cadaver, which is what the Commission used,
CBS used a piece of masonite in a gelatin
block to simulate Connally's wrist. In some
cases, the bullet made its way into that sub
stance, but not a single bullet went through
those substances and then found its way into
the gelatin block CBS used for Governor
Connally's thigh. This was in the absence of
any bullet having to strike a bone substance
simulating the Governor's badly-shattered fifth
rib. What did the CBS test prove? It proved
that no matter how many times they tried,
they could not get a bullet to do what the
Commission said Exhibit 399 did. Secondly,
CBS refused to show its viewers what those
bullets looked like after they had been spent
in their efforts.
THE DAILY: Is that why you refer to Exhibit
399 as the "Magic Bullet"?
MR. LANE: I call it that be
cause it did what no real bullet
has since been able to do. CBS
was very selective in its pres
entation of evidence. I know
about this, because CBS did its
first documentary on the assas
sination back in September, 1964,
though people have perhaps for
gotten it. Subsequent to that
program, after Emile de Antonio
and I decided to do a film on
the assassination, de Antonio
called Virginia Dillard, the film
librarian at CBS, and asked if we
might see the out-takes from
that program for our own docu
mentary. An out-take is simply
a portion of film which isn't
utilized in the final product. We
went to CBS headquarters in
New York City and examined
footage for hours. We saw ma
terial of this kind: A witness in
Dealey Plaza would be asked
where he thought the shots came
from. His answer would indicate
that he thought the shots came
from the grassy knoll. The di
rector would say "Cut," and they
would do the scene over again.
When the scene was re-shot, the
witness would say: "Well, now
I am sort of inclined to think
that the shots came from the
Book Depository building."
There would bo another cut, and
this process would go on until
CBS had an acceptable state
ment for their program: "I now
believe that the shots came from
the Book Depository building,"
without any of the earlier ma
terial finding its way to the view
er. That program was a fraud; it
bore very little relationship to
what the witnesses originally
told CBS. The second documen
tary is equally susceptible to
criticism. Walter Cronkite made
one false statement after an
other, and Eric Sevareid indulg
ed himself too. Sevareid said
that the notion that Mr. Warren
and his colleagues suppressed
information is "idiotic." If he
had trotted over to the National
Archives, he would have dis
covered that some of the most
basic evidence in the case is
presently suppressed — no one
can see it. Mr. Cronkite offered
his opinion that the material
should be made available to in
dependent pathologists at the
leading universities. Perhaps
now that Mr. Cronkite has made
this request there'll be some
action.
THE DAILY: CBS seemed to
place great faith in assassination
witness Chas. Brehm. Is there
any justification for his criti
cisms of you?
MR. LANE: Charles Brehm was
the 1 closest spectator
to the limousine when the fatal
shots struck tne President. He
was never called to testify be
fore the Warren Commission,
and never questioned by its
counsel. But he was questioned
by me in t!*e presence of a
number of witnesses. It was
tape-recorded, filmed, and is now
playing at leading theaters
around the country. He never
said to me that the shots came
from the grassy knoll, and I
have never said that he said
that. CBS also charged that I
said Brehm had told me that he
said a substance that was skull
material fly to the left and rear
of the Presidential limousine.
Brehm very correctly denied
that. All Brehm said was that it
"appeared" to be skull material.
A portion of the President's
skull was found just where

Brehm said he saw a substance
fly. The only reference to Brehm
in Rush To Judgment — and
for citation purposes, I am now
making reference to the Fawcett
paperback edition — appears on
page 45. Exactly the same ma
terial appears in the hardbound
edition but on a different page.
This is the only reference to
Brehm. And I quote from it:
"Another eyewitness, Chas.
Brehm, standing with his young
son at the south curb of Elm,
was approximately 20 feet from
the limousine when the bullet
shattered the President's head.
'I very definitely saw the effect
of the second bullet that struck
the President,' Brehm told me
in an interview. 'That which ap
peared to be a part of the Presi
dent's skull went flying slightly
to the rear- of the President's car
and directly to its left. It did
fly over to the curb to the left
and to the rear,' he said." What
CBS apparently did was to make
a false statement to Brehm
about what I had said that he
had said. But, if you listened to
the program, you know that
Brehm, on CBS, confirmed every
single word in my book regard
ing him. This was CBS' artful,
not to say deceitful, use of a
witness to attack Rush To Judg-

ment. This was the only allega
tion CBS made to show that my
book was inaccurate — but it
proved more about CBS than it
did about "facts." Therefore, I've
sent a telegram to the president
of CBS and demanded equal
time to answer those entirely
false charges. I've sent a copy
of that wire to the Federal Com
munications Commission. I hope
that the ordinary rules will ap
ply in this case, but I'm not too
hopeful, since, in a sense, the
CBS program was a contract for
the United States Government.
THE DAILY: Why do you think
CBS called Edward Jay Epstein
the "most persuasive" critic of
the Warren Commission?
MR. LANE: I presume because
his position, compared to that
of the other critics, comes clos
est to accepting the conclusions
of the Warren Commission's Re
|M>rt. As a matter of fact, when
I was first contacted by Robert
Richter, one of the assistant
producers of the program, he
told me that I would not be on
at all, that the only critic
who would be on was Epstein.
I asked why, and Richter told
me: "CBS says he's respectable."
THE DAILY: An- you ealling
Edward Jay Epstein a "straw
man ?"
MR. LANE: No. I wouldn't go
that far. I would say that he
did a valuable work by inter
viewing members of the Com
mission. I am sorry that he did
not use a tape recorder or some
other device, so that he might
be able to verify the quota
tions which he published, most,
if not all of which, I believe
to be accurate.
THE DAILY: Were you offended
by Dan Rather's statement that
Oswald's shot from the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book
Depository was an "easy" one?

MR. LANE: No. I was amused.
The U.S. Government secured
three of the best rifle experts it
could find, and had them fire at
stationary targets which were
supposed to simulate the mov
ing target that Oswald alleged
ly fired at. The tower from
which they fired was only 30
feet above the ground, whereas
Oswald was allegedly 60 feet
above the ground. Oswald al
legedly had only eight-tenths of
one second to get off his first
shot after the President came
into view. To "simulate" this,
the three experts were told to
take as much time for their
first shots. The target was also
much larger than the one that
Oswald was allegedly firing at
— the head of the President.
Even though conditions were
much less strenuous, of the 18
shots the experts fired, not one
struck the head or neck of the
target. According to his last re
corded score in the Marine
Corps, Oswald was described as
a "rather poor shot." Since three
of the most proficient riflemen
in the United States were un
able to do what Oswald alleged
ly did, I think Dan Rather's
statement is an insult to the in
telligence of the American peo
ple. Incidentally, the Army con
ducted the tests, not the E. 8.1.,
as CBS erroneously stated.
THE DAILY: What about the
evidence CBS presented concern
ing: Jack Ruby's motives for
shooting Oswald? Why isn't it
strong enough for you?
MR. LANE: Well, they had three
people who came on to discuss
that question — two were anon
ymous strippers, one of whom
said that Jack Ruby murdered
Oswald to increase business at
his night club. They also had
one of Ruby's competitors, who
felt the same way. It hardly
seems to me that this was
serious evidence, especially since
the strippers didn't seem to have
names. I'm embarrassed that
CBS chose that method to prove
Jack .Ruby's motivation and
overlooked the massive amount
of material showing more likely
causes. Furthermore, Walter
Cronkite pontificated that Jack
Ruby went to his death main
taining that he killed Oswald
to spare Jackie Kennedy the
trip back to Dallas for the trial.
That statement is entirely false.
On March 27, 1967, Newsweek
said, and I quote: "No one will
ever know for sure what Jack
Ruby was thinking when he kill
ed Lee Harvey Oswald, but one
of the reasons he frequently
gave, now seems to have been
a deliberate falsehood. In 1964,
Ruby, who feared that his cell
was bugged, signalled lawyer
Joe Tonahill for a sheet of note
paper and a pencil. He scribbled
a note that Tonahill has only
now revealed, that read, 'Joe,
you should know this. Tom

didn't have a "petit fuehrer" in
charge of it. Even Beria didn't
last that long. From Hoover's
viewpoint, President's are mere
transients who move in and out
of the White House but who are
not allowed to interfere with his
domain. 1 think that's a very
dangerous situation for any
democratic society. This is sup
posed to be ademocratic society,
isn't it?
THE DAILY: We leave rash
statements to others.
MR. LANE: Yes. Well, I think
Mr. Hoover's attempts to sup
press my book are minor com
pared with some of the other
things he and the FBI have at
tempted — not the least of
which is to subborn perjury. Nel
son Delgado, Oswald's Marine
Corps buddy, testified that Os
wald could speak Spanish. Del
gado, in fact, taught him to
speak Spanish. He also said that
Oswald was a poor shot with a
rifle. According to Delgado's
testimony FBI agents tried to
have Delgado alter his position
so that he would say that Os
wald was, in fact, a good shot
but • that he could not speak
Spanish. These were the charges
made by Delgado when he testi
fied before the Commission. The
Commission never even bothered
to call the FBI agents who were
charged with attempted sub
bordination of perjury.
TirK DAILY: In light of your
comments on Mr. Hoover, if it
were ever proved that the Com
mission attempted to color or
change testimony, would you
favor a similar fate for Earl
Warren?
MR. LANE: Anyone who had
important information regard
ing the death of the President,
and who suppressed that infor
mation, is, in my view, an ac-

Howard told me to say that I
shot Oswald so that Caroline
and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have
to come to Dallas to testify.
O.K.?' Howard, now dead, was
Ruby's lawyer for a short time.
Ruby insisted to Tonahill that
he didn't know why he shot Os
wald." In the face of that state
ment, for Cronkite to say that
Ruby died maintaining that he
killed Oswald to spare Jackie
the trip to Dallas for the trial
can be called nothing short of
another deliberate falsehood,
THE DAILY: You recently told
"The Daily" that FBI chief J.
Edgar Hoover tried to intervene
with Holt, Rinehart, and Win
ston to keep "Rush To Judg
ment" from being published. In
view of this, what kind of sanc
tion, if any, would you favor
against Mr. Hoover?
MR. LANE: Not for what he
tried to do to me, but for what
he has been doing to this coun
try for forty years now, I think
J. Edgar Hoover should be re
moved from his important posi
tion. I suppose we will always
have to have a federal police
force, but it would be good if we

cessory after the fact — no
matter who that person is.
THE DAILY: Do you think the
CBS programs add credence to
the views of Professor Kaplan?
MR. LANE: Who?
THE DAILY: Very well, then,
Mr. Lane. In concluding the CBS
inquiry Walter Cronkite said,
(and I quote: *'AII objections
vanish when exposed to the light
of honest inquiry." What do you
say to that?
MR. LANE: How would they
know?
THE DAILY: Thank you, Mr.
Lane.
