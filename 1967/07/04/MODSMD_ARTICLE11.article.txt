# Dr. Eisner To Teach Art To Tots
## 
### 
Fifteen minutes at the easel,
clad in Daddy's old shirt, may
give way to a much more struc
tured art curriculum for Palo
Alto kindergartners and first
graders under a new proposal
by Professor Eliot W. Eisner
of Stanford.
Dr. Eisner, professor of art
and education, has been granted
$70,000 by the Charles F. Ketter
ing Foundation for a two-year
study in which to develop teach
ing methods and a curriculum in
the visual arts for the first two
primary grades.
During the first year of the
study, September 1967 to August
1968, Professor Eisner and a
small staff will plan the curricu
lum and work out both teaching
methods and the necessary in
structional materials.
Field-Test
During the school year begin
ning in September 1968, Profes
sor Eisner and his staff will
field-test the methods in four
Palo Alto area schools and re
vise them if necessary before
they are officially launched as
part of the kindergarten and
first grade school day.
Basically, Professor Eisner
plans not only to stimulate the
artistic creativity of the young
sters but also to teach them criti
cal appraisal and something of
art history â€” tailored to their
learning level.
Five and six-year-olds can,
he believes, readily recognize
the relationship between "the
hardness, softness or fluid qual
ity of a medium and the char
acter of the work." This is the
beginning of art criticism, he
believes.
Art History
"Secondly," he notes, "chil
dren can begin to understand the
characteristics of a culture
agricultural, rural or urban
and the relationship of art to
these characteristics. This is the
beginning of art history."
Professor Eisner recently com
pleted a major study of artistic
learning in the U.S. high schools
and colleges, and another for a
Senate subcommittee in educa
tion on secondary and elemen
tary art curricula.
