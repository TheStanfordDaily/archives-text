# Thanks Again, Governor

Last April 13, "The Daily" printed a letter
from whielt the following excerpts are taken.
"... A man was gassed in San Quentin to
day The murdered murderer was convicted of
shooting a policeman. In Alabama today, a jail
er was acquitted of all guilt ofter beating a
prisoner to death. Five months ago, when Fat
Brown was in office, Aaron Mitchell would not
have taken those thirteen steps to death. Adolph
Hitler gassed those who were considered ene
mies ol the state, too, which only shows that
time and place have a lot to do with so-called
questions ol right and wrong."
The above sentiments were not those of the
Fditorial Board of Volume 151, though they
closely approximate them. The Editors of
Volume 151 A felt then that capital punishment
has no place in this or any other state, and still
do.
And that is why, on this, the hundred ninety
first anniversary of the American Colonies' dec
laration of independence from Great Britain,
we are happy to commend the recent actions
of Governor Bonald Kcagan in commuting to
life imprisonment without possibility of parole,
the death sentence ol 26-year-old Calvin
Thomas. |
Governor Heagan is an avowed proponent ol
capital punishment. It is the first time he has

done anything of this sort in his first six months
in office.
We think that capital punishment is not a
deterrent to anything, but that is not of the
greatest import to us at this time.
What is important, is that Governor Reagan
has proven us wrong. He has proven that he is,
indeed, a man of compassion. He has proved
that California can be a state with a conscience.
What we find so remarkable is that as budget
conscious as Heagan is, lit 1 went ahead and let
a human being live. He knows very well that
it will be much more expensive for the state
to support Calvin Thomas for the duration of
his life, than it would have been to have exe
cuted him and closed the matter. Alter all, Hea
gan could have said, "I'm only carrying out the
duties of my office," and let the final respon
sibility rest with someone else.
But he did not. And that is what will make
the difference. Whether he; realized it or not
(and we would like to suppose that he. did),
Reagan reaffirmed the humanity of every per
son in the State of California.
There are certain costs inherent in any
democratic situation. One of these is the dol
lars and cents cost of self-respect. In this light,
whatever we pay to feed, clothe, and house
Calvin Thomas, will have been a small price
indeed.â€”K. H.
