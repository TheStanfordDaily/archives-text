## To Hell With Redwood Trees 
### Kirk Hanen 
Prior to the last gubernatorial
election, Lady Bird Johnson flew
out to California as part of her
program for the beautifieation
of America.
High on her list of priorities
is the preservation of Califor
nia's centuries - old Redwood
trees, the majority of which are
located in Del Norte County.
Permit me a suggestion:
If Mrs. Johnson really wants
to do something to make Amer
ica beautiful, she can cover up
a national disgrace by putting
a burlap bag over her face.
Wasn't that a cruel thing to
say? After all, Mrs. Johnson
can't help it that she looks like
the product of a first cousin mar
riage between two wood
peckers.
And I hope someone points
this out to me. Because when
it happens, I'm going to tell that
person a little bit about real
cruelty. I'm going to tell him
about some of the 10,000 people
who stand to lose their jobs, be
cause cruel Lyndon Johnson,
cruel Stewart Udall, and cruel
Thomas Kuchel want to keep
the Miller Redwood Company
from cutting down and selling
Redwood trees which grow on
that firm's land. That's cruelty.
Whenever I discuss the Red
wood situation with anyone, I
can predict the reaction. It runs
something like this:
(1) "You must be putting me
on."
(2) "Everyone knows those
beautiful Redwood trees belong
to The People."
(3) "The Redwood trees are
so old."
(3a) "They're so beautiful."
(4) "How could anyone de
stroy a thing of beauty?"
(5) "The Redwoods will be
come extinct."
(6) "The citizens of Del Norte
County can get jobs elsewhere.
They're just common laborers.
They can be re-trained."
(7) "Why don't you go back
to Orange County where the
rest of the Righ-Wing crackpots
live?"
(8) "Watch yourself, Kirk.
You must not become emo
tional."
Here are my answers:
(2) No, the trees do not be
long to "The People" (no one
has ever defined that term to
my satisfaction); the redwood
trees belong to the person or
persons who hold title to the
land on which they grow; this
is not a question of eminent
domain, since there is nothing
necessary to the common good
about having Redwood trees.
(3) Yes. I quite agree.
(3a) No. I don't agree (but
who cares?).
(4) I do not know how any
one could destroy a thing of
beauty (but it is done every
day in the Middle East, and
many Americans seem willing to
join the slaughter). In case you
didn't get the hint, I think peo
ple are infinitely more beautiful
than any kind of tree.
(5) No. An emphatic no. It
is reassuring to learn that the
Redwoods are being scientifical
ly replaced. Even if not a single
Redwood had ever been touched,
the species would not have ef
fectively replenished its num
bers.
(6) Yes, they certainly can.
And so can you. So you may ex
pect a call from Washington
tomorrow morning. You will be
told that your house and lot are
so beautiful that they are being
turned into a national shrine.
You will be told that you have
24 hours to vacate the premises
before the sight seers start show
ing up. Naturally, you will be

paid for your property, but only
what the Government chooses
to give you. You may happen
to like your present surround
ings, but that doesn't matter:
The People have a right to their
"national beauty." Oh, yes, about
your job. Don't worry, you'll be
re-trained. You say you design
missiles for a living and you'd
like to continue doing so. Holy
Mother of God in blue tennis
shoes, don't be ridiculous! You
know we've got too many of
them on the coast right now.

You'll be re-trained to make
typewriters. You say you don't
think you'll be able to adjust.
Don't rock the boat! Just stop
any Japanese • American who
looks like he is old enough to
remember World War 11. He'll
give you a few tips on techni
que: Try to forget you're an
American citizen: and try to
forget you're supposed to be
protected by the Bill of Rights.
By the way, should we ever
meet again, we'll drink a toast to
beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty,

beauty, and the Era of Non-In
volvement.
(7) I'm sorry. I can't go home
again. I'm allergic to Walter
Knott, and he's pretty much per
vaded the atmosphere down
there.
(8) I will not watch myself.
I must become emotional. Emo
tion is the only weapon I have
left. .Reason fizzled out.
And: (You've been searching
for this one, haven't you.)
(1) No. I'm not, and neither
was George Orwell.

ica beautiful, she can cover up
a national disgrace by putting
a burlap bag over her face.
Wasn't that a cruel thing to
say? After all, Mrs. Johnson
can't help it that she looks like
the product of a first cousin mar
riage between two wood
peckers.
And I hope someone points
this out to me. Because when
it happens, I'm going to tell that
person a little bit about real
cruelty. I'm going to tell him
about some of the 10,000 people
who stand to lose their jobs, be
cause cruel Lyndon Johnson,
cruel Stewart Udall, and cruel
Thomas Kuchel want to keep
the Miller Redwood Company
from cutting down and selling
Redwood trees which grow on
that firm's land. That's cruelty.
Whenever I discuss the Red
wood situation with anyone, I
can predict the reaction. It runs
something like this:
(1) "You must be putting me
on."
(2) "Everyone knows those
beautiful Redwood trees belong
to The People."
(3) "The Redwood trees are
so old."
(3a) "They're so beautiful."
(4) "How could anyone de
stroy a thing of beauty?"
(5) "The Redwoods will be
come extinct."
(6) "The citizens of Del Norte
County can get jobs elsewhere.
They're just common laborers.
They can be re-trained."
(7) "Why don't you go back
to Orange County where the
rest of the Righ-Wing crackpots
live?"
(8) "Watch yourself, Kirk.
You must not become emo
tional."
Here are my answers:
(2) No, the trees do not be
long to "The People" (no one
has ever defined that term to
my satisfaction); the redwood
trees belong to the person or
persons who hold title to the
land on which they grow; this
is not a question of eminent
domain, since there is nothing
necessary to the common good
about having Redwood trees.
(3) Yes. I quite agree.
(3a) No. I don't agree (but
who cares?).
(4) I do not know how any
one could destroy a thing of
beauty (but it is done every
day in the Middle East, and
many Americans seem willing to
join the slaughter). In case you
didn't get the hint, I think peo
ple are infinitely more beautiful
than any kind of tree.
(5) No. An emphatic no. It
is reassuring to learn that the
Redwoods are being scientifical
ly replaced. Even if not a single
Redwood had ever been touched,
the species would not have ef
fectively replenished its num
bers.
(6) Yes, they certainly can.
And so can you. So you may ex
pect a call from Washington
tomorrow morning. You will be
told that your house and lot are
so beautiful that they are being
turned into a national shrine.
You will be told that you have
24 hours to vacate the premises
before the sight seers start show
ing up. Naturally, you will be

paid for your property, but only
what the Government chooses
to give you. You may happen
to like your present surround
ings, but that doesn't matter:
The People have a right to their
"national beauty." Oh, yes, about
your job. Don't worry, you'll be
re-trained. You say you design
missiles for a living and you'd
like to continue doing so. Holy
Mother of God in blue tennis
shoes, don't be ridiculous! You
know we've got too many of
them on the coast right now.

You'll be re-trained to make
typewriters. You say you don't
think you'll be able to adjust.
Don't rock the boat! Just stop
any Japanese • American who
looks like he is old enough to
remember World War 11. He'll
give you a few tips on techni
que: Try to forget you're an
American citizen: and try to
forget you're supposed to be
protected by the Bill of Rights.
By the way, should we ever
meet again, we'll drink a toast to
beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty,

beauty, and the Era of Non-In
volvement.
(7) I'm sorry. I can't go home
again. I'm allergic to Walter
Knott, and he's pretty much per
vaded the atmosphere down
there.
(8) I will not watch myself.
I must become emotional. Emo
tion is the only weapon I have
left. .Reason fizzled out.
And: (You've been searching
for this one, haven't you.)
(1) No. I'm not, and neither
was George Orwell.
Prior to the last gubernatorial
election, Lady Bird Johnson flew
out to California as part of her
program for the beautifieation
of America.
High on her list of priorities
is the preservation of Califor

trees, the majority of which are
located in Del Norte County.

cruelty. I'm going to tell him
about some of the 10,000 people
who stand to lose their jobs, be
cause cruel Lyndon Johnson,
cruel Stewart Udall, and cruel
Thomas Kuchel want to keep
the Miller Redwood Company
from cutting down and selling
Redwood trees which grow on
that firm's land. That's cruelty.
Whenever I discuss the Red
wood situation with anyone, I
can predict the reaction. It runs
something like this:
(1) "You must be putting me
on."
(2) "Everyone knows those
beautiful Redwood trees belong
to The People."
(3) "The Redwood trees are
so old."
(3a) "They're so beautiful."
(4) "How could anyone de
stroy a thing of beauty?"
(5) "The Redwoods will be
come extinct."
(6) "The citizens of Del Norte
County can get jobs elsewhere.
They're just common laborers.
They can be re-trained."
(7) "Why don't you go back
to Orange County where the
rest of the Righ-Wing crackpots
live?"
(8) "Watch yourself, Kirk.
You must not become emo
tional."
Here are my answers:
(2) No, the trees do not be
long to "The People" (no one
has ever defined that term to
my satisfaction); the redwood
trees belong to the person or
persons who hold title to the
land on which they grow; this
is not a question of eminent
domain, since there is nothing
necessary to the common good
about having Redwood trees.
(3) Yes. I quite agree.
(3a) No. I don't agree (but
who cares?).
(4) I do not know how any
one could destroy a thing of
beauty (but it is done every
day in the Middle East, and
many Americans seem willing to
join the slaughter). In case you
didn't get the hint, I think peo
ple are infinitely more beautiful
than any kind of tree.
(5) No. An emphatic no. It
is reassuring to learn that the
Redwoods are being scientifical
ly replaced. Even if not a single
Redwood had ever been touched,
the species would not have ef
fectively replenished its num
bers.
(6) Yes, they certainly can.
And so can you. So you may ex
pect a call from Washington
tomorrow morning. You will be
told that your house and lot are
so beautiful that they are being
turned into a national shrine.
You will be told that you have
24 hours to vacate the premises
before the sight seers start show
ing up. Naturally, you will be

paid for your property, but only
what the Government chooses
to give you. You may happen
to like your present surround
ings, but that doesn't matter:
The People have a right to their
"national beauty." Oh, yes, about
your job. Don't worry, you'll be
re-trained. You say you design
missiles for a living and you'd
like to continue doing so. Holy
Mother of God in blue tennis
shoes, don't be ridiculous! You
know we've got too many of
them on the coast right now.

You'll be re-trained to make
typewriters. You say you don't
think you'll be able to adjust.
Don't rock the boat! Just stop
any Japanese • American who
looks like he is old enough to
remember World War 11. He'll
give you a few tips on techni
que: Try to forget you're an
American citizen: and try to
forget you're supposed to be
protected by the Bill of Rights.
By the way, should we ever
meet again, we'll drink a toast to
beauty, beauty, beauty, beauty,

beauty, and the Era of Non-In
volvement.
(7) I'm sorry. I can't go home
again. I'm allergic to Walter
Knott, and he's pretty much per
vaded the atmosphere down
there.
(8) I will not watch myself.
I must become emotional. Emo
tion is the only weapon I have
left. .Reason fizzled out.
And: (You've been searching
for this one, haven't you.)
(1) No. I'm not, and neither
was George Orwell.
Prior to the last gubernatorial
election, Lady Bird Johnson flew
out to California as part of her
program for the beautifieation
of America.
High on her list of priorities
is the preservation of Califor
nia's centuries - old Redwood
trees, the majority of which are
located in Del Norte County.
Permit me a suggestion:
If Mrs. Johnson really wants
to do something to make Amer
ica beautiful, she can cover up
a national disgrace by putting
a burlap bag over her face.
Wasn't that a cruel thing to
say? After all, Mrs. Johnson
can't help it that she looks like
the product of a first cousin mar
riage between two wood
peckers.
And I hope someone points
this out to me. Because when
it happens, I'm going to tell that
person a little bit about real
cruelty. I'm going to tell him
about some of the 10,000 people
who stand to lose their jobs, be
cause cruel Lyndon Johnson,
