# City Council Considers New Hospital Proposal
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council is now
considering a plan which would al
low Stanford to take over the city's
220-bed wing at the Medical Center.
In exchange, Stanford is to build a
new 220-bed hospital for Palo Alto.
Approved by the City Finance Com
mittee last Thursday night, the plan
is yet to be acted upon by the Stan
ford Board of Trustees and the City
Council.
The proposal is consonant with an

earlier Stanford plan to buy the city's
wing for $5 million. The council, how
ever, rejected this plan last fall. As
an alternative, the University then
planned to build its own complete hos
pital. Dr. Robert Glaser, Dean of
the Stanford School of Medicine and
Vice President of Medical Affairs, was
unavailable to comment how the pres
ent proposal will affect this former
plan.
In any case, the present medical
center is inadequate for the Univer
sity's needs. According to Glaser, who
spoke at the Thursday night finance
committee meeting, the University's
200-bed wing is much too small to be
an efficient "teaching" hospital.
Tradition of Co-operation
If the current plan is carried out,
the city and university will be con
tinuing a tradition of co-operation on
medical care that goes back to 1921.
Since 1959 Palo Alto and Stanford
have jointly operated the $10.3 million
Medical Center. Of the original cost,
the city paid $4 million and the uni
versity paid $6.3 million.
The proposal would give the city
about 390 beds. Palo Alto already has
the 170-bed Hoover Pavilion and if
the new plan is carried through, it
would also have a 220-bed community
hospital.
The action of the Finance Com
mittee last Thursday night constitutes
"an interim policy statement." If
approved by the council, it directs the
city staff to start accumulating data
in conjunction with Stanford staff
workers.

Council Chairman Robert Cooley
and Councilman Edward Arnold, de
velopers of the idea, along with Coun
cilman Frank Gallagher, voted to rec
ommend that the entire council adopt
the statement. City Manager George
E. Morgan also supports the Cooley-
Arnold plan.
1,050 Hospital Beds Planned
If the program becomes a reality,
the Palo Alto area would have 1,050
hospital beds. The Cooley-Arnold re
port pointed out that "long-range as
sumptions indicate a satisfactory sit
uation four years hence, but would not
meet the interim bed need to 1971."
The two councilmen suggest, how
ever, that 75 to 100 beds could be
made available within a year by re
organizing facilities at the Palo Alto-
Stanford Medical Center. "We would
assume that construction of the re
maining beds would have to be timed
to the needs of the two parties, and
particularly to the provision of proper
supporting facilities," Cooley and Ar
nold noted in their written report,
which was distributed to all interested
parties on June 9.
The total estimated cost of the new
community hospital is between $20
and $25 million. It will have its own
director, with a board of trustees in
overall command. According to the
Cooley-Arnold plan the board could
be comprised of Palo Alto's six trus
tees, who with six trustees from
Stanford, make up the board of the
present Medical Center.


This is the Palo Alto-Stanford Medical Center. For over a year now Stanford has been trying to buy out Palo
Alto's share, but Palo Alto has its own ideas about how the question should be solved. vhoto by Bill Howell

ever, that 75 to 100 beds could be
made available within a year by re
organizing facilities at the Palo Alto-
Stanford Medical Center. "We would
assume that construction of the re
maining beds would have to be timed
to the needs of the two parties, and
particularly to the provision of proper
supporting facilities," Cooley and Ar
nold noted in their written report,
which was distributed to all interested
parties on June 9.
The total estimated cost of the new
community hospital is between $20
and $25 million. It will have its own
director, with a board of trustees in
overall command. According to the
Cooley-Arnold plan the board could
be comprised of Palo Alto's six trus
tees, who with six trustees from
Stanford, make up the board of the
present Medical Center.


This is the Palo Alto-Stanford Medical Center. For over a year now Stanford has been trying to buy out Palo
Alto's share, but Palo Alto has its own ideas about how the question should be solved. vhoto by Bill Howell
The Palo Alto City Council is now
considering a plan which would al
low Stanford to take over the city's
220-bed wing at the Medical Center.
In exchange, Stanford is to build a
new 220-bed hospital for Palo Alto.
Approved by the City Finance Com
mittee last Thursday night, the plan
is yet to be acted upon by the Stan
ford Board of Trustees and the City
Council.
The proposal is consonant with an

earlier Stanford plan to buy the city's
wing for $5 million. The council, how
ever, rejected this plan last fall. As
an alternative, the University then
planned to build its own complete hos
pital. Dr. Robert Glaser, Dean of
the Stanford School of Medicine and
Vice President of Medical Affairs, was
unavailable to comment how the pres
ent proposal will affect this former
plan.
In any case, the present medical
center is inadequate for the Univer
sity's needs. According to Glaser, who
spoke at the Thursday night finance
committee meeting, the University's
200-bed wing is much too small to be
an efficient "teaching" hospital.
Tradition of Co-operation
If the current plan is carried out,
the city and university will be con
tinuing a tradition of co-operation on
medical care that goes back to 1921.
Since 1959 Palo Alto and Stanford
have jointly operated the $10.3 million
Medical Center. Of the original cost,
the city paid $4 million and the uni
versity paid $6.3 million.
The proposal would give the city
about 390 beds. Palo Alto already has
the 170-bed Hoover Pavilion and if
the new plan is carried through, it
would also have a 220-bed community
hospital.
The action of the Finance Com
mittee last Thursday night constitutes
"an interim policy statement." If
approved by the council, it directs the
city staff to start accumulating data
in conjunction with Stanford staff
workers.

Council Chairman Robert Cooley
and Councilman Edward Arnold, de
velopers of the idea, along with Coun
cilman Frank Gallagher, voted to rec
ommend that the entire council adopt
the statement. City Manager George
E. Morgan also supports the Cooley-
Arnold plan.
1,050 Hospital Beds Planned
If the program becomes a reality,
the Palo Alto area would have 1,050
hospital beds. The Cooley-Arnold re
port pointed out that "long-range as
sumptions indicate a satisfactory sit
uation four years hence, but would not
meet the interim bed need to 1971."
The two councilmen suggest, how
ever, that 75 to 100 beds could be
made available within a year by re
organizing facilities at the Palo Alto-
Stanford Medical Center. "We would
