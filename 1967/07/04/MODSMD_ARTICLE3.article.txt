# Free Sounds, Free Snacks, Free Sun Highlight Be-In

### 
Sunday the Free University and
The Experiment staged their Mary
Poppins Umbrella Festival and Be-In
at Palo Alto Park from 1 to 6 p.m.
The action started promptly at 1:00
with four bands, the Anonymous Art
ists, the New Delhi River Band, the
Solid State, and the Good Word sup
plying entertainment for the crowd.
Gradually listeners grew from a few
hundred to a few thousand.
Beads, flowers, headbands, bells,
painted faces, and multi-colored cloth
ing were in abundance on Be-In parti
cipants. Smiles and happy laughter
came from all directions during the
easy-going afternoon.
Free oranges and punch were pro
vided by the Free University and The
Experiment, while wandering partici
pants also gladly surrendered their
refreshments to those around them.
One incident which marred the
pleasant atmosphere of the Festival
occurred when a policeman found a
young man with an American flag
draped casually over his shoulder.
He was beckoned aside by the police
man who took the flag away and in

spected it for possible stains or tears.
However, the flag-bearer ran away
at the first opportunity, leaving the
officer with the flag.
The highlight of the afternoon came
at 4:30 when the Grateful Dead step
ped on stage. As the group launched
into "Dancing in the Street," the
crowd of 4,000 moved closer to the
stage.
After coaxing from the "Dead,"
some of the crowd started dancing in
a large circle, holding hands and
swirling around. Snake dance lines
wound through the crowd while tam
borines, marracas, kazoos, and bells
kept the beat of the music.
The "Dead" kept up the perfor
mance for about a half hour, and
then promised to come back for more.
After they left the stage, the audience
settled down and listened to some
blues and more psychedelic music
from the other bands.
At the Be-In, the Free University
provided tables for class enrollment
and sold copies of various under
ground publications.
