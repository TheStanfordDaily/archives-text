## An Evening Of Moving Music 
### FRED ROSENBERG 
Pianist Grant Johannesen returned
to Stanford Friday night and, with
cellist Zara Nelsova, provided a con
vincing answer to the question of
whether or not a woman can play

the cello as well as a man. (The
question was brought into particular
prominence this past season when
Jacqueline DuPre appeared in this
country.)
The program opened with Beetho

ven's "Variations" in E flat. This is
a skillful and beautiful transforma
tion of an aria from Mozart's Magic
Flute. Miss Nelsova and Johannesen
gave a clean, sensitive reading, which
was what the work called for. The
result was superb.
The "Brahms Sonata" in F major
is standard in the cellist's repertoire.
Hearty musical fare, the sonata calls
for a great variety of technique and
expression. Miss Nelsova was up
to the task, and she gave the work
full justice, showing sound musical
sense and understanding of the
piece.
Haieff Sonata
The "Sonata" written in 1963 by
Alexei Haieff showed definite signs
of originality in places. However, the
work as a whole is neoclassic in the
worst sense of the word. While
many of the greatest and most origi
nal works of the twentieth century
come under the heading of "neoclas
sicism," the Haieff work has not used
this idiom well.
Written in a rather pastiche,
Brahmsian idiom, the sonata recalls
the cello sonatas of the major Soviet
composers. In all fairness, perhaps
the work seemed less worthy than it
actually is because it was sandwich-

Ed between two monumental works.
Miss Nelsova lent the performance
the delicate intonation which is vital
for modern harmonies.
The finale was Chopin's potent
"Sonata" in G minor. As might be
expected with a pianistic composer
such as Chopin, the piece provided
an excellent opportunity to hear
Johannesen.
Indeed, he did what few ac
companists do; he played the work
as if it were actually Chopin and not
a composer different from the Cho
pin who wrote the piano music. It
takes a fine artist such as Johannesen
to give full meaning to the subtleties
of Chopin.
As an encore, the husband and
wife team played the mildly pleasant
third movement of Francis Poulenc's
"Sonata."
The playing at all times called at
tention to the music rather than to
itself. This is the best kind of per
formance. Beautiful tone, fine tech
nique, and sensitive interpretations
were consistent throughout the eve
ning.
Most of all, Miss Nelsova and
Johannesen created what one dots
not find often enough — an evening
of beautiful, moving music.

As an encore, the husband and
wife team played the mildly pleasant
third movement of Francis Poulenc's
"Sonata."
The playing at all times called at
tention to the music rather than to
itself. This is the best kind of per
formance. Beautiful tone, fine tech
nique, and sensitive interpretations
were consistent throughout the eve
ning.
Most of all, Miss Nelsova and
Johannesen created what one dots
not find often enough — an evening
of beautiful, moving music.
Pianist Grant Johannesen returned
to Stanford Friday night and, with
cellist Zara Nelsova, provided a con
vincing answer to the question of
whether or not a woman can play

the cello as well as a man. (The
question was brought into particular
prominence this past season when
Jacqueline DuPre appeared in this
country.)
The program opened with Beetho

ven's "Variations" in E flat. This is
a skillful and beautiful transforma
tion of an aria from Mozart's Magic
Flute. Miss Nelsova and Johannesen
gave a clean, sensitive reading, which
was what the work called for. The
result was superb.
The "Brahms Sonata" in F major
is standard in the cellist's repertoire.
Hearty musical fare, the sonata calls
for a great variety of technique and
expression. Miss Nelsova was up
to the task, and she gave the work
full justice, showing sound musical
sense and understanding of the
piece.
Haieff Sonata
The "Sonata" written in 1963 by
Alexei Haieff showed definite signs
of originality in places. However, the
work as a whole is neoclassic in the
worst sense of the word. While
many of the greatest and most origi
nal works of the twentieth century
come under the heading of "neoclas
sicism," the Haieff work has not used
this idiom well.
Written in a rather pastiche,
Brahmsian idiom, the sonata recalls
the cello sonatas of the major Soviet
composers. In all fairness, perhaps
the work seemed less worthy than it
actually is because it was sandwich-

Ed between two monumental works.
Miss Nelsova lent the performance
the delicate intonation which is vital
for modern harmonies.
The finale was Chopin's potent
"Sonata" in G minor. As might be
expected with a pianistic composer
such as Chopin, the piece provided
an excellent opportunity to hear
Johannesen.
Indeed, he did what few ac
companists do; he played the work
as if it were actually Chopin and not
a composer different from the Cho
pin who wrote the piano music. It
takes a fine artist such as Johannesen
to give full meaning to the subtleties
of Chopin.
