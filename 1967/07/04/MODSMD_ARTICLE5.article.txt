the Stanford Museum Sunday morn
ing.
Two 17th century Italian cnadle
sticks were stolen after a thief entered
the museum through a window almost
twelve feet off the ground.
Police said the thief apparently
knew just what he was looking for
and made his way straight to the
second fioor collection where the
candlesticks were on display.
Museum officials said they could
find nothing else missing.
Police said the burglar stood on
top of his car to smash the window;
made his way to the second-floor dis
play room and lugged the candle
sticks, weighing 50 pounds each, out
to his car through a side door.
A silent alarm went off at 3:30 a.m.
when the thief pried open the door
but police arrived moments too late.
The bronze candlesticks were ap
praised at $700 apiece in 1941 when
they were donated to the University,
but are currently valued at $1,500.
The candleholders were part of the
Mortimer C. Leventritt Collection of
Far Eastern and European art.

The 24-inch high candlesticks were
an altar set on display in the Meidol
room on the second floor of the mu
seum.
