# Santa Clara Valley Still The Place For Wineries
## 
### 
(Last of a Series)
Wine-tasting is becoming one
of the major in-door spurts of
the Santa Clara Valley. There
are four large tasting rooms be
tween Stanford and San Juan
Bautista, and all four are more
or less generous with their wine
samples.
Stanford wine-tasters should
have little trouble finding the
various wineries south of here.
Two of them, San Martin Wine
ry, and the Los Altos Winery,
are located on Highway 101, and
the other two, Paul Masson, and
Almaden, are not far from 101.
Since all of these wineries
close at 4 p.m., wine-tasting
tours should start before noon.
The whole trip will take a mini
mum of five hours and some
people have taken days to go to
all four wineries. Minors are not
legally allowed drink at the wine
eries, but false identification
might be useful because most
age checks are superficial.
The wine at these four wine
ries ranges from excellent to
not-so-hot, but all the wine has
one thing in common: it's free.
The first stop on a Santa
Clara Valley wine-tasting tour
is the Paul Masson Winery, lo
cated near highway 85, just off
the Bayshore Freeway.
The winery is not difficult to
find due to its peculiar archi
tecture. Built about three years
ago, it looks as though it be
longs in Disneyland. The parking
lot is filled with people trying
to find their cars through an al
coholic haze. And, on the south
ern edge of the parking lot is a
sign proclaiming a distant field
as a "mother vineyard."
This is the only winery south
of Stanford which requires a
winery tour before the tasting
can begin, but it is mercifully
short.

Visitors may drink as much
as they want at the Masson tast
ing room. The list may include
as many as 25 different types
of wine, including champagne.
The winery is open from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m., and tours leave every
15 minutes. No limit is imposed
on the amount of time that
visitors may spend tasting the
wine.
The second tasting room on
the Santa Clara Valley route is
the San Martin Winery. Even
without a roadmap, the San Mar
tin winery should not be hard
to find. The owners have put
up signs as far south as Salinas
and the winery itself is crowded
with signs offering free wine.
San Martin is geared to selling
their products, and the tasting
room is commercially oriented.
The wine-tasting starts every 10
to 15 minutes, and no tour is re
quired. The wine is not particu
larly good, nor does San Martin
offer any more than the mini
mum sample of a very few
types of wine. Unless four or five
ounces of wine is enough to get
you drunk, you may expect to
remain sober at San Martin.
However, San Martin does fea
ture some different types of
berry wines â€” including straw
berry and blackberry. They are
exceptionally sweet, not too ex
pensive, and might be used to
blow the neighbor's minds.
Just south of Gilroy, also on
Highway 101, is the Los Altos
Winery. It is not as commercial
as San Martin, but the wine
isn't much better. The Los Altos
Winery is essentially a one-man
operation, and he will pour a
few glasses of wine for you. No
winery tour is required and
visitors may spend as little or as
much time there as they desire.
Ask for a taste of the May
wine, which has some interesting
qualities.

The Los Altos winery is at a
disadvantage due to its small
size. Its list of wines is smaller
and certainly not as well known
as those from other California
wine-producers. There are some
differences in prices, but not
much.
Further south, in the small
town of San Juan Bautista, is
the Almaden winery.
Located near the mission, Al
maden overlooks the broad ex
panse of country which seems
to have been bypassed by time
and crass real estate agents.
The tasting room is strictly
non-commercial, although some
wine is sold there. Almaden prob
ably has the best wine of any
of the Santa Clara Valley wine
ries, and visitors are encouraged
to try everything, including the
champagne.
The bartenders at Almaden ap
pear to be the most knowledge
able on this wine-tasting tour,
but the barkeeps at the other
three wineries manage to put
up their share of flak too. The
"experts" at each winery will
have entirely different answers
to such questions as "How long
should wine be kept in the bar
rels before it is bottled?" "How
is champagne made?" and "Is
Brand X's wine better than
yours?" It is the last question
that can bring some of the most
intriguing answers.
Other attractions in San Juan
Bautista include the mission and
the town itself. The mission is
one of the originals, built by the
Spanish in the 18th century. Al
though it suffered some damage
in the 1906 earthquake, it is still
in use. The town of San Juan
Bautista is, in itself, worth a
visit. It may someday join the
"progress" of the twentieth cen
tury, but that day seems far
away.
