# Student Wins Alcoa Award For Unique Brace Design
## 
### 
An unsual aluminum hand
brace, which provides a grasp
ing movement for the victim of
hand paralysis and partial wrist
function, is the 1967 Alcoa Stu

dent Design Merit Award win
ner at Stanford University.
Robert L. Beardmore of Po
mona, Cal., won the award with
a tenodesis splint which looks

more like abstract art than the
highly functional prosthesis it is.
Beardmore estimates there are
more than 12,000 victims in the
U.S. who must wear a prosthesis
for life, as a result of neck
fractures or other serious neck
injuries.
His splint is basically a large,
specially shaped tweezers sys
tem that slips over the hand and
forearm. A main advantage of
the aluminum splint over the
conventional stainless steel and
leather strap system is that it
may be applied by the patient
himslf.
In discussing his design prob
lem with physicians, technicians
and patients at Stanford Univer
sity Hospital, Beardmore learn
ed that previous splints, though
highly functional, were heavy,
difficult to clean, and required
the aid of another to attach
them. The new flesh-colored ap
pliance, made from Alcoa alumi
num sheet is V* as heavy as the
conventional splint, and its flesh
color makes it look less like a
"mechanical hand" than does the
present apparatus. Beardmore
asserts his design could be pro
duced at Mi the cost of the
model currently in use.
His apparatus, when carefully
fitted to the patient, may be
used to pick up single sheets of
of paper, a virtual impossibility
with conventional braces.

This tenodesis splint may change the "mechanical hand" appearance «»l" splints in use today. A major
advantage of the splint is its ease of application. The victim of hand paralysis may attiich it alone, as
illustrated in the sequential photos.
