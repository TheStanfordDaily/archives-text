# Bart Lytton: Banking's Man For All Seasons'
## 
### KIRK HANEN 
Bart Lytton sat down to his typewriter one
morning in 1947 and fed a sheet of paper into
the carriage. He planned to start work on a
novel.
Nothing would come.
Day after day he sat hunched over the
typewriter. Still nothing. He'd developed a
writer's block.
For Bart Lytton, the 35-year-old writer, it
was the end; but for Bart Lytton, the financier
who would come to be known as the most
innovative figure in the savings and loan in
dustry, it was a beginning.
Psychoanalysis
"My wife, Beth, persuaded me to get in
touch with Franz Alexander — one of the
most prominent psychoanalysts in America,"
Lytton recalls. "I wrote to him and he got me
into a new clinic that was starting up in Los
Angeles for fifty cents an hour. Later when
I could afford it, I went into analysis."
Talking with his analyst one morning, Lyt
ton sprang from the couch and moaned:
"This is a helluva note. I've been through
five years and 700 hours of analysis, and I
still can't write."
"Except a check for a million dollars," the
doctor reminded him.
And it was true, in five years Bart Lytton
had become a millionaire.
Today, he chairs the California-based Lyt
ton Financial Corporation, whose $760 million
assets rank it fifth largest of its kind in the
nation.
Self-Realization
"I think that if I've learned anything In my
life time, it's that the really great goal in life

— the one that will give you more things, both
material and spiritual — is self-realization.
Most people are discontented in the twilight
of their lives, because they never really realize
themselves — no matter what their potential
was. The problem is, most people ill-use the
capacities they have.
"I've found that you must constantly test
yourself; offer yourself to stimulation. It's
a matter of having as many interests as you
can without going to the extent that you
can't handle any of them really well."
Unlike his rather staid colleagues in the
savings and loan industry, Lytton has carried
this quest for diversity into his businesses.
He is truly a "user" and patron of art (he de
plores the term "collector"). Some $450,000
worth of art works of all types adorn the walls
of the various Lytton buildings.
"Why should we do it?" he asks rhetorical
ly. "Because it's damn good business. It invites
customers, pleases the staff and myself, and
cuts down on employee turnover. In fact, a
thing of beauty is a profit forever."
Such promotion-minded policy in a basically
conservative field has led one competitor to
brand Lytton "the hair shirt of the industry."
Such barbs might have bothered Lytton a
few years ago, but not any more.
Establishment?
"When I first started in the savings and
loan business," he recalls, "I wanted to be
just 'one of the boys'; to be accepted by my
colleagues in the trade organizations.
"But as Lytton Financial got bigger, I had
to ask myself how important it was to be a
member of the Establishment. My goals
changed. Success became more important

than the satisfactions of being on the 'right'
committees, or going through the various
chairs to become president of some savings
and loan league, or doing any of the many
conforming things that make people small."
"The point is," he says, using his index
finger for emphasis, "if you just go along
with the leadership, and don't rock the boat,
and do only the things that are supposed to
be done, you will be a big NOBODY by the
time you're fifty."

Bart Lytton's turn from script writer to
mortgage writer is not so different from
something F. Scott Fitzgerald might have
written about.
He began his onslaught on an unsuspecting
world as a $15 a-week reporter for the New
castle, Penna., News, after intermittent at
tendance at Westminster College and the Uni
versity of Virginia.
"Those Depression times made for a real
horror show. It got so bad I remember crossing
the street when I'd see a friend coming be
cause I knew he'd invariably ask for a quar
ter to eat on — and I didn't have it."
Coming to New York City in 1936, Lytton
went to work directing plays for the W.P.A.'s
Federal Theater project at $23.86 a week. He
could have gotten by fairly well on that sum,
but he'd since taken on his present wife, a
strikingly-attractive brunette drama student
named Beth Golden.
Bugler
The next decade found Lytton working as
a "bugler" (assistant to a publicity man) at
Warner Bros. Studios in Hollywood, a labor
organizer, a news analyst with Chet Huntley,

and a screen and radio writer ("Hitler's Mad
men," "Bowery to Broadway," "Skyblazers,"
•L.angbusters," "A Date With Judy," among
others).
Then came the veiled blessing. Much as he
wanted to, he could no longer produce as a
writer, and began analysis.
"At the age of 35, I started out at $250 a
month doing the advertising and promotion
for a mortgage company. Inside of six months,
I was a partner in that company. I'd found
myself."
Lytton Savings
Combining an acute ability to appraise
property with the showman-like methods he'd
used as a publicist, Lytton amassed enough
capital to buy Conoga Park (California) Sav
ings and Loan in 1956. He promptly changed
the name to Lytton Savings. In the ten years
following, Lytton Savings has become what its
head man describes as the "most envied, fear
ed, and awe-inspiring financial institution in
the annals of modern man."
"Someone once asked me what I thought
my greatest contribution to mankind was. It's
this simple: I built an institution with $1.4
million in assets into one with $700 million in
ten years. That's fifty thousand per cent
growth. No one's ever done that before."
"Now you can say — 'Well isn't that great.
So you got to be rich and well-known. But
how can you call that a contribution?' I say
my greatest contribution is my success. I've
proved it can still be done."
"There's nothing as depressing as thinking
that all chance is gone. The day of the great
success is not gone. It won't be in my business,
because the 'time of the tycoon', as I call it,

is very short — perhaps 15 to 20 years. But
I've proved that the time of greatness is
always upon us. If that be cockiness, then
make the most of it."
It's likely that any other man who worked
from 7 a.m. on through dinner at a three
quarter billion dollar business would have
enough worry-inspired neuroses to keep a
half-dozen psychiatrists busy.
