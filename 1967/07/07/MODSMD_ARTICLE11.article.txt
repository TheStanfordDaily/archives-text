# Film Review
## 'Divorce'--Second Rate 
### BARBARA DEUTSCH 
Because it attempts to criti
cize and not idealize suburban
American life, Divorce: Ameri
can Style now at the Fine Arts,
transcends the typical Holly
wood comedy of star-studded,
family entertainment. Unfortu
nately much of the satire is de
cidedly diluted by a cliched,
situation-comedy approach and
by a happy ending, seemingly in
tended to salve the conscience of
the very audience at whom the
criticism is directed.
The plot concerns a pleasant,
nouveau riche couple (Debby
Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke)
who find that financial success

has led them to marital discon
tent. When an angry Van Dyke
walks out of the house, neigh
bors, lawyers, and marriage
counselors sweep the couple into
an unwanted divorce. On the
evening of their divorce cele
bration, a deus ex machina, per
sonified as a night club hypno
tist, brings their true feelings
to the fore. They admit their
love, remarry, and resume their
interrupted battle.
Absurdity
The most significant aspect of
the movie is its comment upon
the absurdity of American ali
mony laws and divorce attitudes.
Jason Robards, in Divorce's best
played role, tries repeatedly to
find a husband for his ex-wife
(Jeanne Simmons) so that he
can discontinue paying his ex
horbitant alimony checks and
pay for a much needed leg opera
tion. Shelly Berman, Miss Rey
nold's lawyer, suggests reconcili
ation in passing, and then pro

ceeds with the divorce and his
golf game. Friends and children
accept broken homes as a nor
mal part of happy family life.
Ex-wives live in guiltless luxury
while ex-husbands wage their
own personal wars on poverty.
Occasionally, these situations
lend themselves to very funny
scenes.
Second Rate
What renders Divorce second
rate is its acceptance of itself.
Just as its characters accept
divorce as a panacea, the movie
accepts reconciliation as the so
lution for all its problems. The
happy ending ignores the film's
earlier criticism of middle-class
life and suggests its original pre
dicament as its final answer.
The story ends as it begins,
supposedly for the sake of the
joint bank account. The couple
resumes their problems and
quarrels, the children resume
listening, and Debby and Dick
remain unhappy, though mar
ried.

interrupted battle.
Absurdity
The most significant aspect of
the movie is its comment upon
the absurdity of American ali
mony laws and divorce attitudes.
Jason Robards, in Divorce's best
played role, tries repeatedly to
find a husband for his ex-wife
(Jeanne Simmons) so that he
can discontinue paying his ex
horbitant alimony checks and
pay for a much needed leg opera
tion. Shelly Berman, Miss Rey
nold's lawyer, suggests reconcili
ation in passing, and then pro

ceeds with the divorce and his
golf game. Friends and children
accept broken homes as a nor
mal part of happy family life.
Ex-wives live in guiltless luxury
while ex-husbands wage their
own personal wars on poverty.
Occasionally, these situations
lend themselves to very funny
scenes.
Second Rate
What renders Divorce second
rate is its acceptance of itself.
Just as its characters accept
divorce as a panacea, the movie
accepts reconciliation as the so
lution for all its problems. The
happy ending ignores the film's
earlier criticism of middle-class
life and suggests its original pre
dicament as its final answer.
The story ends as it begins,
supposedly for the sake of the
joint bank account. The couple
resumes their problems and
quarrels, the children resume
listening, and Debby and Dick
remain unhappy, though mar
ried.
