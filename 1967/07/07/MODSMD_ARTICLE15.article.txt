# Asphalt Jungle Next In Tresidder Series
## 
### 
Following a heavily-attended
"Woman in the Dunes" last
week, the TMU-International
Center Summer Film Series will
continue this Friday evening
with a showing of Asphalt
Jungle at the Union.
Directed by John Huston, As

phalt Jungle has come to be a
minor classic of American films,
and certainly is the best of the
big-city crime genre so often
exploited in the thirties and late
forties in this country.
Dr. Zorba
Sterling Hayden and Jean
Hagen provide extremely enter
taining performances as the
country - boy - turned â€¢ hit - man
and his sleazy neurotic girl
friend. But Sam Jaffe (lately
Dr. Zorba) makes the film with
his portrayal of the connoisseur
with Old World sensibilities who
masterminds a major jewel rob
bery in order to indulge his deli
cate sexual tastes. Jaffe won the
International Prize for Best Act
or at the Venice Film Festival
for his performance.
Also to appear in what must
be one of her first times on
screen is Marilyn Monroe (she
is not even listed in the screen
titles). It can be said that she
makes the best of it when she
has lines, and the most of it
when she hasn't
Ten Best
Photography is by Harold Ros
son, and the impressive score by
Miklos Rozsa. The National
Board of Review named Asphalt
Jungle One of the Ten Best
American Films of the Year, and
Huston was awarded Best Di
rector for his efforts.
Tickets are 50 cents each, and
should be purchased at the TMTJ
box office well in advance of
show-time to assure seating.
Viewing times are at 7:30, 8:30,
and 9:30 p.m.
