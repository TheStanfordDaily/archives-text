# This Way Mr. President
## 
### 
During Spring Vacation this past year, Uni
versity President J. E. Wallace Sterling an
nounced his retirement, effective at the end of
the academic year 1967- 68.
Ever since that announcement a special com
mittee of the Board of Trustees has been seek
ing a successor for President Sterling. Or
have they?
Information has reached us which indicates
that this committee has not been functioning, in
fact that the choice had been made before the
committee was even chosen. Who made the
choice is not known, but there is little doubt
in anyone's mind as to who is doing the wooing
of the prospective candidate.
Just in case there are still some people who
do not know who the candidate is, (has the

grapevine broken down that badly?) we are
referring to Secretary of Health, Education, and
Welfare John Gardiner.
Rumors and counter-rumors have been cir
culating ever since President Sterling made his
announcement, but rumors do not change the
facts. Gardiner has dedicated two new build
ings at Stanford in the past year. Gardiner is
a thoroughly competent administrator. Gardiner
is a friend of the incumbent.
Now, we realize that these facts alone do
not a President make, but when you add them
to the fact that Gardiner has visited President
Sterling five times in the past three months, it
is not at all unreasonable to wonder what these
two men have so much to talk about. Were
betting that it is not another dedication.
