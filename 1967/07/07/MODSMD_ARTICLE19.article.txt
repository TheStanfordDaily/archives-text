# Letters To The Editor
## Mr. Hanen: We Love Trees 
### 
Oh, Sensationalism!
Editor, The Daily:
The article of July 4 by your
Managing Editor inspired this
letter. Please either print my
letter in its entirety, or do not
print it at all. I realize you want
all letters restricted to 300
words, but I want no portion of
this letter left out. I would rath
er have you throw my letter
away, than permit you to alter
it. I know this letter might cause
your Managing Editor some em
barrassment if it is printed, so
you may simply ignore my ef
forts to comment on his article.
However, assuming that you are
a fair and honest person, I de
cided to send my letter anyway.
It is as follows:
We have grown up in a coun
try where news reporters are
embedded in sensationalism and
melodrama. The press concen
trates too much of its precision
on being sensational, and not
enough on being accurate. As a
result, we get no more than
studied nonsense from most
newspapers. In reading The
Daily, I have discovered the col
lege newspaper to be the proving
ground for the more embarrass
ing public press.
Usually, I simply accept this
state of affairs, and try to read
the few serious newspapers.
This time, however, I was trap
ped by one of the sensationalistic
headlines of The Daily. More
particularly, it was the article
by Kirk Hanen titled, "To Hell
With Redwood Trees." What up
sets me is not so much his posi
tion, but his obvious confusion
which occasioned his conclu
sions.
Since I am deeding with a con
fused mind, rather than try
to fathoim it, I will simply accept
the conclusions which came out
of it as intended. His most inter
esting conclusion is that he too
realizes his "reason (has) fizzled
out." He further states that

"emotion" is his only guide. Be
ing an artist, I also agree to the
importance of emotion, even
within an institution which ad
vances the importance of rea
son. Since the statements which
Mr. Hanen makes show not even
the sensitivity of a dilettante, his
emotion is completely uncontrol
led, and he is what may be called
in a university "the hopelessly
irrational."
I grew up in what was once
a desert — a wasteland — Los
Angeles, and I find the beauty
of Northern California quite re
freshing. Mr. Hanen grew up in
what is still a wasteland, Orange
County, and I find it difficult to
believe that he would like to see
the rest of California levelled
and simplified into the same type
of wasteland. All of the reasons
he offers, consistent with his
lack of Reason, are covered with
a thin guise of humanism, and
have little to do with the issue
he is raising.
A perfect example of this is
when he compares a hypothet
ical person who is being driven
out of his home, so that it may
become a national shrine for
The People, with the Miller Red
wood Company. This hypotheti
cal person is told, "You may hap
pen to like your present sur
roundings, but that doesn't mat
ter: The People have a right
to their national beauty." This
is an obvious contradiction, and
we may even use his example to
demonstrate the conservation
ists' position. According to his
example, the Miller Redwood
Company, in fact, does not "like
its present surroundings," and is
busy trying to destroy it.
Hence, the responsibility of
caring for the land has been
placed into irresponsible hands.
Therefore, the People have the
right to place restrictions on
this company. This last state
ment raises the problem of the
extent to the rights of owner
ship. Suffice it to say that private

ownership is rarely a lasting
thing.. Only nations, not indivi
duals, last for a considerable
length of time. Hence, private
land is land which has been tem
porarily entrusted by the Peo
ple to a resident of that nation.
Therefore, the People do have
the right to prevent individuals
from destroying land. And the
People also reserve the right to
define what is meant by "de
stroying land."
Mr. Hanen also states that
10,000 people would lose their
jobs by the actions of conserva
tionists. It is public knowledge
that this country shamefully
wastes its resources. However,
the solution is not to employ one
set of resources (the jobless) to
the job of destroying another set
of resources. If anything, this
would be more akin to the world
described in the prophetic writ
ings of George Orwell, than the
world Mr. Hanen hints at. There
fore, Mr. Hanen's association of
himself with George Orwell is
unfortunate and presumptuous.
In conclusion, I can only say
that I feel sorry for our Mr.
Hanen. He grew up in a waste
land, and carries it with him
wherever he goes.

Trees, Not People
Editor, The Daily:
I feel I must reply to Kirk
Hanen's vitriolic editioral on red
woods in Tuesday's Daily. He
claims that the majority of these
trees are located in Del Norte
County. True. The ones there
and in Humboldt County are
practically the only virgin red
woods left standing. They used
to be practically continuous
from southern Oregon to San
Luis Obispo. It has been esti
mated that between 1.7 and 2
million acres of redwoods existed
in California 100 years ago. With
reference to Hanen's point No. 5,
it certainly seems that the red
woods were capable of replenish
ing themselves.
The parks being proposed are
an attempt to save 50,000 to 90,-
000 acres of the roughly 2,000,000
remaining. 90,000/2,000,000 is
about 4.5% by my slide rule. Is
it too much to ask to save 4.5%
of something as magnificent
as the coast redwood for the
future?
Hanen also loudly laments the
fact that some 10,000 people
stand to lose their jobs if the
parks are established. What of
the fact that they will lose them
in ten or twenty years anyway
when the redwoods are all gone?
The lumber industry has an un
enviable record of a "cut it and
scram" policy, especially in the
redwood area,
I interpret point four as fol
lows: "Beauty is being destroyed
every day, so it doesn't matter
if we destroy a little more." How
ridiculous can one get?
Finally:"I think people are
infinitely more beautiful than
any kind of tree." I disagree. I
think that peace, quiet, and trees
are much preferable to crowds
of people, autos, billboards, and
stumps.

ple to a resident of that nation.
Therefore, the People do have
the right to prevent individuals
from destroying land. And the
People also reserve the right to
define what is meant by "de
stroying land."
Mr. Hanen also states that
10,000 people would lose their
jobs by the actions of conserva
tionists. It is public knowledge
that this country shamefully
wastes its resources. However,
the solution is not to employ one
set of resources (the jobless) to
the job of destroying another set
of resources. If anything, this
would be more akin to the world
described in the prophetic writ
ings of George Orwell, than the
world Mr. Hanen hints at. There
fore, Mr. Hanen's association of
himself with George Orwell is
unfortunate and presumptuous.
In conclusion, I can only say
that I feel sorry for our Mr.
Hanen. He grew up in a waste
land, and carries it with him
wherever he goes.

Trees, Not People
Editor, The Daily:
I feel I must reply to Kirk
Hanen's vitriolic editioral on red
woods in Tuesday's Daily. He
claims that the majority of these
trees are located in Del Norte
County. True. The ones there
and in Humboldt County are
practically the only virgin red
woods left standing. They used
to be practically continuous
from southern Oregon to San
Luis Obispo. It has been esti
mated that between 1.7 and 2
million acres of redwoods existed
in California 100 years ago. With
reference to Hanen's point No. 5,
it certainly seems that the red
woods were capable of replenish
ing themselves.
The parks being proposed are
an attempt to save 50,000 to 90,-
000 acres of the roughly 2,000,000
remaining. 90,000/2,000,000 is
about 4.5% by my slide rule. Is
it too much to ask to save 4.5%
of something as magnificent
as the coast redwood for the
future?
Hanen also loudly laments the
fact that some 10,000 people
stand to lose their jobs if the
parks are established. What of
the fact that they will lose them
in ten or twenty years anyway
when the redwoods are all gone?
The lumber industry has an un
enviable record of a "cut it and
scram" policy, especially in the
redwood area,
I interpret point four as fol
lows: "Beauty is being destroyed
every day, so it doesn't matter
if we destroy a little more." How
ridiculous can one get?
Finally:"I think people are
infinitely more beautiful than
any kind of tree." I disagree. I
think that peace, quiet, and trees
are much preferable to crowds
of people, autos, billboards, and
stumps.

Oh, Sensationalism!
Editor, The Daily:
The article of July 4 by your
Managing Editor inspired this
letter. Please either print my
letter in its entirety, or do not
print it at all. I realize you want
all letters restricted to 300
words, but I want no portion of
this letter left out. I would rath
er have you throw my letter
away, than permit you to alter
it. I know this letter might cause
your Managing Editor some em
barrassment if it is printed, so
you may simply ignore my ef
forts to comment on his article.
However, assuming that you are
a fair and honest person, I de
cided to send my letter anyway.
It is as follows:
We have grown up in a coun
try where news reporters are
embedded in sensationalism and
melodrama. The press concen
trates too much of its precision
on being sensational, and not
enough on being accurate. As a
result, we get no more than
studied nonsense from most
newspapers. In reading The
Daily, I have discovered the col
lege newspaper to be the proving
ground for the more embarrass
ing public press.
Usually, I simply accept this
state of affairs, and try to read
the few serious newspapers.
This time, however, I was trap
ped by one of the sensationalistic
headlines of The Daily. More
particularly, it was the article
by Kirk Hanen titled, "To Hell
With Redwood Trees." What up
sets me is not so much his posi
tion, but his obvious confusion
which occasioned his conclu
sions.
Since I am deeding with a con
fused mind, rather than try
to fathoim it, I will simply accept
the conclusions which came out
of it as intended. His most inter
esting conclusion is that he too
realizes his "reason (has) fizzled
out." He further states that

"emotion" is his only guide. Be
ing an artist, I also agree to the
importance of emotion, even
within an institution which ad
vances the importance of rea
son. Since the statements which
Mr. Hanen makes show not even
the sensitivity of a dilettante, his
emotion is completely uncontrol
led, and he is what may be called
in a university "the hopelessly
irrational."
I grew up in what was once
a desert — a wasteland — Los
Angeles, and I find the beauty
of Northern California quite re
freshing. Mr. Hanen grew up in
what is still a wasteland, Orange
County, and I find it difficult to
believe that he would like to see
the rest of California levelled
and simplified into the same type
of wasteland. All of the reasons
he offers, consistent with his
lack of Reason, are covered with
a thin guise of humanism, and
have little to do with the issue
he is raising.
A perfect example of this is
when he compares a hypothet
ical person who is being driven
out of his home, so that it may
become a national shrine for
The People, with the Miller Red
wood Company. This hypotheti
cal person is told, "You may hap
pen to like your present sur
roundings, but that doesn't mat
ter: The People have a right
to their national beauty." This
is an obvious contradiction, and
we may even use his example to
demonstrate the conservation
ists' position. According to his
example, the Miller Redwood
Company, in fact, does not "like
its present surroundings," and is
busy trying to destroy it.
Hence, the responsibility of
caring for the land has been
placed into irresponsible hands.
Therefore, the People have the
right to place restrictions on
this company. This last state
ment raises the problem of the
extent to the rights of owner
ship. Suffice it to say that private

ownership is rarely a lasting
thing.. Only nations, not indivi
duals, last for a considerable
length of time. Hence, private
land is land which has been tem
porarily entrusted by the Peo
ple to a resident of that nation.
Therefore, the People do have
the right to prevent individuals
from destroying land. And the
People also reserve the right to

newspapers. In reading The
Daily, I have discovered the col
lege newspaper to be the proving
ground for the more embarrass
ing public press.
Usually, I simply accept this
state of affairs, and try to read
the few serious newspapers.
This time, however, I was trap
ped by one of the sensationalistic
headlines of The Daily. More
particularly, it was the article
by Kirk Hanen titled, "To Hell
With Redwood Trees." What up
sets me is not so much his posi
tion, but his obvious confusion
which occasioned his conclu
sions.
Since I am deeding with a con
fused mind, rather than try
to fathoim it, I will simply accept
the conclusions which came out
of it as intended. His most inter
esting conclusion is that he too
realizes his "reason (has) fizzled
out." He further states that

"emotion" is his only guide. Be
ing an artist, I also agree to the
importance of emotion, even
within an institution which ad
vances the importance of rea
son. Since the statements which
Mr. Hanen makes show not even
the sensitivity of a dilettante, his
emotion is completely uncontrol
led, and he is what may be called
in a university "the hopelessly
irrational."
I grew up in what was once
a desert — a wasteland — Los
Angeles, and I find the beauty
of Northern California quite re
freshing. Mr. Hanen grew up in
what is still a wasteland, Orange
County, and I find it difficult to
believe that he would like to see
the rest of California levelled
and simplified into the same type
of wasteland. All of the reasons
he offers, consistent with his
lack of Reason, are covered with
a thin guise of humanism, and
have little to do with the issue
he is raising.
A perfect example of this is
when he compares a hypothet
ical person who is being driven
out of his home, so that it may
become a national shrine for
The People, with the Miller Red
wood Company. This hypotheti
cal person is told, "You may hap
pen to like your present sur
roundings, but that doesn't mat
ter: The People have a right
to their national beauty." This
is an obvious contradiction, and
we may even use his example to
demonstrate the conservation
ists' position. According to his
example, the Miller Redwood
Company, in fact, does not "like
its present surroundings," and is
busy trying to destroy it.
Hence, the responsibility of
caring for the land has been
placed into irresponsible hands.
Therefore, the People have the
right to place restrictions on
this company. This last state
ment raises the problem of the
extent to the rights of owner
ship. Suffice it to say that private

ownership is rarely a lasting
thing.. Only nations, not indivi
duals, last for a considerable
length of time. Hence, private
land is land which has been tem
porarily entrusted by the Peo
ple to a resident of that nation.
Therefore, the People do have
the right to prevent individuals
from destroying land. And the
People also reserve the right to
define what is meant by "de
stroying land."
Mr. Hanen also states that
10,000 people would lose their
jobs by the actions of conserva
tionists. It is public knowledge
that this country shamefully
wastes its resources. However,
the solution is not to employ one
set of resources (the jobless) to
the job of destroying another set
of resources. If anything, this
would be more akin to the world
described in the prophetic writ
ings of George Orwell, than the
world Mr. Hanen hints at. There
fore, Mr. Hanen's association of
himself with George Orwell is
unfortunate and presumptuous.
In conclusion, I can only say
that I feel sorry for our Mr.
Hanen. He grew up in a waste
land, and carries it with him
wherever he goes.

Trees, Not People
Editor, The Daily:
I feel I must reply to Kirk
Hanen's vitriolic editioral on red
woods in Tuesday's Daily. He
claims that the majority of these
trees are located in Del Norte
County. True. The ones there
and in Humboldt County are
practically the only virgin red
woods left standing. They used
to be practically continuous
from southern Oregon to San
Luis Obispo. It has been esti
mated that between 1.7 and 2
million acres of redwoods existed
in California 100 years ago. With
reference to Hanen's point No. 5,
it certainly seems that the red
woods were capable of replenish
ing themselves.
The parks being proposed are
an attempt to save 50,000 to 90,-
000 acres of the roughly 2,000,000
remaining. 90,000/2,000,000 is
about 4.5% by my slide rule. Is
it too much to ask to save 4.5%
of something as magnificent
as the coast redwood for the
future?
Hanen also loudly laments the
fact that some 10,000 people
stand to lose their jobs if the
parks are established. What of
the fact that they will lose them
in ten or twenty years anyway
when the redwoods are all gone?
The lumber industry has an un
enviable record of a "cut it and
scram" policy, especially in the
redwood area,
I interpret point four as fol
lows: "Beauty is being destroyed
every day, so it doesn't matter
if we destroy a little more." How
ridiculous can one get?
Finally:"I think people are
infinitely more beautiful than
any kind of tree." I disagree. I
think that peace, quiet, and trees
are much preferable to crowds
of people, autos, billboards, and
stumps.

The article of July 4 by your

Editor, The Daily:
I feel I must reply to Kirk
Hanen's vitriolic editioral on red
woods in Tuesday's Daily. He
claims that the majority of these
trees are located in Del Norte
County. True. The ones there
and in Humboldt County are
practically the only virgin red
woods left standing. They used
to be practically continuous
from southern Oregon to San
Luis Obispo. It has been esti
mated that between 1.7 and 2
million acres of redwoods existed
in California 100 years ago. With
reference to Hanen's point No. 5,
it certainly seems that the red
woods were capable of replenish
ing themselves.
The parks being proposed are
an attempt to save 50,000 to 90,-
000 acres of the roughly 2,000,000
remaining. 90,000/2,000,000 is
about 4.5% by my slide rule. Is
it too much to ask to save 4.5%
of something as magnificent
as the coast redwood for the
future?
Hanen also loudly laments the
fact that some 10,000 people
stand to lose their jobs if the
parks are established. What of
the fact that they will lose them
in ten or twenty years anyway
when the redwoods are all gone?
The lumber industry has an un
enviable record of a "cut it and
scram" policy, especially in the
redwood area,
I interpret point four as fol
lows: "Beauty is being destroyed
every day, so it doesn't matter
if we destroy a little more." How
ridiculous can one get?
Finally:"I think people are
infinitely more beautiful than
any kind of tree." I disagree. I
think that peace, quiet, and trees
are much preferable to crowds
of people, autos, billboards, and
stumps.
