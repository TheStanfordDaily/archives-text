# Registrar's Office Revises Pass-Fail Grading System
## 
### 
The Registrar's Office announced
Tuesday that the practice of making
pass-fail declarations with the Regis
trar's Office is no longer required.
From now on, the student deciding to
elect the pass-fail option need only
notify the instructor of the course.
The new process was arrived at af
ter the Registrar's Advisory Commit
tee reviewed the present practice and
"found that clerical time used in keep
ing track of changes and in handling
retroactive agreements between stu
dent and instructor did not seem to
accomplish sufficient beneficial results
to justify the system." Whatever
grade the instructor reports to the
Registrar will now be recorded direct
ly on the student's record.
Recommended in the fall of 1965 by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Education as a "three-year experi
ment" to be reviewed at the end of
the third year, the pass-fail program
was approved in June, 1966, by the
Academic Council. At that time the

Academic Council set forth the re
quirements concerning the program;
the pass-fail practice was initiated
Fall Quarter.
The stated purpose of the pass-fail
system is to encourage students to
attempt courses outside their majors,
and there is general agreement that
in this respect it has been overwhelm
ingly successful. Last Fall Quarter
more than 900 students elected to
take a pass-fail course.
In the early days of Stanford, all
courses were graded pass-fail, with
additional marks of "unprepared,"
"indifferent," or simply "lazy" some
times being added. Faculty members
generally dismiss the possibility that
Stanford might return to that sys
tem, however. They agree that an all
pass-fail record would seriously hin
der a student's chances for graduate
or professional school.
Presently, growing support is be
ing voiced for a pass-fail freshman
year. Advocates claim it will reduce

"grade trauma" and "place the em
phasis on achievement in a subject
rather than simply doing what's nec
essary to get a grade."
Other opponents to the system
maintain that adjustment problems
would only be postponed a year, and
in the absence of grading pressure,
students would simply do less work.
As set forth by the Academic Coun
cil, requirements of the pass-fail sys
tem of importance to the instructor
are:
1. The decision to elect the pass-fail
option should be made at the time of
enrollment in the course; a student
might change his option within the
time set for adding and dropping
courses.
2. An instructor may elect to close
his course to students choosing the
pass-fail option.
3. General Studies courses (except
for Senior Colloquia and activities
courses) may not be taken for pass
fail; and requirements of a major
department may not be taken on the
pass-fail basis.
Requirements of importance to the
student are:
1. Only one course per quarter may
be taken on this basis.
2. Only 27 such units may be count
ed toward graduation.
3. Courses taken on pass-fail basis
do not count one way or the other
toward the grade point average.


The Old Student Union is rapidly approaching completion of the renovation which will change it from a dormitory
to an office for the University Administration. The Old Union figured prominently in last year's housing debates.

rather than simply doing what's nec
essary to get a grade."
Other opponents to the system
maintain that adjustment problems
would only be postponed a year, and
in the absence of grading pressure,
students would simply do less work.
As set forth by the Academic Coun
cil, requirements of the pass-fail sys
tem of importance to the instructor
are:
1. The decision to elect the pass-fail
option should be made at the time of
enrollment in the course; a student
might change his option within the
time set for adding and dropping
courses.
2. An instructor may elect to close
his course to students choosing the
pass-fail option.
3. General Studies courses (except
for Senior Colloquia and activities
courses) may not be taken for pass
fail; and requirements of a major
department may not be taken on the
pass-fail basis.
Requirements of importance to the
student are:
1. Only one course per quarter may
be taken on this basis.
2. Only 27 such units may be count
ed toward graduation.
3. Courses taken on pass-fail basis
do not count one way or the other
toward the grade point average.

The Registrar's Office announced
Tuesday that the practice of making
pass-fail declarations with the Regis
trar's Office is no longer required.
From now on, the student deciding to
elect the pass-fail option need only
notify the instructor of the course.
The new process was arrived at af
ter the Registrar's Advisory Commit
tee reviewed the present practice and
"found that clerical time used in keep
ing track of changes and in handling
retroactive agreements between stu
dent and instructor did not seem to
accomplish sufficient beneficial results
to justify the system." Whatever
grade the instructor reports to the
Registrar will now be recorded direct
ly on the student's record.
Recommended in the fall of 1965 by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Education as a "three-year experi
ment" to be reviewed at the end of
the third year, the pass-fail program
was approved in June, 1966, by the
Academic Council. At that time the

Academic Council set forth the re
quirements concerning the program;
the pass-fail practice was initiated
Fall Quarter.
The stated purpose of the pass-fail
system is to encourage students to
attempt courses outside their majors,
and there is general agreement that
in this respect it has been overwhelm
ingly successful. Last Fall Quarter
more than 900 students elected to
take a pass-fail course.
In the early days of Stanford, all
courses were graded pass-fail, with
additional marks of "unprepared,"
"indifferent," or simply "lazy" some
times being added. Faculty members
generally dismiss the possibility that
Stanford might return to that sys
tem, however. They agree that an all
pass-fail record would seriously hin
der a student's chances for graduate
or professional school.
Presently, growing support is be
ing voiced for a pass-fail freshman
year. Advocates claim it will reduce

"grade trauma" and "place the em
phasis on achievement in a subject
rather than simply doing what's nec
essary to get a grade."
