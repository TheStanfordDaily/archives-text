## What's It All About? 
### Herbie Hinks 
Governor Reekin sat back in
his capitol hill office, watching
the solons go by.
"What's it all about, Alfle?"
Reekin asked his office boy, Al
fred Reactionary.
"What's what all about?" Re
actionary queried, sticking pins
in a little doll labeled "Governor
Mormon."
"When I was running for
Governor, I promised to keep
California in the black. So I got
elected and that's exactly what
I'm doing. But everytime I cut
one expense or another, all I
get is criticism."
"Yeah, boss," Reactionary
said. "That pile of letters over
there in the corner is about the
mental hospitals. Maybe cutting
the patients down to two meals
a day was a little bit extreme."
Reekin jumped up, and shout
ed, "Don't use that word around
me!"
"What word?"
"Extreme. I'm sensitive."
"Sorry, Chief, but the letters
aren't too complimentary."
"I know, but what do you ex
pect? I'll bet they're all from
the patients. Stupid mongo
loids." Reekin turned toward
the window. "You want to know
why I cut them back to two
meals, Alfle? Because most of
the patients in mental hospitals

are Democrats, left-wingers, and
fellow travelers."
"So what are you going to do,
Boss, starve them to death?"
Reekin's face lit up at the
thought. "Maybe you're smarter
than I thought, Alfie. That's a
brilliant plan. That's what it's
all about, Alfle."
"But I didn't mean it, Chief,
honest . . ." Reactionary's voice
trailed off as he looked up at
Reekin, who was beginning to
foam at the mouth with pleas
ure.
Reekin's arm suddenly shot
up. "Yes, yes. Now I see the
problem, all I had to do was put
circumstances around it."
Reactionary sat in the corner,
trembling.
Reekin was just warming up
to his dream. "You know, Alfie,
I was in a movie once, I think
it was in 1936, and in that mo
vie I stormed a mental hospital
and killed the most vicious loo
ney I could find."
"But, Boss, what does that
have to do with . .
"Don't you see it, Alfie? We
can wipe out every goofy ga
rage in the state with my men
tal health plan. First, two meals
a day, then one, then no food
at all. If they want anything to
eat, they'll have to work for it."
"But they'll have to leave the
hospital to find a job," Reac
tionary protested.
"Maybe you aren't so dumb
after all, Alfie. Either they die
or they get a job. If they get a
job, then they'll have to leave
the hospital. Then we can close
all of the hospitals."
"Than we save all that money,
Chief?"
"That's right."
"Look, Boss, I like the idea of
saving several million, but what
about all the crazy people? We
can't just let them starve or
turn them out on the street."
"We can't?"
"Well, uh . .
Reekin walked over to the
corner where Reactionary was
sitting. He put his face about
two inches from the quivering
office boy and asked, "Can you
give me three reasons why not?
Just three good reasons? They
were put in those hospitals in
the first place because they're
worthless to society. Most of
them were committed by their
families and friends. They
aren't earning their place in so
ciety. Wh" should the state sup
port them?"
"Well, I don't know, Boss."
"I don't know either, Alfie,
and in three months, we won't
be."
"Where do we go from here,
Chief?"
Reekin walked over to the
phone. "I'll tell where we go
from here, Alfie." He quickly
dialed the seven digits. "Hello,
Avis? Yes, I realize you're only
number 2, but do you rent ani
mals? Right, I need a horse for
myself and a donkey for my of
fice boy. I could use a suit of
armor, if you have one, and a
very sharp lance. And don't for
get the directions to the nearest
windmill."
