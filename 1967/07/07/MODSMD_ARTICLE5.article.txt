## 
### ALISON CAMPBELL 
The Peace Corps and the Stanford
Graduate School of Business began a
special training program Wednesday
for 40 young men who prefer an
adventure in South America to a high
paying executive position.
All of the volunteers have master
of business administration degrees
and will work in Peru after eight
weeks of training here.
The program's purpose is to help
Peruvian small business and manage
ment development.
Project Director Frank K. Shallen
berger, professor of industrial man
agement at the business school, feels
that this program is one "which we
hope other business schools will pick
up and operate in other parts of the
world where needed."
Little Guy I>eft Out
Shallenberger, who taught 18
months in a Peruvian graduate school
of business he helped establish, said,
"In Peru a great deal of attention is
paid to big foreign and government
owned business . . . , but nobody is
doing anything for the little guy."
This program is designed to help
that "little guy." Volunteers will work
directly with small businessmen or
cooperatives. According to Shallen
berger, the objective is "anything
which creates and promotes a healthy,
small business sector or aids in form
ing and operating, producing, market
ing or consumer cooperatives."
The training program is rigorous.
While at Stanford the volunteers will
study Spanish for six weeks (six
hours a day, six days a week!), tech
nical studies geared to help them with
problems encountered by the Peruvian
small businessman, and political, eco
nomic, historical and cultural studies.
San Jose Training
The next two weeks are then spent
living with Spanish-speaking families

and working in the San Jose area
with Mexican-American businessmen.
The Santa Clara Office of Economic
Opportunity is responsible for ar
rangements.
Following arrival in Peru, the vo
lunteers will spend one month train
ing at ESAN (La Escuela de Admini
stracion de Negocios para Graduados),

the Stanford established Peruvian
graduate school of business in Lima.
Next step: two years to be spent
working hard to achieve their ob
jective.
Of the 40 volunteers, Stanford's
graduate school of business leads all
other schools by contributing eight
to the program. Helping these volun

teers prepare themselves in the areas
of language and technical training are
five professors and three Spanish
speaking students from the business
school. Bob Roberts, former Peru
vian Peace Corps volunteer and re
gional Peace Corps director in Bolivia,
is helping Shallenberger direct the
program.

program.
The Peace Corps and the Stanford
Graduate School of Business began a
special training program Wednesday
for 40 young men who prefer an
adventure in South America to a high
paying executive position.
All of the volunteers have master
of business administration degrees
and will work in Peru after eight
weeks of training here.
The program's purpose is to help
Peruvian small business and manage
ment development.
Project Director Frank K. Shallen
berger, professor of industrial man
agement at the business school, feels
that this program is one "which we
hope other business schools will pick
up and operate in other parts of the
world where needed."
Little Guy I>eft Out
Shallenberger, who taught 18
months in a Peruvian graduate school
of business he helped establish, said,
"In Peru a great deal of attention is
paid to big foreign and government
owned business . . . , but nobody is
doing anything for the little guy."
This program is designed to help
that "little guy." Volunteers will work
directly with small businessmen or
cooperatives. According to Shallen
berger, the objective is "anything
which creates and promotes a healthy,
small business sector or aids in form
ing and operating, producing, market
ing or consumer cooperatives."
The training program is rigorous.
While at Stanford the volunteers will
study Spanish for six weeks (six
hours a day, six days a week!), tech
nical studies geared to help them with
problems encountered by the Peruvian
small businessman, and political, eco
nomic, historical and cultural studies.
San Jose Training
The next two weeks are then spent
living with Spanish-speaking families

and working in the San Jose area
with Mexican-American businessmen.
The Santa Clara Office of Economic
Opportunity is responsible for ar
rangements.
Following arrival in Peru, the vo
lunteers will spend one month train
ing at ESAN (La Escuela de Admini
stracion de Negocios para Graduados),

the Stanford established Peruvian
graduate school of business in Lima.
Next step: two years to be spent
working hard to achieve their ob
jective.
Of the 40 volunteers, Stanford's
graduate school of business leads all
other schools by contributing eight
to the program. Helping these volun

teers prepare themselves in the areas
of language and technical training are
five professors and three Spanish
speaking students from the business
school. Bob Roberts, former Peru
vian Peace Corps volunteer and re

program.
