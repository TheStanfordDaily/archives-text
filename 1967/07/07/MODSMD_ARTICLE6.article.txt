# 16-Year-Old Poacher Nabbed For 'Candlestick' Thievery
## 
### 
Batman and Boy Wonder, aided by
the Santa Clara's Sheriff's Depart
ment, arrested a 16 year old Sunny
vale youth in connection with the
theft of two $1500 Italian Renaissance
candlesticks. Poached from the Stan
ford Museum early Sunday morning,
the art works weigh 50 pounds each
and are hardly suited to the uncul
tured tastes of the average Beatle
loving teenager.
Therefore, it is not easy to under
stand why the youth took the can
delabrum. Perhaps the thief, whose
name was withheld by the Santa Clara
Sheriff's Department, wished to im
press his current fiancee with a ro
mantic candlelight dinner. But find
ing only electric lamps from Macy's
Bargain Basement at home, he de
cided to borrow what he needed from
Stanford.
Maybe this motive is entirely in
correct and perhaps the youth sought
to live a childhood dream. He may
have been inspired by the stirring
lines of the famous nursery rhyme:
Jack be little
Jack be quick
Jack jump over
The candlestick.

Of course, someone with the erudi
tion of a Newton or an Einstein
would not doubt that any ordinary
Jack who is both little and quick

could propel himself in such a way
as to overcome the forces of gravity
and jump over a candlestick. But the
young poacher is no Einstein or New
ton and he had to prove for himself
that he could overcome the forces of
nature.
Apparently the Sheriff's Depart
ment was unaware of the nursery
rhyme -the most important clue in
the robbery—for it was unable to
solve the theft immediately. In near
desperation, the sheriff projected the
bat signal on the fog that occasion
ally rolls into the Bay Area. Respond
ing immediately to the call, Batman
and Boy Wonder arrived on the scene.
Batman recited the nursery rhyme;
Boy Wonder remarked "Holy Candle
Snuffer;" and the sheriff knew in
stantly who the suspect was.
Arresting the youth on Wednesday,
the sheriff courageously returned the
candlesticks to the Miedel Room of
the Museum. Batman returned to
Wayne Manor; the youth was ordered
over for juvenile court action; and
the world was made a little more un
pleasant for the museum custodian
who now has to dust the damn can
dlesticks again.
