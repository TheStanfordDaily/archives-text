### 
Mem What?, the coffee house that
initiated Summer Quarter operations
in the back of Tresidder last week,
will be open at 9:00 five days a week
from now on, according to Coffee
House Denizeness and Committee
Chairman Janet Cox. The news was
revealed by the espresso-stained
young lady at a limited press confer
ence shortly before dawn this morn
ing.
A detailed study made earlier this
week showed that Stanford Summer
students go to bod approximately one
hour and thirty-six minutes earlier
than Stanfordites during the regular
school year. "And we're flexible," bub
bled Miss Cox, sanguinely brushing
donut crumbs off her saddle shoes.
