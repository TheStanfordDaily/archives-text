# SU Student Designs Portable Gas Station

### 
A new solution to the old prob
lem of how to get a car serviced
without waiting around for it
has been proposed by a Stanford

University design student, Mich
ael Nielsen.
His idea is to bring the ser
vice station to the car.
Nielsen has designed and built
a model of a service station on
wheels which could be pulled to
any location by a truck-tractor.
On its temporary site — say
a large company parking lot
the wheels could be removed and
the unit placed on the ground
with built-in jacks. The tractor
could then leave and go to other
hauling jobs.
Order 'Flag;'
An unattended order stand
where customers could safely
leave their keys and obtain ser
vice order blanks also was work
ed out by the Stanford design
student. The order form is de
signed to attach like a flag on
the car's radio antenna after be
ing filled out. Its checkered cover
would make it easy for atten
dants to spot the cars wanting
service.
Nielsen's portable service sta
tion would contain a compact
grease rack and pneumatic
grease guns similar to those in
conventional service stations.
Two large globular tanks, one
on each end of the portable sta
tion, would carry gas and oil.
All Weather
An air-driven piston would
power the lift of the grease rack.
Cars would be driven onto the
rack through large doors in the
sides of the station. The doors,
opening up and out, would form
roof extensions from which
heavy canvas walls could be
hung in bad weather.
Nielsen designed and built his
portable service station as a
course project in product de
sign, which is jointly sponsored
by Stanford's Mechanical Engi
neering and Art Departments.
His work on it also contributed
to his completion of the require
ments for a master's degree in
design.
Asked what he plans to do
with his idea now, Nielsen said
wearily: "I'd like to forget it."
He estimated he had put in over
500 hours of research and work
on it and was ready to think
about something else.
