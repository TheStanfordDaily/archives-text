# Preminger Here Today
## 
### 
Otto Preminger, one of America's
leading film producer-directors, will
give a guest audience briefing on
American achievements in film, to
day at 4:30 p.m. in the large lounge
of Tresidder Union on the campus.
The briefing, planned as part of
Stanford's 1967 Summer Festival of
the Arts, is offered free of charge and
is open to the public. Preminger,
whose extensive credits include such
films as "Laura," "Forever Amber,"
"Carmen Jones," "The Man With The
Golden Arm," and "Porgy and Bess,"
has been a producer and director
since age 20.
After leaving his native Austria
for a directing-acting career in New
York, Preminger joined the Yale Uni
versity faculty as an associate pro
fessor of drama. He is still associated
with Yale.
Considered one of the most shrewd
judges of film scripts and acting
talent, Preminger's output in this dec
ade alone has included "Exodus,"
"Advise and Consent," "The Cardi
nal,'' "In Harm's Way," and "Bunny
Lake is Missing." His latest film,
"Hurry Sundown," will premiere this
fall. Its tradition-breaking feature is
the young stars cast in its leads:
Michael Caine, Jane Fonda, John
Philip Law, and Diahann Carroll.
Preminger is currently reading the
filming of John Hersey's novel of
contemporary youth, "Too Far To
Walk."
