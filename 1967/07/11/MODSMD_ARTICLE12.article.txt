# Hash-Bury: Legacy Of The Beat Generation
## 
### Mary Dedinsky 
A steady chant of "Ah-h-h,
ah-h-h, ah-h-h," a persistent
drum beat, the staring eyes of
strangers, and a feeling of com
radeship all made the scene of
hippie entertainment at the
Geary-Powell corner of Union
.square Saturday afternoon.
Twelve longhaired hippies,

some bat clout, some sanaaiea,
and some with kerchieves tied
around their heads like Indian
braves, sat in a circle on the
pavement and joined together in
a spiritual-type of montone sing
ing.
150 Spectators
Surrounded by about 150 spec
tators, the hippies seemed to be
in their own world, contempla

five and calm, focusing either
on the ground, their instru
ments, or into space. When the
chant ended, they talked softly
among themselves while a smil
ing, barefoot, redhead passed a
cup around:
"To eat and to sleep," she said.
The crowd laughed when a
muscular youth with long curls
yelled out, "A quarter to have
the name of your company or
favorite politician mentioned."
A white-haired man responded
by tossing a dime and then a
quarter into the circle of hippies.
Pointing at the redhead, he
said, "Isn't she a nice girl? I
gave her all I had. Isn't she a
nice girl?"
Passing the Cup
After the cup had been
passed, the strong, vigorous, na
tive sounding chant was start
ed again. A fifty?year?old hip
pie who for 25 cents gave his
name as Lindy, clinked a metal
tablespoon against a big pottery
jar whose opening was strewn
with string.
Another hippie plucked an un
named wooden affair which
looked like a cross between a
guitar and a miniature pinball
machine. A drum, tambourine
and three maracas completed
the hippies' instrumental accom
paniment.
Play Ball With Jesus
While the hippies sang, a
white-haired man carrying a
signboard about Judgment Day
paced the sidewalk graveling
repeatedly, "Get your sins
washed away on the blood of
Jesus Christ, the devil don't
care!"
On the same corner a youth
was selling The Seer, a hippie
newspaper. As he sold the last
one, he sighed, "Now I can go

home—" home being Haight-
Ashbury.
The Haight-Ashbury district,
extending eight blocks, from
Golden Gate Park (a popular
gathering place for hippy read
ings) to Haight-Central, has
been called "the vibrant epicen
ter of the hippie movement." The
Haight drag, with its stores and
hangouts crowded together, is a
scene of constant activity.
Tourists
Cars with sightseers or ar
riving hippies lock bumper to
bumper; dogs mill aimlessly;
dirty, innocent children play;
and hippies wander, talk, sit,
smoke, eat, and watch.
Hippie clothing includes a
variety of styles. Hippie women
can be seen in long, granny
dresses with shawls wrapped
around them, their feet warmly
inside big boots or moccasins,
or they can be seen in mini
dresses, barefoot or sandaled.
Hippie men wear bluejeans,
old army coats, and thick boots,
or in checkered pants, vest, old
suit coats, and go barefoot or
sandaled. Wise San Francisco
hippies dress warmly, though,
some even carry blankets around
with them, because of the chill
the fog and evening air bring.
Flowered Hair
Most hippies have long hair,
and many men wear beards.
Flowers in the hair, bell-; around
the neck, earrings (some men
wearing only one), bead neck
laces, rabbits feet, buttons, ker
chieves, cowboy, digger, and fish
ing hats, and ankle bracelets are
popular. Why the head bands?
One hippie replied, "To keep the
hair out of my eyes, and, some
times, to keep my head to
gether."
Although a surprisingly large
number of hippies are shaved
and wear clean clothes, it is not
unusual to see blemished skin,
dirty hair, and filthy habit; nor
it is uncommon to see scabbed
and blistered feet or a baby
riding on his father's shoulders
with a diseased scalp.
Hippie Stores
But Haight Street has some
charming and fascinating little
stores, with catchy names like
"The Blushing Peony Skinni
dippin'." Usually a faint trace
of incense greets the customer
at the door. Once inside he finds
himself confronted with a maze
of brilliant color.
Psychedelic paintings, gay
paper flowers, colored glass, ear
rings, bright, patterned pillows
and records are the standard
stock. Posters such as "A toy
gun is not a toy gun," and but
tons saying, "I'm you," "Praise
the pill," and "Ayn Rand is
Ronald Reagan in drag" are
found over and over again in the
stores.

Violin Virtuoso


Pseudo Hippie
Almost every store window
has items of interest side by
side. One, entitled "Love Poem"
by Emmet Fox promises the
power of love, ending with the
line "If only you would love
enough you would be the hap
piest and most powerful being
in the world;" the hippie idea of
love and what it can do.
STP
Next to it is found a red and
yellow poster, saying, "STP
users. Do not take thorazine,
Seconal or other downers for
STP bum trips." It was signed
by a M.D. and gave the tele
phone number and address of a
free medical clinic.
While on Haight Street a rider
or walker is approached usually

by about 4 or 5 different hippies
selling 4 or 5 different news
papers. Hippie newspapers, in
tabloid form with about 16
pages, cost between 10 cents and
a quarter.
Two of the more popular
newspapers, The Seer and the
Berkeley Barb, carry Hippie
poetry, photography, drawings,
stories and special news of in
terest. For example, The Seer,
which has very few adver.ise
ments, carried one in their J Ist
issue, called, "The liobbit Hole"
advertising a store where san
dals and all kinds of leather
goods can be bought.
The Berkeley Barb, a leading
hippie paper carried a column
called, "Phrequent Phones" in
its last issue which listed the
telephone numbers of the Alco
holics Anonymous, the Bkly
Draft Information Committee,
Oakl Planned Parenthood Or
ganization, Pregnancy Test, and
the Sexual Freedom League.
The Oracle, considered by
many hippies to be their official
paper, is organized like The Seer
and the Barb except that it is
bigger and therefore costs 25
cents. Most people who are not
hippies find the articles in these
papers obscure or silly; but it
is difficult to visit Haight-Ash
bury and to escape without buy
ing at least one kind.
Persistent newssellers that
they are, the hippies thrust the
papers in front of the face of
a passer-by or block the view of
a driver until he buys one so
that in honest self-defense he
can say he has already bought
one.
Sidewalk Serenade
Things bizarre are the rule in
hippie town. Three or four peo
ple often sit down on the side
walk and play their guitars, si
tars or flutes. Violinists practice
feverishly, oblivious to bystand
ers.
One Negro hippie bracing
himself against a brick wall,
stayed in the same place for well
over an hour, just watching the
people go by through his two
pair of glasses made of red and
green glass fused together at
different angles. Everyone who
passed him got the pinch for a
quarter "to go to Berkeley on."
All along Haight Street men
and women kiss and embrace in
doorways. Dogs find free love
on the streets, too. Children are
treated gently and seem to get
adequate affection. A boy about
eleven, is heard to say as he
whizzes off on the back of a
motorcycle, "I can't wait to sing
again tonight."
Plastic Hippies
Unexpected people can be met
while on Haight Street, too. Be
sides the genuine hippies, there
are plastic hippies (the fakers)
who can usually be identified by
their too neat, too clean, too new
clothes, or in the case of a girl,
bleached hair or make-up.
A summer visitor to Califor
nia was walking up Haight
Street one day when she met a
vacationing hippie from Pen
nsylvania who was going to at
tend the same college she at
tended. He had been in hippie
town two days but was still
pleased.
He was accompanied by a
bow-carrying Mexican hippie
who had been living in a truck
in the Haight-Ashbury district
for the last two months. When
asked why he was carrying the
bow with him, he replied he was
getting ready to drop-out of so
ciety and live in the forest with
his wife — after he found her.
The Mexican said both his
parents were hippies and had
turned him on. "My mother and
father," he said, "they're mak
ing it all the time." The Mexican
did not hate society, he just did
not seem to want to be a part
of it: "Everybody's taking an
ego trip in society," he said.
Neither the Mexican nor the

visiting hippies minded being
called hippies, but they preferred
not to be classified as anything.
They said they did not hate the
"square," or the police, that the
only people they hated were the
"narcs," the special agents who
dress like hippies and arrest
those with dope. The Mexican
said, "We get the Hell's Angels
after them."
Many hippies, like the visit
ing hippie, just pack a camper
or knap sack, leave their homes,
and come to Haight-Ashbury
with little money or clothing,
and no food. Set up especially
for these people are places
called "crash pads" to which the
poor hippie is directed. "And if
he can't find anything there,"

one hippie said, "then he can
crash on a roof."
Diggers
All cold and hungry hippies
are also familiar with Diggers,
the Free Store. Kept supplied by
better-off hippies, old clothes
from used underwear to
wrinkled and soiled semi-formal
attire are given away. Free food
and dustry books are also pro
vided by the Free Store.
As day ends, the temperature
falls and the sightseers disap
pear; the hippies are left alone
to go read their poetry, smoke
pot, make love, attend free turn
ons, sleep on roofs, or drop-out.

dress like hippies and arrest
those with dope. The Mexican
said, "We get the Hell's Angels
after them."
Many hippies, like the visit
ing hippie, just pack a camper
or knap sack, leave their homes,
and come to Haight-Ashbury
with little money or clothing,
and no food. Set up especially
for these people are places
called "crash pads" to which the
poor hippie is directed. "And if
he can't find anything there,"

one hippie said, "then he can
crash on a roof."
Diggers
All cold and hungry hippies
are also familiar with Diggers,
the Free Store. Kept supplied by
better-off hippies, old clothes
from used underwear to
wrinkled and soiled semi-formal
attire are given away. Free food
and dustry books are also pro
vided by the Free Store.
As day ends, the temperature
falls and the sightseers disap
pear; the hippies are left alone
to go read their poetry, smoke
pot, make love, attend free turn
ons, sleep on roofs, or drop-out.

Repent Or Else


Perilous Perch
A steady chant of "Ah-h-h,
ah-h-h, ah-h-h," a persistent
drum beat, the staring eyes of
strangers, and a feeling of com
radeship all made the scene of
hippie entertainment at the
Geary-Powell corner of Union
.square Saturday afternoon.
Twelve longhaired hippies,

some bat clout, some sanaaiea,
and some with kerchieves tied
around their heads like Indian
braves, sat in a circle on the
pavement and joined together in
a spiritual-type of montone sing
ing.
150 Spectators
Surrounded by about 150 spec
tators, the hippies seemed to be
in their own world, contempla

five and calm, focusing either
on the ground, their instru
ments, or into space. When the
chant ended, they talked softly
among themselves while a smil
ing, barefoot, redhead passed a
cup around:
"To eat and to sleep," she said.
The crowd laughed when a
muscular youth with long curls
yelled out, "A quarter to have
the name of your company or
favorite politician mentioned."
A white-haired man responded
by tossing a dime and then a
quarter into the circle of hippies.
Pointing at the redhead, he
said, "Isn't she a nice girl? I
gave her all I had. Isn't she a
nice girl?"
Passing the Cup
After the cup had been
passed, the strong, vigorous, na
tive sounding chant was start
ed again. A fifty?year?old hip
pie who for 25 cents gave his
name as Lindy, clinked a metal
tablespoon against a big pottery
jar whose opening was strewn
with string.
Another hippie plucked an un
named wooden affair which
looked like a cross between a
guitar and a miniature pinball
machine. A drum, tambourine
and three maracas completed
the hippies' instrumental accom
paniment.
Play Ball With Jesus
While the hippies sang, a
white-haired man carrying a
signboard about Judgment Day
paced the sidewalk graveling
repeatedly, "Get your sins
washed away on the blood of
Jesus Christ, the devil don't
care!"
On the same corner a youth
was selling The Seer, a hippie
newspaper. As he sold the last
one, he sighed, "Now I can go

home—" home being Haight-
Ashbury.
The Haight-Ashbury district,
extending eight blocks, from
Golden Gate Park (a popular
gathering place for hippy read
ings) to Haight-Central, has
been called "the vibrant epicen
ter of the hippie movement." The
Haight drag, with its stores and
hangouts crowded together, is a
scene of constant activity.
Tourists
Cars with sightseers or ar
riving hippies lock bumper to
bumper; dogs mill aimlessly;
dirty, innocent children play;
and hippies wander, talk, sit,
smoke, eat, and watch.
Hippie clothing includes a
variety of styles. Hippie women
can be seen in long, granny
dresses with shawls wrapped
around them, their feet warmly
inside big boots or moccasins,
or they can be seen in mini
dresses, barefoot or sandaled.
Hippie men wear bluejeans,
old army coats, and thick boots,
or in checkered pants, vest, old
suit coats, and go barefoot or
sandaled. Wise San Francisco
hippies dress warmly, though,
some even carry blankets around
with them, because of the chill
the fog and evening air bring.
Flowered Hair
Most hippies have long hair,
and many men wear beards.
Flowers in the hair, bell-; around
the neck, earrings (some men
wearing only one), bead neck
laces, rabbits feet, buttons, ker
chieves, cowboy, digger, and fish
ing hats, and ankle bracelets are
popular. Why the head bands?
One hippie replied, "To keep the
hair out of my eyes, and, some
times, to keep my head to
gether."
Although a surprisingly large
number of hippies are shaved
and wear clean clothes, it is not
unusual to see blemished skin,
dirty hair, and filthy habit; nor
it is uncommon to see scabbed
and blistered feet or a baby
riding on his father's shoulders
with a diseased scalp.
Hippie Stores
But Haight Street has some
charming and fascinating little
stores, with catchy names like
"The Blushing Peony Skinni
dippin'." Usually a faint trace
of incense greets the customer
at the door. Once inside he finds
himself confronted with a maze
of brilliant color.
Psychedelic paintings, gay
paper flowers, colored glass, ear
rings, bright, patterned pillows
and records are the standard
stock. Posters such as "A toy
gun is not a toy gun," and but
tons saying, "I'm you," "Praise
the pill," and "Ayn Rand is
Ronald Reagan in drag" are
found over and over again in the
stores.

Pseudo Hippie
Almost every store window
has items of interest side by
side. One, entitled "Love Poem"
by Emmet Fox promises the
power of love, ending with the
line "If only you would love
enough you would be the hap
piest and most powerful being
in the world;" the hippie idea of
love and what it can do.
STP
Next to it is found a red and
yellow poster, saying, "STP
users. Do not take thorazine,
Seconal or other downers for
STP bum trips." It was signed
by a M.D. and gave the tele
phone number and address of a
free medical clinic.
While on Haight Street a rider
or walker is approached usually

by about 4 or 5 different hippies
selling 4 or 5 different news
papers. Hippie newspapers, in
tabloid form with about 16
pages, cost between 10 cents and
a quarter.
Two of the more popular
newspapers, The Seer and the
Berkeley Barb, carry Hippie
poetry, photography, drawings,
stories and special news of in
terest. For example, The Seer,
which has very few adver.ise
ments, carried one in their J Ist
issue, called, "The liobbit Hole"
advertising a store where san
dals and all kinds of leather
goods can be bought.
The Berkeley Barb, a leading
hippie paper carried a column
called, "Phrequent Phones" in
its last issue which listed the
telephone numbers of the Alco
holics Anonymous, the Bkly
Draft Information Committee,
Oakl Planned Parenthood Or
ganization, Pregnancy Test, and
the Sexual Freedom League.
The Oracle, considered by
many hippies to be their official
paper, is organized like The Seer
and the Barb except that it is
bigger and therefore costs 25
cents. Most people who are not
hippies find the articles in these
papers obscure or silly; but it
is difficult to visit Haight-Ash
bury and to escape without buy
ing at least one kind.
Persistent newssellers that
they are, the hippies thrust the
papers in front of the face of
a passer-by or block the view of
a driver until he buys one so
that in honest self-defense he
can say he has already bought
one.
Sidewalk Serenade
Things bizarre are the rule in
hippie town. Three or four peo
ple often sit down on the side
walk and play their guitars, si
tars or flutes. Violinists practice
feverishly, oblivious to bystand
ers.
One Negro hippie bracing
himself against a brick wall,
stayed in the same place for well
over an hour, just watching the
people go by through his two
pair of glasses made of red and
green glass fused together at
different angles. Everyone who
passed him got the pinch for a
quarter "to go to Berkeley on."
All along Haight Street men
and women kiss and embrace in
doorways. Dogs find free love
on the streets, too. Children are
treated gently and seem to get
adequate affection. A boy about
eleven, is heard to say as he
whizzes off on the back of a
motorcycle, "I can't wait to sing
again tonight."
Plastic Hippies
Unexpected people can be met
while on Haight Street, too. Be
sides the genuine hippies, there
are plastic hippies (the fakers)
who can usually be identified by
their too neat, too clean, too new
clothes, or in the case of a girl,
bleached hair or make-up.
A summer visitor to Califor
nia was walking up Haight
Street one day when she met a
vacationing hippie from Pen
nsylvania who was going to at
tend the same college she at
tended. He had been in hippie
town two days but was still
pleased.
He was accompanied by a
bow-carrying Mexican hippie
who had been living in a truck
in the Haight-Ashbury district
for the last two months. When
asked why he was carrying the
bow with him, he replied he was
getting ready to drop-out of so
ciety and live in the forest with
his wife — after he found her.
The Mexican said both his
parents were hippies and had
turned him on. "My mother and
father," he said, "they're mak
ing it all the time." The Mexican
did not hate society, he just did
not seem to want to be a part
of it: "Everybody's taking an
ego trip in society," he said.
Neither the Mexican nor the

visiting hippies minded being
called hippies, but they preferred
not to be classified as anything.
They said they did not hate the
"square," or the police, that the
only people they hated were the
"narcs," the special agents who
dress like hippies and arrest
those with dope. The Mexican
said, "We get the Hell's Angels

Street one day when she met a
vacationing hippie from Pen
nsylvania who was going to at
tend the same college she at
tended. He had been in hippie
town two days but was still
pleased.
He was accompanied by a
bow-carrying Mexican hippie
who had been living in a truck
in the Haight-Ashbury district
for the last two months. When
asked why he was carrying the
bow with him, he replied he was
getting ready to drop-out of so
ciety and live in the forest with
his wife — after he found her.
The Mexican said both his
parents were hippies and had
turned him on. "My mother and
father," he said, "they're mak
ing it all the time." The Mexican
did not hate society, he just did
not seem to want to be a part
of it: "Everybody's taking an
ego trip in society," he said.
Neither the Mexican nor the

visiting hippies minded being
called hippies, but they preferred
not to be classified as anything.
They said they did not hate the
"square," or the police, that the
only people they hated were the
"narcs," the special agents who
dress like hippies and arrest
those with dope. The Mexican
said, "We get the Hell's Angels
after them."
Many hippies, like the visit
ing hippie, just pack a camper
or knap sack, leave their homes,
and come to Haight-Ashbury
with little money or clothing,
and no food. Set up especially
for these people are places
called "crash pads" to which the
poor hippie is directed. "And if
he can't find anything there,"

one hippie said, "then he can
crash on a roof."
Diggers
All cold and hungry hippies
are also familiar with Diggers,
the Free Store. Kept supplied by
better-off hippies, old clothes
from used underwear to
wrinkled and soiled semi-formal
attire are given away. Free food
and dustry books are also pro
vided by the Free Store.
As day ends, the temperature
falls and the sightseers disap
pear; the hippies are left alone
to go read their poetry, smoke
pot, make love, attend free turn
ons, sleep on roofs, or drop-out.

Repent Or Else


Perilous Perch
A steady chant of "Ah-h-h,
ah-h-h, ah-h-h," a persistent
drum beat, the staring eyes of
strangers, and a feeling of com
radeship all made the scene of
hippie entertainment at the
Geary-Powell corner of Union
.square Saturday afternoon.
Twelve longhaired hippies,

some bat clout, some sanaaiea,
and some with kerchieves tied
around their heads like Indian
braves, sat in a circle on the
pavement and joined together in
a spiritual-type of montone sing
ing.
150 Spectators
Surrounded by about 150 spec
tators, the hippies seemed to be
in their own world, contempla

five and calm, focusing either
on the ground, their instru
ments, or into space. When the
chant ended, they talked softly
among themselves while a smil
ing, barefoot, redhead passed a
cup around:
"To eat and to sleep," she said.
The crowd laughed when a
muscular youth with long curls
yelled out, "A quarter to have
the name of your company or
favorite politician mentioned."
A white-haired man responded
by tossing a dime and then a
quarter into the circle of hippies.
Pointing at the redhead, he
said, "Isn't she a nice girl? I
gave her all I had. Isn't she a
nice girl?"
Passing the Cup
After the cup had been
passed, the strong, vigorous, na
tive sounding chant was start
ed again. A fifty?year?old hip
pie who for 25 cents gave his
name as Lindy, clinked a metal
tablespoon against a big pottery
jar whose opening was strewn
with string.
Another hippie plucked an un
named wooden affair which
looked like a cross between a
guitar and a miniature pinball
machine. A drum, tambourine
and three maracas completed
the hippies' instrumental accom
paniment.
Play Ball With Jesus
While the hippies sang, a
white-haired man carrying a
signboard about Judgment Day
paced the sidewalk graveling
repeatedly, "Get your sins
washed away on the blood of
Jesus Christ, the devil don't
care!"
On the same corner a youth
was selling The Seer, a hippie
newspaper. As he sold the last
one, he sighed, "Now I can go

home—" home being Haight-
Ashbury.
The Haight-Ashbury district,
extending eight blocks, from
Golden Gate Park (a popular
gathering place for hippy read
ings) to Haight-Central, has
been called "the vibrant epicen
ter of the hippie movement." The
Haight drag, with its stores and
hangouts crowded together, is a
scene of constant activity.
Tourists
Cars with sightseers or ar
riving hippies lock bumper to
bumper; dogs mill aimlessly;
dirty, innocent children play;
and hippies wander, talk, sit,
smoke, eat, and watch.
Hippie clothing includes a
variety of styles. Hippie women
can be seen in long, granny
dresses with shawls wrapped
around them, their feet warmly
inside big boots or moccasins,
or they can be seen in mini
dresses, barefoot or sandaled.
Hippie men wear bluejeans,
old army coats, and thick boots,
or in checkered pants, vest, old
suit coats, and go barefoot or
sandaled. Wise San Francisco
hippies dress warmly, though,
some even carry blankets around
with them, because of the chill
the fog and evening air bring.
Flowered Hair
Most hippies have long hair,
and many men wear beards.
Flowers in the hair, bell-; around
the neck, earrings (some men
wearing only one), bead neck
laces, rabbits feet, buttons, ker
chieves, cowboy, digger, and fish
ing hats, and ankle bracelets are
popular. Why the head bands?
One hippie replied, "To keep the
hair out of my eyes, and, some
times, to keep my head to
gether."
Although a surprisingly large
number of hippies are shaved
and wear clean clothes, it is not
unusual to see blemished skin,
dirty hair, and filthy habit; nor
it is uncommon to see scabbed
and blistered feet or a baby
riding on his father's shoulders
with a diseased scalp.
Hippie Stores
But Haight Street has some
charming and fascinating little
stores, with catchy names like
"The Blushing Peony Skinni
dippin'." Usually a faint trace
of incense greets the customer
at the door. Once inside he finds
himself confronted with a maze
of brilliant color.
Psychedelic paintings, gay
paper flowers, colored glass, ear
rings, bright, patterned pillows
and records are the standard
stock. Posters such as "A toy
gun is not a toy gun," and but
tons saying, "I'm you," "Praise
the pill," and "Ayn Rand is
Ronald Reagan in drag" are
found over and over again in the
stores.

Pseudo Hippie
Almost every store window
has items of interest side by
side. One, entitled "Love Poem"
by Emmet Fox promises the
power of love, ending with the
line "If only you would love
enough you would be the hap
piest and most powerful being
in the world;" the hippie idea of
love and what it can do.
STP
Next to it is found a red and
yellow poster, saying, "STP
users. Do not take thorazine,
Seconal or other downers for
STP bum trips." It was signed
by a M.D. and gave the tele
phone number and address of a
free medical clinic.
While on Haight Street a rider
or walker is approached usually

by about 4 or 5 different hippies
selling 4 or 5 different news
papers. Hippie newspapers, in
tabloid form with about 16
pages, cost between 10 cents and
a quarter.
Two of the more popular
newspapers, The Seer and the
Berkeley Barb, carry Hippie
poetry, photography, drawings,
stories and special news of in
terest. For example, The Seer,
which has very few adver.ise
ments, carried one in their J Ist
issue, called, "The liobbit Hole"
advertising a store where san
dals and all kinds of leather
goods can be bought.
The Berkeley Barb, a leading
hippie paper carried a column
called, "Phrequent Phones" in
its last issue which listed the
telephone numbers of the Alco
holics Anonymous, the Bkly
Draft Information Committee,
Oakl Planned Parenthood Or
ganization, Pregnancy Test, and
the Sexual Freedom League.
The Oracle, considered by
many hippies to be their official
paper, is organized like The Seer
and the Barb except that it is
bigger and therefore costs 25
cents. Most people who are not
hippies find the articles in these
papers obscure or silly; but it
is difficult to visit Haight-Ash
bury and to escape without buy
ing at least one kind.
Persistent newssellers that
they are, the hippies thrust the
papers in front of the face of
a passer-by or block the view of
a driver until he buys one so
that in honest self-defense he
can say he has already bought
one.
Sidewalk Serenade
Things bizarre are the rule in
hippie town. Three or four peo
ple often sit down on the side
walk and play their guitars, si
tars or flutes. Violinists practice
feverishly, oblivious to bystand
ers.
One Negro hippie bracing
himself against a brick wall,
stayed in the same place for well
over an hour, just watching the
people go by through his two
pair of glasses made of red and
green glass fused together at
different angles. Everyone who
passed him got the pinch for a
quarter "to go to Berkeley on."
All along Haight Street men
and women kiss and embrace in
doorways. Dogs find free love
on the streets, too. Children are
treated gently and seem to get
adequate affection. A boy about
eleven, is heard to say as he
whizzes off on the back of a
motorcycle, "I can't wait to sing
again tonight."
Plastic Hippies
Unexpected people can be met
while on Haight Street, too. Be
sides the genuine hippies, there
are plastic hippies (the fakers)
who can usually be identified by
their too neat, too clean, too new
clothes, or in the case of a girl,
bleached hair or make-up.

tars or flutes. Violinists practice
feverishly, oblivious to bystand
ers.
One Negro hippie bracing
himself against a brick wall,
stayed in the same place for well
over an hour, just watching the
people go by through his two
pair of glasses made of red and
green glass fused together at
different angles. Everyone who
passed him got the pinch for a
quarter "to go to Berkeley on."
All along Haight Street men
and women kiss and embrace in
doorways. Dogs find free love
on the streets, too. Children are
treated gently and seem to get
adequate affection. A boy about
eleven, is heard to say as he
whizzes off on the back of a
motorcycle, "I can't wait to sing
again tonight."
Plastic Hippies
Unexpected people can be met
while on Haight Street, too. Be
sides the genuine hippies, there
are plastic hippies (the fakers)
who can usually be identified by
their too neat, too clean, too new
clothes, or in the case of a girl,
bleached hair or make-up.
A summer visitor to Califor
nia was walking up Haight
Street one day when she met a
vacationing hippie from Pen
nsylvania who was going to at
tend the same college she at
tended. He had been in hippie
town two days but was still
pleased.
He was accompanied by a
bow-carrying Mexican hippie
who had been living in a truck
in the Haight-Ashbury district
for the last two months. When
asked why he was carrying the
bow with him, he replied he was
getting ready to drop-out of so
ciety and live in the forest with
his wife — after he found her.
The Mexican said both his
parents were hippies and had
turned him on. "My mother and
father," he said, "they're mak
ing it all the time." The Mexican
did not hate society, he just did
not seem to want to be a part
of it: "Everybody's taking an
ego trip in society," he said.
Neither the Mexican nor the

visiting hippies minded being
called hippies, but they preferred
not to be classified as anything.
They said they did not hate the
"square," or the police, that the
only people they hated were the
"narcs," the special agents who
dress like hippies and arrest
those with dope. The Mexican
said, "We get the Hell's Angels
after them."
Many hippies, like the visit
ing hippie, just pack a camper
or knap sack, leave their homes,
and come to Haight-Ashbury
with little money or clothing,
and no food. Set up especially
for these people are places
called "crash pads" to which the
poor hippie is directed. "And if
he can't find anything there,"

one hippie said, "then he can
crash on a roof."
Diggers
All cold and hungry hippies
are also familiar with Diggers,
the Free Store. Kept supplied by
better-off hippies, old clothes
from used underwear to
wrinkled and soiled semi-formal
attire are given away. Free food
and dustry books are also pro
vided by the Free Store.
As day ends, the temperature
falls and the sightseers disap
pear; the hippies are left alone
to go read their poetry, smoke
pot, make love, attend free turn
ons, sleep on roofs, or drop-out.

Repent Or Else


Perilous Perch
A steady chant of "Ah-h-h,
ah-h-h, ah-h-h," a persistent
drum beat, the staring eyes of
strangers, and a feeling of com
radeship all made the scene of
hippie entertainment at the
Geary-Powell corner of Union
.square Saturday afternoon.
Twelve longhaired hippies,

some bat clout, some sanaaiea,
and some with kerchieves tied
around their heads like Indian
braves, sat in a circle on the
pavement and joined together in
a spiritual-type of montone sing
ing.
150 Spectators
Surrounded by about 150 spec
tators, the hippies seemed to be
in their own world, contempla

five and calm, focusing either
on the ground, their instru
ments, or into space. When the
chant ended, they talked softly
among themselves while a smil
ing, barefoot, redhead passed a
cup around:
"To eat and to sleep," she said.
The crowd laughed when a
muscular youth with long curls
yelled out, "A quarter to have
the name of your company or
favorite politician mentioned."
A white-haired man responded
by tossing a dime and then a
quarter into the circle of hippies.
Pointing at the redhead, he
said, "Isn't she a nice girl? I
gave her all I had. Isn't she a
nice girl?"
Passing the Cup
After the cup had been
passed, the strong, vigorous, na
tive sounding chant was start
ed again. A fifty?year?old hip
pie who for 25 cents gave his
name as Lindy, clinked a metal
tablespoon against a big pottery
jar whose opening was strewn
with string.
Another hippie plucked an un
named wooden affair which
looked like a cross between a
guitar and a miniature pinball
machine. A drum, tambourine
and three maracas completed
the hippies' instrumental accom
paniment.
Play Ball With Jesus
While the hippies sang, a
white-haired man carrying a
signboard about Judgment Day
paced the sidewalk graveling
repeatedly, "Get your sins
washed away on the blood of
Jesus Christ, the devil don't
care!"
On the same corner a youth
was selling The Seer, a hippie
newspaper. As he sold the last
one, he sighed, "Now I can go

home—" home being Haight-
Ashbury.
The Haight-Ashbury district,
extending eight blocks, from
Golden Gate Park (a popular
gathering place for hippy read
ings) to Haight-Central, has
been called "the vibrant epicen
ter of the hippie movement." The
Haight drag, with its stores and
hangouts crowded together, is a
scene of constant activity.
Tourists
Cars with sightseers or ar
riving hippies lock bumper to
bumper; dogs mill aimlessly;
dirty, innocent children play;
and hippies wander, talk, sit,
smoke, eat, and watch.
Hippie clothing includes a
variety of styles. Hippie women
can be seen in long, granny
dresses with shawls wrapped
around them, their feet warmly
inside big boots or moccasins,
or they can be seen in mini
dresses, barefoot or sandaled.
Hippie men wear bluejeans,
old army coats, and thick boots,
or in checkered pants, vest, old
suit coats, and go barefoot or
sandaled. Wise San Francisco
hippies dress warmly, though,
some even carry blankets around
with them, because of the chill
the fog and evening air bring.
Flowered Hair
Most hippies have long hair,
and many men wear beards.
Flowers in the hair, bell-; around
the neck, earrings (some men
wearing only one), bead neck
laces, rabbits feet, buttons, ker
chieves, cowboy, digger, and fish
ing hats, and ankle bracelets are
popular. Why the head bands?
One hippie replied, "To keep the
hair out of my eyes, and, some
times, to keep my head to
gether."
Although a surprisingly large
number of hippies are shaved
and wear clean clothes, it is not
unusual to see blemished skin,
dirty hair, and filthy habit; nor
it is uncommon to see scabbed
and blistered feet or a baby
riding on his father's shoulders
with a diseased scalp.
Hippie Stores
But Haight Street has some
charming and fascinating little
stores, with catchy names like
"The Blushing Peony Skinni
dippin'." Usually a faint trace
of incense greets the customer
at the door. Once inside he finds
himself confronted with a maze
of brilliant color.
Psychedelic paintings, gay
paper flowers, colored glass, ear
rings, bright, patterned pillows
and records are the standard
stock. Posters such as "A toy
gun is not a toy gun," and but
tons saying, "I'm you," "Praise
the pill," and "Ayn Rand is
Ronald Reagan in drag" are
found over and over again in the
stores.

Pseudo Hippie
Almost every store window
has items of interest side by
side. One, entitled "Love Poem"
by Emmet Fox promises the
power of love, ending with the
line "If only you would love
enough you would be the hap
piest and most powerful being
in the world;" the hippie idea of
love and what it can do.
STP
Next to it is found a red and
yellow poster, saying, "STP
users. Do not take thorazine,
Seconal or other downers for
STP bum trips." It was signed
by a M.D. and gave the tele
phone number and address of a
free medical clinic.
While on Haight Street a rider
or walker is approached usually

by about 4 or 5 different hippies
selling 4 or 5 different news
papers. Hippie newspapers, in
tabloid form with about 16
pages, cost between 10 cents and
a quarter.
Two of the more popular
newspapers, The Seer and the
Berkeley Barb, carry Hippie
poetry, photography, drawings,
stories and special news of in
terest. For example, The Seer,
which has very few adver.ise
ments, carried one in their J Ist
issue, called, "The liobbit Hole"
advertising a store where san
dals and all kinds of leather
goods can be bought.
The Berkeley Barb, a leading
hippie paper carried a column
called, "Phrequent Phones" in
its last issue which listed the
telephone numbers of the Alco
holics Anonymous, the Bkly
Draft Information Committee,
Oakl Planned Parenthood Or
ganization, Pregnancy Test, and
the Sexual Freedom League.
The Oracle, considered by
many hippies to be their official
paper, is organized like The Seer
and the Barb except that it is
bigger and therefore costs 25
cents. Most people who are not
hippies find the articles in these
papers obscure or silly; but it
is difficult to visit Haight-Ash
bury and to escape without buy
ing at least one kind.
Persistent newssellers that
they are, the hippies thrust the
papers in front of the face of
a passer-by or block the view of
a driver until he buys one so
that in honest self-defense he
can say he has already bought
one.
Sidewalk Serenade
Things bizarre are the rule in
hippie town. Three or four peo
ple often sit down on the side

feverishly, oblivious to bystand

dals and all kinds of leather
goods can be bought.
The Berkeley Barb, a leading
hippie paper carried a column
called, "Phrequent Phones" in
its last issue which listed the
telephone numbers of the Alco
holics Anonymous, the Bkly
Draft Information Committee,
Oakl Planned Parenthood Or
ganization, Pregnancy Test, and
the Sexual Freedom League.
The Oracle, considered by
many hippies to be their official
paper, is organized like The Seer
and the Barb except that it is
bigger and therefore costs 25
cents. Most people who are not
hippies find the articles in these
papers obscure or silly; but it
is difficult to visit Haight-Ash
bury and to escape without buy
ing at least one kind.
Persistent newssellers that
they are, the hippies thrust the
papers in front of the face of
a passer-by or block the view of
a driver until he buys one so
that in honest self-defense he
can say he has already bought
one.
Sidewalk Serenade
Things bizarre are the rule in
hippie town. Three or four peo
ple often sit down on the side
walk and play their guitars, si
tars or flutes. Violinists practice
feverishly, oblivious to bystand
ers.
One Negro hippie bracing
himself against a brick wall,
stayed in the same place for well
over an hour, just watching the
people go by through his two
pair of glasses made of red and
green glass fused together at
different angles. Everyone who
passed him got the pinch for a
quarter "to go to Berkeley on."
All along Haight Street men
and women kiss and embrace in
doorways. Dogs find free love
on the streets, too. Children are
treated gently and seem to get
adequate affection. A boy about
eleven, is heard to say as he
whizzes off on the back of a
motorcycle, "I can't wait to sing
again tonight."
Plastic Hippies
Unexpected people can be met
while on Haight Street, too. Be
sides the genuine hippies, there
are plastic hippies (the fakers)
who can usually be identified by
their too neat, too clean, too new
clothes, or in the case of a girl,
bleached hair or make-up.
A summer visitor to Califor
nia was walking up Haight
Street one day when she met a
vacationing hippie from Pen
nsylvania who was going to at
tend the same college she at
tended. He had been in hippie
town two days but was still
pleased.
He was accompanied by a
bow-carrying Mexican hippie
who had been living in a truck
in the Haight-Ashbury district
for the last two months. When
asked why he was carrying the
bow with him, he replied he was
getting ready to drop-out of so
ciety and live in the forest with
his wife — after he found her.
The Mexican said both his
parents were hippies and had
turned him on. "My mother and
father," he said, "they're mak
ing it all the time." The Mexican
did not hate society, he just did
not seem to want to be a part
of it: "Everybody's taking an
ego trip in society," he said.
Neither the Mexican nor the

visiting hippies minded being
called hippies, but they preferred
not to be classified as anything.
They said they did not hate the
"square," or the police, that the
only people they hated were the
"narcs," the special agents who
dress like hippies and arrest
those with dope. The Mexican
said, "We get the Hell's Angels
after them."
Many hippies, like the visit
ing hippie, just pack a camper
or knap sack, leave their homes,
and come to Haight-Ashbury
with little money or clothing,
and no food. Set up especially
for these people are places
called "crash pads" to which the
poor hippie is directed. "And if
he can't find anything there,"

one hippie said, "then he can
crash on a roof."
Diggers
All cold and hungry hippies
are also familiar with Diggers,
the Free Store. Kept supplied by
better-off hippies, old clothes
from used underwear to
wrinkled and soiled semi-formal
attire are given away. Free food
and dustry books are also pro
vided by the Free Store.
As day ends, the temperature
falls and the sightseers disap
pear; the hippies are left alone
to go read their poetry, smoke
pot, make love, attend free turn
ons, sleep on roofs, or drop-out.

Repent Or Else


Perilous Perch
A steady chant of "Ah-h-h,
ah-h-h, ah-h-h," a persistent
drum beat, the staring eyes of
strangers, and a feeling of com
radeship all made the scene of
hippie entertainment at the
Geary-Powell corner of Union
.square Saturday afternoon.
Twelve longhaired hippies,

some bat clout, some sanaaiea,
and some with kerchieves tied
around their heads like Indian
braves, sat in a circle on the
pavement and joined together in
a spiritual-type of montone sing
ing.
150 Spectators
Surrounded by about 150 spec
tators, the hippies seemed to be
in their own world, contempla

five and calm, focusing either
on the ground, their instru
ments, or into space. When the
chant ended, they talked softly
among themselves while a smil
ing, barefoot, redhead passed a
cup around:
"To eat and to sleep," she said.
The crowd laughed when a
muscular youth with long curls
yelled out, "A quarter to have
the name of your company or
favorite politician mentioned."
A white-haired man responded
by tossing a dime and then a
quarter into the circle of hippies.
Pointing at the redhead, he
said, "Isn't she a nice girl? I
gave her all I had. Isn't she a
nice girl?"
Passing the Cup
After the cup had been
passed, the strong, vigorous, na
tive sounding chant was start
ed again. A fifty?year?old hip
pie who for 25 cents gave his
name as Lindy, clinked a metal
tablespoon against a big pottery
jar whose opening was strewn
with string.
Another hippie plucked an un
named wooden affair which
looked like a cross between a
guitar and a miniature pinball
machine. A drum, tambourine
and three maracas completed
the hippies' instrumental accom
paniment.
Play Ball With Jesus
While the hippies sang, a
white-haired man carrying a
signboard about Judgment Day
paced the sidewalk graveling
repeatedly, "Get your sins
washed away on the blood of
Jesus Christ, the devil don't
care!"
On the same corner a youth
was selling The Seer, a hippie
newspaper. As he sold the last
one, he sighed, "Now I can go

home—" home being Haight-
Ashbury.
The Haight-Ashbury district,
extending eight blocks, from
Golden Gate Park (a popular
gathering place for hippy read
ings) to Haight-Central, has
been called "the vibrant epicen
ter of the hippie movement." The
Haight drag, with its stores and
hangouts crowded together, is a
scene of constant activity.
Tourists
Cars with sightseers or ar
riving hippies lock bumper to
bumper; dogs mill aimlessly;
dirty, innocent children play;
and hippies wander, talk, sit,
smoke, eat, and watch.
Hippie clothing includes a
variety of styles. Hippie women
can be seen in long, granny
dresses with shawls wrapped
around them, their feet warmly
inside big boots or moccasins,
or they can be seen in mini
dresses, barefoot or sandaled.
Hippie men wear bluejeans,
old army coats, and thick boots,
or in checkered pants, vest, old
suit coats, and go barefoot or
sandaled. Wise San Francisco
hippies dress warmly, though,
some even carry blankets around
with them, because of the chill
the fog and evening air bring.
Flowered Hair
Most hippies have long hair,
and many men wear beards.
Flowers in the hair, bell-; around
the neck, earrings (some men
wearing only one), bead neck
laces, rabbits feet, buttons, ker
chieves, cowboy, digger, and fish
ing hats, and ankle bracelets are
popular. Why the head bands?
One hippie replied, "To keep the
hair out of my eyes, and, some
times, to keep my head to
gether."
Although a surprisingly large
number of hippies are shaved
and wear clean clothes, it is not
unusual to see blemished skin,
dirty hair, and filthy habit; nor
it is uncommon to see scabbed
and blistered feet or a baby
riding on his father's shoulders
with a diseased scalp.
Hippie Stores
But Haight Street has some
charming and fascinating little
stores, with catchy names like
"The Blushing Peony Skinni
dippin'." Usually a faint trace
of incense greets the customer
at the door. Once inside he finds
himself confronted with a maze
of brilliant color.
Psychedelic paintings, gay
paper flowers, colored glass, ear
rings, bright, patterned pillows
and records are the standard
stock. Posters such as "A toy
gun is not a toy gun," and but
tons saying, "I'm you," "Praise
the pill," and "Ayn Rand is
Ronald Reagan in drag" are
found over and over again in the
stores.

Pseudo Hippie
Almost every store window
has items of interest side by
side. One, entitled "Love Poem"
by Emmet Fox promises the
power of love, ending with the
line "If only you would love
enough you would be the hap
piest and most powerful being
in the world;" the hippie idea of
love and what it can do.
STP
Next to it is found a red and
yellow poster, saying, "STP
users. Do not take thorazine,
Seconal or other downers for
STP bum trips." It was signed
by a M.D. and gave the tele
phone number and address of a
free medical clinic.
While on Haight Street a rider
or walker is approached usually

by about 4 or 5 different hippies
selling 4 or 5 different news
papers. Hippie newspapers, in
tabloid form with about 16
pages, cost between 10 cents and
a quarter.
Two of the more popular
newspapers, The Seer and the
Berkeley Barb, carry Hippie
poetry, photography, drawings,
stories and special news of in
terest. For example, The Seer,
which has very few adver.ise
ments, carried one in their J Ist
issue, called, "The liobbit Hole"
advertising a store where san
dals and all kinds of leather
goods can be bought.
