# Hash-Bury: Legacy Of The Beat Generation
## 
### Mary Dedinsky 
A steady chant of "Ah-h-h,
ah-h-h, ah-h-h," a persistent
drum beat, the staring eyes of
strangers, and a feeling of com
radeship all made the scene of
hippie entertainment at the
Geary-Powell corner of Union
.square Saturday afternoon.
Twelve longhaired hippies,

some bat clout, some sanaaiea,
and some with kerchieves tied
around their heads like Indian
braves, sat in a circle on the
pavement and joined together in
a spiritual-type of montone sing
ing.
150 Spectators
Surrounded by about 150 spec
tators, the hippies seemed to be
in their own world, contempla

five and calm, focusing either
on the ground, their instru
ments, or into space. When the
chant ended, they talked softly
among themselves while a smil
ing, barefoot, redhead passed a
cup around:
"To eat and to sleep," she said.
The crowd laughed when a
muscular youth with long curls
yelled out, "A quarter to have
the name of your company or
favorite politician mentioned."
A white-haired man responded
by tossing a dime and then a
quarter into the circle of hippies.
Pointing at the redhead, he
said, "Isn't she a nice girl? I
gave her all I had. Isn't she a
nice girl?"
Passing the Cup
After the cup had been
passed, the strong, vigorous, na
tive sounding chant was start
ed again. A fifty?year?old hip
pie who for 25 cents gave his
name as Lindy, clinked a metal
tablespoon against a big pottery
jar whose opening was strewn
with string.
Another hippie plucked an un
named wooden affair which
looked like a cross between a
guitar and a miniature pinball
machine. A drum, tambourine
and three maracas completed
the hippies' instrumental accom
paniment.
Play Ball With Jesus
While the hippies sang, a
white-haired man carrying a
signboard about Judgment Day
paced the sidewalk graveling
repeatedly, "Get your sins
washed away on the blood of
Jesus Christ, the devil don't
care!"
On the same corner a youth
was selling The Seer, a hippie
newspaper. As he sold the last
one, he sighed, "Now I can go

home—" home being Haight-
Ashbury.
The Haight-Ashbury district,
extending eight blocks, from
Golden Gate Park (a popular
gathering place for hippy read
ings) to Haight-Central, has
been called "the vibrant epicen
ter of the hippie movement." The
Haight drag, with its stores and
hangouts crowded together, is a
scene of constant activity.
Tourists
Cars with sightseers or ar
riving hippies lock bumper to
bumper; dogs mill aimlessly;
dirty, innocent children play;
and hippies wander, talk, sit,
smoke, eat, and watch.
Hippie clothing includes a
variety of styles. Hippie women
can be seen in long, granny
dresses with shawls wrapped
around them, their feet warmly
inside big boots or moccasins,
or they can be seen in mini
dresses, barefoot or sandaled.
Hippie men wear bluejeans,
old army coats, and thick boots,
or in checkered pants, vest, old
suit coats, and go barefoot or
sandaled. Wise San Francisco
hippies dress warmly, though,
some even carry blankets around
with them, because of the chill
the fog and evening air bring.
Flowered Hair
Most hippies have long hair,
and many men wear beards.
Flowers in the hair, bell-; around
the neck, earrings (some men
wearing only one), bead neck
laces, rabbits feet, buttons, ker
chieves, cowboy, digger, and fish
ing hats, and ankle bracelets are
popular. Why the head bands?
One hippie replied, "To keep the
hair out of my eyes, and, some
times, to keep my head to
gether."
Although a surprisingly large
number of hippies are shaved
and wear clean clothes, it is not
unusual to see blemished skin,
dirty hair, and filthy habit; nor
it is uncommon to see scabbed
and blistered feet or a baby
riding on his father's shoulders
with a diseased scalp.
Hippie Stores
But Haight Street has some
charming and fascinating little
stores, with catchy names like
"The Blushing Peony Skinni
dippin'." Usually a faint trace
of incense greets the customer
at the door. Once inside he finds
himself confronted with a maze
of brilliant color.
Psychedelic paintings, gay
paper flowers, colored glass, ear
rings, bright, patterned pillows
and records are the standard
stock. Posters such as "A toy
gun is not a toy gun," and but
tons saying, "I'm you," "Praise
the pill," and "Ayn Rand is
Ronald Reagan in drag" are
found over and over again in the
stores.
