The Daily Californian, campus newspaper
of the University of California at Berkeley,
editorialized last week in favor of recalling
Governor Reagan. Without meaning to offer
our editorial support to the Governor, we
would like to criticize the Daily Californian
for its juvenile approach to politics.
Governor Reagan was elected to his office
last November by a majority of over a million
votes. He accomplished his selection in spite
of a complete absence of qualifications for that
or any other political office, a fact that was
pointed out to the citizens of California by
those who supported the candidacy of former
Governor Brown.
In spite of his lack of qualifications, or maybe
because of them, Reagan was elected.
Now that the citizens of this state have
truly seen that their elected Governor doesn't

know what he is doing or what he is talking
about, they wish to remove him from office.
Such action, we feel, places the blame on
the wrong head. It was not Governor Reagan
who elected the Governor; it was the people.
Therefore, it is the people, not the Governor,
who should bear the consequences; putting up
with the inane acts of an incompetent Gover
nor.
Perhaps, the people of California will learn
from Governor Reagan's term of office just
what the qualifications for Governor should be.
Maybe, the next time they cast a vote they will
cast it on some intelligent basis. While we
hope the people will, we doubt that such will
be the case.
In any event, placing the blame on Gover
nor Reagan, passing the buck if you will,
smacks of sour grapes and reflects a basic im
maturity on the part of the head-hunters.
