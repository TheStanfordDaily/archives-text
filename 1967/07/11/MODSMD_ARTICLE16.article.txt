# Sez Me
## Let's Grow Up 
### J. H. Lance 
It has been of interest to me
for some time that an active seg
ment of the student population
is sure that it knows better than
anyone else about everything.
Out of curiosity, therefore,
last quarter I observed one of
the more active radical groups

on campus and have the dubious
pleasure to report that it is not
as it would seem. In the case of
the group I observed, although
the membership was large, only
three persons controlled the acti
vities.
To three individuals was given

the honor of deciding what the
group would oppose. The re
maining members were content
to believe that they really were
against what they were told
they were against, albeit some
hesitatingly (it is difficult to
oppose "popular" opinion). Only
three individuals segregated the
facts which supported their
causes from those which did not.
Favorable Facts
Understandably, they publish
ed and advertised only the facts
and fiction favorable to their
stands. These are methods which
can be described with various
derogatory terms, but are seem
ingly effective. They are also in
dicative that the organization is
not completely founded on the
high ideals which it professes
in its nebulous terminology.
Someone who has spent es
sentially his entire life in school
can hardly presume to construct
a better community, country or
world. Education is certainly
very important, but another
very necessary item is experi
ence. It is difficult to improve
upon something one has never
tried. Perhaps this is why uni
versities are particularly adept
at spawning groups which advo
cate unusual change.
No amount of anti-conformity
labeled individuality can substi
tute for common sense. No
amount of pamphleteering, slo
gan-shouting or petition-signing
can replace practicality. And
strangely enough, no amount of
disorderliness can favorably im
press anyone worth impressing.
After one has gained experi
ence he realizes that the ideal is
often impractical; even the dis
tasteful task must be accom
plished. The normal procedure
is to start at the bottom and
work one's way up.
In addition to education and
experience, another important
ingredient is information. The
people who have attained posi
tions of leadership are privy to
information which we are not.
They are better able, therefore,
to decide what is best for us. It
is infantile for a college student
to assume that he is better able
to interpret a set of incomplete
facts than someone who has
access to more complete facts
and possibly a set of educated
and experienced advisors whose
business it is to know and in
terpret the facts.
Everyone grows up, if he tries.
If he's lucky, something worth
while is left for him to grow up
to.
