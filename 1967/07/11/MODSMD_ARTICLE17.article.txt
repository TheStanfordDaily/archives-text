## Vietnam: The Truth Sinks In 
### Fritz Schaefer 
The past year has witnessed
the gradual death of the anti
war movement. A Harris Poll
taken in May, 1966 showed that
17% of the American people
were opposed to the War in
Vietnam and favored a with
drawal of American troops.
When Mr. Harris asked the
same question two weeks ago,
however, he found that only 6%
of all Americans oppose the
War in Vietnam. The facts are
clear. Although the peace
mongers have bombasted the
American public with one of the
most massive indoctrination
campaigns ever recorded, today
only one-third as many Ameri
cans oppose the war as did a
year ago, and 94% of the people
support President Johnson's ba
sic limited objective in Vietnam.
The majority of those who re
main opposed to the war are
hard core anti-American leftists.
Justified
One of the reasons for the
increased domestic support of
the war is that the public has
noticed that when honest men,
with sincere doubts about the
war have taken the time to visit
Vietnam, they have returned
with a changed outlook and a
realization that our country's
course of action is not only
justifiable but demanded.
After absorbing the well-pub
licized charges that "war crimes"
were being perpetrated by
Americans against Vietnamese
civilians, the British Economist's
special correspondent in Saigon
decided to take to the back
woods of South Vietnam and in
vestigate the situation for him
self. His findings (Economist,
March 11) showed how unfound
ed the venemous "war crimes"
charges were: 'The picture is
reasonably clear. Perhaps never
before has a belligerent wielded
such a preponderance of power
with so much restraint."
He continues, "In areas which
contain civilians, the most elab

orate ground rules are in force
to try to stop them from being
hurt. In such areas, the approval
of the local province chief is re
quired before any air strike can
be made. This frequently results
in delays which allow the enemy
to escape."
Brooke's Change
Before his March fact-finding
trip to Vietnam, Senator Edward
Brooke had been highly critical
of America's Vietnam Policy,
calling for "a pause in the bomb
ing ... or some other military
de-escalation." What he saw in
Southeast Asia forced him to
change his position. To his own
surprise he found the people
of Thailand "in favor of Ameri
can participation in the war in
Vietnam," and in South Vietnam
itself, he "found that anti-Ameri
can feeling is conspicuously ab
sent."
His final position, on March
23, was: "Since I believe that
North Vietnam is not prepared
to negotiate in a meaningful
way at this time, I must reluc
tantly conclude that the general
direction of our present military
efforts in Vietnam is necessary,"
and"it is possible that continued
military pressure may end the
war sooner than we dare to
hope."
Perhaps even more startling
than the revelation of Senator
Brooke is the switch that was
made by Alastair Hetherington,
Editor of Britain's liberal daily,
the Manchester Guardian. Be
fore his May journey to South
east Asia, Mr. Hetherington had
personally led a passionate cam
paign against the War in Viet
nam. Upon returning, Hethering
ton shocked the British Press by
declaring: "The best chance of
a peaceful life for the South
Vietnamese is to let the Ameri
cans continue their military
operations."
Mr. Hetherington also joined
the list of those who have re
pudiated the baby-burning myth:
"Civilian casualties seem to have

reached a peak about two years
ago, when the Vietcong con
trolled most of South Vietnam
and the American buildup was
beginning."
The fact that the American
people have turned against the
anti-war movement is the result
of a new found awareness that
the New Left has repeatedly at
tempted to deceive the American
public with regard to the War in
Vietnam. It is a tribute to Ameri
can democracy that the truth
has prevailed.

Brooke is the switch that was
made by Alastair Hetherington,
Editor of Britain's liberal daily,
the Manchester Guardian. Be
fore his May journey to South
east Asia, Mr. Hetherington had
personally led a passionate cam
paign against the War in Viet
nam. Upon returning, Hethering
ton shocked the British Press by
declaring: "The best chance of
a peaceful life for the South
Vietnamese is to let the Ameri
cans continue their military
operations."
Mr. Hetherington also joined
the list of those who have re
pudiated the baby-burning myth:
"Civilian casualties seem to have

reached a peak about two years
ago, when the Vietcong con
trolled most of South Vietnam
and the American buildup was
beginning."
The fact that the American
people have turned against the
anti-war movement is the result
of a new found awareness that
the New Left has repeatedly at
tempted to deceive the American
public with regard to the War in
Vietnam. It is a tribute to Ameri
can democracy that the truth
has prevailed.
The past year has witnessed
the gradual death of the anti
war movement. A Harris Poll
taken in May, 1966 showed that
17% of the American people
were opposed to the War in
Vietnam and favored a with
drawal of American troops.
When Mr. Harris asked the
same question two weeks ago,
however, he found that only 6%
of all Americans oppose the
War in Vietnam. The facts are
clear. Although the peace
mongers have bombasted the
American public with one of the
most massive indoctrination
campaigns ever recorded, today
only one-third as many Ameri
cans oppose the war as did a
year ago, and 94% of the people
support President Johnson's ba
sic limited objective in Vietnam.
The majority of those who re
main opposed to the war are
hard core anti-American leftists.
Justified
One of the reasons for the
increased domestic support of
the war is that the public has
noticed that when honest men,
with sincere doubts about the
war have taken the time to visit
Vietnam, they have returned
with a changed outlook and a
realization that our country's
course of action is not only
justifiable but demanded.
After absorbing the well-pub
licized charges that "war crimes"
were being perpetrated by
Americans against Vietnamese
civilians, the British Economist's
special correspondent in Saigon
decided to take to the back
woods of South Vietnam and in
vestigate the situation for him
self. His findings (Economist,
March 11) showed how unfound
ed the venemous "war crimes"
charges were: 'The picture is
reasonably clear. Perhaps never
before has a belligerent wielded
such a preponderance of power
with so much restraint."
He continues, "In areas which
contain civilians, the most elab

orate ground rules are in force
to try to stop them from being
hurt. In such areas, the approval
of the local province chief is re
quired before any air strike can
be made. This frequently results
in delays which allow the enemy
to escape."
Brooke's Change
Before his March fact-finding
trip to Vietnam, Senator Edward
Brooke had been highly critical
of America's Vietnam Policy,
calling for "a pause in the bomb
ing ... or some other military
de-escalation." What he saw in
Southeast Asia forced him to
change his position. To his own
surprise he found the people
of Thailand "in favor of Ameri
can participation in the war in
Vietnam," and in South Vietnam
itself, he "found that anti-Ameri
can feeling is conspicuously ab
sent."
His final position, on March
23, was: "Since I believe that
North Vietnam is not prepared
to negotiate in a meaningful
way at this time, I must reluc
tantly conclude that the general
direction of our present military
efforts in Vietnam is necessary,"
and"it is possible that continued
military pressure may end the
war sooner than we dare to
hope."
Perhaps even more startling
than the revelation of Senator
Brooke is the switch that was
made by Alastair Hetherington,
Editor of Britain's liberal daily,
the Manchester Guardian. Be
