# Letters To The Editor
## The
						Critics Agree; Tom's Not Good 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
First let me say that I was
thoroughly outraged by the bel
ligerent tone and arrogant at
titude expressed by Mr. For
stenzer, the Summer Student
Body President, in his letter to
the student body. Every Stan
ford student should feel a con
tempt and indignation toward
the author of such an insolent
statement.
In addition I was personally
angered by Mr. Forstenzer's con
tention that he plans to "devote
himself exclusively to such en
terprises as Rock dances, water
melon feeds and other forms
of entertainment for the citizen
ry at large." Not only has Mr.
Forstenzer had absolutely no
connection with the modest so
cial program that has been of
fered so far, I'm quite sure he
is unaware of its organizers —
Bob Bushnell and myself.
Angered by the lack of any
form of social committee or
functions, Bob and I organized
and paid for an afternoon beer
bust at Lagunita Court on June
30. Having been victims of the
Stanford social stigma for the
last four years, we determined
that summer visitors shouldn't
be burdened with the same re
sentment.
Subsequently, we organized
the dance at Lagunita last Fri
day night and have planned a
watermelon feed this Sunday, a
beach party, and, hopefully, a
Jefferson Airplane concert. Mr.
Forstenzer has not tried to con
tact us and we have no desire
to contact him.
Mr. Forstenzer's unfortunate
attitude is summarized in his
last sentence — "Be content
that he doesn't care enough to
use them." Yes, he doesn't care
enough. If he did, he might try
to make summer school a more
meaningful experience than a
time to "take 8 units, relax,
drink, and. ..." For example,
coffee hours with Stanford fac

ulty and some exceptional visit
ing professors would benefit
regular and visiting students.
Let me conclude by saying
that any suggestions, criticism,
rotten eggs, or offers of help
can be directed to Bob or my
self at the Summer Social Com
mittee's daily meetings from
11-12 a.m. in front of Tresidder
Union.

Editor, The Daily:
I wouldn't be so sure about
your John Gardiner. A fellow
named John Gardner just might
sneak in before you check your
Who"s Who (sic).
