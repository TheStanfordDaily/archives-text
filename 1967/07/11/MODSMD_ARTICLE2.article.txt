# Cent. 21 To Plan Safer World
## 
### 
A group of Stanford University stu
dents have embarked upon an ambi
tious project aimed at making the
world a safer place for man to live.
Century 21 will be inaugurated
Autumn Quarter 1967-68 when Buck
minster Fuller, the architect who de
signed the Houston Astrodome, ad
dresses the Stanford community in
Frost Amphitheater.
Fuller, an expert on environmental
design, will speak on the techno
logical possibility of designing a
world where men can live in peace,
comfort and prosperity.
Century 21, which will coordinate
the efforts of Stanford students, fac
ulty and staff, is sponsored by the
Tresidder Memorial Union Board. Ten
students, under the direction of Larry
Levin, and a faculty advisory board,
are organizing the year-long project
which is the culmination of a two
year planning effort.
In The Fall
Autumn Quarter the project will
focus on urgent world problems: the
balance of power between the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R., and the threat of
nuclear-armed Red China; estimates
of wide-spread famine within twenty
years; social revolution, and political
disruption in the underdeveloped
areas of the world.
Winter Quarter the emphasis will
shift to examining the technology
available for handling these problems,
and to achieving pragmatic solutions.
Potential speakers include Julian Hux
ley and Marshall McLuhan.

If the project is to succeed it must
not only excite and hold the attention
and imagination of the Stanford com
munity; it must also attract consid
erable financial backing.
Goais Exceed Limits
Launched with the support of the
Tresidder Memorial Union Board, Cen
tury 21's goals extend far beyond the
limits of on-campus financing. The
project will attempt to collect, proc
ess and store (using a computer tech

nology) information from world re
search centers so that men's best ef
forts will be concentrated upon find
ing a solution to the world's worst
problems: the threat of thermo
nuclear accident, biological warfare,
environmental pollution, famine, pop
ulation explosion, economic implo
sion, political chaos, and military
marauding.
The project is guided by belief in
the continuity of scientific research

and permanent social revolution, and
the necessity of defining human goals
which will direct technological devel
opment.
Century 21 suggests an answer to
Norbert Wiener's "Is Man changing
his Environment faster than his Ca
pacity to Adapt to it?" By developing
a technology of decision oriented to
human values, Century 21 aims to
improve man's ability to adjust to his
environment.
