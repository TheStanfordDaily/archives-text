"New York Pro Musica's perfor

and style with musical excitement,"
said George Houle, Stanford music

field," Houle said, expressing "our
delight at beinag able to have them

in public performances."
Pro Musica has been at Stanford
three times in the past, twice for
single concerts and last spring for a
10-day workshop in early music.
