The SUMMER STUDENT BODY
PRESIDENT has well ni ff h dicta
torial power. Be content that he
doesn't care enough to exercise it.
Angered by Forstenzer's failure to
organize a summer social program,
Bob King and Bob Bushnell have initi
ated a beer bust and dance and have
planned a watermelon feed, beach
party, and a possible Jefferson Air
plane concert.
Forstenzer has contacted neither
King nor Bushnell. His attitude, as ex
pressed in his statement and his lack
of action and initiative, indicate his
belief that his office is nothing more
than that of an apathetic figurehead.
