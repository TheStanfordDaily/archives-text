# SU's Experimental College Registers 400 Students
## 
### 
The Experiment may not have a
home, but that doesn't seem to have
diminished its popularity. This was
the finding of Barry Greenberg as
Stanford's experimental college com
pleted its first week of classes.
Greenberg reported that sign-up
stations at Tresidder Union, Kepler's
Books, and the FUPA's Sunday after
noon Be-In had registered over 400
students — three-quarters of whom
have paid their 10 dollar registration
fee. Students are entitled to take as
many courses as they wish.
"Probably the most popular course
has been 'The Schizophrenic Child'. I
signed up about 30 on campus alone.
In all, we had requests from about
70 students, though we will probably
close the class off at 45."
The class emphasizes a practical
as well as theoretical look at the prob
lems of the severely disturbed child.
Each participant spends three hours
a week as a volunteer worker at the
Peninsula Children's Center.
Another class that filled up very
quickly," Greenberg added, "was the
Rev. Mike Young's 'The Human
Touch, Who Needs It?' " "The Human
Touch" has been described by Young
as an exploration of "what it means
to be 'persons together', using non
verbal communication techniques,
touch - trust - intimacy games, and a
variety of group methods."
"The Kennedy Assassination",
taught by Mark Lane, author of the
best-seller, Rush To Judgment, has
shown one of the largest gains over
last term.

The class's first meeting attracted
45 students. Last quarter the classes
averaged about 10 persons each. "If
more come next time, we will prob
ably divide the course into two sec
tions. There will be no limit as to
size," Lane emphasized.
"Tomorrow night," Lane said, "we
will consider the 20,000 word Asso
ciated Press article on the critics of
the Warren Report — the longest
story ever sent out over the AP
wires." Lane, who has maintained a
working relationship with Orleans
Parish (La.) District Attorney, Jim
Garrison, will also discuss Garrison's
coming (July 15) reply to the recent
NBC program which atacked his in
vestigation.
"In the near future," Lane con
tinued, "we will examine Professor
John Kaplan's early spring article
in the American Scholar and the more
recent 'corrected' version of it in the
Stanford Law Review, since they are
so different." Professor Kaplan's
methods and conclusion of the War
ren Commission's critics.
Lane's subsequent guests will in
clude:
William Turner, an FBI agent for
ten years, who will give an account
of his personal investigation of the
charges and counter-charges made in
New Orleans; and documentary film
maker, Emile de Antonio, who collab
orated with Lane on the film version
of Rush To Judgment. De Antonio,
who bought footage from CBS to
make Point Of Order, will discuss the
methods used by CBS in putting its
documentary together.
