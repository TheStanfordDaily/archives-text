# Ram's Head To Offer e.e. cummings' 'him'
## 
### 
Ram's Head is at it again. The stu
dent run, student financed drama
group has started rehearsals for its
second annual summer performance.
This year's play, produced and di
rected by Joel Mills, is e. e. cummings'
him. The three act play might be
considered one of the first success
ful attempts at what is now called
"the theater of the absurd."
Analysis
One thumbnail analysis that ap
peared on the jacket of the first edi
tion says of the play, "You may think
you know what to expect in a play
by cummings — and you will find out
that you don't know half ot it. Such
lucid madness, such adventurous gai
ety, such graceful irreverence, such
abounding novelties — squads of
characters firing broadsides of wit —

interpolations of American folklore,
extravagances that astound the imagi
nation. It is a play that satisfies the
five senses, and every corner of the
intelligence — a play full of revels for
the grown-up mind."
Stars of this summer's show include
Jeanie Dargle, Ed Graziano, and Ken
Glazier.
Miss Dargle will be a sophomore at
Reed this fall. She has had much
theater experience including acting,
singing and dancing.
Ed Graziano, a New Yorker, win
be a senior at Stanford. He may be
remembered for his role in the 1966
Ram's Head production of Ten Blocks
on the Camino Real. He appears this
year as the male lead in him.
Ken Glazier, from Harvard, will
play a doctor in the play.
