# TMU Slates Godard
## 
### 
The TMU-International Center
Summer Film Series will con
tinue this Friday evening with
a showing of Jean-Luc Godard's

"A Woman Ls a Woman." There
will be two showings, 7:30 and
8:30 p.m., at Tresidder, and a
late showing at 9:30 p.m. to
be held in the courtyard of the
I-Center.
"A Woman Is a Woman" has
been described by Godard as "a
neo-realist musical," a term
which he readily admits is "an
absolute contradiction." Never
theless, it is perhaps the only
way to characterize the film;
re an appraisal by Henry Heifitz
of Film Quarterly: "This love
minuet is presented with a fine
splashy comic use of color —
certainly among one of the best
ever — and a razzle-dazzle jump
cutting pace that almost never
bogs down. A consciously play
ful relationship with the cinema
audience is established by winks,
gestures, sometimes direct ad
dress. That this sort of thing has
been bastardized in such heavy
handed tripe as Tom Jones
does not lessen Godard's achieve
ment in maintaining a steady
light touch which not only brings
these moments off unaffectedly,
but allows him to use a whole
herd of devices for disrupting
the conventions of a closed fic
tional story intent on the crea
tion of its own 'reality.'
"Titles are flashed across the
screen while characters freeze
into immobility, explaining that
'Angela and Emile are truly in
love but . . . music is used
arbitrarily for particular comic
effects; improvised bits and vis
ual gags come pouring out one
after another. All this style dis
tances and cornices the action,
creating a wacky never-never
land out of a striptease joint, a
bare apartment, and a neon-lit
night-time Paris."
*Anna Karina, Godard's wife,
trips unerringly through her
portrayal of tragicomical Wom
an, so well perhaps that it is
fruitless to define the result: the
title captures the feeling; a
woman is a woman and nothing
else. With the added excellence
of Jean-Claude Brialy as Ange
la's lover, and Jean-Paul Bel
mondo as a persistent hustler,
the film manages to leap from
one technique to another with
out the slightest inconsistency;
"A Woman is a Woman" is to
tally absorbing and very funny.
The photography, as is usual for
Raoul Coutard, is always tight
and imaginative.
Tickets for all three showings
may be purchased at the Tresid
der Box Office for fifty cents, or
at the door for the early show
ings at Tresidder and the late
one at the I-Center.

"Titles are flashed across the
screen while characters freeze
into immobility, explaining that
'Angela and Emile are truly in
love but . . . music is used
arbitrarily for particular comic
effects; improvised bits and vis
ual gags come pouring out one
after another. All this style dis
tances and cornices the action,
creating a wacky never-never
land out of a striptease joint, a
bare apartment, and a neon-lit
night-time Paris."
*Anna Karina, Godard's wife,
trips unerringly through her
portrayal of tragicomical Wom
an, so well perhaps that it is
fruitless to define the result: the
title captures the feeling; a
woman is a woman and nothing
else. With the added excellence
of Jean-Claude Brialy as Ange
la's lover, and Jean-Paul Bel
mondo as a persistent hustler,
the film manages to leap from
one technique to another with
out the slightest inconsistency;
"A Woman is a Woman" is to
tally absorbing and very funny.
The photography, as is usual for
Raoul Coutard, is always tight
and imaginative.
Tickets for all three showings
may be purchased at the Tresid
der Box Office for fifty cents, or
at the door for the early show
ings at Tresidder and the late
one at the I-Center.
The TMU-International Center
Summer Film Series will con
tinue this Friday evening with
a showing of Jean-Luc Godard's

"A Woman Ls a Woman." There
will be two showings, 7:30 and
8:30 p.m., at Tresidder, and a
late showing at 9:30 p.m. to
be held in the courtyard of the
I-Center.
"A Woman Is a Woman" has
been described by Godard as "a
neo-realist musical," a term
which he readily admits is "an
absolute contradiction." Never
theless, it is perhaps the only
way to characterize the film;
re an appraisal by Henry Heifitz
of Film Quarterly: "This love
minuet is presented with a fine
splashy comic use of color —
certainly among one of the best
ever — and a razzle-dazzle jump
cutting pace that almost never
bogs down. A consciously play
ful relationship with the cinema
audience is established by winks,
gestures, sometimes direct ad
dress. That this sort of thing has
been bastardized in such heavy
handed tripe as Tom Jones
does not lessen Godard's achieve
ment in maintaining a steady
light touch which not only brings
these moments off unaffectedly,
but allows him to use a whole
herd of devices for disrupting
the conventions of a closed fic
tional story intent on the crea
tion of its own 'reality.'
