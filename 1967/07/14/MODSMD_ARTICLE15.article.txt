## 'Big Boy Now' Sparkles 
### BILL MAINA 
Bernard Chanticleer is a nice
boy. He drinks milk, wears
glasses, and flies kites. He
obeys his parents, and loves to
romp with his dog, Dog. The
only problem is that Bernie
is nineteen and has never yet
had a girlfriend. Bernie needs
to grow up.
In the course of You're A Big
Boy Now, Bernie (Peter Kast
ner) does quite a bit of grow
ing. His father, anxious for the
boy to become more indepen
dent, moves him into a New
York apartment to live alone.
Alone, that is, except for a
woman-hating rooster and a
lonely landlady named Miss
Thing (Julie Harris).
Then a frumpy girl, Amy
(Karen Black), starts chasing
Bernie. She chases him, in fact,
into the arms of Barbara Darl
ing (Elizabeth Hartman), part
time actress, part-time go-go
dancer, and full-time sadist.
"You're just what I need in my
life," she murmurs to Bernie.
It's true, too. Barbara needs
someone to torture, and poor
mixed-up Bernie is the perfect
choice.
Compared to the perils of
Bernie, Pauline had it easy.
But Bernie's perils are the au
dience's delight. The film's win
ning humor, always effective, is
often bittersweet as well. For in
stance, the dirty old man who
attacked Barbara as a child and
warped her personality forever,
thus influencing Bernie's grow
ing up, was not just any dirty
old man. No, he was the Halibut
Hills Girls' School doctor, a 53-
year-old albino hypnotherapist
with a wooden leg.
You're A Big Boy Now care
fully explores both the heart
break and the humor in Bernie's
process of growing up. The
actors, who all turn in lively

performances, and Director Cop
pola deserve praise for turning
out a sparkling film.
Elizabeth Hartman is superb
as an icy narcissist who hates
all men except one, a dwarf
(Michael Dunn) whom she
merely finds good company.
Peter Kastner comes across as
a truly believeable schlemic.
Bernie's father, a man more in
terested in his incunabula than
in his son, is well portrayed by

Rip Torn. Geraldine Page shines
as Bernie's mother, an over
protective kook who daily sends
her son locks of her hair.
You're A Biff Boy Now was
filmed in New York City — not
ugly, violent New York, but New
York the Fun City — and uses
many fresh camera techniques,
such as quick cutting. An added
bonus to filmgoers is that the
picture's songs are sung by the
Lovin' Spoonful.

break and the humor in Bernie's
process of growing up. The
actors, who all turn in lively

performances, and Director Cop
pola deserve praise for turning
out a sparkling film.
Elizabeth Hartman is superb
as an icy narcissist who hates
all men except one, a dwarf
(Michael Dunn) whom she
merely finds good company.
Peter Kastner comes across as
a truly believeable schlemic.
Bernie's father, a man more in
terested in his incunabula than
in his son, is well portrayed by

Rip Torn. Geraldine Page shines
as Bernie's mother, an over
protective kook who daily sends
her son locks of her hair.
You're A Biff Boy Now was
filmed in New York City — not
ugly, violent New York, but New
York the Fun City — and uses
many fresh camera techniques,
such as quick cutting. An added
bonus to filmgoers is that the
picture's songs are sung by the
Lovin' Spoonful.
Bernard Chanticleer is a nice
boy. He drinks milk, wears
glasses, and flies kites. He
obeys his parents, and loves to
romp with his dog, Dog. The
only problem is that Bernie
is nineteen and has never yet
had a girlfriend. Bernie needs
to grow up.
In the course of You're A Big
Boy Now, Bernie (Peter Kast
ner) does quite a bit of grow
ing. His father, anxious for the
boy to become more indepen
dent, moves him into a New
York apartment to live alone.
Alone, that is, except for a
woman-hating rooster and a
lonely landlady named Miss
Thing (Julie Harris).
Then a frumpy girl, Amy
(Karen Black), starts chasing
Bernie. She chases him, in fact,
into the arms of Barbara Darl
ing (Elizabeth Hartman), part
time actress, part-time go-go
dancer, and full-time sadist.
"You're just what I need in my
life," she murmurs to Bernie.
It's true, too. Barbara needs
someone to torture, and poor
mixed-up Bernie is the perfect
choice.
Compared to the perils of
Bernie, Pauline had it easy.
But Bernie's perils are the au
dience's delight. The film's win
ning humor, always effective, is
often bittersweet as well. For in
stance, the dirty old man who
attacked Barbara as a child and
warped her personality forever,
thus influencing Bernie's grow
ing up, was not just any dirty
old man. No, he was the Halibut
Hills Girls' School doctor, a 53-
year-old albino hypnotherapist
with a wooden leg.
You're A Big Boy Now care
fully explores both the heart
break and the humor in Bernie's
process of growing up. The
actors, who all turn in lively

performances, and Director Cop
pola deserve praise for turning
