# Bimbo's Hosts Freddie Paris' Homecoming
## 
### 
Freddie Paris, newest singing
discovery of Helen Noga, who
brought Johnny Mathis to the
public eye 12 years ago, will be
appearing at Bimbo's 365 Club
in San Francisco July 27 through
August 9.
Paris, who starred with Phyl
lis Diller and the Smothers
Brothers at the Purple Onion in
San Fx-ancisco for two years,
has been recently working in
night clubs in Sidney, Australia.
His first recording, "Take Me
As I Am," was released by RCA
in June.
Paris, a former college foot
ball star, had been international
ly acclaimed for his smooth,
easy, yet powerful voice even
before he was signed by RCA.
His casual and intimate style
is perfect for Bimbo's dark and
smoky setting and makes for an
enjoyable night on the town.
Often likened to Lou Rawls,
Nat King Cole, and Matt Mon
roe, Freddie's style is actually all
his own although he shares the
relaxed audience rapport of his
predecessors. Perhaps Freddie's
most appealing quality is the
variety in his repertoire which
includes pop, rhythm and blues,
jazz, and, of course, love songs.
Appealing to a wide range of
tastes, Freddie Paris' appearance
at Bimbo's should prove as ex
citing as his reputation.
