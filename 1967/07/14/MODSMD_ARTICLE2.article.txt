## Pro Musica Unassuming Virtuosity 
### C.M. SNYDER 
The New York Pro Musiea con
sists of six singers and five instru
mentalists, each of whom is an artist
in his own right, and as a group, the
efFeet is one of pure excellence. What
is even more amazing is that every
one in the ensemble is a master of
more than one instrument.
One of the instrumentalists, I.a
None Davenport, switched with stoi
cial ease from the recorder to the
krummhorn, to the cornett, to the vio
la da gamba, performing magnificent
ly on each.
Sitting next to Davenport was Shelley
Gruskin, complete with a small ar
senal of nearly a dozen wind instru
ments of all shapes and sizes (flutes,
recorder, krummhorns, and a bag
pipe). lie was a confident master of
them all.
Matchless Technique
Christopher Williams, who eon
fined himself to a smaller array of in
struments, performed admirably on
the lute, recorder, krummhorn, and
psaltery, a small string instrument
that looks somewhat like a modern
auto harp. The other two instrumen
talists, Edward Smith (regal, porta
tive organ, and harpischord) and Ju
dith Davidoff (bass, viola d.i gamba
and vielle), were both matchless in
their technique and control.

Although Smith and Miss Davidoff
wore both featured in a solo piece,
they mainly performed as part of the
whole ensemble, or as accompani
ment (both together and separately)
to other soloists. It was in these ac
companiment roles that the subtle
finesse of their virtuosity became
most noticeable.
The six singers were also masters
of their profession. Each displayed a
beautiful, clear tone. They formed an
extremely well-balanced group. The
singers occasionally added their tal
ents as percussionists to the ensemble.
The musical director of the group
is Mr. John White, who, in addition
to his musical abilities, (he occasion
ally joined the group on the harpsi
chord) should be commended on the
highly informative and interesting
program notes.
Medieval France
Wednesday night's program w a s
dedicated to the Music of Medieval
France. The first five selections were
of a secular nature, while the last
three were music of the church.
"Son me regarde," a secular duet
by the two sopranos, Shiela Schoi>
brun and Elizabeth Numes, was one
of the best selections of evening. The
delightful singing of tin 1 two women
was brilliantly accompanied

The best of the sacred music was
represented by an exquisite organ
solo by Edward Smith, and the Cre
do, a beautiful, unstrained solo sung
by counter-tenor Ernest Murphy.
The second half of the program was
devoted to the music of Giullaume de
Machaut, who, according to the pro
gram notes, "stands as an unique per
sonality fully rounded in the range
and variety of his works and thus the
first great composer in Western his
tory."
Selections during the second half
of the program which were particu
larly notable were: "Triple Ballade,"
a well done trio by Ernest Murphy,
Elizabeth Numcs, and Sheila Schon
brnm; "Virelai." a solo by golden
smooth baritone Arthur Burrows, sii
perbly accompanied by Judith David
olf; "Ballade — pas de tor en thics
pais," an instrumental piece featuring
Miss DavidofT and the final selection
on the program, "Virelai," a sprightly
piece performed by the whole en
semble.
The New York Pro Musica's per
formance was one of unassuming
virtuosity. Their technique and tone
were matchless, their control, bal
ance. and interpretation were superb.
The concert will be remembered as a
high point of the Slimmer Festival.

dedicated to the Music of Medieval
France. The first five selections were
of a secular nature, while the last
three were music of the church.
"Son me regarde," a secular duet
by the two sopranos, Shiela Schoi>
brun and Elizabeth Numes, was one
of the best selections of evening. The
delightful singing of tin 1 two women
was brilliantly accompanied

The best of the sacred music was
represented by an exquisite organ
solo by Edward Smith, and the Cre
do, a beautiful, unstrained solo sung
by counter-tenor Ernest Murphy.
The second half of the program was
devoted to the music of Giullaume de
Machaut, who, according to the pro
gram notes, "stands as an unique per
sonality fully rounded in the range
and variety of his works and thus the
first great composer in Western his
tory."
Selections during the second half
of the program which were particu
larly notable were: "Triple Ballade,"
a well done trio by Ernest Murphy,
Elizabeth Numcs, and Sheila Schon
brnm; "Virelai." a solo by golden
smooth baritone Arthur Burrows, sii
perbly accompanied by Judith David
olf; "Ballade — pas de tor en thics
pais," an instrumental piece featuring
Miss DavidofT and the final selection
on the program, "Virelai," a sprightly
piece performed by the whole en
semble.
The New York Pro Musica's per
formance was one of unassuming
virtuosity. Their technique and tone
were matchless, their control, bal
ance. and interpretation were superb.
The concert will be remembered as a
high point of the Slimmer Festival.
The New York Pro Musiea con
sists of six singers and five instru
mentalists, each of whom is an artist
in his own right, and as a group, the
efFeet is one of pure excellence. What
is even more amazing is that every
one in the ensemble is a master of
more than one instrument.
One of the instrumentalists, I.a
None Davenport, switched with stoi
cial ease from the recorder to the
krummhorn, to the cornett, to the vio
la da gamba, performing magnificent
ly on each.
Sitting next to Davenport was Shelley
Gruskin, complete with a small ar
senal of nearly a dozen wind instru
ments of all shapes and sizes (flutes,
recorder, krummhorns, and a bag
pipe). lie was a confident master of
them all.
Matchless Technique
Christopher Williams, who eon
fined himself to a smaller array of in
struments, performed admirably on
the lute, recorder, krummhorn, and
psaltery, a small string instrument
that looks somewhat like a modern
auto harp. The other two instrumen
talists, Edward Smith (regal, porta
tive organ, and harpischord) and Ju
dith Davidoff (bass, viola d.i gamba
and vielle), were both matchless in
their technique and control.

Although Smith and Miss Davidoff
wore both featured in a solo piece,
they mainly performed as part of the
whole ensemble, or as accompani
ment (both together and separately)
to other soloists. It was in these ac
companiment roles that the subtle
finesse of their virtuosity became
most noticeable.
The six singers were also masters
of their profession. Each displayed a
beautiful, clear tone. They formed an
extremely well-balanced group. The
singers occasionally added their tal
ents as percussionists to the ensemble.
The musical director of the group
is Mr. John White, who, in addition
to his musical abilities, (he occasion
ally joined the group on the harpsi
chord) should be commended on the
highly informative and interesting
program notes.
