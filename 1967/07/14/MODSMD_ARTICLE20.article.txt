## The 						Redwood Park Debate 
### John Karon 
Do we really have to choose
between trees and people in
creating a Redwood National
Park? Will 10,000 men lose their
jobs? Recent debate in The
Daily has featured a great deal
of emotion and a lack of infor
mation. Here are some of the
pertinent facts:
The redwood industry is bit
terly opposed to a national park
because it has to log virgin
timber for at least another twen
ty years, when it can begin cut
ting second-growth trees; natu
rally, a national park should in
clude as much virgin timber
as possible. Also, each of the
two park plans — in Humboldt
County on Redwood Creek, or in
Del Norte County on Mill Creek
— would force one major com
pany out of business, unless
Forest Service redwood land is
traded for the private holdings.
The state redwood parks are
not adequate. Under current
California law, the State High
way Commission can push free
ways through the parks at will.
No state park includes an entire
stream drainage, so that up
stream logging and heavy rain
cause destructive floods; in the
flood of 1955, 500 large redwoods
were toppled in Humboldt Red
woods State Park on Bull
Creek Flat. Either national park
plan would preserve almost an
entire watershed.
Only 235 Jobs
Will a redwood park mean the
loss of 10,000 jobs, as stated by
Kirk Hanen in The Daily? Ac
cording to Secretary of Interior
Udall, a park in Del Norte Coun
ty "will result in an immediate
loss of 235 jobs in the timber in
dustry. However, after five years
we expect the stimulating effect
of park operations ... to result
in a net gain of 350 jobs. . . . "
The unemployment rate in Del

Norte County is now 15%; 85%
of the county's economy is di
rectly dependent on forest prod
ucts, and forest economists ex
pect employment in the wood
products industry there to drop
40% in the next ten years as a
result of automation and pres
ent intensive logging.
Currently, second-growth tim
ber land is taxed at a very low
rate for 40 years after cutting,
so county tax revenues will drop
as the lumber companies shift
to a second-growth operation.
With forest products as the only
big industry, the economic fu
ture of Del Norte County is
bleak.
Humboldt County is not quite
so heavily dependent on the
lumbering industry, but simi
lar statistics are valid there.
Establishment of a park would,
at first, compensate the county
for loss of taxes and employ
laborers in the construction of
park facilities. After a few
years, the tourist trade will in
crease greatly. A park should
give the local economy a boost.
No Extinction
The redwoods will not become
extinct if a national park is not
established. However, the exis
tence of any redwood forests
outside parks is in doubt, despite
the industry's claim of sustained
yield logging. Second-growth
trees probably will be harvested
every 40-60 years, and, while
redwoods do grow up quickly,
they mature slowly, so that sec
ond-growth will go into pulp and
synthetic board, rather than saw
logs. For this reason, much cut
over redwood land is being re
seeded in douglas fir, spruce, and
pine ,not redwood.
Further, due to heavy rain
fall, steep slopes, and clear-cut
logging practices, much cut-over
redwood land erodes very rapid-

ly and will soon be denuded of
soil if cut repeatedly. The red
wood industry claims that there
are more redwoods now than
ever before, but to most people
1000 ten-year old trees do not re
place a 300 foot giant, nor is an
erosion-scarred second - growth
hillside a suitable replacement
for a virgin forest.
Unless a park is established
in the next few years, logging
will cut the heart out of any
possible meaningful national
park. A few men will be out of
work temporarily, but millions
of people will come to the region
to enjoy the unique experience
of walking through a redwood
forest, and we will be fulfilling
our responsibility to preserve at
least a sample of the once vast
California redwood forest.
