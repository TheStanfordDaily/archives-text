## The 						Price Of Free Speech 
### J.H. Lane 
One of the current fads is
exercising one's right of free
speech. The causes of the fad
are not of interest to me. The ef
fects are. No one disputes the
press' right, the obligation, to
print the news or each citizen's
right to voice his disagreement.
However, both the press and
certain citizens have misused
their rights with regard to the
War in Vietnam.
In the case of the press, the
War in Vietnam has been dis
torted. The distortion arises
from one-sided reporting and
from a disproportionate amount
of coverage given to antiwar
groups in America.
Many people have the mis
taken notion that what they
read on the front page consti
tutes all the news. The press,
by sensationalizing the isolated
and tragic events caused by
the U.S. and South Vietnamese,
makes it appear that the Ameri
cans are inept with a primary
purpose of satisfying sadistic
tendencies and that the South
Vietnamese are corrupt and po
litically inept and therefore do
not deserve help.
More Discerning: Readers
Other, more discerning read
ers, realize that in war artillery

rounds do go astray, bombs do
miss the target, soldiers do die,
and captured enemy soldiers are
not always treated in a gentle
manly manner. Anyone who has
the power to reason also realizes
that the American military has
no monopoly on mistakes.
Further, anyone with knowl
edge of the methods employed
by the Viet Cong knows that
the Viet Cong purposely wage
war on South Vietnamese civi
lians, a war method which is
centrally controlled from North
Vietnam and is directed against
leaders and officials. These items
do not receive the sensational
coverage they deserve from the
news for some reason — possibly
because there is neither space
nor time after allotting both
to antiwar activities; more prob
ably because they are not what
the public wants to hear.
Antiwar groups in America,
misled by news coverage, have
taken up a cause they do not
understand. Guided by emotion,
they act without reason. They
should pause to reflect on the
side effects of their activities.
General Westmoreland said it
when he returned to the United
States a few months ago; peace
activists strengthen the enemy's

will to resist. It is not realistic
to believe otherwise.
If antiwar sentiment is Ameri
ca, published and promoted by
American news media, causes
North Vietnam to continue the
war for only one additional
week, as many as two hundred
additional Americans could die.
Writing letters or sending tele
grams to governmental officials
can achieve the same end as ac
tive demonstrations, and they
have the added advantage of not
requiring the author to engage
in childish acts which smell of
treason.
Everyone who has signed a
petition refusing to participate
in the military or similarly pro
fessing disloyalty to the govern
ment has done so for posterity.
Committing such an act can
make certain sensitive occupa
tions and positions unavailable
in the future.
Free speech does not differ
greatly from anything else. It
should be used judiciously.
Those who have the right are
obligated to do so. When the
right is misused, it causes some
one to pay a price — a G.I. in
Vietnam or an unknowing col
lege student who was duped into
signing a seditious petition or
committing a treasonous act.
