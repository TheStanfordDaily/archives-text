## The
						Torchbearers 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Since the trouble at Berkeley
(doesn't it just seem like yes
terday?) and at other schools
ostensibly for learning, students
have unfortunately often been
put in a bad light. Indeed, the
hippie movement, the radical
movement have forced the more
serious adults of our society
to question whether youth today
can make any claim at all to
good taste and maturity.
But as is always true, the few
whilom departures do not tell
the whole story. Even such ex
tensive magazines as Time or
Iskra have failed to report any
thing but such music as Country
Joe and the Fish or The Grate
ful Dead (would you believe the
grateful dead?). The many,
many wind ensembles, the poe
try readings, the walks on Sun
day do not make that ambrosia
"news" and thus go untold.
So I hope you won't mind if
I turn my column over to eulogy
this day and sing praise of those
unsung young heroes, those
growing men and women trying
to learn, to laugh, to explore the
world, to understand the respon
sibilities of democracy. You will
forgive me for telling what is
too often passed over in pur
suit of the photogenic Fillmore,
the flamboyant pothead. Let me
sing especially of you, and you
especially at Stanford, where
there are especially so many of
you.
Demands of Media
You will forgive the demands
of media — that I reduce you
verve for life to a few words,
your eagerness to a few adjec
tives. You, so terrible compress
ed in a recent song as being
"a large oblong thing, with a

white or green rind, having a
sweet watery pulp."
You are everywhere. You are
reading the best sellers, yuu are
climbing the San Francisco
spires of Ghirardelli Square, you
are finding meaning in the dance
at Lagunita. While your defeat
ed brethren are pompously try
ing to find out where it is at,
you are taking notes in class.
You are beautiful. You find
time others don't to make your
women beautiful with tras, and
your men beautiful with tans.
Your women comb and cut their
hair, shining with a blond irra
diance. Your men comb and cut
their hair, shining with a blond
irradiance.
Success
You are successful. You prefer
success to failure. You have not
turned your back on the wisdom
of your parents, but have pre
served in their name the sym
bols of hard work; you give
these symbols to the world, their
symbols — soon your symbols.
Symbols to give to Encina Hall,
to the Tresidder Information
Desk, to the Bookstore minus
eight per cent.
You are tolerant of the lives
of others. You forbear interfer
ence with the Negro, with the
Esoteric, with the Dialectic, with
the Litterati. These groups, like
any group, you respect for their
own self-definition. You are not
a meddler.
You keep your place. You do
not scream at leaders and deci
sions you cannot understand.
You let the world be run by
world-runners as it should.
Glory. Glory. You are the
bearers of the torch.
You should live so long.
