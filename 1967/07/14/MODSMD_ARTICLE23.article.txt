## What Are The Facts? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Fritz Schaefer's "tribute to
American democracy" in Tues
day's Daily makes much of the
changes in heart in a few ex
"doves" who return from Viet
nam resigned to continue the
war. When they see the "facts",
they realize they have been de
ceived by "hard-core anti-Ameri
can leftists."
This kind of "evidence" which
the hawks muster to support
their position seems to us to be
as misleading as it is simplistic.
We are two soft-core leftists who
spent three months last summer
in Vietnam working with stu
dents and learning about our
A.I.D. and military mission

aries there. We left Vietnam
discouraged by America's de
struction of the Vietnamese eco
nomy and social system, shaken
from hearing every night the
American bombs exploding in
the countryside, and mistrustful
of anyone's ability to gauge the
depth and extent of the devas
tation we are causing there.
Senator Brooke, and other
"fact-finders" like himself, was
in Vietnam less than two weeks.
He was guided in his tour by top
American officials, was not taken
to any of the "insecure" areas,
and was shown only the few
model pacification projects
which succeed. He met French
trained bureaucrats and Ameri
can-trained officers. He spoke to
no "communists" and directly to
no "peasants." The war in Viet
nam is impressive on paper, on
the A.I.D. maps and charts and
in the thousands of photographs
of one-room schoolhouses. No
one has yet photographed the
widespread alienation and bitter
ness toward Americans which
can be sensed in Vietnam.
We wish that those who are
born or made "hawks" would
tell us not that they support the
war but why they support it.
What is it accomplishing and
why is it worth the price? Their
response would interest us, but
it would be irrelevant to the
many thousands of Vietnamese
and Americans who have al
ready died needlessly in Viet
nam.

Editor, The Daily:
I read with great interest the
debut of the column "Sez Me"
by Mr. Lane in the last edition
of The Daily. It was refreshing
to see in print an individual's
views that were not noncon
formist just for the sage of non
conformity. The current fad of
attacking an institution or any
existing organization is too prev
alent among the members of
some generation, those who are
convinced they alone possess all
the answers to tuday's prob
lems.
Particularly significant was
Mr. Lane's generality in the
article. He named no one person
or group. Neither did he give
enough details to positively

identify any group(s). I wonder
if Mr. Lane's purpose was to
avoid a running debate over
some immature or irresponsible
ideas promoted on campus these
days. (I hope so, since the
column represents Mr. Lane's
own opinion and readers may
agree or not but his opinion
will remain as is.) If the leaders
of any group(s) are incensed
over the article, then perhaps
they have the bare feet on
which the shoe(s) fits.

Editor, The Daily:
Your vociferous attack (July
4) upon that great bastion of
courage and apathy, Summer
School Student Body President
Tom Forstenzer, at first render
ed me inarticulate. However,
with Mr. King's somewhat in
genuous letter to The Daily, July
11, I felt compelled to break my
silence.
Mr. Forstenzer's position
would at first appear to be inde
fensible. Yet when one realizes
that his position is to have no
position, that his commitment
to the Student Body is to spare
them of his ridiculous but cus
tomary Presidential responsi
bilities of "entertaining the citi
zenary at large", then one can
appreciate his silence.
Many at Stanford would find
Mr. King attempting to "un
burden" the Stanford summer
school visitor of the wrong thing.
Perhaps if Stanford did not —
through the offices of the Stu
dent Body — afford its consti
tuents a rigorous social program
then its visitors would become
aware of the more important
"functions" of the University.
Fortunately, Stanford has in the
past been concerned about more
than its "social" stigma. At least
Mr. Forstenzer is not suffering
under the illusion that he can —
through his organization — con
tribute to a personal and mean
ingful university experience.
Nevertheless, I applaude Mr.
King's efforts. In addition, I
would like to suggest that he
perhaps organize 3-legged games
and pin-the-donkey parties atop
Hoo Tow.

Editor, The Daily:
I read with great interest the
debut of the column "Sez Me"
by Mr. Lane in the last edition
of The Daily. It was refreshing
to see in print an individual's
views that were not noncon
formist just for the sage of non
conformity. The current fad of
attacking an institution or any
existing organization is too prev
alent among the members of
some generation, those who are
convinced they alone possess all
the answers to tuday's prob
lems.
Particularly significant was
Mr. Lane's generality in the
article. He named no one person
or group. Neither did he give
enough details to positively

identify any group(s). I wonder
if Mr. Lane's purpose was to
avoid a running debate over
some immature or irresponsible
ideas promoted on campus these
days. (I hope so, since the
column represents Mr. Lane's
own opinion and readers may
agree or not but his opinion
will remain as is.) If the leaders
of any group(s) are incensed
over the article, then perhaps
they have the bare feet on
which the shoe(s) fits.

Your vociferous attack (July
4) upon that great bastion of
courage and apathy, Summer
School Student Body President
Tom Forstenzer, at first render
ed me inarticulate. However,
with Mr. King's somewhat in
genuous letter to The Daily, July
11, I felt compelled to break my
silence.
Mr. Forstenzer's position
would at first appear to be inde
fensible. Yet when one realizes
that his position is to have no
position, that his commitment
to the Student Body is to spare
them of his ridiculous but cus
tomary Presidential responsi
bilities of "entertaining the citi
zenary at large", then one can
appreciate his silence.
Many at Stanford would find
Mr. King attempting to "un
burden" the Stanford summer
school visitor of the wrong thing.
Perhaps if Stanford did not —
through the offices of the Stu
dent Body — afford its consti
tuents a rigorous social program
then its visitors would become
aware of the more important
"functions" of the University.
Fortunately, Stanford has in the
past been concerned about more
than its "social" stigma. At least
Mr. Forstenzer is not suffering
under the illusion that he can —
through his organization — con
tribute to a personal and mean
ingful university experience.
Nevertheless, I applaude Mr.
King's efforts. In addition, I
would like to suggest that he
perhaps organize 3-legged games
and pin-the-donkey parties atop
Hoo Tow.

Fritz Schaefer's "tribute to
American democracy" in Tues
day's Daily makes much of the
changes in heart in a few ex
"doves" who return from Viet
nam resigned to continue the
war. When they see the "facts",
they realize they have been de
ceived by "hard-core anti-Ameri
can leftists."
This kind of "evidence" which
the hawks muster to support
their position seems to us to be
as misleading as it is simplistic.
We are two soft-core leftists who
spent three months last summer
in Vietnam working with stu
dents and learning about our
A.I.D. and military mission

aries there. We left Vietnam
discouraged by America's de
struction of the Vietnamese eco
nomy and social system, shaken
from hearing every night the
American bombs exploding in
the countryside, and mistrustful
of anyone's ability to gauge the
depth and extent of the devas
tation we are causing there.
Senator Brooke, and other
"fact-finders" like himself, was
in Vietnam less than two weeks.
He was guided in his tour by top
American officials, was not taken
to any of the "insecure" areas,
and was shown only the few
model pacification projects
which succeed. He met French
trained bureaucrats and Ameri
can-trained officers. He spoke to
no "communists" and directly to
no "peasants." The war in Viet
nam is impressive on paper, on
the A.I.D. maps and charts and
in the thousands of photographs
of one-room schoolhouses. No
one has yet photographed the
widespread alienation and bitter
ness toward Americans which
can be sensed in Vietnam.
We wish that those who are
born or made "hawks" would
tell us not that they support the
war but why they support it.
What is it accomplishing and
why is it worth the price? Their
response would interest us, but
it would be irrelevant to the
many thousands of Vietnamese
and Americans who have al
ready died needlessly in Viet
nam.

Perhaps if Stanford did not —
through the offices of the Stu
dent Body — afford its consti
tuents a rigorous social program
then its visitors would become
aware of the more important
"functions" of the University.
Fortunately, Stanford has in the
past been concerned about more
than its "social" stigma. At least
Mr. Forstenzer is not suffering
under the illusion that he can —
through his organization — con
tribute to a personal and mean
ingful university experience.
Nevertheless, I applaude Mr.
King's efforts. In addition, I
would like to suggest that he
perhaps organize 3-legged games
and pin-the-donkey parties atop
Hoo Tow.

Editor, The Daily:
Fritz Schaefer's "tribute to
American democracy" in Tues
day's Daily makes much of the
changes in heart in a few ex
"doves" who return from Viet
nam resigned to continue the
war. When they see the "facts",
they realize they have been de
ceived by "hard-core anti-Ameri
can leftists."
This kind of "evidence" which
the hawks muster to support
their position seems to us to be
as misleading as it is simplistic.
We are two soft-core leftists who
spent three months last summer
in Vietnam working with stu
dents and learning about our
A.I.D. and military mission

aries there. We left Vietnam
discouraged by America's de
struction of the Vietnamese eco
nomy and social system, shaken
from hearing every night the
American bombs exploding in
the countryside, and mistrustful
of anyone's ability to gauge the
depth and extent of the devas
tation we are causing there.
Senator Brooke, and other
"fact-finders" like himself, was
in Vietnam less than two weeks.
He was guided in his tour by top
American officials, was not taken
to any of the "insecure" areas,
and was shown only the few
model pacification projects
which succeed. He met French
trained bureaucrats and Ameri
can-trained officers. He spoke to
no "communists" and directly to
no "peasants." The war in Viet
nam is impressive on paper, on
the A.I.D. maps and charts and
in the thousands of photographs
of one-room schoolhouses. No
one has yet photographed the
widespread alienation and bitter
ness toward Americans which
can be sensed in Vietnam.
We wish that those who are
born or made "hawks" would
tell us not that they support the
war but why they support it.
What is it accomplishing and
why is it worth the price? Their
response would interest us, but
it would be irrelevant to the
many thousands of Vietnamese
and Americans who have al
ready died needlessly in Viet
nam.

Editor, The Daily:
I read with great interest the
debut of the column "Sez Me"
by Mr. Lane in the last edition
of The Daily. It was refreshing
to see in print an individual's
views that were not noncon
formist just for the sage of non
conformity. The current fad of
attacking an institution or any
existing organization is too prev
alent among the members of
some generation, those who are
convinced they alone possess all
the answers to tuday's prob
lems.
Particularly significant was
Mr. Lane's generality in the
article. He named no one person
or group. Neither did he give
enough details to positively

identify any group(s). I wonder
if Mr. Lane's purpose was to
avoid a running debate over
some immature or irresponsible
ideas promoted on campus these
days. (I hope so, since the
column represents Mr. Lane's
own opinion and readers may
agree or not but his opinion
will remain as is.) If the leaders
of any group(s) are incensed
over the article, then perhaps
they have the bare feet on
which the shoe(s) fits.

• Disagreement
Editor, The Daily:
Your vociferous attack (July
4) upon that great bastion of
courage and apathy, Summer
School Student Body President
Tom Forstenzer, at first render
ed me inarticulate. However,
with Mr. King's somewhat in
genuous letter to The Daily, July
11, I felt compelled to break my
silence.
Mr. Forstenzer's position
would at first appear to be inde
fensible. Yet when one realizes
that his position is to have no
position, that his commitment
to the Student Body is to spare
them of his ridiculous but cus
tomary Presidential responsi
bilities of "entertaining the citi
zenary at large", then one can
appreciate his silence.
Many at Stanford would find
Mr. King attempting to "un
burden" the Stanford summer
school visitor of the wrong thing.
Perhaps if Stanford did not —
through the offices of the Stu
dent Body — afford its consti
tuents a rigorous social program
then its visitors would become
aware of the more important
"functions" of the University.
Fortunately, Stanford has in the
past been concerned about more
than its "social" stigma. At least
Mr. Forstenzer is not suffering
under the illusion that he can —
through his organization — con
tribute to a personal and mean
ingful university experience.
