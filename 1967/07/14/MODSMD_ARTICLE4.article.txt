# Preminger Explains Views On Youth, Art
## 
### 
Motion picture director Otto Prem
inger, immersed in a film about stu
dents, pot and protest, told a Stan
ford audience Tuesday he agrees
laws banning marijuana are hypo
critical and applauded student acti
vism.
"In my research for the film (Too
Far To Walk) I couldn't find one doc
tor who could tell me marijuana is

more harmful than cigarettes," Prem
inger said.
"To me it's understandable that
young people think the law is hypo
critical. And I get the same answer
from people 30 and 40: The law says
no; [they| say the law is wrong, and
it's hard to argue with them."
Not For Kicks
Preminger told more than 300 stu
dents and faculty in Tresidder Union
that youth doesn't march in parades
for kicks.
"They're trying very seriously to
get answers, more than any other
generation of young people."
Preminger had no prepared speech
and instead answered questions put
forward by the audience.
He said his present film, based on
the book by John Hersey, doesn't try
to embrace all of youth's problems.
"In a two-hour film we can only
show an example. Two or three peo-

pie will tell their story. The theme
comes through in the background."
He defended the traditional Ameri
can film idiom and its reluctance to
make direct social commentary.
Insidious Appeal
"The film with a story appeals in
an almost, insidious way to people
who wouldn't go otherwise. Like
people who won't read a book with
just facts in it."
Preminger knocked the Academy
awards.
"I don't believe any awards are
more than a game. As a game it (the
Academy award ceremony) is fine:
People enjoy watching Bob Hope
make some jokes and people dressed
up mostly over-dressed.
"But you can't compare a Brancusi
sculpture to a painting by Picasso and
it's the same with films."
Several people asked questions
about his directing career.
He said he trusts only his own judg
ment in selecting a book or a script.
About Hersey's book he said: "I
don't think it's his best. It's super
fieial and self-conscious; there's a bad
experience with LSD hidden in the
book. But the theme excited me.
"The author's work is a spring
board. I filter his material through
my brain. Whether it's a bad picture
or a good one, I get the blame."
He explained why he thought Holly
wood has produced no movie about
the war in Vietnam.
"Such a film must have perspec
tive!" tic said. "Now everything is a
muddle."
He said many filmmakers are
against the war.
"I would bet anything that the
percentage* of film-makers against the
war is at least as great as in the
colleges," he said.
"We ean't count John Wayne's
forthcoming The (lri«n Berets: "It's
a film about any war."
Down On TV
Preminger had few kind words
for television.
"I hate commercials more than
you. They annoy me so that I have
not seen a complete film on TV," ho
said.

He said he trusts only his own judg
ment in selecting a book or a script.
About Hersey's book he said: "I
don't think it's his best. It's super
fieial and self-conscious; there's a bad
experience with LSD hidden in the
book. But the theme excited me.
"The author's work is a spring
board. I filter his material through
my brain. Whether it's a bad picture
or a good one, I get the blame."
He explained why he thought Holly
wood has produced no movie about
the war in Vietnam.
"Such a film must have perspec
tive!" tic said. "Now everything is a
muddle."
He said many filmmakers are
against the war.
"I would bet anything that the
percentage* of film-makers against the
war is at least as great as in the
colleges," he said.
"We ean't count John Wayne's
forthcoming The (lri«n Berets: "It's
a film about any war."
Down On TV
Preminger had few kind words
for television.
"I hate commercials more than
you. They annoy me so that I have
not seen a complete film on TV," ho
said.


OTTO PREMINGER
Motion picture director Otto Prem
inger, immersed in a film about stu
dents, pot and protest, told a Stan
ford audience Tuesday he agrees
laws banning marijuana are hypo
critical and applauded student acti
vism.
"In my research for the film (Too
Far To Walk) I couldn't find one doc
tor who could tell me marijuana is

more harmful than cigarettes," Prem
inger said.
"To me it's understandable that
young people think the law is hypo
critical. And I get the same answer
from people 30 and 40: The law says
no; [they| say the law is wrong, and
it's hard to argue with them."
Not For Kicks
Preminger told more than 300 stu
dents and faculty in Tresidder Union
that youth doesn't march in parades
for kicks.
"They're trying very seriously to
get answers, more than any other
generation of young people."
Preminger had no prepared speech
and instead answered questions put
forward by the audience.
He said his present film, based on
the book by John Hersey, doesn't try
to embrace all of youth's problems.
"In a two-hour film we can only
show an example. Two or three peo-

pie will tell their story. The theme
comes through in the background."
He defended the traditional Ameri
can film idiom and its reluctance to
make direct social commentary.
Insidious Appeal
"The film with a story appeals in
an almost, insidious way to people
who wouldn't go otherwise. Like
people who won't read a book with
just facts in it."
Preminger knocked the Academy
awards.
"I don't believe any awards are
more than a game. As a game it (the
Academy award ceremony) is fine:
People enjoy watching Bob Hope
make some jokes and people dressed
up mostly over-dressed.
"But you can't compare a Brancusi
sculpture to a painting by Picasso and
it's the same with films."
Several people asked questions
about his directing career.
