# Palo Alto Nods On Hospital Plan
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council ap
proved a plan Monday that may allow
Stanford to build a "community hos
pital" for the city. The new hospital
will be built adjacent to the Medical
Center, in return for the city's 220-
bed wing at the Center. The plan di
rects the city to work with Stanford
staff workers, accumulating informa
tion on the project. II passed on a 6-3
vote.
The proposal, approved by the City
Finance Committee June 30, would
give the city a total of 390 beds, in
cluding the 170-bed Hoover Pavilion
and the new community hospital. It
would also provide the Palo Alto area
with a total of 1,050 hospital beds, sat
isfying the estimated bed need for
the next four years.
The total estimated cost of the
new hospital is between $20 and $25
million. Although adjacent to the Med
ical Center, the new wing would be
independently run by a director and
a board of trustees, made up of the
six trustees now working on the joint
Stanford-Palo Alto Medical Center hos
pital board.
The idea of the new hospital was
developed by Council Chairman Ro
bert Cooley and Councilman Edward
Arnold. Cooley, however, joined Mayor
Frances Dias and John Berwald in
opposition of the revised proposal by
Councilman Arnold that the council
passed Monday. He objected to the
plan because it did not provide for tin 1
establishment of an advisory group on
hospital affairs, to be comprised of
the six Palo Alto trustees on the
present joint hospital board. Cooley
proposed an amendment to the plan
that the six trustees, who will be in
charge of the now wing, would be
"given the responsibility and author

ity to serve as an advisory board on
hospital affairs."
Arnold defended his plan, stating
that his revisions were necessary to
"get the city out of the hospital busi
ness, almost like preparing a home for
sale or lease." He objected to the ad
visory committee, as he believed that
it would "put Palo Alto board mem
bers in the difficult position of acting
as six-member board members and as
twelve member board members."
Chairman Cooley withdrew his
amendment, stating that he would
bring the proposal up again in the
fall.
Mayor Dias objected to the plan as
a step that would further concern the
city with "the hospital business." She
stated that Palo Alto patients receive
the best possible care "where they
are today."
Stanford has indicated its readiness
to work with city workers on the
project. Robert Lindy, assistant dean
of the Stanford School of Medicine,
has stated that he "stands ready to
talk with city officials whenever they
give us a call."

the best possible care "where they
are today."
Stanford has indicated its readiness
to work with city workers on the
project. Robert Lindy, assistant dean
of the Stanford School of Medicine,
has stated that he "stands ready to
talk with city officials whenever they
give us a call."
The Palo Alto City Council ap
proved a plan Monday that may allow
Stanford to build a "community hos
pital" for the city. The new hospital
will be built adjacent to the Medical
Center, in return for the city's 220-
bed wing at the Center. The plan di
rects the city to work with Stanford
staff workers, accumulating informa
tion on the project. II passed on a 6-3
vote.
The proposal, approved by the City
Finance Committee June 30, would
give the city a total of 390 beds, in
cluding the 170-bed Hoover Pavilion
and the new community hospital. It
would also provide the Palo Alto area
with a total of 1,050 hospital beds, sat
isfying the estimated bed need for
the next four years.
The total estimated cost of the
new hospital is between $20 and $25
million. Although adjacent to the Med
ical Center, the new wing would be
independently run by a director and
a board of trustees, made up of the
six trustees now working on the joint
Stanford-Palo Alto Medical Center hos
pital board.
The idea of the new hospital was
developed by Council Chairman Ro
bert Cooley and Councilman Edward
Arnold. Cooley, however, joined Mayor
Frances Dias and John Berwald in
opposition of the revised proposal by
Councilman Arnold that the council
passed Monday. He objected to the
plan because it did not provide for tin 1
establishment of an advisory group on
hospital affairs, to be comprised of
the six Palo Alto trustees on the
present joint hospital board. Cooley
proposed an amendment to the plan
that the six trustees, who will be in
charge of the now wing, would be
"given the responsibility and author

ity to serve as an advisory board on
hospital affairs."
Arnold defended his plan, stating
that his revisions were necessary to
"get the city out of the hospital busi
ness, almost like preparing a home for
sale or lease." He objected to the ad
visory committee, as he believed that
it would "put Palo Alto board mem
bers in the difficult position of acting
as six-member board members and as
twelve member board members."
Chairman Cooley withdrew his
amendment, stating that he would
bring the proposal up again in the
fall.
Mayor Dias objected to the plan as
a step that would further concern the
city with "the hospital business." She
stated that Palo Alto patients receive
the best possible care "where they
are today."
