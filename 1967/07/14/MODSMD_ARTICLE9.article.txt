# TV Lectures Try To Defend Medium
## 
### BUCK NIEHOFF 
Television is often dull. Sub
jected to tortuous hours of soap
operas, insulted by repetitious
situation comedies and confused
by the conflicting claims of aspi
rin commercials, television au
diences can do little but curse
loudly or read a dusty book.
There is, however, a more en
joyable side to television pro
graming which the Stanford
Summer Festival explored this
week.
As part of its theme; "Focus
on America"the festival pre
sented a series of lectures and
program screenings called "25
Years of TV: A Balance Sheet."
Culminating today with a panel
discussion in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium at 3 p.m., the series in
cluded four lectures by promi
nent representatives of the tele
vision industry and screenings
of eighteen outstanding pro
grams from the past year.
Internetwork Rivalries
The lectures were potentially
the most exciting aspect of the
series, but unfortunately the
speakers were unable to over
come internetwork rivalries.
Each lecturer emphasized the
achievements of his own net
work and invariably ended with
super-sneak, extra-special pre

views of some programs sche
duled for next season.
Each also emphasized the
Nielson rating system. Conclud
ing that the rating figures are
somewhat inaccurate and often
times completely disregarded by
network executives, the speak
ers nevertheless devoted large
portions of the lectures to dis
cussing the rating systems.
As well as these irrelevant
digressions, the speakers were
distressingly pro - television.
Since all the lecturers are repre
sentatives of the television in
dustry — some even founders of
the media — this lack of criti
cism was expected.
This afternoon's panel discus
sion promises to be more ex
citing. Five of the eight partici
pants are not employed by the
television industry and hopefully
they will present some inter
esting criticism.
NET
The first lecturer in the series,
Winter D. Horton, Vice Presi
dent of National Educational
Television, spoke Monday night
on "TV: What Does It Do Besides
Make Money?" Of course, his
point was that television does
lots of things, especially his net
work which is non-profit mak
ing. He even conceded that com-
mercial networks have achieved
notable heights, but that all the
networks are hampered by gen
erally apathetic audiences who
prefer strictly entertainment
shows.
He concluded, however, that
there is a large enough audience
interested in educational TV to
warrant its continuance even if
it means getting some govern
ment aid. *
Commercial T*y and Art
The second lecture, given by
Philip Berry of the American
Broadcasting Company, was
somewhat less satisfying than
Mr. Norton's. His subject, "Are
Today's Mass TV Audience Pro
grams Underrated as Art
Forms?", was perhaps the most
important in the series. He failed
to do it justice.
Of course, Mr. Berry asserted
that mass television programs
are not at all underrated. He
then attempted to explain how
such A.B.C. programs as "The
Newlywed Game" or "American
Bandstand" do indeed improve
the artistic sensibilities of the
American television viewer. Mr.
Berry got his terms mixed up
and failed to completely answer
the question. Instead of talking
about art he tried to explain
how mass audience programs
improve America's culture,
which is a much broader subject
than art.
Start Over
The third speaker was Richard
Eastland, West Coast Manager
of Standards and Practices at
N.8.C., who spoke Wednesday
night on "If I Were Starting the
Television Industry from Scratch
Today. . . Mr. Eastland briefly
reviewed the early days of the
television industry, and com
mented on what changes tele
vision audiences can expect in
the near future. There will be
more news analysis programs,
more international news and
more on-the-spot coverage —
"live and in color" —of major
world events such as the Viet
nam War.
He also suggested a standard
for the networks' use in sche
duling programs. Asserting that
programs should generally be
scheduled to satisfy the needs
of the total public, Mr. Eastland
stressed that the networks must
also try to satisfy the interests
of sub-groups. Finally he out
lined the methods used by the
networks to discover the inter
ests of the public and to sche
dule programs which will satisfy
those interests.
TV At Its Best
Despite the disappointing na
ture of the lectures, the program

screenings were fairly enjoy
able. They ranged from child
ren's programs such as "Stuart
Little" to outstanding dramas
such as "A Christmas Memory"
to documentaries such as "This
is Marshall McLuhan: The Me
dium is the Massage." The sche
duling of the programs through
out the week was generally well
done. Only once were two basic
ally incompatible programs
shown together.
On Wednesday afternoon
"Stuart Little", a children's pro
gram, presented the story of a
mouse who is born to two per
fectly normal people in New
York City. Following this pro
gram was the "Mystery of Life"
which described how people
might alter the looks of their off
spring by transplanting genes.
Perhaps the witty gentleman
who scheduled these two pro
grams together was perpetrat
ing some sort of subtle satire.
Intentional or not, the result
was quite amusing.
Critics vs. the Networks
The whole series was often
times enjoyable and occasionally
enlightening. I believe that the
most valuable single program
in the series will take place
this afternoon and I am looking
forward to an interesting debate
as three of the lectures take on
television critics. In addition to
Mr. Berry, Mr. Eastland and Mr.
Lafferty, the panel will include
Paul Speegle, a former televi
sion critic; Nathan Maccoby,
Professor of Communications at
Stanford; Janet Voelker, Instruc
tor of Mass Communications;
Dwight Newton, television critic
of the San Francisco Examiner;
and George Willey, DeAnza Col
lege Dean of Instruction and
Television and critic for the
Palo Alto Times.

NET
The first lecturer in the series,
Winter D. Horton, Vice Presi
dent of National Educational
Television, spoke Monday night
on "TV: What Does It Do Besides
Make Money?" Of course, his
point was that television does
lots of things, especially his net
work which is non-profit mak
ing. He even conceded that com-
mercial networks have achieved
notable heights, but that all the
networks are hampered by gen
erally apathetic audiences who
prefer strictly entertainment
shows.
He concluded, however, that
there is a large enough audience
interested in educational TV to
warrant its continuance even if
it means getting some govern
ment aid. *
Commercial T*y and Art
The second lecture, given by
Philip Berry of the American
Broadcasting Company, was
somewhat less satisfying than
Mr. Norton's. His subject, "Are
Today's Mass TV Audience Pro
grams Underrated as Art
Forms?", was perhaps the most
important in the series. He failed
to do it justice.
Of course, Mr. Berry asserted
that mass television programs
are not at all underrated. He
then attempted to explain how
such A.B.C. programs as "The
Newlywed Game" or "American
Bandstand" do indeed improve
the artistic sensibilities of the
American television viewer. Mr.
Berry got his terms mixed up
and failed to completely answer
the question. Instead of talking
about art he tried to explain
how mass audience programs
improve America's culture,
which is a much broader subject
than art.
Start Over
The third speaker was Richard
Eastland, West Coast Manager
of Standards and Practices at
N.8.C., who spoke Wednesday
night on "If I Were Starting the
Television Industry from Scratch
Today. . . Mr. Eastland briefly
reviewed the early days of the
television industry, and com
mented on what changes tele
vision audiences can expect in
the near future. There will be
more news analysis programs,
more international news and
more on-the-spot coverage —
"live and in color" —of major
world events such as the Viet
nam War.
He also suggested a standard
for the networks' use in sche
duling programs. Asserting that
programs should generally be
scheduled to satisfy the needs
of the total public, Mr. Eastland
stressed that the networks must
also try to satisfy the interests
of sub-groups. Finally he out
lined the methods used by the
networks to discover the inter
ests of the public and to sche
dule programs which will satisfy
those interests.
TV At Its Best
Despite the disappointing na
ture of the lectures, the program

screenings were fairly enjoy
able. They ranged from child
ren's programs such as "Stuart
Little" to outstanding dramas
such as "A Christmas Memory"
to documentaries such as "This
is Marshall McLuhan: The Me
dium is the Massage." The sche
duling of the programs through
out the week was generally well
done. Only once were two basic
ally incompatible programs
shown together.
On Wednesday afternoon
"Stuart Little", a children's pro
gram, presented the story of a
mouse who is born to two per
fectly normal people in New
York City. Following this pro
gram was the "Mystery of Life"
which described how people
might alter the looks of their off
spring by transplanting genes.
Perhaps the witty gentleman
who scheduled these two pro
grams together was perpetrat
ing some sort of subtle satire.
Intentional or not, the result
was quite amusing.
Critics vs. the Networks
The whole series was often
times enjoyable and occasionally
enlightening. I believe that the
most valuable single program
in the series will take place
this afternoon and I am looking
forward to an interesting debate
as three of the lectures take on
television critics. In addition to
Mr. Berry, Mr. Eastland and Mr.
Lafferty, the panel will include
Paul Speegle, a former televi
sion critic; Nathan Maccoby,
Professor of Communications at
Stanford; Janet Voelker, Instruc
tor of Mass Communications;
Dwight Newton, television critic
of the San Francisco Examiner;
and George Willey, DeAnza Col
lege Dean of Instruction and
Television and critic for the
Palo Alto Times.
Television is often dull. Sub
jected to tortuous hours of soap
operas, insulted by repetitious
situation comedies and confused
by the conflicting claims of aspi
rin commercials, television au
diences can do little but curse
loudly or read a dusty book.
There is, however, a more en
joyable side to television pro
graming which the Stanford
Summer Festival explored this
week.
As part of its theme; "Focus
on America"the festival pre
sented a series of lectures and
program screenings called "25
Years of TV: A Balance Sheet."
Culminating today with a panel
discussion in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium at 3 p.m., the series in
cluded four lectures by promi
nent representatives of the tele
vision industry and screenings
of eighteen outstanding pro
grams from the past year.
Internetwork Rivalries
The lectures were potentially
the most exciting aspect of the
series, but unfortunately the
speakers were unable to over
come internetwork rivalries.
Each lecturer emphasized the
achievements of his own net
work and invariably ended with
super-sneak, extra-special pre

views of some programs sche
duled for next season.
Each also emphasized the
Nielson rating system. Conclud
ing that the rating figures are
somewhat inaccurate and often

prefer strictly entertainment

there is a large enough audience

Commercial T*y and Art
The second lecture, given by
Philip Berry of the American
Broadcasting Company, was
somewhat less satisfying than
Mr. Norton's. His subject, "Are
Today's Mass TV Audience Pro
grams Underrated as Art
Forms?", was perhaps the most
important in the series. He failed
to do it justice.
Of course, Mr. Berry asserted
that mass television programs
are not at all underrated. He
then attempted to explain how
such A.B.C. programs as "The
Newlywed Game" or "American
Bandstand" do indeed improve
the artistic sensibilities of the
American television viewer. Mr.
Berry got his terms mixed up
and failed to completely answer
the question. Instead of talking
about art he tried to explain
how mass audience programs
improve America's culture,
which is a much broader subject
than art.
Start Over
The third speaker was Richard
Eastland, West Coast Manager
of Standards and Practices at
N.8.C., who spoke Wednesday
night on "If I Were Starting the
Television Industry from Scratch
Today. . . Mr. Eastland briefly
reviewed the early days of the
television industry, and com
mented on what changes tele
vision audiences can expect in
the near future. There will be
more news analysis programs,
more international news and
more on-the-spot coverage —
"live and in color" —of major
world events such as the Viet
nam War.
He also suggested a standard
for the networks' use in sche
duling programs. Asserting that
programs should generally be
scheduled to satisfy the needs
of the total public, Mr. Eastland
stressed that the networks must
also try to satisfy the interests
of sub-groups. Finally he out
lined the methods used by the
networks to discover the inter
ests of the public and to sche
dule programs which will satisfy
those interests.
TV At Its Best
Despite the disappointing na
ture of the lectures, the program

screenings were fairly enjoy
able. They ranged from child
ren's programs such as "Stuart
Little" to outstanding dramas
such as "A Christmas Memory"
to documentaries such as "This
is Marshall McLuhan: The Me
dium is the Massage." The sche
duling of the programs through
out the week was generally well
done. Only once were two basic
ally incompatible programs
shown together.
On Wednesday afternoon
"Stuart Little", a children's pro
gram, presented the story of a
mouse who is born to two per
fectly normal people in New
York City. Following this pro
gram was the "Mystery of Life"
which described how people
might alter the looks of their off
spring by transplanting genes.
Perhaps the witty gentleman
who scheduled these two pro
grams together was perpetrat
ing some sort of subtle satire.
Intentional or not, the result
was quite amusing.
Critics vs. the Networks
The whole series was often
times enjoyable and occasionally
enlightening. I believe that the
most valuable single program
in the series will take place
this afternoon and I am looking
forward to an interesting debate
as three of the lectures take on
television critics. In addition to
Mr. Berry, Mr. Eastland and Mr.
Lafferty, the panel will include
Paul Speegle, a former televi
sion critic; Nathan Maccoby,
Professor of Communications at
Stanford; Janet Voelker, Instruc
tor of Mass Communications;
Dwight Newton, television critic
of the San Francisco Examiner;
and George Willey, DeAnza Col
lege Dean of Instruction and
Television and critic for the
Palo Alto Times.
Television is often dull. Sub
jected to tortuous hours of soap
operas, insulted by repetitious
situation comedies and confused
by the conflicting claims of aspi
rin commercials, television au
diences can do little but curse
loudly or read a dusty book.
There is, however, a more en
joyable side to television pro
graming which the Stanford
Summer Festival explored this
week.
As part of its theme; "Focus
on America"the festival pre
sented a series of lectures and
program screenings called "25
Years of TV: A Balance Sheet."
Culminating today with a panel
discussion in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium at 3 p.m., the series in
cluded four lectures by promi
nent representatives of the tele
vision industry and screenings
of eighteen outstanding pro
grams from the past year.
Internetwork Rivalries
The lectures were potentially
the most exciting aspect of the
series, but unfortunately the
speakers were unable to over
come internetwork rivalries.
Each lecturer emphasized the
achievements of his own net
work and invariably ended with
super-sneak, extra-special pre

views of some programs sche
duled for next season.
Each also emphasized the
Nielson rating system. Conclud
ing that the rating figures are
somewhat inaccurate and often
times completely disregarded by
network executives, the speak
ers nevertheless devoted large
portions of the lectures to dis
cussing the rating systems.
As well as these irrelevant
digressions, the speakers were
distressingly pro - television.
Since all the lecturers are repre
sentatives of the television in
dustry — some even founders of
the media — this lack of criti
cism was expected.
This afternoon's panel discus
sion promises to be more ex
citing. Five of the eight partici
pants are not employed by the
television industry and hopefully
they will present some inter
esting criticism.

The first lecturer in the series,
Winter D. Horton, Vice Presi
dent of National Educational
Television, spoke Monday night
on "TV: What Does It Do Besides
Make Money?" Of course, his
point was that television does
lots of things, especially his net
work which is non-profit mak
ing. He even conceded that com-
mercial networks have achieved
notable heights, but that all the
