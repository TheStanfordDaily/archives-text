# TV Lectures Try To Defend Medium
## 
### BUCK NIEHOFF 
Television is often dull. Sub
jected to tortuous hours of soap
operas, insulted by repetitious
situation comedies and confused
by the conflicting claims of aspi
rin commercials, television au
diences can do little but curse
loudly or read a dusty book.
There is, however, a more en
joyable side to television pro
graming which the Stanford
Summer Festival explored this
week.
As part of its theme; "Focus
on America"the festival pre
sented a series of lectures and
program screenings called "25
Years of TV: A Balance Sheet."
Culminating today with a panel
discussion in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium at 3 p.m., the series in
cluded four lectures by promi
nent representatives of the tele
vision industry and screenings
of eighteen outstanding pro
grams from the past year.
Internetwork Rivalries
The lectures were potentially
the most exciting aspect of the
series, but unfortunately the
speakers were unable to over
come internetwork rivalries.
Each lecturer emphasized the
achievements of his own net
work and invariably ended with
super-sneak, extra-special pre

views of some programs sche
duled for next season.
Each also emphasized the
Nielson rating system. Conclud
ing that the rating figures are
somewhat inaccurate and often
times completely disregarded by
network executives, the speak
ers nevertheless devoted large
portions of the lectures to dis
cussing the rating systems.
As well as these irrelevant
digressions, the speakers were
distressingly pro - television.
Since all the lecturers are repre
sentatives of the television in
dustry — some even founders of
the media — this lack of criti
cism was expected.
This afternoon's panel discus
sion promises to be more ex
citing. Five of the eight partici
pants are not employed by the
television industry and hopefully
they will present some inter
esting criticism.
NET
The first lecturer in the series,
Winter D. Horton, Vice Presi
dent of National Educational
Television, spoke Monday night
on "TV: What Does It Do Besides
Make Money?" Of course, his
point was that television does
lots of things, especially his net
work which is non-profit mak
ing. He even conceded that com-
