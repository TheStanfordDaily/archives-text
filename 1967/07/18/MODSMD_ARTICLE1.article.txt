# Dr. Erhard Proposes Expansion Of EEC
## 
### BUCK NIEHOFF 
Professor Dr. Ludwig Erhard,
speaking last night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium on "The European Eco
nomic Community with a View To
ward the Future," asserted that the
European Economic Community
(EEC) might be enlarged to include
the smaller European countries, such
as Denmark, Switzerland, Austria
and Norway. Similarly, Erhard, the
former Chancellor of the Federal
Republic of Germany, believes that
the Common Market should also be
expanded to include the United
Kingdom.
Such expansion, according to the
former Chancellor, might eventually
lead to the formation of a federalist
European State. Erhard was, how
ever, unwilling to predict when the
creation of such a state might be
achieved. But he stressed that a
more unified Europe was definitely
an attainable goal.
Indeed, all Europeans, as "Der
Dicke" pointed out, share the same
"spirit, culture, history, tradition,
and economy." Similarly, he pointed
to the economic value of a more
unified Europe, "especially with re
gard to the opportunities it provides
for a practical and profitable appli
cation of modern technology and
science."
No Third Power
The power of a federated Europe
would not be as great as might be
expected. Indeed, Erhard observed
that "whether a partially or wholly
united Europe will muster up the
financial and economic strength to
become a third factor of power
besides the United States and the
Soviet Union appears to me to be
more than uncertain."
In any case, a federated Europe, as
the former Chancellor observed, is
now just a dream, almost as distant
today as it was in the first quarter
of this century when Konrad Aden
auer, whom Erhard described as one
of "the first and most faithful Euro
peans," began to propose its estab
lishment. At the present, Erhard
states, we should "keep on the
ground of overseeable realities."

Among Erhard's foreseeable reali
ties is the inclusion of the smaller
states of Europe and the United King
dom in the EEC. Indeed, he asserted
that "I am not . . . able to understand
or acknowledge why the six EEC coun
tries would have to defend themselves
against an enlargement of the Com
munity . . . ." Similarly, he stated that
"the European Economic Community
. . . cannot disregard the well-being
or hurts of those smaller States and at
the same time talk loftily about
Europe."
British Omission Distressing
Even more distressing to Erhard
than the exclusion of smaller Euro
pean countries is the problem of Brit
ish omission from the Common Mar
ket. Viewing the failure of Britain's
first attempt at accession to the EEC
as a defeat of the "European idea," he
believes that a second bid might be
more successful. In his press con
ference yesterday afternoon, Erhard
refused to give his opinion of De
Gaulle, who has prevented Brit
ain's inclusion in the EEC. He only
remarked that France is "a difficult
partner to discuss this question with."
Also in yesterday afternoon's press
conference Erhard supported Ameri
ca's position in Vietnam. Regarding
the war as evidence of America's
steadfastness to its obligations and
treaties, Erhard asserted that the Ger
mans are reassured by America's posi
tion.
Similarly, Erhard supports Ameri
ca's position in the Mid-East crisis.
Whereas the German government
must remain officially neutral on this
issue, Erhard observed that the Ger
man people have strong sympathies
for the Israelites. No other country in
Europe, he believes, has so supported
the Israelites as the Germans.
Ends Visit Today
The ex-Chancellor concludes his visit
at Stanford this morning with a brief
speech before the 100 businessmen
enrolled in Stanford Executives Pro
grams. Erhard goes to Sacramento to
meet with Gov. Reagaq, later this
afternoon. Tomorrow he returns to
New York.
