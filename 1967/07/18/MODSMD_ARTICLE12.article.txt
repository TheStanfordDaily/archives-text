# Anti-Draft Union Members To Contine Summer Protests
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Anti-
Draft Union will continue to be
a thorn in the side of the local
Selective Service Boards this
summer, as they plan another
day of civil disobedience Thurs
day.
Among the most significant re
cent developments among Anti-
Draft Union circles was the ar
rest on May 25 of members David
Brown and Fred Bennett, for

"disturbing the peace." They
were distributing anti-draft leaf
lets while being processed for
their physicals when police ap
prehended them.
Now three other Anti-Draft
Union members, A 1 Abrams, Pe
ter Ware and Jim Sayre, have an
nounced their intentions of dis
tributing anti-war and anti-draft
literature at the Oakland induc
tion center this Thursday. They
are scheduled to report for their
pre-induction physicals at that
time. Other members of the Anti-
Draft Union will also be on hand
Thursday beginning at 6:30 a.m.
to picket and help distribute lit
erature.
Jim Sayre told the Daily that
anyone wishing to "help harass
the Selective Service System this
way" should call 325-7604 for
rides and further information.
