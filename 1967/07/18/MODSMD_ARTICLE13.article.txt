## Dear Mr. Lane 
### 
A column entitled The Price
of Free Speech, by J. Lane, in
July 14th's Daily attacks the
"press and certain citizens" for
misusing their rights of free
speech and press with regard to
the War in Vietnam.
My understanding of his col
umn is that it attacks the bases
of these freedoms; that his defi
nition of their "judicious" use

amounts to considerably loss
than freedom.
I challenge Mr. Lane to de
fend his definitions of free
speech and press in public de
bate.

(Note: the debate will be held
under the auspices of the Sum
mer ASSU President's office, and
can be held in the daytime in
White Plaza, or in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium in the evening.)
