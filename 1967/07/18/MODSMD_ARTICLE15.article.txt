Editor, The Daily:
In a letter to Friday's Daily
the question is asked: "Why are
we in Vietnam?" Although I
don't consider myself a hawk
(or dove) I would like to reply:
Millions of South Vietnamese
have fought and resisted Com
munist aggression including
many who at one time fought
with the NLF for reform but
changed sides, especially after
Diem's overthrow. Included also
are village officials working
with the government who risked
torture and death at the hands
of terrorists "helping the popu
lation."
South Vietnam has a culture
and the South Vietnamese are
not beings less than human who
deserve only the right to follow
the dictates of a despotism. We
would be betraying our heritage
to allow a tyranny which is un
acceptable to us to engulf an
entire people because we don't
want to become involved.
More importantly, we are
fighting the notion that Com
munism can overthrow existing
governments in any non-Com
munist country by applying the
appropriate form of guerrilla
warfare; which is probably their
blueprint for the future. As a
recent very high defector (main
force platoon leader and politi
cal commissar) said, "The Front
may have a false doctrine but
it may beat you because psycho
logical warfare can decide the
victory. . . . (For the Front) it
was the soul of the truth."
If we withdraw now the tre
mendous psychological impact
of the apparent inevitability of
victory will cause small incipi
ent guerrilla skirmishes in sev
eral Latin American as well as
Asian countries to develop into
"Wars of Liberation" which will
mean a type of slavery to many
who are consciously aware of
and committed (as well as those
indifferent) to freedom.
In all of these lands we can;
"rest" assured that after take- J
over many peasants will t>e
killed or jailed in attempts to
maintain their property without
knowing the difference between
"Capitalism" and "Democratic
Socialism", and many artists and
writers will suffer a similar fate
in a "Hundred Flowers Move
ment" for free speech.
As for the "immorality" of war
and killing that has occurred
and will occur, which those self
righteous among us are so apt
to advance, I ask of them:
"What did you do to prevent the
conditions leading to the migra
tion of 850,000 people or 90,000
killings in North Vietnam fol
lowing partition in 1954? What
will you do to protect from loss
of life, jailings and forced mass
migration as well as social ex
termination those who have
fought against the Viet Cong?"
Peace is important but the
rebellions (including a suppres
sed one in Ho Chi Minh's home
district during a visit of the
ICC) in many countries, Com
munist and non-, show that the
way one lives is more so.
I find it hard to believe that
those most vociferous in de
nouncing our policy would, if
Vietnamese, idly allow their
fates to go down the drain. Yet
this is what they propose for
others.
