# The 						Column
## Down Memory Lane 
### Jurgen Wolff 
A memorable statement was
made at the little summit at
Glassboro by President Johnson
and Premier Kosygin. As they
sat around eating apple pie in
the all-American town (no pro
testors), they decided that, both
being grandfathers, they really
should work to make the world
safe for their grandchildren.
Sighs of relief were heard
around the world, especially
here in the U.S.A. Thank good
ness, or rather thank Pat and
Lucy, for giving LBJ the moti
vation for making peace.
I'm still worried.
Remember a few months ago
when the President recalled the
conversation he had with his
daughter upon first ordering the
bombing of North Vietnam? At
a press conference, he admitted
that he had told her it might
start World War 111, and that
she might not wake up the next
morning. Let's travel back to
that scene:
He is sitting in a large lounge
chair. His pet beagle brings him
his slippers, then goes and
fetches LBJ's paper. The Presi
dent opens it, only to see that
it's the New York Times, where
upon he tears the paper to
shreds and angrily lifts the dog
by its ears and throws it across
the room. He tries to console
himself by reading the latest
statement by Mendel Rivers, but
even that doesn't do the job.
He removes his dark glasses,
adjusts his purple lounging
robe, and starts pacing the
room. His sweet young daughter
peeks into the door.
"Daddy, you look so tired,"
she says.
He smiles at her, invites her
to sit on his lap, and starts
running his fingers through her
hair.
"Daddy, please use your other
hand to run through my hair . ..
you know how I hate the feel
of that black glove."
"Sorry, dear. This is an im
portant day for me and for
'Merica. Your father may go

down in history for starting
World War III."
"That'll show that Bobby Ken
nedy!"
"Yes, my child, but it does
have its drawbacks. For one
thing, you may not wake up
tomorrow."
"But Daddy," she says, wiping
a tear from her eye," I don't
mind if you blow up the world
to make it safe for democracy."
He turns and says,"I have the
most understanding daughter
in the world."
They both turn in, feeling a
lot better.

Well, I return to this tender
scene only because it is gen
erally accepted that we must
learn from what has happened
in the past.
Somebody should watch Pat
and Lucy's house. If LBJ drops
in for a late-night chat with
little Lyn, we're in big trouble.
