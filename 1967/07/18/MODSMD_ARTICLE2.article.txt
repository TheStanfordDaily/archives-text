# SLAC Receives New 'Brain'
## 
### 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) recently installed a
new $5 million computer which will
enable it to increase nuclear research.
Stanford operates SLAC under a con
tract held with the U.S. Atomic En
ergy Commission.
The System 360/ Model 75, the larg
est computer now used by SLAC
scientists, is taking the burden from
the University's IBM 7090 and Bur
roughs 85500 which previously hand
led the load.

The 360/75, operated by the SLAC
group of the Stanford Computation
Center, offers services suited to var
ious needs. For example, small, med
ium or large data reduction calcula
tions can oe handled "batch" style. It
is also planned that scientists will be
able to work simultaneously at re
mote consoles in a computer time
sharing system.
In addition to the 360/75 "there are
a number of small and medium-sized
computers at SLAC for individual
and specialized functions," according

to Prof. William F. Miller, head of
the SLAC computation group.
Both the 360/75 and smaller com
puters will be connected, in some
cases directly, to experimental ap
paratus in order to accumulate new
data. Using the TV-like screen of a
remote console, scientists can use the
computers to analyze results.
Although the 360/75 is the largest
computer at SLAC now, there are al
ready plans for the 360/91, the larg
est and fastest computer made by
IBM, to replace it by the end of 1968.


810 NUCLEAR COMPUTER recently installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) was a source of plea
sure for both Prof. Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky (left), SLAC director, and Henry M. Deter 111, IBM's national program man
ager for AEC facilities. The H6O/Model 75 machine will aid physicists using the two-mile accelerator to explore the inner
structure of the atomic nucleus.
