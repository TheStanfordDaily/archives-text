# The

On Friday morning, July 14, 1967, we re
ceived the following note from Richard A.
Ware, Student Financial Manager for the
ASSU:
"I am sorry for the procedural changes that
it will involve, but the title of the summer pub
lication must be changed to the Stanford Sum
mer Weekly, effective immediately. Please see
me for a more thorough explanation."
Thus began what must surely be the most
absurd and inane battle between the ASSU
and a member organization.
According to the By-Laws of the Associated
Students, "There shall be a weekly publication
called the Stanford Summer Weekly." Our pub
lication violates this by-law on two counts.
We are not a weekly publication and we are
not called the Stanford Summer Weekly. Our
reasons for these "violations" were laid out in
our first editorial.
Three weeks and five editions later, the pow
ers that be in the ASSU decided that they
were in a very tenuous legal position. Should
the Stanford Daily, Volume 151 A be sued, they
might be hard put to explain their relation
ship to the organization.
When the order came down from above to
change the name of the publication we refused
to comply. To do so, we felt, would have made
it impossible to accomplish the goal we set for
ourselves in the first edition. Because we feel
as strongly as we do about this goal, we were
unwilling to compromise our position.

After much heated debate, we suggested
that the whole problem might be solved if we
created a new organization entitled the Stan
ford Daily, Volume 151 A. We refused to do
this, however, unless it was demonstrated to us
that such action was necessary. In essence, we
did not want to lose the $1,000 subsidy that the
ASSU provides.
Summer ASSU President Tom Forstenzer
then authorized a transfer from the Stanford
Summer Weekly to the Stanford Daily, Volume
151 A of the $1,000 subsidy. Following For
stenzer's generous action, we assumed control
of the Stanford Daily, Volume 151 A.
The ramifications of this organizational
change are few. In the Flag of the paper, if
you look very closely, you will find the words
"Volume 151 A." By the next edition, you will
find a new wording in the staff box indicating
the new ownership. We will no longer be an
official ASSU Publication.
Otherwise, nothing has changed. We will
continue to publish twice a week and attempt
to attain our prior stated goal. We will con
tinue to be funded by the ASSU. We will con
tinue to publish what is intended to be a fair
and accurate account of the news.
What the ASSU has accomplished by effect
ing this change is a nebulous fact. We have
received indications that they have, in reality,
changed nothing at all. We doubt whether it
was worth the effort.
