## Death Of Peace Movement? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Fritz Schaefer's announce
ment of the death of the anti
war movement may be, like
Mark Twain's, somewhat pre
mature.
Most of us who still speak up
are, he says, "hard core anti-
American leftists." That's famil
iar enough language to those
who remember the McCarthy
Era. One is tempted to ask
whether Mr. Schaefer is a soft
core anti-humanity rightist. And
"one of the most massive indoc
trination campaigns ever re
corded" does seem a bit thick
as a description of antiwar senti
ment. Might it not apply more
logically to the federal govern
ment's propaganda, paid for
with some of that $80 billion in
taxes that goes each year to
"defense"? We peaceniks don't
have that kind of money.
He's on firmer ground with
his description of three repu
table men (one unnamed) who
visited Vietnam and came back
with reports favorable to U.S.
policy. But there are, of course,
other opinions by men on the
spot. When, e.g., Harrison Salis
bury of the N.Y. Times reported
objectively from the north, he
was attacked in the Schaefer
manner. And I don't believe that
Bernard Fall, one of the leading
authorities on Vietnamese his
tory, had changed his opposition
to the war at the time of his
death there (from a sniper's
bullet) earlier this year.

The time may be coming when
the Schaefers will manage to
get us anti-American leftists in
to relocation camps (or Reagan
villes?) to re-educate us in Am
ericanism. But until then, I'll
take my stand with Franz Schur
man, Hans Morgenthau, and
Henry Steele Commager in the
the USA, Jean-Paul Sartre in
France, Gunnar Myrdal in Swed
en, and Bertrand Russell and
Arnold Toynbee in Britain. (Pro
fessor Toynbee's spring lectures
here on nationalism and nuclear
disaster were, I think, land
marks in Stanford history.)
Assuming that Mr. Schaefer
does believe in the value of the
superior mind and the trained
intellect, can he suggest any
CIA- sponsored intellectuals,
here or elsewhere, to match
those names?
Mr. Schaefer may be right
about the high percentage of
those who support the war. I
don't know and I don't care any
more. I'll take my stand, finally,
with a Congressman who almost
ruined his political career by
expressing doubts about the
Mexican War in 1846. His speech
in the House that cost him the
next election can be found in
the Stanford Library Documents
Room. The name was Lincoln.

• Who's Dome?
Editor, The Daily:
Your lead article of July 11,
1967 states that "Century 21"
will be inaugurated with an ad
dress by Buckminster Fuller,
"the architect who designed the
Houston Astrodome." As a mat
ter of fact, the Astrodome was
designed by Ralph A. Anderson
and associates who considered,
but rejected Fuller's geodesic
dome in favor of a lamella-type
truss roof to which Dr. G. R.
Kiewitt holds the U.S. patent
rights (Business Week, Oct. 5,
1963, p. 56). As another matter
of fact, R. Buckminster Fuller is
not listed in the Directory of
American Architects.
It is true that Fuller owns
the patent rights to the geodesic
dome, but I offer the hypothesis
that this does not qualify him
for the article's label as "an ex
pert on environmental design."
Perhaps your readers can evalu
ate my hypothesis with the fol
lowing excerpts from a few of
the reviews of Fuller's recent
book, No More Secondhand God.
"He (Fuller) is a man incapable
of developing only one idea at a
time. His ideas stream from him
in clusters as he talks two,
three, or seven hours at a
stretch, one idea suggesting its
successor, one cluster of ideas
creating new clusters, some
ideas creating new clusters,
some ideas expressed in words
of his own invention, at times in

a syntax of intolerable complex
ity and almost complete opacity."
(Harold Taylor, Book Week, Jan.
26, 1964). "The architectural ex
perimenter with geodesic domes
tries his hand at prose poems.
His private jargon renders most
of what he has to say virtually
unintelligible. We vote for the
domes. He's singing songs of
God, but not for us." (Christian
Century, May 8, 1963).
On second thought, perhaps
the above quotations indicate
only that my hypothesis cannot
be refuted because of Fuller's
highly developed propensity to
obfuscate. However, based on the
quotations and my personal ex
perience, I am willing to bet that
a Stanford student will not waste
two to seven hours if he does
not attend Fuller's address.

"one of the most massive indoc

as a description of antiwar senti
ment. Might it not apply more
logically to the federal govern
ment's propaganda, paid for
with some of that $80 billion in
taxes that goes each year to
"defense"? We peaceniks don't
have that kind of money.
He's on firmer ground with
his description of three repu
table men (one unnamed) who
visited Vietnam and came back
with reports favorable to U.S.
policy. But there are, of course,
other opinions by men on the
spot. When, e.g., Harrison Salis
bury of the N.Y. Times reported
objectively from the north, he
was attacked in the Schaefer
manner. And I don't believe that
Bernard Fall, one of the leading
authorities on Vietnamese his
tory, had changed his opposition
to the war at the time of his
death there (from a sniper's
bullet) earlier this year.

The time may be coming when
the Schaefers will manage to
get us anti-American leftists in
to relocation camps (or Reagan
villes?) to re-educate us in Am
ericanism. But until then, I'll
take my stand with Franz Schur
man, Hans Morgenthau, and
Henry Steele Commager in the
the USA, Jean-Paul Sartre in
France, Gunnar Myrdal in Swed
en, and Bertrand Russell and
Arnold Toynbee in Britain. (Pro
fessor Toynbee's spring lectures
here on nationalism and nuclear
disaster were, I think, land
marks in Stanford history.)
Assuming that Mr. Schaefer
does believe in the value of the
superior mind and the trained
intellect, can he suggest any
CIA- sponsored intellectuals,
here or elsewhere, to match
those names?
Mr. Schaefer may be right
about the high percentage of
those who support the war. I
don't know and I don't care any
more. I'll take my stand, finally,
with a Congressman who almost
ruined his political career by
expressing doubts about the
Mexican War in 1846. His speech
in the House that cost him the
next election can be found in
the Stanford Library Documents
Room. The name was Lincoln.

• Who's Dome?
Editor, The Daily:
Your lead article of July 11,
1967 states that "Century 21"
will be inaugurated with an ad
dress by Buckminster Fuller,
"the architect who designed the
Houston Astrodome." As a mat
ter of fact, the Astrodome was
designed by Ralph A. Anderson
and associates who considered,
but rejected Fuller's geodesic
dome in favor of a lamella-type
truss roof to which Dr. G. R.
Kiewitt holds the U.S. patent
rights (Business Week, Oct. 5,
1963, p. 56). As another matter
of fact, R. Buckminster Fuller is
not listed in the Directory of
American Architects.
It is true that Fuller owns
the patent rights to the geodesic
dome, but I offer the hypothesis
that this does not qualify him
for the article's label as "an ex
pert on environmental design."
Perhaps your readers can evalu
ate my hypothesis with the fol
lowing excerpts from a few of
the reviews of Fuller's recent
book, No More Secondhand God.
"He (Fuller) is a man incapable
of developing only one idea at a
time. His ideas stream from him
in clusters as he talks two,
three, or seven hours at a
stretch, one idea suggesting its
successor, one cluster of ideas
creating new clusters, some
ideas creating new clusters,
some ideas expressed in words
of his own invention, at times in

a syntax of intolerable complex
ity and almost complete opacity."
(Harold Taylor, Book Week, Jan.
26, 1964). "The architectural ex
perimenter with geodesic domes
tries his hand at prose poems.
His private jargon renders most
of what he has to say virtually
unintelligible. We vote for the
domes. He's singing songs of
God, but not for us." (Christian
Century, May 8, 1963).
On second thought, perhaps
the above quotations indicate
only that my hypothesis cannot
be refuted because of Fuller's
highly developed propensity to
obfuscate. However, based on the
quotations and my personal ex
perience, I am willing to bet that
a Stanford student will not waste
two to seven hours if he does
not attend Fuller's address.

table men (one unnamed) who
visited Vietnam and came back
with reports favorable to U.S.
policy. But there are, of course,
other opinions by men on the
spot. When, e.g., Harrison Salis
bury of the N.Y. Times reported
objectively from the north, he
was attacked in the Schaefer
manner. And I don't believe that
Bernard Fall, one of the leading
authorities on Vietnamese his
tory, had changed his opposition
to the war at the time of his
death there (from a sniper's
bullet) earlier this year.

The time may be coming when
the Schaefers will manage to
get us anti-American leftists in
to relocation camps (or Reagan
villes?) to re-educate us in Am
ericanism. But until then, I'll
take my stand with Franz Schur
man, Hans Morgenthau, and
Henry Steele Commager in the
the USA, Jean-Paul Sartre in
France, Gunnar Myrdal in Swed
en, and Bertrand Russell and
Arnold Toynbee in Britain. (Pro
fessor Toynbee's spring lectures
here on nationalism and nuclear
disaster were, I think, land
marks in Stanford history.)
Assuming that Mr. Schaefer
does believe in the value of the
superior mind and the trained
intellect, can he suggest any
CIA- sponsored intellectuals,
here or elsewhere, to match
those names?
Mr. Schaefer may be right
about the high percentage of
those who support the war. I
don't know and I don't care any
more. I'll take my stand, finally,
with a Congressman who almost
ruined his political career by
expressing doubts about the
Mexican War in 1846. His speech
in the House that cost him the
next election can be found in
the Stanford Library Documents
Room. The name was Lincoln.

• Who's Dome?
Editor, The Daily:
Your lead article of July 11,
1967 states that "Century 21"
will be inaugurated with an ad
dress by Buckminster Fuller,
"the architect who designed the
Houston Astrodome." As a mat
ter of fact, the Astrodome was
designed by Ralph A. Anderson
and associates who considered,
but rejected Fuller's geodesic
dome in favor of a lamella-type
truss roof to which Dr. G. R.
Kiewitt holds the U.S. patent
rights (Business Week, Oct. 5,
1963, p. 56). As another matter
of fact, R. Buckminster Fuller is
not listed in the Directory of
American Architects.
It is true that Fuller owns
the patent rights to the geodesic
dome, but I offer the hypothesis
that this does not qualify him
for the article's label as "an ex
pert on environmental design."
Perhaps your readers can evalu
ate my hypothesis with the fol
lowing excerpts from a few of
the reviews of Fuller's recent
book, No More Secondhand God.
"He (Fuller) is a man incapable
of developing only one idea at a
time. His ideas stream from him
in clusters as he talks two,
three, or seven hours at a
stretch, one idea suggesting its
successor, one cluster of ideas
creating new clusters, some
ideas creating new clusters,
some ideas expressed in words
of his own invention, at times in

a syntax of intolerable complex
ity and almost complete opacity."
(Harold Taylor, Book Week, Jan.
26, 1964). "The architectural ex
perimenter with geodesic domes
tries his hand at prose poems.
His private jargon renders most
of what he has to say virtually
unintelligible. We vote for the
domes. He's singing songs of
God, but not for us." (Christian
Century, May 8, 1963).
On second thought, perhaps
the above quotations indicate
only that my hypothesis cannot
be refuted because of Fuller's
highly developed propensity to
obfuscate. However, based on the
quotations and my personal ex
perience, I am willing to bet that
a Stanford student will not waste
two to seven hours if he does
not attend Fuller's address.

Editor, The Daily:
Fritz Schaefer's announce
ment of the death of the anti
war movement may be, like
Mark Twain's, somewhat pre
mature.
Most of us who still speak up
are, he says, "hard core anti-
American leftists." That's famil
iar enough language to those
who remember the McCarthy
Era. One is tempted to ask
whether Mr. Schaefer is a soft
core anti-humanity rightist. And
"one of the most massive indoc
trination campaigns ever re
corded" does seem a bit thick
as a description of antiwar senti
ment. Might it not apply more
logically to the federal govern
ment's propaganda, paid for
with some of that $80 billion in
taxes that goes each year to
"defense"? We peaceniks don't
have that kind of money.
He's on firmer ground with
his description of three repu
