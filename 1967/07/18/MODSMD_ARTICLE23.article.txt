"The Government has no right
to calm our fears, any more
than it has a right to excite our
fears. . .
Jim Garrison,
Orleans Parish
District Attorney
July 15, 1967
It is now almost four years
since John F. Kennedy was
assassinated in Dallas, Texas. A
hand-picked Presidential com
mission held top secret meet
ings, denied counsel to the ac
cused, allowed his wife to testi
fy against him, suppressed rele
vant evidence, resorted to hear
say, and gave the nation a 296,-
000 word verdict against Lee
Harvey Oswald—the same ver
dict that the Dallas Police is
sued within hours of Kennedy's
death.
The Warren Commission took
a conclusion—"The shots which
killed President Kennedy and
wounded Governor Connally
were fired by Lee Harvey Os
wald."—and sought evidence to
support it. A man—albeit a dead
one—was denied his basic right
of assumed innocence pending
proven guilt to soothe the
doubts of a mourning nation.
When the Report of the Pres
ident's Commission on the As
sassination of President Ken
nedy was released to the giants
of the American news media
on Sunday evening, Sept. 27,
1964, reaction was uniform:
none questioned the conclusions
of the Warren Commission (to
question its motives bordered
on treason).
Within three days of the re
lease of the Report, Walter Lipp
mann—considered by many the
genius emeritus of the Ameri
can press—buttressed the Com
mission's findings in his nation
ally-syndicated column.
It was beyond reason, he said,
for mere "contemporary men"
to question the judgment of so
august a body as the seven-man
Warren Commission. And if
some upstarts did not want to
accept their verdict on faitl,
Lippmann assured his readers

that he—l'eminenee gris— had
read the Report over the week
end.
What probably never occurred
to Lippmann is that it was im
possible for the news media to
make a qualified judgment of
the merits of the Report. Why?
Simply because the Commis
sion had issued only the single
volume, 888-page Report—the 26
volumes of testimony and ex
hibits were published later.
Without checking this evi
dence (however questionable or
shoddily gathered) against the
Report's conclusions, no judg
ment as to its validity could be
made — not even by Walter
Lippmann.
Between then and now, Amer
icans have been promised the
last word on the assassination of
their late President in several
pseudo-scholarly works — not
ably the petit histolre of William
Manchester in his command-per
formance for Jacqueline Ken
nedy, Death of A President; and
the back-of-the press bus report
age of Charles Roberts and Pul
itzer Prize winner Merriman
Smith. Their mouthings of the
Establishment position have
only added to a state of general
confusion.
Unbiased presentation of fact
has been left to others. In the
climate of intellectual suffoca
tion nurtured by the actions of
the United States Government,
this is difficult, at best. Defend
ers of every American's basic
right to know (little-used
though it is) are called "scav
engers," "assassins," "profiteers
of human gullibility," and "polit
ical opportunists."
Taking the majority of the
knocks these days is New Or
leans District Attorney Jim Gar
rison, who was given thirty
minutes of prime time last Sat
urday night to answer one
hour's worth of questionable
charges made against him by
the National Broadcasting Com
pany. Inspired by the work of
New York attorney Mark Lane
and his Citizens Committee of
Inquiry, Garrison has directed
the first official re-examination
of the events of November 22—
despite alleged criminal inter
vention in his investigation by
an official of N.B.C. (now under
indictment), not to mention the
Central Intelligence Agency.
"If the day has come," Gar
rison said, "when the President
of the United States can be shot
down in the streets because
some people disagree with his
foreign policy; if the day has
come when the minute his heart
stops beating other considera
tions take over to conceal the
truth from the people of the
United States, then the day has
come when we have lost our
democracy."
Evidently, Garrison has found
enough of the truth to convince
a New Orleans grand jury to
hold socialite Clay Shaw and
others for a fair and open trial.
We commend Jim Garrison
and can appreciate the difficul
ties he has faced with his three
trigger theory: thousands of
Americans reason that even if
Oswald didn't shoot Kennedy,
we shouldn't seek the real kill
ers, for if a plot were uncovered
the United States would find it
self irreparably discredited in
the eyes of the world. As sub
stantiation of this attitude, we
cite the Louis Harris Poll of
February, 1967, which reported
that 59 per cent of those queriec 1
felt that the Warren Commis
sion had not divulged "the whol
story." At the same time, 58 pe
cent of those did not want th
case re-opened.
Such an attitude is hardly sui
prising thought, in a nation con
trolled largely by men who see]
to block thought and who car
not admit that the Enemy of th«
People is not the person wh>
exposes a crime, but the person
who commit it.
