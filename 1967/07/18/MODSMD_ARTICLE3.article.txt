# ASSU Uncertainty Causes 'Daily' To Change Publishers
## Voluntary Student Organization Assumes Control Of Volume 151A 
### 
Effective with this morning's edi
tion, the Stanford Dally, Volume
151 A will no longer be considered an
official publication of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(ASSU).
The change in publishers was ar
ranged at a meeting yesterday in the
office of Manager Richard A. Ware.
Present at the meeting were ASSU
Summer President Tom Forstenzer,
Stanford Daily editor for Volume 152
Kirk Hanson, and Stanford Daily
editor for Volume 151 A Robert Stone.
According to Forstenzer the
change in publishers was necessi
tated by the fact that this summer's
publication complies with none of the
ASSU By-Laws established to gov
ern the summer paper. In particular,
Forstenzer was referring to the By-
Law which states that there shall be
a weekly publication called the Stan
ford Summer Weekly.
Clear Relationship
Given the conflict between the By-
Laws and the publication, Forstenzer
felt that the ASSU might be hard
put to explain the relationship be
tween itself and the publication
should a lawsuit arise. With the
change Forstenzer feels, "we will be
able to show a clear relationship be
tween the ASSU and the Daily."

Originally the ASSU had requested
Stone to change the name of the
paper to the Stanford Summer Week
ly. Stone pointed out that such a
change would only relieve half of the
By-Law conflict, and if the ASSU
were going to be hanged, they might
as well be hanged for murder as
for robbery.
One of the problems that compli
cated the main issue was the disposi
tion of the $1,000 subsidy that the
ASSU normally provides for the
Summer Weekly. In order to re
move the money as an arguing point,
Forstenzer authorized a transfer of
the funds from the Summer Weekly
account to the account of the new
publishing organization.
Easy Way Out
The new publishing organization is
entitled, "The Stanford Daily, Vol
ume 151 A" and was formed at
Stone's suggestion as the easiest way
to satisfy the demands of all the
involved parties. The new organiza
tion was formed through the Office
of the Student Financial Manager
pending the approval of the Office of
the Dean of Students.
The primary change accomplished
in the shake-up was the formation of
the new publishing organization. Ac
cording to Stone and Ware, neither
the financial nor operational formats
of the paper have changed at all.
Stone later commented, "It is too
bad that this had to happen because
we are trying something new. It is
not our fault that the Legislature
never was able to pass on the By-
Law amendment changing the name
of the paper. But, as long as the
ASSU is happy, I guess we are too."
It was not immediately known
what effect the change would have
on the ASSU's legal position in refer
ence to the paper. Although Forsten
zer felt that the ASSU would now be
legally in the clear, both Dean of
Students Joel Smith and University
Attorney Cassius Kirk doubted that
the change had indeed achieved the
desired effect.
