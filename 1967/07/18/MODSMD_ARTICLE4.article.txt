# CHINESE ARTIST
## Chang To Explain His Art 
### 
On July 22, the Stanford community
will greet a "living Chinese painting,"
an old Chinese gentleman with a foot
long gray beard wearing Chinese robe
and shoes and carrying a curved walk
ing stick. He is Prof. Chang Tai-chien
generally recognized as the leading
Chinese painter of the past five hun
dred years.
Born in the last year of the 19th
century, taught by his mother and
other teachers, Prof. Chang was first
inspired by the creativeness of the
Tang-Sung masters. But since he has
gone on to express personal experi
ences in a distinctive and original style
of his own.
In order to build a mental reservoir
of "multi-dimentional" landscapes
Prof. Chang travels "internationally,"
from China to Japan, to India, Europe,
America and Brazil.
For about six months every year he
stays in his "Garden of the Eight
Virtues," a miniature Chinese estate
with Chinese plants and animals and
spends the rest of the year in travel.
His visit to the Bay area is the second
in two months.
His artistic life might be divided into
three stages. From his youth to 1937
he was mainly following and imitat
ing the Tang-Sung masters, especially
Shih Tao, a revolutionary painter of
the Ming royalty, who broke away
from the conventions and introduced
a new style. But after absorbing the
simplicity and serenity of the Tang
masters, the style and form of the
Sung masters and the techniques and
imagination of the Yuan and Ming
masters he began to create a new
phenomenon of Chinese painting.
In the second stage he devoted two
and a half years to study of the sacred
murals, sculptures, pictures on silk,
linen and paper, blocks and woodcuts
of the Buddhist monasteries in Tun-
Huang, province of Kansu. He made
more than two hundred copies of the
frescoes painted by the Sui (519-618
A.D.) and Tang (618-907 A.D .) masters
that remained hidden for centuries in
over five hundred caves.
The third stage started with the end
of World War 11. Travels to the West
and contacts with western artists
brought another change in his style.
He now explores new motifs, develops
new techniques and his later works
are more personal, more powerful and
more unique. The splashed-ink land
scapes and ink-monocrome plants are
full of passion, original in conception
and majestic in expression—to use a
German word, it is most Lebendig
(lively).
With this new style of painting,
Prof. Chang, though still representing
the Chinese tradition, still reflects the
nature of man in his works. In his
paintings man's nature is meaningful
in itself, thus satisfying the imaginary
and realistic criteria of the East and
the West.
In recent years Prof. Chang has held
a number of exhibitions in Taipei,
Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, Bonn and
New York. But this is the first time
that his paintings are exhibited in the
West-coast area. He will be accompan
ied to Stanford by his wife and the
Consul General of the Republic of
China, Mr. Ying-shou Che.
At the reception in the Tresidder

Memorial Union, starting at 1:30 p.m.
Prof. Michael Sullivan, Dept. of Art,
will introduce the artist. His demon
stration will be interpreted by Prof.
Pao-chen Lee of Monterey.
The Stanford Museum is exhibiting
39 of his masterpieces, both old and
new works. Also around 30 paintings
are on display at the Tresidder Union.
Both events run from July 22 to Aug.

scapes and ink-monocrome plants are
full of passion, original in conception
and majestic in expression—to use a
German word, it is most Lebendig
(lively).
With this new style of painting,
Prof. Chang, though still representing
the Chinese tradition, still reflects the
nature of man in his works. In his
paintings man's nature is meaningful
in itself, thus satisfying the imaginary
and realistic criteria of the East and
the West.
In recent years Prof. Chang has held
a number of exhibitions in Taipei,
Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, Bonn and
New York. But this is the first time
that his paintings are exhibited in the
West-coast area. He will be accompan
ied to Stanford by his wife and the
Consul General of the Republic of
China, Mr. Ying-shou Che.
At the reception in the Tresidder

Memorial Union, starting at 1:30 p.m.
Prof. Michael Sullivan, Dept. of Art,
will introduce the artist. His demon
stration will be interpreted by Prof.
Pao-chen Lee of Monterey.
The Stanford Museum is exhibiting
39 of his masterpieces, both old and
new works. Also around 30 paintings
are on display at the Tresidder Union.
Both events run from July 22 to Aug.

CHANG TAI-CHIEN


Lotus-With Splashed-Ink
On July 22, the Stanford community
will greet a "living Chinese painting,"
an old Chinese gentleman with a foot
long gray beard wearing Chinese robe
and shoes and carrying a curved walk
ing stick. He is Prof. Chang Tai-chien
generally recognized as the leading
Chinese painter of the past five hun
dred years.
Born in the last year of the 19th
century, taught by his mother and
other teachers, Prof. Chang was first
inspired by the creativeness of the
Tang-Sung masters. But since he has
gone on to express personal experi
ences in a distinctive and original style
of his own.
In order to build a mental reservoir
of "multi-dimentional" landscapes
Prof. Chang travels "internationally,"
from China to Japan, to India, Europe,
America and Brazil.
For about six months every year he
stays in his "Garden of the Eight
Virtues," a miniature Chinese estate
with Chinese plants and animals and
spends the rest of the year in travel.
His visit to the Bay area is the second
in two months.
His artistic life might be divided into
three stages. From his youth to 1937
he was mainly following and imitat
ing the Tang-Sung masters, especially
Shih Tao, a revolutionary painter of
the Ming royalty, who broke away
from the conventions and introduced
a new style. But after absorbing the
simplicity and serenity of the Tang
masters, the style and form of the
Sung masters and the techniques and
imagination of the Yuan and Ming
masters he began to create a new
phenomenon of Chinese painting.
In the second stage he devoted two
and a half years to study of the sacred
murals, sculptures, pictures on silk,
linen and paper, blocks and woodcuts
of the Buddhist monasteries in Tun-
Huang, province of Kansu. He made
more than two hundred copies of the
frescoes painted by the Sui (519-618
A.D.) and Tang (618-907 A.D .) masters
that remained hidden for centuries in
over five hundred caves.
The third stage started with the end
of World War 11. Travels to the West
and contacts with western artists
brought another change in his style.
He now explores new motifs, develops
new techniques and his later works
are more personal, more powerful and
more unique. The splashed-ink land
scapes and ink-monocrome plants are
full of passion, original in conception
and majestic in expression—to use a
German word, it is most Lebendig
(lively).
