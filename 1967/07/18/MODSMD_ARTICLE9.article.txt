# Unique Child Clinic Proposed
## 
### 
Creation of an "educational
clinic," to dianose problems and
prescribe treatment for individ
ual children, was suggested to
the closing session of a Stanford
conference on urban education
Friday by H. Thomas James,
dean of the Stanford School of
Education.
"Th e treatment," h e said,
"might be as simple as adjusting
some individual or school char
acteristic, leaving the child free
to pursue his studies in the tra
ditional school setting, or it
might be as drastic as proscrib
ing that he drop out of school
to be exposed to some new insti
tutional service yet to be in
vented."
The, function of the school
among its other characteristics,
is custodial, Dean James pointed
out, a safe place for a child to
be while the urban world goes
about its daily business.
Platonic Notion
If the "educational clinic" pre
scribed that the child be left

alone to pursue his enlightened
self-interests, "we would at long
last begin to realize the platonic
notion of education, where the
city and all its rich resources be
comes the classroom and pro
vides the curriculum, and the
ends of education pursued by the
individual are also the goals of
the society. . ~" Dean James told
the gathering of educators and
officials.
Another function of the educa
tional clinic, he suggested, would
be a periodic review of the stu
dent's record, attending to the
process by which he acquires an
education, enhancing the contri
butions and removing the ob
stacles.
Both of these broad proposals,

the custodial and the treatment,
are being provided in the public
school system now through "the
personal services of relatively
expensive, highly-trained pro
fessionals."
This "irrational and ineffici
ent" arrangement is illustrated
by the fact that in most schools,
those who need the most help
receive it the least, because their
attendance and performance rec
ords are in the lower five per
cent of the class, the Stanford
dean said.
"The achievement record of
these two groups (high and low
performers) would almost cer
tainly remain the same if their
attendance records were re
versed," Prof. James declared.
