# Japanese Folk Troupe To Perform At Geary
## 
### 
The Odori Festival of Japan,
which makes its first appear
ance in San Francisco at the
Geary on July 24 for a one week
engagement, was formed in
1963 through the cooperative ef
forts of the Japanese Govern
ment and the International Art
ists Center of Japan.
Though Japan itself is rela
tively small, within its narrow
bounds are scattered a vast num
ber of native folk dances brim

ming with variety, and seldom
seen outside of the country.
Upon the troupe's formation,
the director enlisted the aid
of leading specialists among both
scholars and performers to sur
vey and select original folk
dances and to adapt them for
theatre presentation. Great ef
fort went into the preservation
of authenticity to insure that
the dances and music be per
formed in their true form.
The dancers who appear here
have been hand-picked from the
fields of classical and modern
Japanese dance and ballet, while
the musicians and singers are
all recognized as experts. As in
the world of folkloric art, the
Japanese performances are
based on a way of life and por
tray a fundamental simplicity
and elegance within the frame
work of professional theatre en
tertainment.
Seats go on sale at the Geary
Box office Monday, July 17. Mati
nee days are Wednesday and
Saturday at 2:30. The evening
performances (Monday through
Saturday) are at 8:30.
