# Open Letter
## Dear Mr. Fitts 
### 
Dear Mr. Fitts:
I appreciate the time and effort you devoted in writing me your
recent letter. It is always exciting to hear from long lost friends.
However, I believe that you must have written your letter with
out much serious thought. It puzzles me that your "challenge" was
not issued as either an "invitation" or a "proposal", both of which
sound more civilized.
It is not apparent to me that I have anything to defend or that
anything as grand as a public debate is warranted. I, therefore,
invite you to call me at 257-3469 any time after 6:00 p.m. at which
time we can arrange a meeting for the purpose of discussing your
misunderstanding.
Sincerely,
J. H. LANE
