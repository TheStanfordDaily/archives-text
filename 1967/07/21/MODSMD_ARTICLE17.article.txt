## Please, No Pin-The-Donkey Parties

Editor, The Dally:
A word of caution to Mr. Marti
concerning his letter in the July
14 edition: Watch your tongue,
Mr. Marti. "Pin-the-donkey"
parties atop that great bastion
of Republicanism, Hoover Tow
er? "Feed - the * peanuts - to •
the - elephant" parties perhaps
but "pin - the • donkey" parties
—never! And he a student of

I am impressed by J. H.

is being attacked and robbed. It
is inspiring to see concerned
neighbors, U.S., Philippines,
Thailand, New Zealand, South
Korea, all joined to help the
brave Vietnamese (South, that
is) fight the ... By the way,
what ever happened to that
huge army on which we spent
billions of dollars and over 10
years of time training, equip
ping, and indoctrinating?
Well, we know the Vietnamese
are peaceful, disorganized, and
not well adapted to warfare . . .
fight the dreaded Communism?
That can't be right. Communism
is an ideology and we all know
you can't fight an ideology with
bombs and bullets.
Let's try ... to fight the

they live in the south too . . .
who are getting help from the
North Vietnamese who have no
Good Neighbors to defend them
from the attacks of the Good
Neighbors who are helping the
South Vietnamese to set up a
democratic government which
they are not ready for because
that's why we did not allow them
to hold free elections in 1955
which is why the Viet Cong is
fighting the Good Neighbors in
the first place ...????
Please Mr. Lane, once more
from the top. What are we do

all we are killing is Vietnamese

when all we are aiming at is
Communism?

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. J. H. Lane's paleolithic
pap bemoaning the alleged
abuses of Free Speech com
mitted by those protesting the
Vietnam War ignores the veri
ties behind the uproar.
Toward these verities Mr.
Lane by self-admission professes
profound unconcern. "The causes
of the fad (Free Speech), don't
interest me." Possibly his un
conern masks a high degree of
historical ignorance of the ori
gins and development of the
Vietnam conflict.
Who has sent a half million
troops to Vietnam, the protest
ers? Or were these troops sent
by a government whose foreign
policy has been bankrupt for
the past half decade? Is the
Hanoi government — like the
government of Great Britain
during 1940 — refusing to nego
tiate a de facto surrender be
cause it is aware of the exis
tence of small loci of domestic
opposition to the policies of its
major military adversary? Or is
the government of Ho Chi Minh
—again like the Churchill gov
ernment during 1940 — simply
too proud and too furious with
its enemy to even consider nego
tiation with an adversary en
gaged in an attempt to obliterate
its territories with bombs?
Is Mr. Lane aware of the re
ports of Felix Greene written in
North Vietnam for the San Fran
cisco Chronicle that Hanoi is
quite cognizant of the miniscule
dimensions of the anti-war pro
test movement in the United
States?
To believe that the vociferous
opposition of the protestors to
our asinine military adventure

in Vietnam is somehow respon
sible for the prolongation of
what is now a twenty year old
conflict is simply naive. To blame
our military failures in Vietnam
upon those opposed to the poli
cies which are responsible for
those failures in the first place
is as cheap a demagogic trick
as the Nazis employed during
the 1920's when they blamed the
German defeat in World War
I upon domestic opposition to
the war which had allegedly
"stabbed Germany in the back."

• Baa!
Editor, The Daily:
Does anyone think for him
self any more? I am astounded
by the number of people who
rely on critics, book reviewers,
columnists, politicians and well
known intellectuals to do their
thinking for them.
The articles on page 4 of Tues
day's Daiiy were all largely
concerned with second-hand in
formation: criticism of critics
of the Warren Report; letters:
"I'll take my stand with Jean-
Paul Sartre (etc.)" and "Per
haps readers can evaluate my
hypothesis (about B. Fuller)
with the following excerpts from
from the reviews of Fuller's
latest book ..." Last week one
writer seemed to be basing his
support for the war on what
other people thought.
I wonder how many Ameri
cans feel their dislike for Com
munism on their personal re
search or reading first-hand re
ports and studies of the theory
and practice of Communism of
life in Russia. How many mere
ly let the biased verbal diarhhea
and cocktail party circles from
their idle minds? How many of
the millions who say "Commu
nism was o.k. in theory when
it originated but now the sums

are all distorted and corrupted"
know what they're talking
about?
I fear William Lederer was
very close to the dangerous
truth when he branded the U.S.
"A nation of sheep."
LEO TOSCANELLI
• More Domes
Editor, The Daily:
I must come to the defense of
Buckminster Fuller after Jerry
Hollenhorst's letter to the edit
or (Tues., July 18).
Consider first his geodesic
domes. There are now more than
3,000 of them in 50 countries.
They range in size and use from
the world's biggest train shed
to his own small home. They
can be carried everywhere by
helicopter, are strong enough
to stand natural disasters, and
can be made from nearly any
thing, including paper. I don't
know what the Houston astro
dome has to recommend it, but
of his domes, Fuller says, "They
average three percent of the
weight of the materials of the
best alternative engineering
strategy."
Consider also his proposal to
put a dome over New York's
Manhatten Island. Two miles in
diameter, it would provide natu
ral] air conditioning and an um
brella against storms; he says
it would take less steel than an
ocean liner.
Also, in 1927, he designed a
ten-story building to be carried
by a dirigible and planted, tree
like, in a bomb crater.
And Mr. Hollenhorst claims
Fuller is not qualified as an "ex
pert on environmental design."
Then who is?
I would also like to add that
the seven hours I spent listen
ing to Fuller talk (in two ses
sions) were among the best
seven hours of my life. I caught
a glimpse of ideas that could

only have come from the mind
of a genius. People who had
driven over 300 miles just to
hear him joined the rest of the
packed house in giving him a
standing ovation.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. J. H. Lane's paleolithic
pap bemoaning the alleged
abuses of Free Speech com
mitted by those protesting the
Vietnam War ignores the veri
ties behind the uproar.
Toward these verities Mr.
Lane by self-admission professes
profound unconcern. "The causes
of the fad (Free Speech), don't
interest me." Possibly his un
conern masks a high degree of
historical ignorance of the ori
gins and development of the
Vietnam conflict.
Who has sent a half million
troops to Vietnam, the protest
ers? Or were these troops sent
by a government whose foreign
policy has been bankrupt for
the past half decade? Is the
Hanoi government — like the
government of Great Britain
during 1940 — refusing to nego
tiate a de facto surrender be
cause it is aware of the exis
tence of small loci of domestic
opposition to the policies of its
major military adversary? Or is
the government of Ho Chi Minh
—again like the Churchill gov
ernment during 1940 — simply
too proud and too furious with
its enemy to even consider nego
tiation with an adversary en
gaged in an attempt to obliterate
its territories with bombs?
Is Mr. Lane aware of the re
ports of Felix Greene written in
North Vietnam for the San Fran
cisco Chronicle that Hanoi is
quite cognizant of the miniscule
dimensions of the anti-war pro
test movement in the United
States?
To believe that the vociferous
opposition of the protestors to
our asinine military adventure

in Vietnam is somehow respon
sible for the prolongation of
what is now a twenty year old
conflict is simply naive. To blame
our military failures in Vietnam
upon those opposed to the poli
cies which are responsible for
those failures in the first place
is as cheap a demagogic trick
as the Nazis employed during
the 1920's when they blamed the
German defeat in World War
I upon domestic opposition to
the war which had allegedly
"stabbed Germany in the back."

• More Domes
Editor, The Daily:
I must come to the defense of
Buckminster Fuller after Jerry
Hollenhorst's letter to the edit
or (Tues., July 18).
Consider first his geodesic
domes. There are now more than
3,000 of them in 50 countries.
They range in size and use from
the world's biggest train shed
to his own small home. They
can be carried everywhere by
helicopter, are strong enough
to stand natural disasters, and
can be made from nearly any
thing, including paper. I don't
know what the Houston astro
dome has to recommend it, but
of his domes, Fuller says, "They
average three percent of the
weight of the materials of the
best alternative engineering
strategy."
Consider also his proposal to
put a dome over New York's
Manhatten Island. Two miles in
diameter, it would provide natu
ral] air conditioning and an um
brella against storms; he says
it would take less steel than an
ocean liner.
Also, in 1927, he designed a
ten-story building to be carried
by a dirigible and planted, tree
like, in a bomb crater.
And Mr. Hollenhorst claims
Fuller is not qualified as an "ex
pert on environmental design."
Then who is?
I would also like to add that
the seven hours I spent listen
ing to Fuller talk (in two ses
sions) were among the best
seven hours of my life. I caught
a glimpse of ideas that could

only have come from the mind
of a genius. People who had
driven over 300 miles just to
hear him joined the rest of the
packed house in giving him a
standing ovation.

I wonder how many Ameri

• More Domes
Editor, The Daily:
I must come to the defense of
Buckminster Fuller after Jerry
Hollenhorst's letter to the edit
or (Tues., July 18).
Consider first his geodesic
domes. There are now more than
3,000 of them in 50 countries.
They range in size and use from
the world's biggest train shed
to his own small home. They
can be carried everywhere by
helicopter, are strong enough
to stand natural disasters, and
can be made from nearly any
thing, including paper. I don't
know what the Houston astro
dome has to recommend it, but
of his domes, Fuller says, "They
average three percent of the
weight of the materials of the
best alternative engineering
strategy."
Consider also his proposal to
put a dome over New York's
Manhatten Island. Two miles in
diameter, it would provide natu
ral] air conditioning and an um
brella against storms; he says
it would take less steel than an
ocean liner.
Also, in 1927, he designed a
ten-story building to be carried
by a dirigible and planted, tree
like, in a bomb crater.
And Mr. Hollenhorst claims
Fuller is not qualified as an "ex
pert on environmental design."
Then who is?
I would also like to add that
the seven hours I spent listen
ing to Fuller talk (in two ses
sions) were among the best
seven hours of my life. I caught
a glimpse of ideas that could

only have come from the mind
of a genius. People who had
driven over 300 miles just to
hear him joined the rest of the
packed house in giving him a
standing ovation.

Mr. J. H. Lane's paleolithic
pap bemoaning the alleged
abuses of Free Speech com
mitted by those protesting the
Vietnam War ignores the veri
ties behind the uproar.
Toward these verities Mr.
Lane by self-admission professes
profound unconcern. "The causes
of the fad (Free Speech), don't
interest me." Possibly his un
conern masks a high degree of
historical ignorance of the ori
gins and development of the
Vietnam conflict.
Who has sent a half million
troops to Vietnam, the protest
ers? Or were these troops sent
by a government whose foreign
policy has been bankrupt for
the past half decade? Is the
Hanoi government — like the
government of Great Britain
during 1940 — refusing to nego
tiate a de facto surrender be
cause it is aware of the exis
tence of small loci of domestic
opposition to the policies of its
major military adversary? Or is
the government of Ho Chi Minh
—again like the Churchill gov
ernment during 1940 — simply
too proud and too furious with
its enemy to even consider nego
tiation with an adversary en
gaged in an attempt to obliterate
its territories with bombs?
Is Mr. Lane aware of the re
ports of Felix Greene written in
North Vietnam for the San Fran
cisco Chronicle that Hanoi is
quite cognizant of the miniscule
dimensions of the anti-war pro
test movement in the United
States?
To believe that the vociferous

our asinine military adventure

in Vietnam is somehow respon

Editor, The Daily:
I must come to the defense of
Buckminster Fuller after Jerry
Hollenhorst's letter to the edit
or (Tues., July 18).
Consider first his geodesic
domes. There are now more than
3,000 of them in 50 countries.
They range in size and use from
the world's biggest train shed
to his own small home. They
can be carried everywhere by
helicopter, are strong enough
to stand natural disasters, and
can be made from nearly any
thing, including paper. I don't
know what the Houston astro
dome has to recommend it, but
of his domes, Fuller says, "They
average three percent of the
weight of the materials of the
best alternative engineering
strategy."
Consider also his proposal to
put a dome over New York's
Manhatten Island. Two miles in
diameter, it would provide natu
ral] air conditioning and an um
brella against storms; he says
it would take less steel than an
ocean liner.
Also, in 1927, he designed a
ten-story building to be carried
by a dirigible and planted, tree
like, in a bomb crater.
And Mr. Hollenhorst claims
Fuller is not qualified as an "ex
pert on environmental design."
Then who is?
I would also like to add that
the seven hours I spent listen
ing to Fuller talk (in two ses
sions) were among the best
seven hours of my life. I caught
a glimpse of ideas that could

only have come from the mind
of a genius. People who had
driven over 300 miles just to
hear him joined the rest of the
packed house in giving him a
standing ovation.

Editor, The Dally:
A word of caution to Mr. Marti
concerning his letter in the July
14 edition: Watch your tongue,
Mr. Marti. "Pin-the-donkey"
parties atop that great bastion
of Republicanism, Hoover Tow
er? "Feed - the * peanuts - to •
the - elephant" parties perhaps
but "pin - the • donkey" parties
—never! And he a student of
Political Science. Horrors!

Editor, The Daily:
I am impressed by J. H.
Lane's analogy of good neigh
bors springing to the defense
of a weak neighbor whose home
is being attacked and robbed. It
is inspiring to see concerned
neighbors, U.S., Philippines,
Thailand, New Zealand, South
Korea, all joined to help the
brave Vietnamese (South, that
is) fight the ... By the way,
what ever happened to that
huge army on which we spent
billions of dollars and over 10
years of time training, equip
ping, and indoctrinating?
Well, we know the Vietnamese
are peaceful, disorganized, and
not well adapted to warfare . . .
fight the dreaded Communism?
That can't be right. Communism
is an ideology and we all know
you can't fight an ideology with
bombs and bullets.
Let's try ... to fight the
tough, ferocious Viet Cong Viet
namese who are invading ... No,
they live in the south too . . .
who are getting help from the
North Vietnamese who have no
Good Neighbors to defend them
from the attacks of the Good
Neighbors who are helping the
South Vietnamese to set up a
democratic government which
they are not ready for because
that's why we did not allow them
to hold free elections in 1955
which is why the Viet Cong is
fighting the Good Neighbors in
the first place ...????
Please Mr. Lane, once more
from the top. What are we do
ing in Vietnam and how come
all we are killing is Vietnamese

when all we are aiming at is
Communism?

• Veritas
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. J. H. Lane's paleolithic
pap bemoaning the alleged
abuses of Free Speech com
mitted by those protesting the
Vietnam War ignores the veri
ties behind the uproar.
Toward these verities Mr.
Lane by self-admission professes
profound unconcern. "The causes
of the fad (Free Speech), don't
interest me." Possibly his un
conern masks a high degree of
historical ignorance of the ori
gins and development of the
Vietnam conflict.
Who has sent a half million
troops to Vietnam, the protest
ers? Or were these troops sent
by a government whose foreign
policy has been bankrupt for
the past half decade? Is the
Hanoi government — like the
government of Great Britain
during 1940 — refusing to nego
tiate a de facto surrender be
cause it is aware of the exis
tence of small loci of domestic
opposition to the policies of its
major military adversary? Or is
the government of Ho Chi Minh
—again like the Churchill gov
ernment during 1940 — simply
too proud and too furious with
its enemy to even consider nego
tiation with an adversary en
gaged in an attempt to obliterate
its territories with bombs?
Is Mr. Lane aware of the re
ports of Felix Greene written in
North Vietnam for the San Fran
cisco Chronicle that Hanoi is
quite cognizant of the miniscule
dimensions of the anti-war pro
test movement in the United
States?
To believe that the vociferous
opposition of the protestors to
our asinine military adventure

in Vietnam is somehow respon
sible for the prolongation of
what is now a twenty year old
conflict is simply naive. To blame
our military failures in Vietnam
upon those opposed to the poli
cies which are responsible for
those failures in the first place
is as cheap a demagogic trick
as the Nazis employed during
the 1920's when they blamed the
German defeat in World War
I upon domestic opposition to
the war which had allegedly
"stabbed Germany in the back."

• Baa!
Editor, The Daily:
Does anyone think for him
self any more? I am astounded
by the number of people who
rely on critics, book reviewers,
columnists, politicians and well
known intellectuals to do their
thinking for them.
The articles on page 4 of Tues
day's Daiiy were all largely
concerned with second-hand in
formation: criticism of critics
of the Warren Report; letters:
"I'll take my stand with Jean-
Paul Sartre (etc.)" and "Per
haps readers can evaluate my
hypothesis (about B. Fuller)
with the following excerpts from
from the reviews of Fuller's
latest book ..." Last week one
writer seemed to be basing his
support for the war on what
other people thought.
I wonder how many Ameri
cans feel their dislike for Com
munism on their personal re
search or reading first-hand re
ports and studies of the theory
and practice of Communism of
life in Russia. How many mere
ly let the biased verbal diarhhea
and cocktail party circles from
their idle minds? How many of
the millions who say "Commu
nism was o.k. in theory when
it originated but now the sums

are all distorted and corrupted"
know what they're talking
about?
I fear William Lederer was
very close to the dangerous
truth when he branded the U.S.
"A nation of sheep."
