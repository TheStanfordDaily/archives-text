## Is The Draft All Bad? 
### J.H. Lane 
It is curious that college stu
dents are so vociferous in their
denunciation of the draft while,
as a group, they need worry
about it the least. And if a col
lege student does get drafted, he
is reasonably assured of spend
ing his active duty in close prox
imity to a typewriter or some
thing similarly nonviolent and
probably never getting even the
opportunity to fire a shot in
anger.
The only alternative to the
draft that I have been able to
glean from those opposing the
draft is to pay the military
enough so that volunteers would
be sufficient to fill the manpower
requirements. This does sound
reasonable. Indeed, if there were
enough volunteers, there would
be no requirement for draftees.
The present system allows for
this. It also allows for rapid
expansion of the military forces.
But are there not advantages
to having a fluid population of
draftees in the military? Most
of the positions in the military

call for relatively low ranking
personnel. Not many career per
sonnel want to remain low rank
ing. Also, many of these jobs re
quire no special talent, just the
presence of a body. Under the
present system, due to the large
amount of personnel turbulence
created by the draft, a man is
not required to perform an un
challenging job for any exten
sive period.
Under an all volunteer sys
tem, the military would tend to
grow old. The positions filled by
men who have three years and
less service are also the posi
tions requiring strength and
stamina. If the personnel turn
over created by the draft were
eliminated, the military would
lose the large influx of youth it
now enjoys.
A survey was taken among
military officers serving their ob
ligated term of duty. Over forty
percent responded that if it had
not been for the draft, they
would not have come into the
military. How many college

graduates would want to accept
a starting base pay of $304 a
month? How much would that
amount have to be increased
before you would be interested?
And then consider the type of
life you would be accepting.
Those who accept it now do so
because they like it—not for the
money.
Draftee Gains
The draftee gains something
from his experience with the
military. In many cases he has
no skill, but is taught one by
the military. The military re
quires almost every skill and
craft a civilian community does,
and it has to train men to per
form them.
A man in the military learns
to accept discipline. He learns
the limits to which he can push
himself. And he learns that he
must meet obligations. In short,
the military provides him with
experience.
Any man is a better man after
helping to guard his country and
his way of life.

of the positions in the military

call for relatively low ranking
personnel. Not many career per
sonnel want to remain low rank
ing. Also, many of these jobs re
quire no special talent, just the
presence of a body. Under the
present system, due to the large
amount of personnel turbulence
created by the draft, a man is
not required to perform an un
challenging job for any exten
sive period.
Under an all volunteer sys
tem, the military would tend to
grow old. The positions filled by
men who have three years and
less service are also the posi
tions requiring strength and
stamina. If the personnel turn
over created by the draft were
eliminated, the military would
lose the large influx of youth it
now enjoys.
A survey was taken among
military officers serving their ob
ligated term of duty. Over forty
percent responded that if it had
not been for the draft, they
would not have come into the
military. How many college

graduates would want to accept
a starting base pay of $304 a
month? How much would that
amount have to be increased
before you would be interested?
And then consider the type of
life you would be accepting.
Those who accept it now do so
because they like it—not for the
money.
Draftee Gains
The draftee gains something
from his experience with the
military. In many cases he has
no skill, but is taught one by
the military. The military re
quires almost every skill and
craft a civilian community does,
and it has to train men to per
form them.
A man in the military learns
to accept discipline. He learns
the limits to which he can push
himself. And he learns that he
must meet obligations. In short,
the military provides him with
experience.
Any man is a better man after
helping to guard his country and
his way of life.
It is curious that college stu
dents are so vociferous in their
denunciation of the draft while,
as a group, they need worry
about it the least. And if a col
lege student does get drafted, he
is reasonably assured of spend
ing his active duty in close prox
imity to a typewriter or some
thing similarly nonviolent and
probably never getting even the
opportunity to fire a shot in
anger.
The only alternative to the
draft that I have been able to
glean from those opposing the
draft is to pay the military
enough so that volunteers would
be sufficient to fill the manpower
requirements. This does sound
reasonable. Indeed, if there were
enough volunteers, there would
be no requirement for draftees.
The present system allows for
this. It also allows for rapid
expansion of the military forces.
But are there not advantages
to having a fluid population of
draftees in the military? Most
