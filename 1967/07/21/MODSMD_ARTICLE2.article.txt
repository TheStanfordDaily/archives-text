# SU Plans Crack-Down On Dogs
## 
### 
Dogs may be required to live off
campus in the near future if Univer
sity Health Officer Hal W. Wilson has
his way.
Wilson first made the proposal
March 16, 1967, but the issue didn't
become urgent until yesterday noon.
It all started with a visit from The
Law.
The Daily pieced the story together
this way: Political Science graduate
student, Norman Nie, and his eight
months-pregnant wife were walking
toward Tresidder Union with their
pet Golden Retriever.
Suddenly, a plain clothes Santa
Clara County dog catcher appeared
on the scene, threw a rope around the
dog's neck, and began to drag him
away.
Mrs. Nie saw the struggle first and
raced off to find out who was "steal
ing" her dog. She reached the dog
and tried to free him, but the dog
catcher stepped in and pushed her to
the pavement.
Next, Nie himself noticed the melee
and sped to his wife's side. A scuffle
ensued, and the Nies finally found
out the identity of the thief: "Don't
mess with me," he warned. "I'm the
law."
By day's end, Nie had instituted

proceedings involved in an assault
and battery charge.
The original Wilson proposal in
cluded the following provisions:
1) Dogs should not be permitted
in the buildings or on the grounds of
any University residence.
2) The Police Department would be
provided with equipment for captur
ing and confining dogs until the Coun
ty Health Department can transport
them to animal shelters.
3) Rules less stringent than those
of the County code should not be
permitted.


While old-fashioned fireplugs may receive the unqualified approval of canines,
they were found to be terribly time-consuming for five Stanford student engi
neers who devised the quik-lok connection pictured above.
