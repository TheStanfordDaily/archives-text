# Quinn, Gleason, Rooney To Star In TMU Showing Of 'Requiem'
## 
### MAC McCONNELL 
The TMU-International Center Sum
mer Film Series focuses on Requiem
For a Heavyweight this Friday eve
ning, with showings both in the Union
and the I-Center courtyard. Union
showings will be at 7:30 and 8:30 p.m.,
followed by a 9:30 showing at the
I-Center.
Produced in 1962, Requiem stars An
thony Quinn, Jackie Gleason, Mickey
Rooney, and Julie Harris, a montage
of characters extraordinarily balanced
by Dir. Ralph Nelson. Quinn, who has
played a baftlingly diverse number of

roles through the years, maintains his
portrayal of a washed-up punchy fight
er with a plodding and piteous con
stancy. Only perhaps in Zorba did he
come as close to unifying character
and actor, and even without the fine
support given him, the film could stand
on his performance alone. Given the
fact that both Gleason and Rooney
must always transcend Andy Hardy
and Ralph Kramden in any serious
role, they both nevertheless add im
measurably to the production. The
New York Times comments on Re
quiem: "A serious, incisive drama that

pulls no punches in its low-keyed ex
posure of its pitiable has-been hero
and the sleazy, harried side-kicks who
share his sweat-stained and blood
stained world . . . hits hard and un
compromisingly at man's inhumanity
to man."
The I-Center courtyard is particu
larly pleasant to watch a film in, and
coffee is served during the show. If
you can wait until the 9:30 showing
to see it there, you should. Tickets, at
50c, are available at the Tresidder box
office. Due to the limited capacity of
the I-Center, they should be purchased
in advance of show time.
