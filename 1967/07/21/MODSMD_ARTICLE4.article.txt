Student Executives
The SES is a University-wide re
view of all aspects of Stanford, includ
ing undergraduate and graduate pro
grams, residences, policy advising and
counseling. Last January, President
Wallace Sterling published a letter in
ThÂ« Daily soliciting student applica
tions for the study's executive com
mittee membership.
Sterling invited, "the widest pos
sible student interest and participa
tion in this important study, which
will do much to influence Stanford's
academic programs."

Applicants submitted brief state
ments covering their personal quali
fications and the problems they iden
tified as important to the review. The
statements served as the basis for
selection of a small group of students
to be interviewed for student positions
on the committee. Since the study is
to be completed in about two years,
applications were limited to those
students attending Stanford at least
through June 1968.
Controversy
Considerable controversy surround
ed the appointment of students. In
January a student petition was circu
lated asking that the selections be
made by a committee of two admini
strators and two students, rather than
solely by the Administration.
Professor Packer, however, main
tained that "the qualities of interest,
talent, and critical intelligence that we
want in the student members is not to
be determined by a majority vote." In
February five professors and three
students were named by the Admini
stration to the Steering Committee.
The Steering Committee established
the committees listed above and is
working on an agenda for the coming
year.
The SES is not the first review of
Stanford's educational programs. The
last comprehensive study was done
in 1954-56, focusing, however, on the
undergraduate area. In that study, 19
undergraduates chosen by the Asso
ciated Students served as an advisory
committee; unlike SES, none were
on the executive committee.
