## Dixie Sounds To Fill Jazz Tent 
### 
The Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
internationally known for its authen
tic, old-time New Orleans jazz style,
will open the jazz series of the Stan
ford Summer Festival Monday.
Performances will be held nightly
through July 29 from 8:30 to 12:30 in

a jazz tent erected next to Memoral
Hall.
Tickets for the performances will
be on a first-come-first-served basis
and are good for any night — as long
as seats are available. To counteract
this problem, Summer Festival man

agers suggest that those who have
already bought tickets attend the
shows early in the week to be assured

Preservation Hall was founded in
1961 to give New Orleans audiences
the opportunity to re-experience the
original jazz form as played by native
musicians who had kept its traditions
alive.
Larry Borenstein, a New Orleans
art dealer, established the center in his
French Quarter gallery originally as
an open rehearsal hall with a record
ing venture in mind. Shortly after
wards, the Hall was taken over by
Sandra and Allan Jaffee who turned
it into what it is today.
Performances at the Hall empha
size listening — no dancing or liquor
is permitted. In the admis
sion was free and the musicians were
paid according to the generosity of
their audiences contributions to a
kitty. Today there is a one dollar ad
mission price. Players can also aug
ment their salary by playing requests
from the audience — one dollar for
traditional, two dollars for "others"
and five dollars for the popular 'The
Saints Go Marching In."
After establishing its reputation in
the New Orleans area, the Hall widen
ed its range of audiences through
recordings, personal appearances
throughout the country and television
performances.
Featured at the Summer Festival
will be Billie and DeDe Pierce and the
other five members of their combo.
DeDe, of Creole descent, plays the
coronet and sings. Originally a brick
mason by day and a coronetist by
night, blindness from glaucoma al
lowed him the time to continue with
the coronet and achieve the heights he
has reached today. His best songs are
in Gombo, Negro-French dialect of
Louisiana.
His wife, Billie, is a blues singer and
piano player. She once accompanied
the famous Bessie Smith.
Other members of the combo are
Albert Warner, trombone; Cie Frazier,
drummer; George Lewis, clarinet;
Lewis Nelson, trombone; Narvin Kim

Preservation Hall Jazz Band
The Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
internationally known for its authen
tic, old-time New Orleans jazz style,
will open the jazz series of the Stan
ford Summer Festival Monday.
Performances will be held nightly
through July 29 from 8:30 to 12:30 in

a jazz tent erected next to Memoral
Hall.
Tickets for the performances will
be on a first-come-first-served basis
and are good for any night — as long
as seats are available. To counteract
this problem, Summer Festival man

agers suggest that those who have
already bought tickets attend the
shows early in the week to be assured
of a seat.
Preservation Hall was founded in
1961 to give New Orleans audiences
the opportunity to re-experience the
original jazz form as played by native
musicians who had kept its traditions
alive.
Larry Borenstein, a New Orleans
art dealer, established the center in his
French Quarter gallery originally as
an open rehearsal hall with a record
ing venture in mind. Shortly after
wards, the Hall was taken over by
Sandra and Allan Jaffee who turned
it into what it is today.
Performances at the Hall empha
size listening — no dancing or liquor
is permitted. In the admis
sion was free and the musicians were
paid according to the generosity of
their audiences contributions to a
kitty. Today there is a one dollar ad
mission price. Players can also aug
ment their salary by playing requests
from the audience — one dollar for
traditional, two dollars for "others"
and five dollars for the popular 'The
Saints Go Marching In."
After establishing its reputation in
the New Orleans area, the Hall widen
ed its range of audiences through
recordings, personal appearances
throughout the country and television
performances.
Featured at the Summer Festival
will be Billie and DeDe Pierce and the
other five members of their combo.
DeDe, of Creole descent, plays the
coronet and sings. Originally a brick
mason by day and a coronetist by
night, blindness from glaucoma al
lowed him the time to continue with
the coronet and achieve the heights he
has reached today. His best songs are
in Gombo, Negro-French dialect of
Louisiana.
His wife, Billie, is a blues singer and
piano player. She once accompanied
the famous Bessie Smith.
Other members of the combo are
Albert Warner, trombone; Cie Frazier,
drummer; George Lewis, clarinet;
Lewis Nelson, trombone; Narvin Kim
ball, banjo; and Chester Zardis, bass.
