# DRAMA REVIEW
## ACT's 'Our Town' Shines; 'Lace' Fades Out 
### ROBERT E. STONE ROBERT E. STONE 
Thornton Wilder's Our Town is
the story of every small town in the
United States; a story of birth and
life and death. If there is one word
that can be used to describe the
play it is "typical."
The power of Our Town is, how
ever, its ery banality. When Wilder
wrote it in 1934, the play must have
been very fresh and alive. The pas
sage of time has reduced it to a
series of cliches. As is often the case,
however, cliches have a way of say
ing something that can not be ex
pressed in any other way. The clich
es of Our Town possess this quality.
The story of Our Town, Grover's
Corners, New Hampshire, is told by
the stage manager. It is his job to
relate and correlate what happens
there, to give the inside story as an
insider sees it, to make the trivial
actions of everyday life meaningful.
The story is carried out by two
families, the Gibbs and the Webbs,
the town doctor and editor respec
tively. Through the members of
these two families the traits of Gro
ver's Corners — the back-yard gos
sip fence, the worried wife, the
bright daughter and the lazy son,
love and marriage, the church choir

—come to be known.
Each member of the two families
portrays a person with something to
add to the story of Our Town, but
the actors must be careful not to let
their stories interfere with the larger
story of the town. It is here that the
stage manager is vitally important
as he keeps the play moving, run
ning people on and off stage, and
changing the scene with a quip or
a series of lines of his own. Richard
Dysart managed to accomplish all of
this while maintaining a smooth and
professional style not unlike that of
a professional story-teller.
Josephine Nichols and Carol Tei
tel performed the roles of Mrs. Gibbs
and Mrs. Webb flawlessly and great
credit is due them. It is not easy to
look like you have one foot in the
grave and tell your husband that he
should get away for a rest. Nor is it
easy to stand up at your daughter's
wedding and announce, "It's cruel
sending them into marriage this
way; I hope her girlfriends have told
her something about it."
If a part of Our Town must stand
out from the rest of the play it is
the third act in which life is seen
through the eyes of th e d e a d .
The conclusions that are drawn by

the departed are frightening. To
hear that life goes hy so fast that no
one takes the time to watch it go is
not particularly pleasant, but the al
ternative life of the dead, who do
nothing but sit and wait for that
"special somthing," is not too pleas
ant either.
Our Town is living drama; a time
less work that brings home all the
little problems of life. The fact that
it presents no solutions for these
problems is excusable in that it at
leasts holds them up for us to see.

Once upon a time, a long time
ago Arsenic and Old Lace may have
been a very funny show. Two things,
however, keep the American Con
servatory Theatre's production of it
from maintaining that humor.
Arsenic and Old Lace is situation
comedy. It is not, however, slap
stick and must not be played as such.
When the situation is overextended,
when the actors allow their roles to
become stereotypes, the effect of the
play is lost. Worse, the intricate in
terweavings of plot and sub-plots
beeome tedious.
Unfortunately, all of these don'ts
did Wednesday night.
Carol Teitel as Abby Brewster al
lowed herself to get carried away
by the part she was playing. It is
disconcerting to see a sweet old
maiden aunt carrying on like a
schoolgirl. Ruth Kobart as Martha
Brewster portrayed her part extreme
ly well, but left the feeling that she
wasn't really part of the action.
Mortimer Brewster (Paul Shenar)
was well cast, but terribly under-re
hearsed. His constant dronninc of

lines can not be attributed to the
nervousness inherent in the situation.
Elaine Harper (Ellen Geer) did not
help any by laughing at her own
jokes.
There was one redeeming factor
in Wednesday's performance and
credit must go to Ken Ruta for his
portrayal of the weird brother Jona
than Brewster. His part is the most
stereotyped in the entire play, and
that he managed to carry it off with
out letting it fall to the level of the
other performances is amazing.
The second problem with Arsenic
and Old Lace is one over which the
actors have no control, but which
they can alleviate. Situation comedy
can be viewed seven days a week on
television. Audiences are used to it;
they can predict the situations and
usually the endings. For live situa
tion comedy to succeed, it must be
lifted out of the ordinary. This only
the actors can do, and, sorry to say,
they failed to do so.
ACTs Arsenic and Old Lace can
only be compared to watching a TV
show in the studio instead of at
home. The only thing missing
commercials.
