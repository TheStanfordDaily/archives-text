## Freaks Enliven 'Visit' 
### JANE CIABATTARI 
For its initial season, Berk
eley's new Alumni Repertory
Theater has chosen three plays
which define in varying modes
and configurations two polarities
of modern concern, love and
war.
Contemporary Swiss play
wright Friedrich Duerrenmatt's

The Visit, which opened last
week at Wheeler Auditorium on
the University of California cam
pus at Berkeley, explores the
violence which results when
love diverges from truth and
justice.
Anton Schill's youthful be
trayal of Clara Wascher, and
his renunciation of her child by

him, stimulates a macabre re
venge, involving the townspeople
of Gullen in a moral dilemma
which reveals in frightening de
tail the extent of their greed.
When Clara returns to Gullen
after 40 years, she has become
Madame Claire Zachanassian, a
multimillionairess with a full
repertoire of eccentricities and
an entourage of curiosities —
blind eunochs, gum-chewing ex
convicts, a panther and a coffin,
ex-husbands and husbands-to-be
—which demonstrate the power
of her wealth. Her goal, to trans
form her former hometown
from an economic failure into
a prosperous town, is greeted
with subservient enthusiasm by
the townspeople. However, Claire
attaches a bizarre condition to
her generosity: the death of An
ton Schill.
Duerrenmatt's insight into the
corruption of human nature cen
ters around three characters:
Claire (Barbara Oliver), whose
diabolical manipulation of the
people of Gullen is softened only
by her paradoxical tenderness
towards Anton: the Burgomaster
(Morgan Upton), who leads the
forces of "justice" determined
to execute Anton for his ado
lescent sin (and also conven
iently collect Madame Zachanas
sian's one billion marks); and
Anton himself, played by Rod
eric Prindle.
As Claire's ex-lover, Anton is
revered by the money-worship
ping Gullenites; later, as scape
goat, he assumes a horrifying
prominence. Prindle's portrayal
is subtly powerful. During his
progression from quiet confi
dence in the support of his
friends to final, sad defeat and
acquiesence to the will of the
majority, he commands a mix
ture of sympathy and uneasy
guilt.
Upton, the Burgomaster, epi
temizes the hard-driving politi
cian who can shift positions and
alliances without qualms.
Barbara Oliver as the million
airess maintains a bitter aloof
ness from the atrocities she has
motivated. Her facial expression
of complex emotions is particu
larly fine, and injects a roman
tic dimension into the rigid and
determined character of Claire,
making her nostalgic farewell
to Anton — and her promise to
bury him near her in Capri —
credibly poignant.
Noteworthy in supporting
roles were N. Joseph Callarco as
the idealistic teacher who strug
gles with temptation; Robert
Gardner as the Pastor, symbol
of spiritual corruption; and Ruth
Silveira as Anton's wife; who
participates vigorously in his
final condemnation and grue
some execution. Kathleen Harp
er as Miss Luise, mirror of
Claire's youth, was properly vul
gar, but at times irritatingly
conspicuous.
The chorus of men (Andrew
Potter, Alan Barnes, Joseph
Peter Spano, and John Lion)
was finely synchronized.
The Visit was strikingly stag
ed in an auditorium, which, in
its barenness, places unusual
demands upon the technical
crew. The Berkeley crew met
these demands with capability
and imagination.
