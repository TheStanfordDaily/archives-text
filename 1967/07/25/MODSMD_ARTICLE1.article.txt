# Wilson Proposes Policy On Dogs
## 
### 
Editor's note: In order to avert any
misinterpretation in University Health
Officer Hal W. Wilson's proposal to
keep dogs out of all University build
ings and residences, Wilson's proposal
and reasons justifying it are published
below.

The ordinance to which he refers
is a Santa Clara County Ordinance.
After reading the attached ordi
nance regarding dogs, it is my opinion
that Stanford University should adopt
policies as follows:
1) Dogs should not be permitted In

the building or on the grounds of any
university student residence, including
fraternities.
Individual members of certain fra
ternities will no doubt insist that they
should be able to own dogs. Such
ownership could lead to required com
pliance with the Santa Clara County
Kennel Ordinance. Compliance with
this ordinance requires concrete sloped
and drained run-ways and escape-proof
fences which are located a certain
distance from their own and the neigh
boring houses. Compliance with this
code would be difficult or impossible
in most cases.
2) Dogs should not be permitted in
married student houses. Ownership
of dogs by residents in married stu
dent housing facilities would create
serious and continuous problems.
Dogs housed in small apartments,
where both owners may be gone for
classes, would no doubt cause noise
and nuisance problems. Dogs housed
where there are small children cause
many problems . . . barking, bites,
and health problems resulting from
droppings, etc. Fenced areas might not
be available for confinement of dogs.
3) On-campus residents who own
dogs shall be required to keep them
confined in an enclosure approved by
the health officer. These dogs may
be permitted out of this enclosure
only on leash or under the immediate
command of the owner.
4) The Police Department should
be provided with equipment for cap
turing and confining dogs until such
time as the Santa Clara County Health
Department vehicle can pick up these
animals for transportation to the ani
mal shelters.
The Santa Clara County Health De
partment has agreed to recommend

preferred equipment and give instruc
tions to as many police officers as we
deem necessary.
The enclosures for confining ani
mals should consist of a three-com
partment, metal, two-wall insulated
enclosure. This enclosure could be
either in the form of a truck with
motor, a trailer which could be pulled,
or a box-like structure designed to
fit in a pick-up for transportation. The
enclosure must contain a compart
ment for confining live dogs, a second
compartment for confining live cats
and/or other pets which would have
to be separated from the dogs, and a
third tightly closed compartment for
dead animals. All of these compart
ments would be constructed out of
galvanized iron or stainless steel and
should be designed so that daily
steam cleaning may be accomplished.
The animal enclosure should be lo
cated in an acceptable, convenient
area near the Police Station and
should be shaded from the sun to al
low greater comfort for the animals.
Attempts should be made to remove
the captured animals to the Humane
Society Animal Shelter before it
closes each day.
5) All persons on the campus should
be instructed concerning the Univer
sity policy regarding dogs, the Santa
Clara County ordinance code require
ment, and the enforcement procedure.
6) Rules less stringent than the
requirements of the Santa Clara
County Ordinance Code should not be
permitted.
In my opinion, the policy as out
lined above together with a continuing
educational program on campus, will
considerably reduce the number of
complaints, bites, nuisances, and other
dog problems which are presently in
creasing at an alarming rate.


According to University Health Officer Hal Wilson, dogs in multiple residences like fraternities and dormitories pre
sent serious health problems. For Wilson's proposal concerning dogs on the campus, please see the accompanying
article.

preferred equipment and give instruc
tions to as many police officers as we
deem necessary.
The enclosures for confining ani
mals should consist of a three-com
partment, metal, two-wall insulated
enclosure. This enclosure could be
either in the form of a truck with
motor, a trailer which could be pulled,
or a box-like structure designed to
fit in a pick-up for transportation. The
enclosure must contain a compart
ment for confining live dogs, a second
compartment for confining live cats
and/or other pets which would have
to be separated from the dogs, and a
third tightly closed compartment for
dead animals. All of these compart
ments would be constructed out of
galvanized iron or stainless steel and
should be designed so that daily
steam cleaning may be accomplished.
The animal enclosure should be lo
cated in an acceptable, convenient
area near the Police Station and
should be shaded from the sun to al
low greater comfort for the animals.
Attempts should be made to remove
the captured animals to the Humane
Society Animal Shelter before it
closes each day.
5) All persons on the campus should
be instructed concerning the Univer
sity policy regarding dogs, the Santa
Clara County ordinance code require
ment, and the enforcement procedure.
6) Rules less stringent than the
requirements of the Santa Clara
County Ordinance Code should not be
permitted.
In my opinion, the policy as out
lined above together with a continuing
educational program on campus, will
considerably reduce the number of
complaints, bites, nuisances, and other
dog problems which are presently in
creasing at an alarming rate.


According to University Health Officer Hal Wilson, dogs in multiple residences like fraternities and dormitories pre
sent serious health problems. For Wilson's proposal concerning dogs on the campus, please see the accompanying
article.
Editor's note: In order to avert any
misinterpretation in University Health
Officer Hal W. Wilson's proposal to
keep dogs out of all University build
ings and residences, Wilson's proposal
and reasons justifying it are published
below.

The ordinance to which he refers
is a Santa Clara County Ordinance.
After reading the attached ordi
nance regarding dogs, it is my opinion
that Stanford University should adopt
policies as follows:
1) Dogs should not be permitted In

the building or on the grounds of any
university student residence, including
fraternities.
Individual members of certain fra
ternities will no doubt insist that they
should be able to own dogs. Such
ownership could lead to required com
pliance with the Santa Clara County
Kennel Ordinance. Compliance with
this ordinance requires concrete sloped
and drained run-ways and escape-proof
fences which are located a certain
distance from their own and the neigh
boring houses. Compliance with this
code would be difficult or impossible
in most cases.
2) Dogs should not be permitted in
married student houses. Ownership
of dogs by residents in married stu
dent housing facilities would create
serious and continuous problems.
Dogs housed in small apartments,
where both owners may be gone for
classes, would no doubt cause noise
and nuisance problems. Dogs housed
where there are small children cause
many problems . . . barking, bites,
and health problems resulting from
droppings, etc. Fenced areas might not
be available for confinement of dogs.
3) On-campus residents who own
dogs shall be required to keep them
confined in an enclosure approved by
the health officer. These dogs may
be permitted out of this enclosure
only on leash or under the immediate
command of the owner.
4) The Police Department should
be provided with equipment for cap
turing and confining dogs until such
time as the Santa Clara County Health
Department vehicle can pick up these
animals for transportation to the ani
mal shelters.
The Santa Clara County Health De
partment has agreed to recommend

preferred equipment and give instruc
tions to as many police officers as we
deem necessary.
