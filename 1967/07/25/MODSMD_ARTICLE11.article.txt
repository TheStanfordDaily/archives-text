How risky should a corpora
tion, state or municipality be in
investing employee pension
funds? How much control should
government have in the way
pension funds are invested?
These and related issues will
be taken up by pension fund
investment guardians in a two
week Fiduciary Investment Pro
gram at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business, July 30-Aug.

Questions of risk and regula
tion take on great importance
because pension funds in the
U.S. now amount to more than
$115 billion, according to Gert
von der Linde, associate profes
sor of finance and director of
the program.
The question of government
control is not an academic one,
said Prof, von der Linde, be
cause several pieces of legisla
tion calling for greater govern
ment control of pension funds
are now before Congress.
In California, greater risk in
public pension fund investments
is now a factor, since the recent
change in state law permitting
investment of up to 25 per cent
of pension funds on common
stocks. And pension funds in the
state are now increasing at a
rate of $150 million a year.
