# The 						Director-Joel Mills
## Interview 'him's' Director Speaks 
### 
As producer of the Second An
nual Ram's Head Summer Show,
I felt the acute need to publi
cize the show; so I decided to
hold an interview with myself,
as director of the show, in
order to elucidate certain aspects
of the play to our Daily listeners
— er — readers. Finally, last
night at about 2 a.m., I had the
fortunate (?) opportunity to
catch myself in one of my free
moments In order to conduct the
interview. Following is an a
bridged text of the discussion:
Question: Tell me, Joel Mills,
what prompted you to under
take such an endeavor as to di
rect this difficult e. e. cummings
masterpiece?
Answer: In one word: insan
ity.
Question: Uh — yes — and
what do you feel is the ultimate
significance of this play to the
free love movement?
Answer: I stand on the Fifth
Amendment.
Question: Well, what is the
theme of cummings' play?
Answer: It concerns a play
wright who is struggling to find
himself and to find that which
will enable him to create his art.
It deals with the conflict between
tween life, illusion (image) and
reality, intuition (emotion) and
intellect.
Question: The play has been
described as an early attempt
at theater of the absurd; do you
have any misgivings about an
audience's ability to understand
and interpret the play?
Answer: No, the play is "ab

surd" only in some respects;
"surrealistic" is probably a bet
ter term to describe it. I feel
that the play deals quite clearly
with universal problems and
situations, and though there are
many subtleties of symbolism
and expression, the major
themes are clear and precise.
Question: How are the cast
and crew of your production
working out?
Answer: Lynn Baquier, my
terhnical director, is doing an
excellent job of scraping togeth
er barely enough crew to build
and run the show, and so far
she has been able to put up with
my impossible demands upon
her time, ability and sanity.

The cast, comprised of leads
Ed Graziano and Jeanie Daigle
and approximately 12 other stal
warts, have thus far survived
the rigors of a tight, four-week
production schedule and still
continue to impress me with the
way they are progressing in re
hearsal.
Question: Thank you very
much.
Answer: You are indeed wel
come.
The play will be produced
August 3, 4, and 5 in the Nitery
Theatre at 8:30 p.m. Tickets at
$1.10 apiece will go on sale to
day at Tresidder and in front of
the post office.
