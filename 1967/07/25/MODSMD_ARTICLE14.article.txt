# Man in the Middle
## Mort Sahl-The Rejected Critic 
### Kirk Hanen 
Not long ago, somebody asked
"Whatever happened to Mort
Sahl?" I'd like to answer that:
America abandoned him, but he
will not abandon America.
In 1960, he was easily one of
the hottest properties in show
business. That's only a memory
today.
The man who wrote campaign

jokes for and about John F. Ken
nedy and made a reported $400,-
000 a year while looking out
from the cover Time, is now try
ing to find out who murdered
John F. Kennedy and why —
and the mass media won't touch
him.
In the middle of May he was
fired for the fourth time by
Metromedia — for whom he did
a telephone talk-a-thon on radio
station KLAC — and also by
KTTV television.
He had gone to New Orleans,
taped an interview with District
Attorney Jim Garrison, and play
ed it over the air.
What he got for his trouble
is despicable if not unbelievable.
Here is what he told me in a
recent interview:
"Within a week's time, I ad
dressed the National Press Club.
1 was at the White House, I saw
the Vice President, and I saw
both the Kennedy brothers in
the Senate. A week later, I was
In Los Angeles. Agents who have
pictures of Lyndon Johnson on
their desks would say to me:
'You're dead. There isn't any
place you can work. People just
don't like you.' There was no de
compression chamber. That all
happened in seven days. I talked
to Garrison and found no market
for it. No place to tell it.
"All I want to do is what I've
always wanted to do: talk to the
people. I always thought this
was a transient occupation on
the way to something else. Now
I see it's got to be fought for,
staked out. Now I see this is a
permanent role.

"When the net descended on
me, I found there was no one
in Los Angeles to whom I could
appeal. First, they said I was
paranoiac; then I documented
It, and they said they couldn't
live with it. There was no one
who wanted to fight it; no one
who saw the common danger.
"The country is having a ner
vous breakdown. That has to be
documented. The people have
got to get custody of their coun
try.
"It's a disease of the times.
Nobody wants to get their hands
dirty. The most painful thing to
know is that you have no
friends; that you stand alone,
and you'd better damned well
believe in your principles, be
cause you're going to be tested
on that alone. There is no re
spite. You might fall alseep if
you're lucky, but when you get
up it starts. It's a war.
"It's like a moving body that's
moved two hundred miles to the
right — nobody will notice the
shift if we move together. But,
if one person stands, we'll be
able to measure the distance. So,
we come to the point where we
look at that one tree that's
sprouted in the arid land, and
we're offended by it. All we can
think of when we see the tree
is to chop it down.
"There seems to be a con
spiracy against the American In
tellect, which is the worst dis
crimination of all. If you lose
the right to gather information
and make an evaluation, thafs
worse than any discrimination
against any race, religion, age

group, whatever. For people who
control the media to begin to
assume what is palatable to you
is the beginning of the end.
"What I did with Garrison, in
an era of sanity in my country,
would have earned me the Pul
itzer Prize. Instead, it brought
the heavens down. I lived long
enough to learn that you could
get in trouble for asking a ques
tion."
For several years now, those
who would like to be thought
of as part of the American intel
ligentsia have chided Mort Sahl
for taking pot shots at every
thing in sight. They say he's a
negative thinker — an unreason
able, relentless critic. If that's
their attitude, ink on paper will
not change it.
But for the record, if nothing
else, let's remember this much:
While the "reasonable" people
say: "Don't be upset. You must
expect your government to lie
to you — it's something every
mature individual accepts," Mort
Sahl grapples with what should
be every American's responsi
bilities. What is the Establish
ment's reward for this particu
larly scarce brand of American
ism? They've taken away his
platform and scornfully brand
ed him America's Angry Young
Man — The Guy Who Became
Bitter.
Mort Sahl will be heard from
again and again — he's got
tremendous resilience. It's like
he says, "You can't sweep a
mountain under a throw rug."
Someone, somewhere will no
tice.

Metromedia — for whom he did
a telephone talk-a-thon on radio
station KLAC — and also by
KTTV television.
He had gone to New Orleans,
taped an interview with District
Attorney Jim Garrison, and play
ed it over the air.
What he got for his trouble
is despicable if not unbelievable.
Here is what he told me in a
recent interview:
"Within a week's time, I ad
dressed the National Press Club.
1 was at the White House, I saw
the Vice President, and I saw
both the Kennedy brothers in
the Senate. A week later, I was
In Los Angeles. Agents who have
pictures of Lyndon Johnson on
their desks would say to me:
'You're dead. There isn't any
place you can work. People just
don't like you.' There was no de
compression chamber. That all
happened in seven days. I talked
to Garrison and found no market
for it. No place to tell it.
"All I want to do is what I've
always wanted to do: talk to the
people. I always thought this
was a transient occupation on
the way to something else. Now
I see it's got to be fought for,
staked out. Now I see this is a
permanent role.

"When the net descended on
me, I found there was no one
in Los Angeles to whom I could
appeal. First, they said I was
paranoiac; then I documented
It, and they said they couldn't
live with it. There was no one
who wanted to fight it; no one
who saw the common danger.
"The country is having a ner
vous breakdown. That has to be
documented. The people have
got to get custody of their coun
try.
"It's a disease of the times.
Nobody wants to get their hands
dirty. The most painful thing to
know is that you have no
friends; that you stand alone,
and you'd better damned well
believe in your principles, be
cause you're going to be tested
on that alone. There is no re
spite. You might fall alseep if
you're lucky, but when you get
up it starts. It's a war.
"It's like a moving body that's
moved two hundred miles to the
right — nobody will notice the
shift if we move together. But,
if one person stands, we'll be
able to measure the distance. So,
we come to the point where we
look at that one tree that's
sprouted in the arid land, and
we're offended by it. All we can
think of when we see the tree
is to chop it down.
"There seems to be a con
spiracy against the American In
tellect, which is the worst dis
crimination of all. If you lose
the right to gather information
and make an evaluation, thafs
worse than any discrimination
against any race, religion, age

group, whatever. For people who
control the media to begin to
assume what is palatable to you
is the beginning of the end.
"What I did with Garrison, in
an era of sanity in my country,
would have earned me the Pul
itzer Prize. Instead, it brought
the heavens down. I lived long
enough to learn that you could
get in trouble for asking a ques
tion."
For several years now, those
who would like to be thought
of as part of the American intel
ligentsia have chided Mort Sahl
for taking pot shots at every
thing in sight. They say he's a
negative thinker — an unreason
able, relentless critic. If that's
their attitude, ink on paper will
not change it.
But for the record, if nothing
else, let's remember this much:
While the "reasonable" people
say: "Don't be upset. You must
expect your government to lie
to you — it's something every
mature individual accepts," Mort
Sahl grapples with what should
be every American's responsi
bilities. What is the Establish
ment's reward for this particu
larly scarce brand of American
ism? They've taken away his
platform and scornfully brand
ed him America's Angry Young
Man — The Guy Who Became
Bitter.
Mort Sahl will be heard from
again and again — he's got
tremendous resilience. It's like
he says, "You can't sweep a
mountain under a throw rug."
Someone, somewhere will no
tice.
Not long ago, somebody asked
"Whatever happened to Mort
Sahl?" I'd like to answer that:
America abandoned him, but he
will not abandon America.
In 1960, he was easily one of
the hottest properties in show
business. That's only a memory
today.
The man who wrote campaign

jokes for and about John F. Ken
nedy and made a reported $400,-
000 a year while looking out
from the cover Time, is now try
ing to find out who murdered
John F. Kennedy and why —

him.

'You're dead. There isn't any
place you can work. People just
don't like you.' There was no de
compression chamber. That all
happened in seven days. I talked
to Garrison and found no market
for it. No place to tell it.
"All I want to do is what I've
always wanted to do: talk to the
people. I always thought this
was a transient occupation on
the way to something else. Now
I see it's got to be fought for,

permanent role.

"When the net descended on
me, I found there was no one
in Los Angeles to whom I could
appeal. First, they said I was
paranoiac; then I documented
It, and they said they couldn't

who wanted to fight it; no one
who saw the common danger.

"It's a disease of the times.
Nobody wants to get their hands

know is that you have no
friends; that you stand alone,
and you'd better damned well
believe in your principles, be

you're lucky, but when you get

"It's like a moving body that's

if one person stands, we'll be
able to measure the distance. So,

look at that one tree that's

For several years now, those
who would like to be thought
of as part of the American intel
ligentsia have chided Mort Sahl
for taking pot shots at every
thing in sight. They say he's a
negative thinker — an unreason
able, relentless critic. If that's
their attitude, ink on paper will
not change it.
But for the record, if nothing
else, let's remember this much:
While the "reasonable" people
say: "Don't be upset. You must
expect your government to lie
to you — it's something every
mature individual accepts," Mort
Sahl grapples with what should
be every American's responsi
bilities. What is the Establish
ment's reward for this particu
larly scarce brand of American
ism? They've taken away his
platform and scornfully brand
ed him America's Angry Young
Man — The Guy Who Became
Bitter.
Mort Sahl will be heard from
again and again — he's got
tremendous resilience. It's like
he says, "You can't sweep a
mountain under a throw rug."
Someone, somewhere will no
tice.
Not long ago, somebody asked
"Whatever happened to Mort
Sahl?" I'd like to answer that:
America abandoned him, but he
will not abandon America.
In 1960, he was easily one of
the hottest properties in show
business. That's only a memory
today.
The man who wrote campaign

jokes for and about John F. Ken
nedy and made a reported $400,-
000 a year while looking out
from the cover Time, is now try
ing to find out who murdered
John F. Kennedy and why —
and the mass media won't touch
him.
In the middle of May he was
fired for the fourth time by
Metromedia — for whom he did
a telephone talk-a-thon on radio
station KLAC — and also by
KTTV television.
He had gone to New Orleans,
taped an interview with District
Attorney Jim Garrison, and play
ed it over the air.
What he got for his trouble
is despicable if not unbelievable.
Here is what he told me in a
recent interview:
"Within a week's time, I ad
dressed the National Press Club.
1 was at the White House, I saw
the Vice President, and I saw
both the Kennedy brothers in
the Senate. A week later, I was
In Los Angeles. Agents who have
