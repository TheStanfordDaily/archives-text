# The Movie Scene
## How To Preserve The Wayne Image 
### Jurgen Wolff 
Now playing at the Bijou is
El Dorado with John Wayne.
The man is more interesting to
consider than the picture.

Wayne has been playing the
same character for about thirty
years, which makes him a per
sonality rather than an actor.
The former portrays himself,
while the latter is capable of
portraying a multitude of types.
If Wayne is a personality, then
someone like Alec Guiness is an
actor.
Wayne has always played the
rough, tough guy who uses his
fists and/or guns first and asks
questions later, if at all. He has
usually been a man of few
words, dispatching villains on
the range and sneaking in an
occasional kiss, like as not to
his horse.
The Image
He is now in his sixties, but
likes to keep up the image. Ac
cording to a recent visitor to one
of his movie sets, keeping the
image up now entails the use
of a girdle that keeps the stom
ach in, heavy make up that keeps
the wrinkles out, and a lot of
stunt men to do the actual work.
But the tough guy role is not
a complete sham; if it ever was,
Wayne's screen and private per
sonalities have by now fused.
A couple of years ago he had
cancer. Typically, he rolled up
his sleeves and, calling it"the
big C", overcame it as he over
came the bad guys.
Lately he has been talking
more and has jumped on the po
litical bandwagon (stagecoach?).
As might be expected, he rides
for the far right, and his main
message has been that we have
to stomp out them Viet Cong
(the big V. C.?). His trusty side
kick is Chuck Conners, also a
personality, but a lesser one. As
he once took care of the Indians
encircling him, Wayne now
takes careful aim at the Com
symps.
But the fact remains that John
Wayne is a phenomenon of the
American film industry. If his
personality appeals to you, you
will like "El Dorado" and prob
ably the other films he has made
and will make.
It's sad that only sometime
after his death will Hollywood
probably make a picture called
something like "The Man Called
Wayne". Couldn't we persuade
them to make it now? He could
play the lead so well.
