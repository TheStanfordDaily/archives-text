Editor, The Daily:
I finished my undergraduate
work at Claremont Men's Col
lege and came to Stanford this
quarter expecting to find myself
at a really superior institution
of higher learning. I am disap
pointed. I find that Stanford's
accumulation of books is kept
in the same array that renders
the Claremont College library in
adequate for even undergraduate
use.
There is one central facility,
to which one goes to (hopefully)
locate a source. Then, finding
that there are copies of the book
anywhere from the Hopkins Ma
rine Station to the (noncirculat
ing!) Systematic Biology Li
brary, filed under half a dozen
different systems, one can begin
the book safari hither, thither,
and yon.
Now, I could see the useful
ness of specialized (even if scat
tered) libraries if each one could
gather under its roof all the
sources pertinent to a given de
partment such as law, biology,
or economics. This is not, how
ever, what has been done. In a
very specialized area of biology
I have found sources in four
Stanford libraries. I view this
as the result of a parochial plan
ning process, if, indeed, any
planning process at all is in ef
fect.
I remain disappointed.
