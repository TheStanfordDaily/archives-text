# Critic Elwood Discusses Negro Influence On Jazz

### BUCK NIEHOFF 
Philip Elwood, speaking last night
in the School of Education Building on
"Roots of Jazz: New Orleans and
Beyond," pointed to the various in
fluences on early jazz music. An in
structor in American cultural history
at the Peralta Colleges in Alameda
County and jazz critic for the San
Francisco Examiner, Elwood observed
that the most important influence on
jazz was the Negro ghetto culture
of the South.
Indeed, early jazz was almost com
pletely segregated from white cul
ture. As the famous early musician
Leadbelly once said, "Never was the
white man had the blues." Similarily,

Elwood observed that even the early
recordings of jazz were segregated.
They were all published under The
Race Catalogue label. Not until the
1920's did Negro musicians become
accepted by white communities.
Ragtime Influences Jazz
Another early influence on jazz was
ragtime, which is based on the music
of military bands, such as John Philip
Sousa's. One song that is typical of
this influence is "The Maple Leaf
Rag." It was first recorded on a piano
roll in 1897. In playing a modern
recording of this song during his lec
ture, Elwood asserted that jazz is an
attitude which comes forth through
the individual expression of the play
ers. "It ain't what you do but how
you do it" is how an early jazz musi
cian said the same idea.
A third important influence on early
jazz was Negro Revivalist religion. As
Elwood observed, the preaching of a
vehement Negro minister with the
singing of a choir and the enthusiastic
and rythmic applause of his congre
gation backing him up produces an
exciting sound quite similar to those
which were later recorded by the jazz
musicians.
Jazz Born In New Orleans
Combining all these influences, the
musicians of New Orleans created a
new form of music at the turn of the
century. According to Elwood, this
early jazz is the first serious and so
phisticated music written by Ameri
cans. Earlier works by Stephen Foster,

for example, were, according to El
wood, basically too comical to be re
garded as sophisticated music.
In any case, jazz really moved
out of the ghettos in 1917 when the
Original Dixieland Jass (thafa how it
was spelled then) Band cut a record.
But jazz musicians didn't become popu
lar until the middle twenties when
Jelly Roll Ferdinand Morton became
the jazz performer to hit the top.
First Great Jazz Musician
Describing Morton, Elwood pictured
him as he jMst finished a concert in
Chicago in 1927. Dressed in a fancy
black suit, with a pearl stick pin and a
diamond for a false front tooth, Jelly
Roll, according to the description,
started driving to California in his
brand new Cadillac, towing his second
brand new Cadillac behind. Jazz had
become popular, and Jelly Roll typified
the new era.
Elwood followed the growth of the
new music form through the third gen
eration of jazz musicians. Describing
the great Louis Armstrong's work in
the late '20's and early '30's, Elwood
again emphasized his theme about in
dividual expression. He played a series
of recordings of "Tiger Rag" all of
which Armstrong had made. He then
explained how the style of one record
ing could be classified as jazz, while
that of the second was not rhythmic
enough to be jazz. In this way Elwood
stressed that jazz is a feeling or tech
nique that has nothing to do with the
pieces that are played.
