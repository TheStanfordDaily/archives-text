# ACT Sharp In 'Dear Liar' And 'Fringe'
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE BUCK NIEHOFF 
Dear Liar is a show to please every
one who has ever been in love. It tells
the story of George Bernard Shaw's
extra-marital affair with the famous
English actress Mrs. Patrick Camp
bell.
The story is told through the volu
minous correspondence that Shaw
and Mrs. Campbell exchanged
throughout the course of the 40-year
affair.
Dear Liar is exciting because Shaw
has come down to us as being some
what of a surly old crab. His affair
with Mrs. Campbell must be regard
ed as somewhat out of character, and
indeed it is.
Shaw is played to perfection by
Michael O'Sullivan who finds no dif
ficulty in portraying a man struggling
with an emotion that he has never
faced before. The internal conflict of
the man is carefully and beautifully
drawn until there can be no doubt of
the torment Shaw is going through.
The other pertinent part of the
"Eternal Quadrangle" (Mrs. Camp
bell is married, widowed, and remar
ried during the course of the affair)
is portrayed by Barbara Colby. She,
too is deeply affected by the relation
ship, and Miss Colby leaves little to
be desired, either as Shaw's lover or
as his foil.
Dear Liar is highlighted by the

lines of author Jerome Kilty. To avoid
making the play a soap opera, Kilty
has incorporated some of the best of
Shaw's vindictive and none too subtle
oratory into the play. Nor does Mrs.
Campbell suffer in the sharp tongue
department. Each Shavian slur is met
in turn and the scenes where the two
have their little lovers' quarrels pro
vide a deep insight into the char
acters.
Only one thing detracts from the
otherwise perfect entertainment of
Dear Liar and that is that no one real
ly knows who Mrs. Campbell is. The

audience is told, of course, that she is
a famous actress and that for 40 years
she was Shaw's lover. But, the real
Mrs. Campbell is never really intro
duced, and, not being as famous as
Shaw, there is some question as to
why Shaw found her so exciting. The
audience is given a fait accompli
without being given the history be
hind it.
Dear Liar is a warm sensitive play
about a dour man. More of this type
work than not sinks to the level of
afternoon television. Dear Liar is a
very pleasant exception.

"Beyond the Fringe" is a bloody
good show. It's bouncey as a mound
of lemon jello, as up-to-date as the
most recent gubernatorial demands
of Ronald Reagan and as satiric as
Mark Twain. Presented twice this
past weekend as an A.C.T. late night
special, it is to be performed again
July 28 and August 4.
The play is a revue, consisting of a
series of lampoonish sketches. Poking
fun at everything from Englishmen's
love of royalty to the odd laugh of a
member of the audience, the cast,
Rene Auberjonois, James Ragan,
David Grimm and Patrick Tovatt,
perform with the skill and timing of
the great burlesque comics. More
over, they give their audiences a sense
of ease, as if everyone were old
friends, listening to one another tell
jokes. This quality helped make the
production outlandishly funny, al
though it detracted from the theatrics
of the performance.
Indeed, the players at times be
come too familiar with their audience,
which makes them seem silly. How
ever, the cause of the situation is
probably not due to any fault of
theirs. It is instead the fault of the
script, which contains the sort of ma
terial used by a performer in a night
club rather than that used in serious
theatre. In translating such material
to the stage, the actors naturally had

to risk overdoing it to make it effec
tive. In any case, their performances
were generally satisfying and quite
often extremely amusing, despite the
slap-stick.
Of the four actors, Rene Auber
jonois is the most delightful. He
caught the spirit of every scene, no
matter if it involved a subtle play on
words or slap-stick acrobatics. More
over, he never loses his belief in what
he is doing, a fact which allows him
to give some rather trite punch lines
and to get away with them. The
variety of approaches to his lines, his
rubber-like face and his talented use
of the British accent add to the effec
tiveness of his performance.
Also outstanding is Patrick Tovatt,
whose skill in portraying a hick from
Southern North Dakota is down
right amusing. As well as a hick, To
vatt plays a hyprocritical—although
somewhat stereotyped—vicar named
Dickor and a distraught coal miner
who wanted to be a judge. In this lat
ter role he causes both sympathy and
laughter at the same moments. Tin's
scene proves to be one of the high
points of the show.
Somewhat less satisfying is David
Grimm who seems unable to over
come his surprise at being on stage.
Furthermore, Grimm has the mis
fortune of oftentimes playing the
straightman. Despite these two diffi
culties, he manages to conjure a num

ber of well deserved laughs out of
the audience.
The fourth performer, James
Ragan, proved somewhat disappoint
ing. Basically Ragan seems to have
too much dignity to play the sort of
comedy that is required of him. He
seems to be a Shakespearean actor
and as such could not permit himself
to bccome a part of this farcical show.
His performance was, however, par
tially satisfying in that his dignified
poses often proved to be delightful
contrasts to the wild activities of the
other characters.
Despite these few faults, the show
is definitely funny. One of the most
amusing scenes is a parody on a
Shakespearean drama. While two of
the actors clumsily try to dual, Auber
jonois assuming a vermin-like pose,
scampers about the stage with an in
secticide. He is supposed to be creat
ing a special dramatic effect—mist,
but as he admits his magic mist is
more like smog from Los Angeles
than fog from England.
In another appealing scene all four
actors pretend they are prophets fore
casting the end of the world. At a
very carefully predetermined mo
ment the head prophet points and
says something religious, like zap.
But the world does not end, which,
of course, disappoints them. After
failing again to end the world, they
decide instead to end their show on
this rather jocular note.
