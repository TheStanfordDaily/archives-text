# 'Abuse Of Power'
## Draper Blasts Viet War 
### 
No "final victory" can compen
sate for the failures which al
ready have marked American
involvement in Vietnam.
This is one of the principal
conclusions of a new book, Abuse
of Power, written by Theodore
Draper and published this month
by the Viking Press. A widely
known scholar on communism
in Cuba and America, Draper is
currently a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace at Stan
ford.
Political Fairytale
"Thp idpa that the frustration
of a communist bid for power
in South Vietnam will be some
kind of decisive setback for
communism in Southeast Asia
or even the world is a political
fairytale," Draper declares.
"No communist bid for power
which forces the U.S. to pay
such a high price for 'victory'
can be said to have been 'defeat
ed."
Draper contends that, "If the
communists of other impov
erished, diminutive Southeast
Asian countries could be sure of
making us spend so much blood
and treasure on frustrating
them, we might well be faced
with an epidemic of such wars.
"In the end, the political, so
cial and economic conditions in
each country will determine the
outcome far more than Ameri
can political, economic, and mili
tary power."
The communist takeover in
Cuba has failed to topple any
other Latin American "domi
noes" because Castro's internal
policies "soon backfired, thanks
to no one but himself," Draper
points out.
In Indonesia, "communism
suffered its greatest defeat in
postwar history," mainly be
cause domestic forces were al
lowed to work freely. Indonesia
is far more important strategi
cally than Vietnam, yet the U.S.
did not intervene militarily to
prevent a possible communist
coup, Draper notes.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk
and other American officials
have made the North Vietnamese
"doctrinal prisoners of the Chi
nese," despite widespread evi
dence that Ho Chi Minh and his
top general, Vo Nguyen Giap,
both are Soviet oriented.
"There is nothing in ancient
or recent history that warrants
writing off the North Vietna
mese communists as puppets or
satellites of the Chinese," he
argues.
"Ho Chi Minh was a leading
communist before Mao, with far
more international responsibili
ties and experience in the 1920's
and 1930'5. The Vietnamese com
munists have over 20 years of
their own armed struggle from
which to draw lessons and leg
ends." Since 1965, "all signs have
indicated that the Soviets have
gained appreciably over the Chi
nese in Vietnam." By 1967, Rus
sia was investing close to $1 bil
lion a year in the war, "far
more than the Chinese had ever
done."
The American decision to
bomb North Vietnam in Feb
ruary 1965 came while Soviet
Premier Alexei Kosygin was
visiting Hanoi. Since them "the
more the U.S. bombed, the more
the Soviet Union provided mili
tary and economic assistance to
North Vietnam.
"The notion that we are weak
ening, frightening, or deterring
China by killing Vietnamese, as
if this were a case of mistaken
identity, defies all logic and ex
perience. The only thing we are
conceivably proving is that if
we can bog down in South Viet
nam, it should not be too diffi
cult to bog down in the endless
expanse of mainland China. . . .
It is madness or frivolity to just
ify the present war in terms of
an infinitely more dubious and
appalling war (against China).
Diplomatic Ovtrk
"American diplomacy, as well
as the American military, has a
tendency to 'overkill.' A de-esca
lation of theory is needed as ur
gently as a de-escalation of
force."
In Cuba, the Dominican Re
public, and Vietnam, "we have
resorted to power because our
politics have failed. Since no
politician can afford to admit
this, we must pretend we are
resorting to power in order to
make our politics succeed."
The "use and abuse (of)
naked military power" is the
hallmark of the Johnson admini
stration's foreign policy. We can
not continue to live wholly in
the moment, holding on to every
status quo, however rotten or
unstable, to maintain the line
against communism at whatever
cost," Draper adds.
"From the President on down,
leading officials have spread the
glad tidings that power has
given us global responsibilities
which seem to be functions not
of our infinite wisdom or bound
less altruism but mainly of our
incomparable power. ... In the
new worship of power, we are
squandering our power by using
too much too frequently and too
maladroitly. All great powers
which have overestimated, over
indulged, and overextended their
power have come to grief. What
ever one may think about the
present military imperatives, we
cannot go on failing politically
and 'succeeding' militarily with
out ultimately inviting disaster
beyond anything yet known to
mankind."
Brutal Tactics Used
The author of two military his
tories, two works on American
communists, and two analyses
of Castroism, Drapnr points out
that from 1954 to 1956, Ho Chi
Minh's tactics in consolidating
his grip on North Vietnam
"were every bit as ruthless and
brutal as any used in China or
Soviet Russia at their worst.
"At least 50,000 and possibly
100,000 peasants were physically
exterminated." Had free elec
tions been held in the South,

Ho "might have taken power
democratically, but he would
not have kept power democrati
cally, which is far more impor
tant," he observes.
While a "democratic reform
er or even an honest civilian"
would be preferable to "the most
'independent' communist in pow
er" in Vietnam, Draper main
tains that the best the U.S. has
come up with is "a self-imposed
military junta, composed almost
wholly of Northerners, without
a shred of legitimacy and social
conscience....
Key To Involvement
"As long as the U.S. does not
have a regime in South Vietnam
which can remain in power
through its own resources and
popular support, the U.S. will
never be able to pull out of
South Vietnam, whatever the
North Vietnam regime may do."
He emphasizes that the key to
long-term involvement lies in
the South, not the North. The
newly adopted constitution is
"more likely to produce a consti
tutional cover for the junta's
rule than a genuine civilian suc
cessor" (to Premier Ky). The in
ternal political decay which led
to the assassination of Premier
Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 was
marked by police state tactics
and left a "political wasteland,"
he notes. President Kennedy,
who backed Diem and then did
nothing to prevent his over
throw, was "a statesman whose
style is considered more impor
tant than his substance."
President Johnson's decision
to bomb the North in February
1965 and sharply increase U.S.
troop commitments in Vietnam
has been officially justified on
the basis of an invasion from
the North. Yet the Defense De
partment has confirmed that
only 400 North Vietnamese sol
diers were among enemy forces
totaling 140,000 in the South at
that time, Draper points out.
The weakness of a succession
of South Vietnamese regimes
"exerts an influence akin to poli
tical blackmail on American po
licy," forcing increased Ameri
can involvement, he adds. The
Gulf of Tonkin and Pleiku inci
dents were "extenuating circum
stances" which enabled Presi
dent Johnson to ease the public
shock of actions based "far
more" on South Vietnamese po
litical disintegration than on
Northern troop infiltration. The
"overwhelming impression" cre
ated by a review of the record
leading to the 1965 escalation of
the war, "is that this was an in
credibly bumbling diplomatic
operation," Draper comments.
"Those who fear the encroach
ments of 'American imperialism'
might take some comfort in the
thought that it has come too
late into the world to develop
he-men and the methods for do
ing a good job of it."
Integrity of Press
"One of the saving and most
hopeful elements on the Ameri
can scene throughout the Viet
namese war has been the rela
tive independence and integrity
of an important part of the
American press," he observes.
"Whatever one may have
thought of that policy, the Amer
ican political system, at least
until the spring of 1967, had
passed the most severe test a
democracy can be subjected to
— freedom of the press in war
time."
No "final victory" can compen
sate for the failures which al
ready have marked American
involvement in Vietnam.

The author of two military his
tories, two works on American
communists, and two analyses
of Castroism, Drapnr points out
that from 1954 to 1956, Ho Chi
Minh's tactics in consolidating
his grip on North Vietnam
"were every bit as ruthless and
brutal as any used in China or
Soviet Russia at their worst.
"At least 50,000 and possibly
100,000 peasants were physically
exterminated." Had free elec
tions been held in the South,

Ho "might have taken power
democratically, but he would
not have kept power democrati
cally, which is far more impor
tant," he observes.
While a "democratic reform
er or even an honest civilian"
would be preferable to "the most
'independent' communist in pow
er" in Vietnam, Draper main
tains that the best the U.S. has
come up with is "a self-imposed
military junta, composed almost
wholly of Northerners, without
a shred of legitimacy and social
conscience....
Key To Involvement
"As long as the U.S. does not
have a regime in South Vietnam
which can remain in power
through its own resources and
popular support, the U.S. will
never be able to pull out of
South Vietnam, whatever the
North Vietnam regime may do."
He emphasizes that the key to
long-term involvement lies in
the South, not the North. The
newly adopted constitution is
"more likely to produce a consti
tutional cover for the junta's
rule than a genuine civilian suc
cessor" (to Premier Ky). The in
ternal political decay which led
to the assassination of Premier
Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 was
marked by police state tactics
and left a "political wasteland,"
he notes. President Kennedy,
who backed Diem and then did
nothing to prevent his over
throw, was "a statesman whose
style is considered more impor
tant than his substance."
President Johnson's decision
to bomb the North in February
1965 and sharply increase U.S.
troop commitments in Vietnam
has been officially justified on
the basis of an invasion from
the North. Yet the Defense De
partment has confirmed that
only 400 North Vietnamese sol
diers were among enemy forces
totaling 140,000 in the South at
that time, Draper points out.
The weakness of a succession
of South Vietnamese regimes
"exerts an influence akin to poli
tical blackmail on American po
licy," forcing increased Ameri
can involvement, he adds. The
Gulf of Tonkin and Pleiku inci
dents were "extenuating circum
stances" which enabled Presi
dent Johnson to ease the public
shock of actions based "far
more" on South Vietnamese po
litical disintegration than on
Northern troop infiltration. The
"overwhelming impression" cre
ated by a review of the record
leading to the 1965 escalation of
the war, "is that this was an in
credibly bumbling diplomatic
operation," Draper comments.
"Those who fear the encroach
ments of 'American imperialism'
might take some comfort in the
thought that it has come too
late into the world to develop
he-men and the methods for do
ing a good job of it."
Integrity of Press
"One of the saving and most
hopeful elements on the Ameri
can scene throughout the Viet
namese war has been the rela
tive independence and integrity
of an important part of the
American press," he observes.
"Whatever one may have
thought of that policy, the Amer
ican political system, at least
until the spring of 1967, had
passed the most severe test a
democracy can be subjected to
— freedom of the press in war
time."
No "final victory" can compen
sate for the failures which al
ready have marked American
involvement in Vietnam.
This is one of the principal
conclusions of a new book, Abuse
of Power, written by Theodore
Draper and published this month
by the Viking Press. A widely
known scholar on communism
in Cuba and America, Draper is
currently a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace at Stan
ford.
Political Fairytale
"Thp idpa that the frustration
of a communist bid for power
in South Vietnam will be some
kind of decisive setback for
communism in Southeast Asia
or even the world is a political
fairytale," Draper declares.
"No communist bid for power
which forces the U.S. to pay
such a high price for 'victory'
can be said to have been 'defeat
ed."
Draper contends that, "If the
communists of other impov
erished, diminutive Southeast
Asian countries could be sure of
making us spend so much blood
and treasure on frustrating
them, we might well be faced
with an epidemic of such wars.
"In the end, the political, so
cial and economic conditions in
each country will determine the
outcome far more than Ameri
can political, economic, and mili
tary power."
The communist takeover in
Cuba has failed to topple any
other Latin American "domi
noes" because Castro's internal
policies "soon backfired, thanks
to no one but himself," Draper
points out.
In Indonesia, "communism
suffered its greatest defeat in
postwar history," mainly be
cause domestic forces were al
lowed to work freely. Indonesia
is far more important strategi
cally than Vietnam, yet the U.S.
did not intervene militarily to
prevent a possible communist
coup, Draper notes.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk
and other American officials
have made the North Vietnamese
"doctrinal prisoners of the Chi
nese," despite widespread evi
dence that Ho Chi Minh and his
top general, Vo Nguyen Giap,
both are Soviet oriented.
"There is nothing in ancient
or recent history that warrants
writing off the North Vietna
mese communists as puppets or
satellites of the Chinese," he
argues.
"Ho Chi Minh was a leading
communist before Mao, with far
more international responsibili
ties and experience in the 1920's
and 1930'5. The Vietnamese com
munists have over 20 years of
their own armed struggle from
which to draw lessons and leg
ends." Since 1965, "all signs have
indicated that the Soviets have
gained appreciably over the Chi
nese in Vietnam." By 1967, Rus
sia was investing close to $1 bil
lion a year in the war, "far
more than the Chinese had ever
done."
The American decision to
bomb North Vietnam in Feb
ruary 1965 came while Soviet
Premier Alexei Kosygin was
visiting Hanoi. Since them "the
more the U.S. bombed, the more
the Soviet Union provided mili
tary and economic assistance to
North Vietnam.
"The notion that we are weak
ening, frightening, or deterring
China by killing Vietnamese, as
if this were a case of mistaken
identity, defies all logic and ex
perience. The only thing we are
conceivably proving is that if
we can bog down in South Viet
nam, it should not be too diffi
cult to bog down in the endless
expanse of mainland China. . . .
It is madness or frivolity to just
ify the present war in terms of
an infinitely more dubious and
appalling war (against China).
Diplomatic Ovtrk
"American diplomacy, as well
as the American military, has a
tendency to 'overkill.' A de-esca
lation of theory is needed as ur
gently as a de-escalation of
force."
In Cuba, the Dominican Re
public, and Vietnam, "we have
resorted to power because our
politics have failed. Since no
politician can afford to admit
this, we must pretend we are
resorting to power in order to
make our politics succeed."
The "use and abuse (of)
naked military power" is the
hallmark of the Johnson admini
stration's foreign policy. We can
not continue to live wholly in
the moment, holding on to every
status quo, however rotten or
unstable, to maintain the line
against communism at whatever
cost," Draper adds.
"From the President on down,
leading officials have spread the
glad tidings that power has
given us global responsibilities
which seem to be functions not
of our infinite wisdom or bound
less altruism but mainly of our
incomparable power. ... In the
new worship of power, we are
squandering our power by using
too much too frequently and too
maladroitly. All great powers
which have overestimated, over
indulged, and overextended their
power have come to grief. What
ever one may think about the
present military imperatives, we
cannot go on failing politically
and 'succeeding' militarily with
out ultimately inviting disaster
beyond anything yet known to
mankind."

policies "soon backfired, thanks
to no one but himself," Draper
points out.
In Indonesia, "communism
suffered its greatest defeat in
postwar history," mainly be
cause domestic forces were al
lowed to work freely. Indonesia
is far more important strategi
cally than Vietnam, yet the U.S.
did not intervene militarily to
prevent a possible communist
coup, Draper notes.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk
and other American officials
have made the North Vietnamese
"doctrinal prisoners of the Chi
nese," despite widespread evi
dence that Ho Chi Minh and his
top general, Vo Nguyen Giap,
both are Soviet oriented.
"There is nothing in ancient
or recent history that warrants
writing off the North Vietna
mese communists as puppets or
satellites of the Chinese," he
argues.
"Ho Chi Minh was a leading
communist before Mao, with far
more international responsibili
ties and experience in the 1920's
and 1930'5. The Vietnamese com
munists have over 20 years of
their own armed struggle from
which to draw lessons and leg
ends." Since 1965, "all signs have
indicated that the Soviets have
gained appreciably over the Chi
nese in Vietnam." By 1967, Rus
sia was investing close to $1 bil
lion a year in the war, "far
more than the Chinese had ever
done."
The American decision to
bomb North Vietnam in Feb
ruary 1965 came while Soviet
Premier Alexei Kosygin was
visiting Hanoi. Since them "the
more the U.S. bombed, the more
the Soviet Union provided mili
tary and economic assistance to
North Vietnam.
"The notion that we are weak
ening, frightening, or deterring
China by killing Vietnamese, as
if this were a case of mistaken
identity, defies all logic and ex
perience. The only thing we are
conceivably proving is that if
we can bog down in South Viet
nam, it should not be too diffi
cult to bog down in the endless
expanse of mainland China. . . .
It is madness or frivolity to just
ify the present war in terms of
an infinitely more dubious and
appalling war (against China).
Diplomatic Ovtrk
"American diplomacy, as well
as the American military, has a
tendency to 'overkill.' A de-esca
lation of theory is needed as ur
gently as a de-escalation of
force."
In Cuba, the Dominican Re
public, and Vietnam, "we have
resorted to power because our
politics have failed. Since no
politician can afford to admit
this, we must pretend we are
resorting to power in order to
make our politics succeed."
The "use and abuse (of)
naked military power" is the
hallmark of the Johnson admini
stration's foreign policy. We can
not continue to live wholly in
the moment, holding on to every
status quo, however rotten or
unstable, to maintain the line
against communism at whatever
cost," Draper adds.
"From the President on down,
leading officials have spread the
glad tidings that power has
given us global responsibilities
which seem to be functions not
of our infinite wisdom or bound
less altruism but mainly of our
incomparable power. ... In the
new worship of power, we are
squandering our power by using
too much too frequently and too
maladroitly. All great powers
which have overestimated, over
indulged, and overextended their
power have come to grief. What
ever one may think about the
present military imperatives, we
cannot go on failing politically
and 'succeeding' militarily with
out ultimately inviting disaster
beyond anything yet known to
mankind."
Brutal Tactics Used
The author of two military his
tories, two works on American
communists, and two analyses
of Castroism, Drapnr points out
that from 1954 to 1956, Ho Chi
Minh's tactics in consolidating
his grip on North Vietnam
"were every bit as ruthless and
brutal as any used in China or
Soviet Russia at their worst.
"At least 50,000 and possibly
100,000 peasants were physically
exterminated." Had free elec
tions been held in the South,

Ho "might have taken power
democratically, but he would
not have kept power democrati
cally, which is far more impor
tant," he observes.
While a "democratic reform
er or even an honest civilian"
would be preferable to "the most
'independent' communist in pow
er" in Vietnam, Draper main
tains that the best the U.S. has
come up with is "a self-imposed
military junta, composed almost
wholly of Northerners, without
a shred of legitimacy and social
conscience....
Key To Involvement
"As long as the U.S. does not
have a regime in South Vietnam
which can remain in power
through its own resources and
popular support, the U.S. will
never be able to pull out of
South Vietnam, whatever the
North Vietnam regime may do."
He emphasizes that the key to
long-term involvement lies in
the South, not the North. The
newly adopted constitution is
"more likely to produce a consti
tutional cover for the junta's
rule than a genuine civilian suc
cessor" (to Premier Ky). The in
ternal political decay which led
to the assassination of Premier
Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 was
marked by police state tactics
and left a "political wasteland,"
he notes. President Kennedy,
who backed Diem and then did
nothing to prevent his over
throw, was "a statesman whose
style is considered more impor
tant than his substance."
President Johnson's decision
to bomb the North in February
1965 and sharply increase U.S.
troop commitments in Vietnam
has been officially justified on
the basis of an invasion from
the North. Yet the Defense De
partment has confirmed that
only 400 North Vietnamese sol
diers were among enemy forces
totaling 140,000 in the South at
that time, Draper points out.
The weakness of a succession
of South Vietnamese regimes
"exerts an influence akin to poli
tical blackmail on American po
licy," forcing increased Ameri
can involvement, he adds. The
Gulf of Tonkin and Pleiku inci
dents were "extenuating circum
stances" which enabled Presi
dent Johnson to ease the public
shock of actions based "far
more" on South Vietnamese po
litical disintegration than on
Northern troop infiltration. The
"overwhelming impression" cre
ated by a review of the record
leading to the 1965 escalation of
the war, "is that this was an in
credibly bumbling diplomatic
operation," Draper comments.
"Those who fear the encroach
ments of 'American imperialism'
might take some comfort in the
thought that it has come too
late into the world to develop
he-men and the methods for do
ing a good job of it."
Integrity of Press
"One of the saving and most
hopeful elements on the Ameri
can scene throughout the Viet
namese war has been the rela
tive independence and integrity
of an important part of the
American press," he observes.
"Whatever one may have
thought of that policy, the Amer
ican political system, at least
until the spring of 1967, had
passed the most severe test a
democracy can be subjected to
— freedom of the press in war
time."
No "final victory" can compen
sate for the failures which al
ready have marked American
involvement in Vietnam.
This is one of the principal
conclusions of a new book, Abuse
of Power, written by Theodore
Draper and published this month
by the Viking Press. A widely
known scholar on communism
in Cuba and America, Draper is
currently a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace at Stan
ford.
Political Fairytale
"Thp idpa that the frustration
of a communist bid for power
in South Vietnam will be some
kind of decisive setback for
communism in Southeast Asia
or even the world is a political
fairytale," Draper declares.
"No communist bid for power
which forces the U.S. to pay
such a high price for 'victory'
can be said to have been 'defeat
ed."
Draper contends that, "If the
communists of other impov
erished, diminutive Southeast
Asian countries could be sure of
making us spend so much blood
and treasure on frustrating
them, we might well be faced
with an epidemic of such wars.
"In the end, the political, so
cial and economic conditions in
each country will determine the
outcome far more than Ameri
can political, economic, and mili
tary power."
The communist takeover in
Cuba has failed to topple any
other Latin American "domi
noes" because Castro's internal
policies "soon backfired, thanks
to no one but himself," Draper
points out.
In Indonesia, "communism

the South, not the North. The
newly adopted constitution is
"more likely to produce a consti

ternal political decay which led
to the assassination of Premier
Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 was
marked by police state tactics
and left a "political wasteland,"
he notes. President Kennedy,
who backed Diem and then did
nothing to prevent his over
throw, was "a statesman whose
style is considered more impor
tant than his substance."
President Johnson's decision
to bomb the North in February
1965 and sharply increase U.S.
troop commitments in Vietnam
has been officially justified on
the basis of an invasion from
the North. Yet the Defense De
partment has confirmed that
only 400 North Vietnamese sol
diers were among enemy forces
totaling 140,000 in the South at
that time, Draper points out.
The weakness of a succession
of South Vietnamese regimes
"exerts an influence akin to poli
tical blackmail on American po
licy," forcing increased Ameri
can involvement, he adds. The
Gulf of Tonkin and Pleiku inci
dents were "extenuating circum
stances" which enabled Presi
dent Johnson to ease the public
shock of actions based "far
more" on South Vietnamese po
litical disintegration than on
Northern troop infiltration. The
"overwhelming impression" cre
ated by a review of the record
leading to the 1965 escalation of
the war, "is that this was an in
credibly bumbling diplomatic
operation," Draper comments.
"Those who fear the encroach
ments of 'American imperialism'
might take some comfort in the
thought that it has come too
late into the world to develop
he-men and the methods for do
ing a good job of it."
Integrity of Press
"One of the saving and most
hopeful elements on the Ameri
can scene throughout the Viet
namese war has been the rela
tive independence and integrity
of an important part of the
American press," he observes.
"Whatever one may have
thought of that policy, the Amer
ican political system, at least
until the spring of 1967, had
passed the most severe test a
democracy can be subjected to
— freedom of the press in war
time."
No "final victory" can compen
sate for the failures which al
ready have marked American
involvement in Vietnam.
This is one of the principal
conclusions of a new book, Abuse
of Power, written by Theodore
Draper and published this month
by the Viking Press. A widely
known scholar on communism
in Cuba and America, Draper is
currently a research fellow at
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace at Stan
ford.
Political Fairytale
"Thp idpa that the frustration
of a communist bid for power
in South Vietnam will be some
kind of decisive setback for
communism in Southeast Asia
or even the world is a political
fairytale," Draper declares.
"No communist bid for power
which forces the U.S. to pay
such a high price for 'victory'
can be said to have been 'defeat
ed."
Draper contends that, "If the
communists of other impov
erished, diminutive Southeast
Asian countries could be sure of
making us spend so much blood
and treasure on frustrating
them, we might well be faced
with an epidemic of such wars.
"In the end, the political, so
cial and economic conditions in
each country will determine the
outcome far more than Ameri
can political, economic, and mili
tary power."
The communist takeover in
Cuba has failed to topple any
other Latin American "domi
noes" because Castro's internal
policies "soon backfired, thanks
to no one but himself," Draper
points out.
In Indonesia, "communism
suffered its greatest defeat in
postwar history," mainly be
cause domestic forces were al
lowed to work freely. Indonesia
is far more important strategi
cally than Vietnam, yet the U.S.
did not intervene militarily to
prevent a possible communist
coup, Draper notes.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk
and other American officials
have made the North Vietnamese
"doctrinal prisoners of the Chi
nese," despite widespread evi
dence that Ho Chi Minh and his
top general, Vo Nguyen Giap,
both are Soviet oriented.
"There is nothing in ancient
or recent history that warrants
writing off the North Vietna
mese communists as puppets or
satellites of the Chinese," he
argues.
"Ho Chi Minh was a leading
communist before Mao, with far
more international responsibili
ties and experience in the 1920's
and 1930'5. The Vietnamese com
munists have over 20 years of
their own armed struggle from
which to draw lessons and leg
ends." Since 1965, "all signs have
indicated that the Soviets have
gained appreciably over the Chi
nese in Vietnam." By 1967, Rus
sia was investing close to $1 bil
lion a year in the war, "far
more than the Chinese had ever
done."
The American decision to
bomb North Vietnam in Feb
ruary 1965 came while Soviet
Premier Alexei Kosygin was
visiting Hanoi. Since them "the
more the U.S. bombed, the more
the Soviet Union provided mili
tary and economic assistance to
North Vietnam.
"The notion that we are weak
ening, frightening, or deterring
China by killing Vietnamese, as
if this were a case of mistaken
identity, defies all logic and ex
perience. The only thing we are
conceivably proving is that if
we can bog down in South Viet
nam, it should not be too diffi
cult to bog down in the endless
expanse of mainland China. . . .
It is madness or frivolity to just
ify the present war in terms of
an infinitely more dubious and
appalling war (against China).
Diplomatic Ovtrk
"American diplomacy, as well
as the American military, has a
tendency to 'overkill.' A de-esca
lation of theory is needed as ur
gently as a de-escalation of
force."
In Cuba, the Dominican Re
public, and Vietnam, "we have
resorted to power because our
politics have failed. Since no
politician can afford to admit
this, we must pretend we are
resorting to power in order to
make our politics succeed."
The "use and abuse (of)
naked military power" is the
hallmark of the Johnson admini
stration's foreign policy. We can
not continue to live wholly in
the moment, holding on to every
status quo, however rotten or
unstable, to maintain the line
against communism at whatever
cost," Draper adds.
"From the President on down,
leading officials have spread the
glad tidings that power has
given us global responsibilities
which seem to be functions not
of our infinite wisdom or bound
less altruism but mainly of our
incomparable power. ... In the
new worship of power, we are
squandering our power by using
too much too frequently and too
maladroitly. All great powers
which have overestimated, over
indulged, and overextended their
power have come to grief. What
ever one may think about the
present military imperatives, we
cannot go on failing politically
and 'succeeding' militarily with
out ultimately inviting disaster
beyond anything yet known to
mankind."
Brutal Tactics Used
The author of two military his
tories, two works on American
communists, and two analyses
of Castroism, Drapnr points out
that from 1954 to 1956, Ho Chi
Minh's tactics in consolidating
his grip on North Vietnam
"were every bit as ruthless and
brutal as any used in China or
Soviet Russia at their worst.
"At least 50,000 and possibly
100,000 peasants were physically
exterminated." Had free elec
tions been held in the South,

Ho "might have taken power
democratically, but he would
not have kept power democrati
cally, which is far more impor
tant," he observes.
While a "democratic reform
er or even an honest civilian"
would be preferable to "the most
'independent' communist in pow
er" in Vietnam, Draper main
tains that the best the U.S. has
come up with is "a self-imposed
military junta, composed almost
wholly of Northerners, without
a shred of legitimacy and social
conscience....
Key To Involvement
"As long as the U.S. does not
have a regime in South Vietnam
which can remain in power
through its own resources and
popular support, the U.S. will
never be able to pull out of
South Vietnam, whatever the
North Vietnam regime may do."
He emphasizes that the key to
long-term involvement lies in
the South, not the North. The
newly adopted constitution is
"more likely to produce a consti
tutional cover for the junta's
rule than a genuine civilian suc
cessor" (to Premier Ky). The in
ternal political decay which led
to the assassination of Premier
Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 was
