# Smith To Direct 'Focus' Orchestra On August 4
## 
### 
American musical pioneers
Charles Ives, Wallingford Rieg
ger, and Aaron Copland will be
saluted in a concert of their rare
ly performed innovative works
Friday, Aug. 4, by a Stanford
Summer Festival Orchestra.
The 23-piece orchestra will be
comprised of leading musicians
from the San Francisco and
Oakland symphony orchestras,
directed by Leland Smith, Stan
ford expert on modern music.
"These three — Ives, Riegger
and Copeland — were among
the first who wrote independent

music in America," Smith ex
plained.
The works selected were writ
ten between 1908 and 1931, as
American music came into its
own. They are seldom performed
because they are technically dif
ficult, requiring accomplished
professionals, and yet are for
a small orchestra between the
normal chamber and symphonic
sizes.
"Only for special occasions,
such as the Summer Festival,"
Smith said, "can the proper
sized orchestra be gathered."
"Focus on America" is the

theme of the 1967 Summer Fes
tival.
The festival orchestra's con
cert will begin at 8 p.m. in Dink
elspiel Auditorium.
The program, in order, is:
Ives' Tone Roads No. 1 (1911),
Tone Roads No. 3 (1915), Scher
zo ("Over the Pavements") (19-
13), "The Gong on the Hook
and Ladder" (or "The Firemen's
Parade on Main Street") (1912),
and"The Unanswered Question"
(1908); Riegger's "Dichotomy"
(1931); and Copland's "Music for
the Theater" (1925).
Ives
Ives (1874-1954) was a titani
cally original composer who
would borrow from American
song idiom but, more than that,
had a highly chromatic, rhyth
mically vital and atonal or poly
tonal style.
Smith notes that Ives develop
ed his own style, without refer
ence to such European con
temporaries and innovators as
Debussy, Schoenberg, or Stra
vinsky.
"He wrote in an idealistic
way, without account of per
formance problems. He had a
fondness for irregular meters."
Riegger (1885-1961) was one
of the first composers to grasp
the 12-tone technique, and he
produced early works in this
school. The difference was that
his pieces — including "Dicho
tomy" — are full of American
rhythms and syncopations. He
wrote for years for the Martha
Graham dancers.
Copland
Copland (1900 ) is probably
the best known serious Ameri
can composer. His ballet and
dance music has a strong folk
root. "Music for the Theater" is
a five-movement piece incorpora
ting jazz in formal music. It has
been recorded by Leonard Bern
stein.
Smith will discuss pieces in
the program between perform
ances.
The orchestra will include
such Bay Area virtuosos as Na
than Rubin, concertmaster of the
Oakland Symphony Orchestra;
Edward Haug, trumpeter, San
Francisco Symphony and soloist
at the Carmel Bach Festival;
Nathan Schwartz, pianist; and
Stuart Dempster, trombonist re
nowned for avant garde per
formances across the nation.

elspiel Auditorium.
The program, in order, is:
Ives' Tone Roads No. 1 (1911),
Tone Roads No. 3 (1915), Scher
zo ("Over the Pavements") (19-
13), "The Gong on the Hook
and Ladder" (or "The Firemen's
Parade on Main Street") (1912),
and"The Unanswered Question"
(1908); Riegger's "Dichotomy"
(1931); and Copland's "Music for
the Theater" (1925).
Ives
Ives (1874-1954) was a titani
cally original composer who
would borrow from American
song idiom but, more than that,
had a highly chromatic, rhyth
mically vital and atonal or poly
tonal style.
Smith notes that Ives develop
ed his own style, without refer
ence to such European con
temporaries and innovators as
Debussy, Schoenberg, or Stra
vinsky.
"He wrote in an idealistic
way, without account of per
formance problems. He had a
fondness for irregular meters."
Riegger (1885-1961) was one
of the first composers to grasp
the 12-tone technique, and he
produced early works in this
school. The difference was that
his pieces — including "Dicho
tomy" — are full of American
rhythms and syncopations. He
wrote for years for the Martha
Graham dancers.
Copland
Copland (1900 ) is probably
the best known serious Ameri
can composer. His ballet and
dance music has a strong folk
root. "Music for the Theater" is
a five-movement piece incorpora
ting jazz in formal music. It has
been recorded by Leonard Bern
stein.
Smith will discuss pieces in
the program between perform
ances.
The orchestra will include
such Bay Area virtuosos as Na
than Rubin, concertmaster of the
Oakland Symphony Orchestra;
Edward Haug, trumpeter, San
Francisco Symphony and soloist
at the Carmel Bach Festival;
Nathan Schwartz, pianist; and
Stuart Dempster, trombonist re
nowned for avant garde per
formances across the nation.
American musical pioneers
Charles Ives, Wallingford Rieg
ger, and Aaron Copland will be
saluted in a concert of their rare
ly performed innovative works
Friday, Aug. 4, by a Stanford
Summer Festival Orchestra.
The 23-piece orchestra will be
comprised of leading musicians
from the San Francisco and
Oakland symphony orchestras,
directed by Leland Smith, Stan
ford expert on modern music.
"These three — Ives, Riegger
and Copeland — were among
the first who wrote independent

music in America," Smith ex
plained.
The works selected were writ
ten between 1908 and 1931, as
American music came into its
own. They are seldom performed
because they are technically dif
ficult, requiring accomplished
professionals, and yet are for
a small orchestra between the
normal chamber and symphonic
sizes.
"Only for special occasions,
such as the Summer Festival,"
Smith said, "can the proper
sized orchestra be gathered."
"Focus on America" is the

theme of the 1967 Summer Fes
tival.
The festival orchestra's con
cert will begin at 8 p.m. in Dink
elspiel Auditorium.
