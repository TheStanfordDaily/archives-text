# Wheelchair Golfâ€” Newest Therapy
## 
### 
Wheelchair golf could be the
next forward step in rehabilita
tion therapy if the club-swing
ing apparatus designed by a
group of engineering students
at Stanford University is put
to use.
Nicholas Lieggi of Chicago
and John Seevers of Davis
(standing 1. to r.) watched as
Yong-Taik Sim of Seoul, Korea,
proved that it really works.
Their hastily-built device was
added to a standard wheel chair
after consultation with Stanford
Medical School doctors, who felt
it could be a great morale-boost
er for handicapped people. With
a little more development it
could make pitch-and putt golf
possible for such people, the stu
dents bolieve.
A fourth student, Seifi Gha
semi of Teheran, Iran, also par
ticipated in the project, which
was part of a four-week summer
workshop in engineering design
conducted by the Design Division
of Stanford's Mechanical
neering Department and spon
sored by the National Science
Foundation.
