# 'Third Man' Tonight At TMU Flicks
## 
### 
The Third Man, tonight's
movie (7:30, 8:30 at Tresidder
Union, 9:30 at I-Center) was di
rected in 1950 by Sir Carol Reed
and based on a story by Graham
Greene, who also wrote the
screen play. The major actors
are Joseph Cotton, Orson Wells,
Alida Valli and Trevor Howard.
The action is situated in Vien
na, immediately after the end
of World War 11, when Austria
was occupied by the Allies. It is
basically a mystery - suspense
story, but the subject is fairly
unique in the genre because of
its social overtones.
An American writer comes to
Vienna to see an old friend of
his, Harry Lime. As soon as he
arrives, he is told that his friend
just died in an automobile acci
dent. The accident looks suspi
cious to the American, who de
cides to find out the truth, a
very unusual one in fact. During
the beginning of the movie, the
audience sees Lime's friends, one
after another, and we come 1o
know who and what Lime is. For
about two-thirds of the movie
the dominating figure, Lime,
never appears on the screen.
The many things we see deal
with the writer-turned-detective
whose style of inquiry is com
pared with that of the English
police; the world of a destroyed
cafe society is very well depicted
for what it has become â€” a very
squalid sub-culture; the uncer
tainties of Lime's portier who
has seen but hasn't seen, and
Lime's mistress, portrayed by
Alida Valli (one of her very best
performances) are also explored.
Besides all this, another story
is told: that of humane feelings
like friendship and love and the
difficulty of betraying a friend.
The movie is very well bal
anced between these two main
lines of action. Sometimes the
action is really carried on in a
purely photographical style and
dialogue is appropriately inte
grated with the camera work.
More rarely speeches and dia
logue overcome photography. Al
though there are almost no tech
nical innovations compared
to Citizen Kane or The Magnifi
cent Amber sons, and there is
very little which may make us
think of the Italian style which
was then being developed. The
story is very well told with skill
and an excellent treatment of
the socio-political suspense in
gredients. These were the rea
sons why The Third Man was
awarded first prize at the Can
nes Festival.
Especially interesting are the
bottom-to-top pictures of the
Portier as opposed to the top-to
bottom of his son; Lime's pres
entation which is done in a very
classical form; some pictures of
an empty square reminiscent of
German expressionistic forms
of the middle thirties; and the
Sewer scenes of the last part. If
several sequences are clearly de
rived from Fritz Lang's Murder
especially in the treatment of
gray-black tones, in The Third
Man there is a modification of
that style which is appropriate
to the time and captures the very
different social backgrounds.
The long scene in the sewers
will serve as an example to Waj
da for his Kanal. The movie is
very important for the reasons
spelled out above but there are
others which can be found out
only by the viewer, and it would
spoil the thrill and the suspense
to give a full account of the
story and a more detailed criti
cism.
