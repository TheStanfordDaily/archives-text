## Poor Cast Hurts 'Balcony' 
### JANE CIABATTABI 
Although marred by inconsis

tencies in execution and over
cautious editing, the Playhouse
Repertory Theatre's production
of Jean Genet's The Balcony is
worthy of attention on the basis
of the play itself.
Genet presents his perception
of the ubiquitous dichotomy be
tween illusion and reality, image
and function, within a strikingly
original and complex frame
work. His brothel (the balcony)
is at once a house of illusions
in which the visitors are allow
ed to indulge in their wildest
fantasies, and a metaphor for
Genet's view of contemporary
existence.

In order to meet the challenge
of this difficult play, director
David Lindeman should have
provided a more intelligent dis
tribution of emphasis and great
er control for the members of
the cast. Perhaps then the actors
could have projected Genet's
philosophical pronouncements as
convincingly as they did his sex
ual puns.
Because the actors themselves
did not utilize the opportunities
for character development inher
ent in Genet's play, their por
trayals were, for the most part,
disappointing and one-dimen
sional.
Joyce Lancaster as Irma, the
Madam, appeared unable to sac
rifice a regal image to achieve
dramatic credibility. She with
held involvement in the role un
til near the end, when Irma im
personates the Queen. Her flex
ible portrayal of the Madam
lacked the essential transition
from hardened creator of illu
sions to victim of illusion. Only
when acting the part of the
Queen is she convincing.
The presentation of the rela
tionship between Irma and the
Chief of Police, played by Thorn
Rhodes, falls short of its poten
tial because of the weakness of
Rhodes' portrayal. The signifi
cance of the Chief of Police de
pends on the gradual revelation
of the impotence and egomania
beneath his superficial strength
and power. Because Rhodes'
Chief is pathetic from his first
appearance, there is no oppor
tunity for the audience to wit
ness the process of destruction,
and the impact of the charact
er's development is lessened.
The introductory scenes, in
volving the prostitutes and their
clients were well-staged and act
ed, with noteworthy perform
ances by Merike Leitso, Cherie
Jenson, Lewis and Allen Rob
ertson. The near-nudity of the
girls was tastefully handled.
Manuel Miro's portrayal of the
Bishop was marred by his self
conscious buffoonery, and Jack
Nance was mediocre as Arthur,
the Executioner.
The rebel scene in the second
act was damaged by rough, in
sensitive acting and poor cast
ing. The significance of the state
of revolution which surrounds
the brothel is lost in the confu
sion of the performance, thus
dissolving the parallel between
external and internal conflicts
which is necessary to a satis
factory resolution of the play.
Keith Reagan as the Envoy,
Christopher Brent as Roger, and
Carol Campbell as Carmen are to
be commended for the coherence
and consistency of their per
formances.
