# Collector Dahl To Speak On Tobey's Work
## 
### 
Arthur Dahl, California art
collector and personal friend of
Mark Tobey, is to give a lecture
on "The Work of Mark Tobey"
at 8:00, Monday, July 31 in
room 320 of the Geology Build
ing. Fifty of Tobey's calligra
phic works, selected from Dahl's
private collection are being
shown in the Stanford Art Gal
lery through August 13.
Tobey, the only American art
ist to have a major exhibit at
the Louvre, is noted for his inno
vative "white writing" techni
que of painting and for the tid
bits of social comment he in
jects into his representational
works. In his "white writing"
style, each figure is outlined in
white Chinese ink, giving them
a common denominator and yet,
at the same time, accentuating
their individual emotion.
"Tobey is one of the most sig
nificant American artists," said
Lorenz Eitner, head of the Stan
ford Art Department. "He has
coordinated his art with a deeply
meditative personal philosophy
and became a unique phenome
non in contemporary art." His
philosophical beliefs are based
on ideas of the Baha'i Faith, and
it is through this religious group
that he met Dahl. The latter is
the Treasurer of the National
Administrative Board of the
Baha'i Faith. In his talk, Dahl
will emphasize the religious as
pects of Tobey's paintings.
