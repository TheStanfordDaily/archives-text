## Why Bother With Studies? 
### Robert E. Stone 
There is an attitude beginning
to spread among college-age stu
dents which must cause every
one to shiver in mortal dread.
This attitude says that knowl
edge for knowledge's sake is a
good thing.
This attitude is used by many
as an excuse for studying sub
jects which otherwise would
never be incorporated into a
curriculum; subjects like West
ern Civilization, philosophy, and
paleontology.
These courses, and the hun
dreds of others like them, have
been created by shrewd minds
who see in them nothing of value
to anyone. But, because they
constitute "scientific research,"
they provide a great opportunity
to obtain research grants and
to live very comfortably while
dealing with a mass of esoteric
trivia.
These shrewd minds pass on
the information that they have
gleaned in the course of their
research to unsuspecting stu
dents who consider it "part of
their education." Should any of
these shrewd minds be question
ed on the pap that they are try
ing to spoon feed the younger
generation, they condemn the
student as being anti-intellectual.

At the end of the four-year
indoctrination known as college,
trauma sets in. The BA or BS
degree is worth about $350 per
month to the new statistic in
the labor force. Picture if you
will the sweet young thing go
ing up to the personnel manager
of some big company. The con
versation might go something
like this:
Personnel Manager: Now I see
on your application that you
graduated from Stanford.
Sweet young thing: Yes, sir.
Personnel manager: What was
your major?
Sweet young thing: Social
Thought.
Personnel manager: I see.
What job were you interested
in having?
Sweet young thing: Anything
that I'm qualified for.
Personnel manager: I see.
How fast do you type?
Sweet young thing: 40 words
per minute.
Personnel manager: How
about shorthand?
Sweet young thing: I don't
know shorthand.
Personnel manager: Well, that
should do it. We'll let you know.
Now picture the same conver
sation taking place between a

highschool drop-out who types
at 115 words per minute and
takes shorthand at 75 words per
minute.
Personnel manager: I think we
have a job for you at $600 per
month.
All this goes to show that col
lege students are being duped.
Unfortunately by the time they
realize that their studies have no
practical application whatsoever,
there is nothing they can do
about it. They must complete
the sequence.
There was once a professor
here at Stanford, who summed
the situation up in the following
manner. If you are a four-point
student, you will always be in
demand on the cocktail party
circuit. This professor was re
fused tenure, although he was
one of the best thought of by
his students.
The myth of "knowledge for
knowledge's sake" cannot be de
stroyed from within. It is up to
the students who are the victims
of that myth to rise up and
overthrow the false values they
are handed in the name of a
"well-rounded education."
