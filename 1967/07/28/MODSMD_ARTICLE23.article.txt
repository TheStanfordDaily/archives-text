## Danger: Squirrels 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to lodge a further pro
test against the animal popula
tion on this campus: the squir
rels. As was recently published
in the noted medical magazine
Compendium Hypochondriaca,
squirrels in the bay area are
prone to be carriers of Patagon
ian Fever, which has since been
proven to have a subtle but dev
astating effect on students.
In view of the fact that the
probability of an epidemic of
this disease is unknown, I think
it mandatory that all the squir
rels on this campus be rooted
out — lock, stock and under
growth. And while I'm on the
subject, let's not forget the
swallows and the quail! Every
one knows that in addition to
the physical hazard caused by
the careening flights of these
birds they are often carriers of
Multiple Congolese Anaemia.
Don't let the fact that these
animals exist in the society at
large be used as an excuse;
Stanford was created to be a

city on the hill to the rest of the
world in Engineering and Hu
manities, and thus it should be
in Hygiene as well.
University Health Officer Hal
W. Wilson has convincingly
demonstrated that the Stanford
Community has a serious health
problem as it is (mental) and
Grounds and Maintenance as
sures us that the nonhuman ani
mal population is actually grow
ing. Believe me, Things Are Ac
tually Creeping Up On Us! I'm
for the final solution.

Editor, The Daily:
I cannot help but agree with
your columnist, Mr. Lane; he
has absolutely nothing to de
fend — he has absolutely nothing
worth defending.
His most recent effort is a
case in point. The reply to his
arguments for the draft is
simple. If soldiers will not work
at the rates offered, raise the
rates. The theory of compen
sating differentials implies that
men will indeed work for long
periods in low prestige posi
tions, if they are given high
enough pay.
Men will also enter a career
with a short "job expectancy",
if it pays well enough while they
work or if it offers a suitable
pension. This would solve his
problem of an army of paunchy
middle aged men, without even
pointing out that the army is
increasingly in need of highly
trained men, as well as young
fighters.
All Mr. Lane has done is to
say that he does not want to pay
higher taxes so that citizens of
the United States can be freed
from involuntary servitude and
possible infinite taxation. There
may be arguments for a con
script army, but Mr. Lane's ar
guments, as usual, are not they.
