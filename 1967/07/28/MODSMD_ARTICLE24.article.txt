## What Hath Watts Wrought? 
### Kirk Hanen 
The DiagnOstical and Statisti
cal Manual published by the
American, Psychiatric Associa
tion has this to say about the
sociopathic personality:
"This term refers to chronical
ly antisocial individuals who are
always in trouble, profiting
neither from experience nor
punishment, and maintaining no
real loyalties to any person,
group, or code. They are fre
quently callous and hedonistic,
showing marked emotional im
maturity, with lack of sense of
responsibility, lack of judgment,
and an ability to rationalize their
behavior so that it appears war
ranted, reasonable and justified."
If the adjective "sociopathic"
can be used in describing a na
tion, perhaps it would fit well
along side the United States.
It's been two years now since
riots erupted in Watts, and the
United States seems no closer to
compatible color — black, white,
and yellow together.
The FBI is still using cannons
to shoot down flies, and making
enemies in the process. They ar
rested SNCC Chairman H. Rap
Brown Wednesday for inciting a
group to riot in Cambridge, Md. t
which seems as absurd as blam
ing the Vietnam conflict solely
on Lyndon Johnson.
In the last week alone, major
civil disorders have broken out
in Detroit, New Vork City, Phoe
nix, Chicago, and South Bend,
Ind. And the worst part of it is,
no one knows why; no one
knows where or when to expect

the next riots. All that can be
said with any surety is that
there will Im* more.
Government will continue to
"solve" problems with costly
committees. < Not surprisingly,
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield has proposed a War
ren Commission-type panel to
study the race problem. What
this country definitely does not
need is another Warren Commis
sion. Instead of resoiving estab
lished conflicts, the last one only
created new ones.)
The problem itself cannot In
conscience be given a name. It
is surely not strictly a "Negro"
problem or a "black" problem,
for many millions of law abid
ing Negro citizens have nothing
to riot about, and probably
wouldn't do so if they did.
Perhaps there is no solution
to this nameless problem. Per
haps it is only the death rattle
of a passing society — one in
which individuals could never
accept each other as individuals;
a society whose members called
what they disliked "extremism"
—whether of the Right or of the
Left; a society which felt more
secure in the knowledge of ex
pedients than of truth.

are they now?

ample.

sociopathic personality:

punishment, and maintaining no
real loyalties to any person,
group, or code. They are fre
