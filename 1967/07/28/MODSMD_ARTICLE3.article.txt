# Med, Law Schools, Hoover, Library Receive $2.5 Million In Grants
## 
### 
More than $2.5 million has been
awarded to Stanford University this
week in grants from four separate
sources.
It was announced Wednesday that
the late Ira S. Lilliek bequeathed $1,-
772,980 to Stanford. Lilliek was a life
long friend of the late Herbert Hoov
er and had served on the Stanford
University Board of Trustees from
1923 to 1960, resigning just after the
late former president did.
Half of the sum is intended to go
to the law school, with one-quarter for
the Hoover Institute on War, Revolu
tion and Peace, and the remainder to
be disbursed as the trustees wish.
Computer Libraries
Practical ways for large university
libraries to manage the "knowledge
explosion" with computers will be de
veloped at Stanford with a $417,000
grant from the U.S. Office of Educa
tion.
The Stanford study is based on ac
cess to a central time-sharing com
puter used for many different pur
poses by all university departments.
It will cover all academic disciplines
and adhere closely to national stand
ards for library automation.
Major university libraries now ac
quire between 50,000 and 200,000 new
books annually — and the rate is
growing rapidly. In addition to the
cost of each volume, the library
spends about $10 to get a book incorp
orated into its present system. Once
there, it can be retrieved by a scholar
in minutes or days — depending on
where it is in the information "pipe
line" and how easily the book can
be found in conventional card cata

logs, which are becoming increasingly
complex and difficult to use.
The initial emphasis of the Stanford
project will be in this area — the
selection, purchasing cataloging, in
dexing, preparation of materials for
public use, and circulation of materials
to users.
Allen B. Veaner, principal investi
gator for the project, commented that
his objective is "a realistically orient
ed, functional program, covering all
areas of library sevrice to the univer
sity, including book fund accounting
and other internal operations.
Animal Study Funds
One of the two grants awarded to
the School of Medicine amounts to
$281,000, and is intended for construc
tion of an Animal Research Center
Funds are provided by the National
Institutes of Health.
One of the most advanced of its
kind in the nation, the center will be
located on Stanford land in the foot
hills just southwest of the main cam
pus. The proposed buildings will con
tain approximately 14,000 square feet
of space with an additional 4,000
square feet of outdoor pens and ken
nels. The central facility, a single
story building of reinforced concrete,
will provide laboratories for the study
of animal diseases, operating rooms,
research laboratories and support fa
cilities.
Orland Seave, director of the
Animal Care Facilities, stated, "In
spite of the tremendous advances in
medicine in the past 50 years, there
are still many unknowns — cures for
cancer, diseases of the heart and cir

culation, and the problems of ageing
and mental retardation. Undoubtedly,
animal research will play an import
ant role in research directed toward
the solution of these problems in the
future."
March of Dimes
The Medical School was the recipi
ent of an additional grant of $69,403
from the National Foundation of the
March of Dimes. Funds will be used
for continuation of the Med School's
search into the causes, treatment and
prevention of birth defects.
Stanford operates a birth defects
study center as a unit of its de
partment of pediatrics. The center,
established by the National Founda
tion in 1963, is directed by Dr. Norman
Kretchmer, professor and executive
head of the department.

Among investigations under way at
the center is a study of the role play
ed by Vitamin C in Hurler's disease,
also known as gargoylism. An esti
mated one in 10,000 infants is born
with this affliction. Although the
child looks normal at birth, during the
first two years of life the head en
larges, the features thicken and
growth is stunted to the point that
the children resemble medieval gar
goyles. They usually die at an early
age.
Stanford researchers have added
Vitamin C to skin cultures from Hur
ler's disease victims and from normal
subjects. They found no significant
change in the normal cultures, but
there was an increased chemical reac
tion in the diseased culture, similar
to a reaction which occurs to excess in
these patients, and is thought to cause
the thickening of various body parts.
