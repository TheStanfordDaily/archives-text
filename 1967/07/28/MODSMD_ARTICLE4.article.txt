# Tanner Discusses US Authors

### 
Dr. Anthony Tanner, Fellow of
King's College, Cambridge University,
spoke Tuesday night on "Henry James
on Hawthorne — The Idea of an Amer
ican Artist," and last night on "The
Retrospective Vision of Henry Adams
and Henry James."
In his Tuesday night lecture, Tan
ner asserted that no one was more in
fluential on James' work than Haw
thorne. Late in life, James even recog
nized this fact, respectfully calling
Hawthorne "the last pure American"
and the first American artist. But,
as Tanner observed, the young James
had a different view of Hawthorne.
Indeed, in 1878, two years after he
had decided to settle in England,
James wrote a critical biography of
his mentor.
Addressed to his new British au
dience, James' book stressed the pro
vinciality of America and of its first
great writer — Hawthorne. In this
way James hoped to prove that he had
transcended the backwardness of his
native country. James wrote that
American artists, including Haw

thorne, were simple, childlike and in
nocent.
He wanted to forget his American
past and to become a novelist in the
continental manner. In short, he want
ed to write like Balzac. But, according
to Tanner, he never achieved his goal.
He could never put Hawthorne out of
his mind, even thought he had pub
lically branded Hawthorne a self-con
scious, immature author.
As Tanner observed, James owes
a great deal to Hawthorne, from his
use of images to thematic influences.
For example, the image of "dust" fas
cinated both Hawthorne and James.
Both artists capitalized on the glum
iness which that image connotes. Simi
larly, Tanner observed that both writ
ers constantly used the theme evil ex
ploiting people.
By the end of the 1880's, some twelve
years after he wrote his belittling cri
ticism of Hawthorne's work, James
began to recognize Hawthorne's great
ness. He even conceded "that an
American can be an artist." This re
alization, Tanner concluded, is one of
Hawthorne's most valuable influences
on James.

In last night's lecture Tanner ex
plained how James and Henry Adams
differed on their views of the past.
Both authors were pessimistic about
man and the course of history. Where
as Adams sought to order the past,
James yielded to it. James, whom
Tanner calls an artist, loved to recap
ture all the myriad of details of his
past. He regarded these facts — "his
goldust" — as important in them
selves.
Adams, whom Tanner described as
a philosopher, tried to order the facts
of history. He believed that only the
mind could bestow unity, but, as he
discovered later in life, the mind is too
ignorant to find the unity in the uni
verse. Adams, therefore, concluded
that "no one or nothing could tell him
what it all means." "Humans," Adams
was also led to believe, "were inher
ently unstable." And he pessimistical
ly predicted the world would end in
1917. In short, Tanner concluded,
Adams was more pessimistic about
man than James because he sought to
explain the whole of the universe, an
impossible task. James, however, only
sought to order his own life.
