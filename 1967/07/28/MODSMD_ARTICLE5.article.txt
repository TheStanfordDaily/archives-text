# Murray Named To Med School Planning Group
## 
### 
Dr. George R. Murray Jr., a speci
a'ist in system analysis, has been ap
pointed director of the Stanford Medi
cal Facilities Planning Group.
The announcement was made July
25 by Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice-presi
dent of medical affairs and dean of
the School of Medicine.
Dr. Murray, 36, and a staff of nine
specialists will work on designing the
physician structure and operational
system of the proposed new hospital
and ambulatory care center. In their
work, they will collaborate with the
medical faculty and experts in non
medical r! partments and schools of
the University.
Diagnosis ami Treatment
"Medical science to date has focused
on specific techniques of diagnosis and
treatment," said Dr. Murray. "Rela
tively little thought has been devoted
to the total system by which health
care is administered.
"Stanford is unique in having on
one campus both a major medical
school and a department of engineer
ing-economic systems devoted to the
design of complex technical-economic
systems.
"Our study will concentrate specifi
cally on patient care and the teaching
function of a medical school hospital.
I regard this as an example of inter
action between medicine, technology
and engineering that can lead us to
more effective and less costly health
care systems," Dr. Murray said.
The School of Medicine recently re
ceived a $500,000 planning grant from
the Commonwealth Fund of New
York to initiate studies toward a solu

tion of the widespread national prob
lem of escalating medical care costs.
Dr. Murray's staff members include
men from such fields as system ana
lysis, economics, hospital management,
and computer technology. They are:
Chief System Analyst Dr Richard D.
Smallwood, assistant professor of en
gineering-economic systems at Stan
ford, and his staff, Fred L. Offensend,
Daniel D. Silva and Edward J. Sondik.
Selections By Fall
James Stanford, currently assistant
to the financial vice-president of Gen
eral Mills, Inc., will join the planning
group next month. Other staff mem
bers will be selected by fall.
Dr. Murray and his staff will work
with Bertrand Goldberg Associates of
Chicago, recently named as architec
tural consultants for. the proposed ex
pansion.
During the study, Dr. Murray will
take a leave of absence from the de
partment of engineering-economic sys
tems at Stanford where he has been
an associate professor since 1965. Dr.
Murray received his B.A. degree from
Harvard in 1952 and a Ph.D. from
M.I.T. in 1956.
400-500 Beds
Stanford's proposed health facilities,
which will include a 400 to 500-bed
hospital, will seek two objectives. Fa
cilities will be related to the specific
stages of care required by the pa
tient, from those needing minimal
supervision to patients requiring in
tensive care. Comprehensive-care ser
vice, stressing ambulatory, or outpa
tient care, will be an integral part of
this concept.

more effective and less costly health
care systems," Dr. Murray said.
The School of Medicine recently re
ceived a $500,000 planning grant from
the Commonwealth Fund of New
York to initiate studies toward a solu

tion of the widespread national prob
lem of escalating medical care costs.
Dr. Murray's staff members include
men from such fields as system ana
lysis, economics, hospital management,
and computer technology. They are:
Chief System Analyst Dr Richard D.
Smallwood, assistant professor of en
gineering-economic systems at Stan
ford, and his staff, Fred L. Offensend,
Daniel D. Silva and Edward J. Sondik.
Selections By Fall
James Stanford, currently assistant
to the financial vice-president of Gen
eral Mills, Inc., will join the planning
group next month. Other staff mem
bers will be selected by fall.
Dr. Murray and his staff will work
with Bertrand Goldberg Associates of
Chicago, recently named as architec
tural consultants for. the proposed ex
pansion.
During the study, Dr. Murray will
take a leave of absence from the de
partment of engineering-economic sys
tems at Stanford where he has been
an associate professor since 1965. Dr.
Murray received his B.A. degree from
Harvard in 1952 and a Ph.D. from
M.I.T. in 1956.
400-500 Beds
Stanford's proposed health facilities,
which will include a 400 to 500-bed
hospital, will seek two objectives. Fa
cilities will be related to the specific
stages of care required by the pa
tient, from those needing minimal
supervision to patients requiring in
tensive care. Comprehensive-care ser
vice, stressing ambulatory, or outpa
tient care, will be an integral part of
this concept.
Dr. George R. Murray Jr., a speci
a'ist in system analysis, has been ap
pointed director of the Stanford Medi
cal Facilities Planning Group.
The announcement was made July
25 by Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice-presi
dent of medical affairs and dean of
the School of Medicine.
Dr. Murray, 36, and a staff of nine
specialists will work on designing the
physician structure and operational
system of the proposed new hospital
and ambulatory care center. In their
work, they will collaborate with the
medical faculty and experts in non
medical r! partments and schools of
the University.
Diagnosis ami Treatment
"Medical science to date has focused
on specific techniques of diagnosis and
treatment," said Dr. Murray. "Rela
tively little thought has been devoted
to the total system by which health
care is administered.
"Stanford is unique in having on
one campus both a major medical
school and a department of engineer
ing-economic systems devoted to the
design of complex technical-economic
systems.
"Our study will concentrate specifi
cally on patient care and the teaching
function of a medical school hospital.
I regard this as an example of inter
action between medicine, technology
and engineering that can lead us to
more effective and less costly health
care systems," Dr. Murray said.
