## Quartet And Jazz Band Display Virtuosity 
### FRED ROSENBERG ROBERT E. STONE 
The Philadelphia Quartet bowed
in at Dinkelspiel Auditorium Monday
with a varied and interesting program
and display of virtuosity. The quar
tet, composed of Veda Reynolds and
Irwin Eisenberg, violins; Alan Iglit
zin, viola; and Charles Brennard, vio
loncello; began the evening by filing
on stage, all dressed in white, and
taking seats behind the music stands.
Works by Haydn, Bassett, Kirchner,
and Beethoven were offered.
The opener was the Quartet, Opus
3 Number 3, subtitled Tlie Bird, by
Franz Josef Haydn.
The Focus on America portion of
the program followed. The Five
Pieces for String Quartet by Leslie
Bassett are original and very expres
sive numbers. Although the music is
demanding, it was handled terrific
ally. The full range of musical emo
tions in the "Five Pieces", from fear
to guilt, was captured admirably by
the four virtuosi. The string quartets
of Leon Kirchner have brought him
world renown (the Pulitzer Prize in

music this year was the most recent
example). The Quartet written in
1949 was the third offering of the
Philadelphia Quartet. A very intense
work, the Quartet was well perform
ed. The rich sonorities and melodic
lines were brought forth fully and
lyrically.
During the ensuing intermission
the audience warmed up to the con
cluding work on the program. The
Philadelphia Quartet seemingly did
not.
The First Rasumovsky Quartet,
Opus 59, No. 1, by Yudwig von Beeth
oven, is a difficult work, but the tech
nical difficulties it presents do not
rival those of the American works
heard earlier. The Philadelphia group
was simply not up to the music. Phras
ings were sometimes awkward, differ
ing from those written. Each member
of the quartet flubbed at least one
solo passage. Notes were frequently
missed or badly out of tune. The en
semble was missing, and sloppy in
tonation led to a harsh sound. One
did not get the impression that the
performers liked the music.

The violinists play the violin very
well; the cellist plays the cello very
well; the violist plays his intrument
aso very well. Each quartet member
is a fine instrumentalist in his own
right. However, the quartet perfor
mance was more than a conglomera
tion of individual talents. The essence
of chamber music lies in the team ef
fort. The Philadelphia Quartet show
ed that it is capable of very good per
formance.
Perhaps to redeem itself after the
errors of the performance of the
Beethoven quartet, the Philadelphia
Quartet played as an encore the Pres
to movement from the Opus 130
Quartet by Beethoven. It worked.
The quartet was warmly received.

It is a rare moment in the entertain
ment world when the performers get
as much from performing as the au
dience does from the performance.
Preservation Hall Jazz Band provides
one of those moments.
Headed by Billie and DeDe Pierce,
the band moved into the Summer
Festival Jazz Tent last Monday. They
have been pouring out the vibrant
sounds of traditional jazz to packed
houses ever since.
The band's motto is "Oldest of the
living old," but they are more than
that. They are "living Jazz." Listening
to the sounds they produce and
watching people who look like jazz
musicians instantly carries the audi
ence to old New Orleans where it all
began.
It is difficult to cite a single mem
ber of the band as being better than
the rest. Surely DeDe stands out for
his singing and cornet playing, both
of which are exciting and beautiful.
Billie Pierce is equally exciting with
her blues singing in the style of the
late, great Bessie Smith
It is a tribute to the other members
of the band, however, that the per

formances of their leaders do not hide
their own abilities. Albert Warner
makes his trombone an instrument of
love as he carefully carresses all of
its potential from it.
Cie Frazier's reputation as the sur
viving virtuoso New Orleans drum
mer proves well-deserved as he makes
his sticks do what few drummers can
do with their hands. George Lewis
makes his clarinet come alive as it
issues forth all the wails and tones
for which the clarinet is famous.
Narvin Kimball is the band's banjo
player and captures the audience
with his vibrant and moving solos.
His rendition of Going to my Jesus
was one of the high points of the eve
ning. The final member of the band
is bass player Chester Zardis, who,
in addition to providing a sure bass
beat for the group, actually played
the melody in one portion of When
the Saints Go Marchin' In.
The most glowing tribute that can
be paid to Preservation Hall Jazz
Band is provided by their audiences
who have come back night after night
to sit on hard, uncomfortable seats
and listen to the old masters play
four hours of great traditional jazz.

as much from performing as the au
dience does from the performance.
Preservation Hall Jazz Band provides
one of those moments.
Headed by Billie and DeDe Pierce,
the band moved into the Summer
Festival Jazz Tent last Monday. They
have been pouring out the vibrant
sounds of traditional jazz to packed
houses ever since.
The band's motto is "Oldest of the
living old," but they are more than
that. They are "living Jazz." Listening
to the sounds they produce and
watching people who look like jazz
musicians instantly carries the audi
ence to old New Orleans where it all
began.
It is difficult to cite a single mem
ber of the band as being better than
the rest. Surely DeDe stands out for
his singing and cornet playing, both
of which are exciting and beautiful.
Billie Pierce is equally exciting with
her blues singing in the style of the
late, great Bessie Smith
It is a tribute to the other members
of the band, however, that the per

formances of their leaders do not hide
their own abilities. Albert Warner
makes his trombone an instrument of
love as he carefully carresses all of
its potential from it.
Cie Frazier's reputation as the sur
viving virtuoso New Orleans drum
mer proves well-deserved as he makes
his sticks do what few drummers can
do with their hands. George Lewis
makes his clarinet come alive as it
issues forth all the wails and tones
for which the clarinet is famous.
Narvin Kimball is the band's banjo
player and captures the audience
with his vibrant and moving solos.
His rendition of Going to my Jesus
was one of the high points of the eve
ning. The final member of the band
is bass player Chester Zardis, who,
in addition to providing a sure bass
beat for the group, actually played
the melody in one portion of When
the Saints Go Marchin' In.
The most glowing tribute that can
be paid to Preservation Hall Jazz
Band is provided by their audiences
who have come back night after night
to sit on hard, uncomfortable seats
and listen to the old masters play
four hours of great traditional jazz.


DEDE FIERCE
The Philadelphia Quartet bowed
in at Dinkelspiel Auditorium Monday
with a varied and interesting program
and display of virtuosity. The quar
tet, composed of Veda Reynolds and
Irwin Eisenberg, violins; Alan Iglit
zin, viola; and Charles Brennard, vio
loncello; began the evening by filing
on stage, all dressed in white, and
taking seats behind the music stands.
Works by Haydn, Bassett, Kirchner,
and Beethoven were offered.
The opener was the Quartet, Opus
3 Number 3, subtitled Tlie Bird, by
Franz Josef Haydn.
The Focus on America portion of
the program followed. The Five
Pieces for String Quartet by Leslie
Bassett are original and very expres
sive numbers. Although the music is
demanding, it was handled terrific
ally. The full range of musical emo
tions in the "Five Pieces", from fear
to guilt, was captured admirably by
the four virtuosi. The string quartets
of Leon Kirchner have brought him
world renown (the Pulitzer Prize in

music this year was the most recent
example). The Quartet written in
1949 was the third offering of the
Philadelphia Quartet. A very intense
work, the Quartet was well perform
ed. The rich sonorities and melodic
lines were brought forth fully and
lyrically.
During the ensuing intermission
the audience warmed up to the con
cluding work on the program. The
Philadelphia Quartet seemingly did
not.
The First Rasumovsky Quartet,
Opus 59, No. 1, by Yudwig von Beeth
oven, is a difficult work, but the tech
nical difficulties it presents do not
rival those of the American works
heard earlier. The Philadelphia group
was simply not up to the music. Phras
ings were sometimes awkward, differ
ing from those written. Each member
of the quartet flubbed at least one
solo passage. Notes were frequently
missed or badly out of tune. The en
semble was missing, and sloppy in
tonation led to a harsh sound. One
did not get the impression that the
performers liked the music.

The violinists play the violin very
well; the cellist plays the cello very
well; the violist plays his intrument
aso very well. Each quartet member
is a fine instrumentalist in his own
right. However, the quartet perfor
mance was more than a conglomera
tion of individual talents. The essence
of chamber music lies in the team ef
fort. The Philadelphia Quartet show
ed that it is capable of very good per
formance.
Perhaps to redeem itself after the
errors of the performance of the
Beethoven quartet, the Philadelphia
Quartet played as an encore the Pres
to movement from the Opus 130
Quartet by Beethoven. It worked.
The quartet was warmly received.

sive numbers. Although the music is
demanding, it was handled terrific
ally. The full range of musical emo
tions in the "Five Pieces", from fear
to guilt, was captured admirably by
the four virtuosi. The string quartets
of Leon Kirchner have brought him
world renown (the Pulitzer Prize in

music this year was the most recent
example). The Quartet written in
1949 was the third offering of the
Philadelphia Quartet. A very intense
work, the Quartet was well perform
ed. The rich sonorities and melodic
lines were brought forth fully and
lyrically.
During the ensuing intermission
the audience warmed up to the con
cluding work on the program. The
Philadelphia Quartet seemingly did
not.
The First Rasumovsky Quartet,
Opus 59, No. 1, by Yudwig von Beeth
oven, is a difficult work, but the tech
nical difficulties it presents do not
rival those of the American works
heard earlier. The Philadelphia group
was simply not up to the music. Phras
ings were sometimes awkward, differ
ing from those written. Each member
of the quartet flubbed at least one
solo passage. Notes were frequently
missed or badly out of tune. The en
semble was missing, and sloppy in
tonation led to a harsh sound. One
did not get the impression that the
performers liked the music.

The violinists play the violin very
well; the cellist plays the cello very
well; the violist plays his intrument
aso very well. Each quartet member
is a fine instrumentalist in his own
right. However, the quartet perfor
mance was more than a conglomera
tion of individual talents. The essence
of chamber music lies in the team ef
fort. The Philadelphia Quartet show
ed that it is capable of very good per
formance.
Perhaps to redeem itself after the
errors of the performance of the
Beethoven quartet, the Philadelphia
Quartet played as an encore the Pres
to movement from the Opus 130
Quartet by Beethoven. It worked.
The quartet was warmly received.

It is a rare moment in the entertain
ment world when the performers get
as much from performing as the au
dience does from the performance.
Preservation Hall Jazz Band provides
one of those moments.
Headed by Billie and DeDe Pierce,
the band moved into the Summer
Festival Jazz Tent last Monday. They
have been pouring out the vibrant
sounds of traditional jazz to packed
houses ever since.
The band's motto is "Oldest of the
living old," but they are more than
that. They are "living Jazz." Listening
to the sounds they produce and
watching people who look like jazz
musicians instantly carries the audi
ence to old New Orleans where it all
began.
It is difficult to cite a single mem
ber of the band as being better than
the rest. Surely DeDe stands out for
his singing and cornet playing, both
of which are exciting and beautiful.
Billie Pierce is equally exciting with
her blues singing in the style of the
late, great Bessie Smith
It is a tribute to the other members
of the band, however, that the per

formances of their leaders do not hide
their own abilities. Albert Warner
makes his trombone an instrument of
love as he carefully carresses all of
its potential from it.
Cie Frazier's reputation as the sur
viving virtuoso New Orleans drum
mer proves well-deserved as he makes
his sticks do what few drummers can
do with their hands. George Lewis
makes his clarinet come alive as it
issues forth all the wails and tones
for which the clarinet is famous.
Narvin Kimball is the band's banjo
player and captures the audience
with his vibrant and moving solos.
His rendition of Going to my Jesus
was one of the high points of the eve
ning. The final member of the band
is bass player Chester Zardis, who,
in addition to providing a sure bass
beat for the group, actually played
the melody in one portion of When
the Saints Go Marchin' In.
The most glowing tribute that can
be paid to Preservation Hall Jazz
Band is provided by their audiences
who have come back night after night
to sit on hard, uncomfortable seats
and listen to the old masters play
four hours of great traditional jazz.
