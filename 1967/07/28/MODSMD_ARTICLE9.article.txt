# Anesthesiology Training Grant Awarded To Medical School
## 
### 
A $21,000 grant has been
awarded to the Stanford Univer
sity School of Medicine to in
crease the number of physicians
training in anesthesiology, and
to upgrade the quality of the
training program.
The new program, supported
by the National Institutes of
Health, is part of a national ef
fort to improve patient care by
expanding anesthesiology train
ing.
Dr. Ellis N. Cohen, professor
of anesthesia, will direct the pro
gram.
New Areas
"The increased compexity of
today's medical care has opened
many new areas in which the
anesthetist is now concerned,
and expanded training programs
are required to meet these addi
tional needs," Dr. Cohen points
out.
"The scholarly environment in
a teaching hospital such as ours
is an essential element to the
training of highly qualified clini
cal anesthesiologists," he says.

"Our clinical and teaching fac
ulty can provide a high level of
training in both the basic and
the clinical sciences."
Two candidates will be chosen
from present applicants or from
residents currently in the anes
thesiology residency program.
Initial training will begin this
fall. Plans call for a third trainee
to be selected for next year, and
two additional trainees in 1969-
70.
Curriculum
The curriculum will incorpor
ate the present two-year pro
gram in anesthesiology and pro
vides an additional year of spe
cial training. One of the two
trainees will direct his third year
towards the anesthetic manage
ment of the patient for cardiac
surgery, and the second trainee
will spend his third year in acute
medical care.
The Stanford grant is part of
a million dollars awarded to 30
teaching hospitals in 21 states
and in Puerto Rico for anethe
siology training programs.
