# ACT To Close 'Season' With 'USA' And 'Seesaw'
## 
### 
American Conservatory The
atre will debut two more pro
ductions before bringing to a
close this summer's "Focus on
America" Festival. USA, John
Dos Passos' review of American
life in the Twenties, opens Aug.
3, to be followed August 11 by
William Gibson's comedy, Two

for the Seesaw. Both plays will
be staged in Memorial Auditor
ium and presented four times.
USA is Robert W. Goldsby's
first directing stint for ACT.
Drama professor at UC-Berkeley,
he directed three plays for Act
or's Workshop and more than
20 plays at Berkeley.

He interprets the play as a
character role, a "what-happens
next? kind of thing." Of it he
says,"It has an enormous
amount of vitality and American
music, American voices, Ameri
can stereotypes, American
charm."
A veritable feast of Ameri
cana, circa 1900-30, the play fea
tures the use of period music,
film clips, headlines, and per
sonalities including Rudolph
Valentino, the Wright Brothers,
Eugene V. Debs and Isadore
Duncan.
The play dramatizes the life
and times of Moorehouse, a pub
lic relations genius and a per
sonal failure. Six actors fill all
the roles.
Goldsby has cast Patrick To
vatt, John Schuck, Mark Bram
hall, Dana Larson, Charlene Po
lite and Judith Mihalyi for USA.
He says,"The actors love it.
They love it because it has mu
sic and energy and pace and vi
tality."
Period music was selected and
arranged by John Swakhammer
from a private collection. Dance
consultant for the production is
Davitt H. Kasdan.
Two for the Seesaw, ACT'S
final production for the Festival,
is directed by Byron Ringland.
Barbara Colby will portray Git-

Tel Mosca and Ramon Bieri will
play Jerry Ryan in the lover's
comedy about a New York
dancer and a Midwestern busi
nessman who leaves his wife to
live with Gittel in New York
City.
During the Festival, Miss Col
by has appeared as Mrs. Patrick
Campbell in Dear Liar. Bieri por
trayed John Proctor in Arthur
Miller's The Crucible.
Playwright Gibson produces
high tension between the two
characters as they explore each
other's personalities in a series
of intimate revelations. Seesaw
has been successful both as a
Broadway show and a motion
picture.
Members of the ACT troupe
involved in these two produc
tions will participate in informal
audience briefings before both
of the plays. These are given
at 4:30 p.m. in Tresidder Memo
rial Union's large lounge; for
USA on Friday, August 4; and
for Two for the Seesaw on
Thursday, August 10.
Productions for USA will be
given at 8:00 p.m. August 3, 4
and 6 and at 2:30 p.m. on August
5. Two for the Seesaw will be
performed August 11, 12 and 13
at 8:00 p.m. and at 2:30 p.m.
August 12.
