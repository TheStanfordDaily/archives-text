• Betrayed
Mi tor, The Daily:
In the interview given to
David Ransom of the Midpenin
supla Observer, I spoke with all
frankness about the views of
our group and also some of our
presidential candidate in the
hope and on the assumption that
these views would receive an
adequate publication in the Ob
server.
As it turns out, they were sub
ject to some kind of political
"meat - grinding", distortion
based, I suppose, on the very
great information and cultural
gap that exists between a strang
er to Vietnamese politics and
native Vietnamese politically ac
tive, and also on the political
credo held by the reporter.
It is a great mistake to assume
that any anti-Communist South
Vietnamese should be identified
with the Saigon military junta,
with the image of an American
puppet. If everybody should
agree with the reporter, I think

in that case there are only two
alternatives left to the Vietna
mese: either the U.S. or the
Hanoi regime. This war fortu
nately involves many other vari
ables, and I do not expect every
American to be at ease with this
complexity.
It is not my intention to chal
lenge somebody who knows
nothing about the situation. Of
ten, one solves this fundamental
lack by taking one extreme stand
or the other, and then wastes
precious time in criticizing. It is
very unfortunate because this
nonconstructive view does not
get you closer to a better view
of people from another culture.
Local parties involved in this
war do not respect such persons.
Blind leftists are just worth
as much as blind rightists. The
worst is those coupled with para
noidal feelings.
I sincerely hope that the Mid
peninsula Observer would im
prove its quality of press ocver
age.

• Dogging It?
Editor, The Daily:
I would suggest that Univer
sity Health Officer Wilson might
more profitably direct his time
and energies toward a solution
to the health problem engender
ed by the unbathed, unshaved,
and otherwise ill-kempt student
junior faculty population at
Stanford, rather than toward the
relatively innocuous canine
members of the community.
