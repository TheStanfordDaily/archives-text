## 'Crucible' Not All Bad 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
The American Conservatory The
atre opened Arthur Miller's The Cru
cible last Saturday after an insuffi
cient number of rehearsals. The result
was a disastrous exercise in just how
many things can go wrong in the the
ater.
The audience was warned of im
pending doom even before the play
began. William Ball, General Director
of ACT, came on stage to announce
that there had been several last min
ute cast changes. The audience, there
by prepared for the worst, proceeded
to get just what they were expecting.
The Crucible gets under way as
the Reverend Mr. Parris (Rene
Auberjonois) tries to get his niece
Abigail (Carol Jenkins) to tell him
the truth about an episode of dancing
in the woods that has left his daugh
ter Betty (Valerie Smith) in an unex
plainable coma.
As Abigail magnificently performs
the child's habit of covering one lie
with another, any pretense Mr. Parris
might have had of being a man of
God is quickly stripped away through
self-pity and an ever-increasing con
cern for his own position.
Once the scene-setting of the first
act is gotten out of the way, The Cru
cible really gets a chance to come into
its own. The second act deals with
John and Elizabeth Proctor (Ramon

Bieri and Angela Paton), and how
they get to be caught up in the Salem
witch trials. It seems that Abigail
once worked for the Proctors and that
John Proctor had "had" her. Natural
ly, Abigail fell in love with him and
was determined to dance with him on
his wife's grave.
Bieri does an excellent job playing
the man who is torn between what he
knows is right and what he knows to
be practical. His efforts are not
enough, however, since any strength
he might have exhibited is milk-sop
ped away by his wife who can neither
make up her mind nor stay in char
acter long enough for anyone to de
cide just what her character is sup
posed to be.
Bieri struggles hard to bring off his
role, but, except for the courtroom
scene, all his travail goes for naught.
The courtroom scene engenders the
crux of the play. Unfortunately only
two of the players manage to make it
seem as such. Bieri performs without
flaw as he reaches the decision to con
demn himself in order to prove that
the witch-hunt is a sham.
Fortunately for the scene, Bieri is
at last given some help — from none
other than Abigail, the girl he is about
to condemn as a harlot. Miss Jenkins
demonstrates great talent in this scene
and between her and Bieri, the scene
almost comes off.

The reason the scene doesn't quite
make it is that the central figure in it,
Deputy Governor Danforth (Jay
Doyle — one of the cast substitu
tions), appears to be on the point of
apoplexy as he drops his lines and
scatters them to the four corners of
the stage. Unfortunately, more of the
Lines than not end up in the back two
corners.
There are two more major char
acters in The Crucible who deserve
mention. The first is Reverend Mr.
John Hale (Richard Dysart), the sec
ond, Mary Warren (Kitty Winn).
Mr. Hale has been summoned to
Salem by Mr. Parris in order to dis
prove the witch theory. Although at
first he appears to be a pompous theo
logian, it soon becomes evident that
he is sickened by the whole process
which he is convinced is a fraud.
When he is rejected by the court, ap
parently for not agreeing with their
findings, he performs a complete
turn-around and becomes one; of its
severest critics.
Not many people could carry off
an about-face of this kind; Dysart is
a pleasant exception.
Mary Warren turns out to be the
Proctor's replacement for Abigail. Al
though she is under Abigail's thumb,
as are all the rest of the girls in Salem,
Mr. Proctor manages to get her to tell
the court that the girls are all lying.
Abigail, in a flash of genius, accuses
Mary of being an agent of the devil,
and Mary, realizing the spot she is in,
jumps back to "God's side" and ac
cuses Proctor of being a wizard. All
of this hopping back and forth could
be very confusing, but Dysart and
Miss Winn prevent it from being so.
All the problems with The Crucible
did not come from the actors.
Throughout the show the lightroom
seemed to get confused as to what
was supposed to be happening. The
second intermission never took place
because the house lights never came
on. Quite often a night-time scene
would be flooded with liglit and a
daytime scene would be black as
pitch.
The main problem with The Cru
cible, however, is a fault of the play
itself. The book can hardly be de
scribed as meaningful for our time,
and witchcraft? — you've got to be
kidding. The most fitting description
I can think of is one attributed to that
marvel of modern television, Batman.
The Crucible is either "low camp or
high treason."
Hopefully, the correctable prob
lems will be smoothed over as ACT
continues to work on the play. The
Crucible could provide quite enjoy
able entertainment provided that it is
not taken seriously and all the ingre
dients are properly blended. The
blending has vet to occur.

Bieri and Jenkins in "The Crucible"
The American Conservatory The
atre opened Arthur Miller's The Cru
cible last Saturday after an insuffi
cient number of rehearsals. The result
was a disastrous exercise in just how
many things can go wrong in the the
ater.
The audience was warned of im
pending doom even before the play
began. William Ball, General Director
of ACT, came on stage to announce
that there had been several last min
ute cast changes. The audience, there
by prepared for the worst, proceeded
to get just what they were expecting.
The Crucible gets under way as
the Reverend Mr. Parris (Rene
Auberjonois) tries to get his niece
Abigail (Carol Jenkins) to tell him
the truth about an episode of dancing
in the woods that has left his daugh
ter Betty (Valerie Smith) in an unex
plainable coma.
As Abigail magnificently performs
the child's habit of covering one lie
with another, any pretense Mr. Parris
might have had of being a man of
God is quickly stripped away through
self-pity and an ever-increasing con
cern for his own position.
Once the scene-setting of the first
act is gotten out of the way, The Cru
cible really gets a chance to come into
its own. The second act deals with
John and Elizabeth Proctor (Ramon

Bieri and Angela Paton), and how
they get to be caught up in the Salem
witch trials. It seems that Abigail
once worked for the Proctors and that
John Proctor had "had" her. Natural
ly, Abigail fell in love with him and
was determined to dance with him on
his wife's grave.
Bieri does an excellent job playing
the man who is torn between what he
knows is right and what he knows to
be practical. His efforts are not
enough, however, since any strength
he might have exhibited is milk-sop
ped away by his wife who can neither
make up her mind nor stay in char
acter long enough for anyone to de
cide just what her character is sup
posed to be.
Bieri struggles hard to bring off his
role, but, except for the courtroom
scene, all his travail goes for naught.
The courtroom scene engenders the
crux of the play. Unfortunately only
two of the players manage to make it
seem as such. Bieri performs without
flaw as he reaches the decision to con
demn himself in order to prove that
the witch-hunt is a sham.
Fortunately for the scene, Bieri is
at last given some help — from none
other than Abigail, the girl he is about
to condemn as a harlot. Miss Jenkins
demonstrates great talent in this scene
and between her and Bieri, the scene
almost comes off.

The reason the scene doesn't quite
make it is that the central figure in it,
Deputy Governor Danforth (Jay
Doyle — one of the cast substitu
tions), appears to be on the point of
apoplexy as he drops his lines and
scatters them to the four corners of
the stage. Unfortunately, more of the
Lines than not end up in the back two
corners.
There are two more major char
acters in The Crucible who deserve
mention. The first is Reverend Mr.
John Hale (Richard Dysart), the sec
ond, Mary Warren (Kitty Winn).
Mr. Hale has been summoned to
Salem by Mr. Parris in order to dis
prove the witch theory. Although at
first he appears to be a pompous theo
logian, it soon becomes evident that
he is sickened by the whole process
which he is convinced is a fraud.
When he is rejected by the court, ap
parently for not agreeing with their
findings, he performs a complete
turn-around and becomes one; of its
severest critics.
Not many people could carry off
an about-face of this kind; Dysart is
a pleasant exception.
Mary Warren turns out to be the
Proctor's replacement for Abigail. Al
though she is under Abigail's thumb,
as are all the rest of the girls in Salem,
Mr. Proctor manages to get her to tell
the court that the girls are all lying.
Abigail, in a flash of genius, accuses
Mary of being an agent of the devil,
and Mary, realizing the spot she is in,
jumps back to "God's side" and ac
cuses Proctor of being a wizard. All
of this hopping back and forth could
be very confusing, but Dysart and
Miss Winn prevent it from being so.
All the problems with The Crucible
did not come from the actors.
Throughout the show the lightroom
seemed to get confused as to what
was supposed to be happening. The
second intermission never took place
because the house lights never came
on. Quite often a night-time scene
would be flooded with liglit and a
daytime scene would be black as
pitch.
The main problem with The Cru
cible, however, is a fault of the play
itself. The book can hardly be de
scribed as meaningful for our time,
and witchcraft? — you've got to be
kidding. The most fitting description
I can think of is one attributed to that
marvel of modern television, Batman.

daytime scene would be black as
pitch.
The main problem with The Cru
cible, however, is a fault of the play
itself. The book can hardly be de
scribed as meaningful for our time,
and witchcraft? — you've got to be
kidding. The most fitting description
I can think of is one attributed to that
marvel of modern television, Batman.
The Crucible is either "low camp or
high treason."
Hopefully, the correctable prob
lems will be smoothed over as ACT
continues to work on the play. The
Crucible could provide quite enjoy
able entertainment provided that it is
not taken seriously and all the ingre
dients are properly blended. The
blending has vet to occur.


Bieri and Jenkins in "The Crucible"
The American Conservatory The
atre opened Arthur Miller's The Cru
cible last Saturday after an insuffi
cient number of rehearsals. The result
was a disastrous exercise in just how
many things can go wrong in the the
ater.
The audience was warned of im
pending doom even before the play
began. William Ball, General Director
of ACT, came on stage to announce
that there had been several last min
ute cast changes. The audience, there
by prepared for the worst, proceeded
to get just what they were expecting.
The Crucible gets under way as
the Reverend Mr. Parris (Rene
Auberjonois) tries to get his niece
Abigail (Carol Jenkins) to tell him
the truth about an episode of dancing
in the woods that has left his daugh
ter Betty (Valerie Smith) in an unex
plainable coma.
As Abigail magnificently performs
the child's habit of covering one lie
with another, any pretense Mr. Parris
might have had of being a man of
God is quickly stripped away through
self-pity and an ever-increasing con
cern for his own position.
Once the scene-setting of the first
act is gotten out of the way, The Cru
cible really gets a chance to come into
its own. The second act deals with
John and Elizabeth Proctor (Ramon

Bieri and Angela Paton), and how
they get to be caught up in the Salem
witch trials. It seems that Abigail
once worked for the Proctors and that
John Proctor had "had" her. Natural
ly, Abigail fell in love with him and
was determined to dance with him on
his wife's grave.
Bieri does an excellent job playing
the man who is torn between what he
knows is right and what he knows to
be practical. His efforts are not
enough, however, since any strength
he might have exhibited is milk-sop
ped away by his wife who can neither
make up her mind nor stay in char
acter long enough for anyone to de
cide just what her character is sup
posed to be.
Bieri struggles hard to bring off his
role, but, except for the courtroom
scene, all his travail goes for naught.
The courtroom scene engenders the
crux of the play. Unfortunately only
two of the players manage to make it
seem as such. Bieri performs without
flaw as he reaches the decision to con
demn himself in order to prove that
the witch-hunt is a sham.
Fortunately for the scene, Bieri is
at last given some help — from none
other than Abigail, the girl he is about
to condemn as a harlot. Miss Jenkins
demonstrates great talent in this scene
and between her and Bieri, the scene
almost comes off.

The reason the scene doesn't quite
make it is that the central figure in it,
Deputy Governor Danforth (Jay
Doyle — one of the cast substitu
tions), appears to be on the point of
apoplexy as he drops his lines and
scatters them to the four corners of
the stage. Unfortunately, more of the
Lines than not end up in the back two
corners.
There are two more major char
acters in The Crucible who deserve
mention. The first is Reverend Mr.
John Hale (Richard Dysart), the sec
ond, Mary Warren (Kitty Winn).
Mr. Hale has been summoned to
Salem by Mr. Parris in order to dis
prove the witch theory. Although at
first he appears to be a pompous theo
logian, it soon becomes evident that
he is sickened by the whole process
which he is convinced is a fraud.
When he is rejected by the court, ap
parently for not agreeing with their
findings, he performs a complete
turn-around and becomes one; of its
severest critics.
Not many people could carry off
an about-face of this kind; Dysart is
a pleasant exception.
Mary Warren turns out to be the
Proctor's replacement for Abigail. Al
though she is under Abigail's thumb,
as are all the rest of the girls in Salem,
Mr. Proctor manages to get her to tell
the court that the girls are all lying.
Abigail, in a flash of genius, accuses
Mary of being an agent of the devil,
and Mary, realizing the spot she is in,
jumps back to "God's side" and ac
cuses Proctor of being a wizard. All
of this hopping back and forth could
be very confusing, but Dysart and
Miss Winn prevent it from being so.
All the problems with The Crucible
did not come from the actors.
Throughout the show the lightroom
seemed to get confused as to what
was supposed to be happening. The
second intermission never took place
because the house lights never came
on. Quite often a night-time scene
would be flooded with liglit and a
daytime scene would be black as
pitch.
