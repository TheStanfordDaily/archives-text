## Government By String Pulling 
### Jurgen Wolff 
Our man in Saigon has done
it again.
On Friday Premier Nguyen
Cao Ky said that if opposition
candidates in the elections
should win through "trickery",
he will overthrow them in a
coup d'etat similar to the one
which put him into power in
1965. He will be the one to de
cide what constitutes trickery.
If this were happening in
South America we might be out
raged. If the government had a
leftist bent, we would probably
send in troops.
But in South Vietnam, we are
already there. Under the guise
of delivering the people from
Communist oppression and of
promoting democracy we put Ky
into power and kept him there.
The upcoming election will be
as farcical as anything by Gil
bert and Sullivan but not half
as funny. Want to go back a bit
to see how the plot developed?
1. The constitution stipulated
that government officials must
resign if they want to run. Neith
er Ky nor Chief of State Thieu,
his running mate, did so.
2. Since declaring his candidacy
Ky has exercised tight control
over newspapers, closing some
down and censoring the others.
Originally newspapers had to
submit page proofs to govern
ment censors at 10 each morn
ing. Then censors snipped out
the parts likely to "create dis
sent". This method has been
made more efficient. Now the
publishers send the first copies

of their editions to the censors.
If they find anything offensive,
they direct the police to seize
all copies of that day's edition.
3. To legitimize the elections,
the Constituent Assembly screen
ed all candidates and decided
who would be allowed to run. In
their first ballot, the electoral
committee voted 8 to 4 to dis
qualify Ky and Thieu. Upon
hearing this, Ky put the police
on special reserve and ordered
one special reserve battalion into
readiness. Ky's Information Min
ister reportedly said: "If the
Assembly does not accept the
candidacy of Thieu and Ky, the
government will dissolve the As
sembly." The Assembly decided
to accept Ky's and Thieu's can
didacy.
4. No Communists will be al
lowed to run. Whether or not
the people want communism evi
dentally is irrelevant.
5. No peace candidates will be
allowed to run. Thieu and Ky
labeled the major prospective
peace candidate a Communist
sympathizer. Until last October
he was Ky's minister of finance
and economy. The Assembly dis
qualified him on the basis of his
temporary French citizenship.
6. It seems no popular candi
date will be allowed to oppose
Ky. Also eliminated from the
ballot was exiled General Duong
Van "Big" Minh. He was the
hero of the 1963 revolt against
one of South Vietnam's earlier
despots, President Diem. Ky and
Thieu said they would not allow
Minh to return to the country

regardless of the Assembly's de
cision.

While Ky generally responds
to tugs on his strings by Uncle

Sam, some of his actions have
probably been original. Ky is
an embarrassing puppet, but
Washington says the show must
go on.
