"No university should become a political instrument or a pawn in the hands of

President J. E. Wallace Sterling
State of the University
Message, 1967

"Stanford should maintain and strengthen its historical superiority in undergradu
ate education. It must endeavor to bring undergraduate students in more intimate
contact with the most exciting members of the faculty."
Provost Frederick E. Terman, 1958

"WINNIPEG, Man., March 19
(AP) — Canada refused entry
today to Prof. Mulford Q. Sibley
of the University of Minnesota
who was to speak at the Univer
sity of Manitoba. Officials said

his views on such subjects as
communism, atheism, and free
love were questionable. He re
turned on the plane that brought
him here."
Hard to believe that could hap
pen in the Sixties, isn't it. But it
did — the nation to which so
many conscientious objectors are
now fleeing barred entrance to
a man simply because of his
beliefs.
What may be more or less dif
ficult to believe is that virtually
the same thing hapi)ened to Sib-1

ley at Stanford some six years
before. Sibley, who has described
himself as a Norman Thomas
Socialist and a Quaker pacifist,
had repeatedly and strongly de
nounced Russian-American nu
clear testing. This is how the
Stanford Daily of 1958 tells the
story:
April 21: "Stanford will soon
be the site of the world's largest
linear electron accelerator if the
project is approved by federal
agencies."
May 8: "Professor Mulford Q.
Sibley has been denied perma
nent appointment to the faculty
of the Political Science Depart
ment. The Office of the President
effectively barred Sibley's ap
pointment Tuesday afternoon by
its decision not to present Sib
ley's name to the Board of Trus
tees. This decision was made
even though Sibley had the un
amimous approval of all the fac
ulty of the department and also
the dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences.... According
to statements from Administra
tion officials, there are four pos
sible reasons why an appoint
ment might be disapproved:
• The candidate's moral repu
tation is under serious question.
• The candidate does not meet
the scholarsldp requirements.
• The candidate is not a good
teacher.
• The candidate's political
leanings would be detrimental
to the interests of the Univer

The Office of t he President has
given no official reason for not

has been said that the admini

Sibley is presently at Stanford

"No university should become a political instrument or a pawn in the hands of
those who would use it as such, be those hands inside or outside the university."
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
State of the University
Message, 1967

"Stanford should maintain and strengthen its historical superiority in undergradu
ate education. It must endeavor to bring undergraduate students in more intimate
contact with the most exciting members of the faculty."
Provost Frederick E. Terman, 1958

It's March 20, 1964. The fol
lowing story appears in the New
York Times, buried on page sev
en:
"WINNIPEG, Man., March 19
(AP) — Canada refused entry
today to Prof. Mulford Q. Sibley
of the University of Minnesota
who was to speak at the Univer
sity of Manitoba. Officials said

his views on such subjects as
communism, atheism, and free
love were questionable. He re
turned on the plane that brought
him here."
Hard to believe that could hap
pen in the Sixties, isn't it. But it
did — the nation to which so
many conscientious objectors are
now fleeing barred entrance to
a man simply because of his
beliefs.
What may be more or less dif
ficult to believe is that virtually
the same thing hapi)ened to Sib-1

ley at Stanford some six years
before. Sibley, who has described
himself as a Norman Thomas
Socialist and a Quaker pacifist,
had repeatedly and strongly de
nounced Russian-American nu
clear testing. This is how the
Stanford Daily of 1958 tells the
story:
April 21: "Stanford will soon
be the site of the world's largest
linear electron accelerator if the
project is approved by federal
agencies."
May 8: "Professor Mulford Q.
Sibley has been denied perma
nent appointment to the faculty
of the Political Science Depart
ment. The Office of the President
effectively barred Sibley's ap
pointment Tuesday afternoon by
its decision not to present Sib
ley's name to the Board of Trus
tees. This decision was made
even though Sibley had the un
amimous approval of all the fac
ulty of the department and also
the dean of the School of Human
