# Stanford Prof. Discovers Skin Cultivation Method
## 
### 
Dr. Marvin A. Karasek, a Stanford
University biochemist, announced yes
terday that he has been able to recon
struct outer layers of skin from cells
grown in a test tube.
Rabbit cells cultured for two weeks
in a test tube grew normally when
transplanted back to the host animal,
Dr. Karasek said. The grafted cells
formed a new epidermis, the outer
layer of skin.
The transplanted cells and newly
formed epidermis survived for as long
as five weeks. During this period, the
cells maintained their ability to grow
and divide.
These findings would seem to re
fute the common belief that no speci
fic tissue can be formed from cultured
adult skin cells. "When placed in an
appropriate physiologic environment,
the cultured adult epithelial cell again
resumes its normal growth and differ
entiation," reported Dr. Karasek. Al
though others have transplanted cells
before, this is the first time cells have
successfully grown after culture in a
synthetic medium.
The use of cultured skin cells for
studies of wound healing has been an
attractive possibility since the devel
opment of advanced cell culture tech
niques. The behavior of cultured cells
after transplantation has never before
been established, however. One diffi
culty has been that normal wound
healing interferes with grafts. To deal
with this problem, Dr. Karasek de
veloped for his studies a silicone rub
ber chamber that blocks normal
wound healing and permits only trans
planted cells to grow.
The sequence of events in the rab
bit transplant experiments was as fol
lows:
• One week after transplantation
of the cells to the prepared graft site,
the epithelial cells multiplied to form
a cell layer over the entire wound site
that was three cells in thickness.
• Two weeks later the cells had
formed an epidermis that was 5 to 10
cells in thickness. Keratinization, the

formation of the corneous or horny
outer normal skin layer, also appear
ed during this period.
• After three weeks, the newly
formed epidermis became extra-thick
because of an abnormal increase in
the number of cells.
• Five weeks later the new epider
mis began to show deterioration signs
and to flake off.
"We are not sure why this skin is
not permanent," Dr. Karasek report
ed. "It is possibly due to some unex
plained immunologic mechanism or
because we have not yet achieved the
proper physiologic environment for
these cultured cells to survive for a
longer period."
He added, though, that from a bio
logical viewpoint this development
represents a "rare opportunity to test
the changes that occur when a cell is
grown in a foreign environment. The
explanation of the changes that take
place is one of the most challenging
and important areas in cell biology."
Dr. Karasek, an assistant professor
of biochemistry in the department of
dermatology of the Stanford Univer
sity School of Medicine, released his
findings at the 13th International Con
gress of Dermatology in Munich, West
Germany. Among Dr. Karasek's other
interests is learning more about the

intricate biochemical reactions that
cause uncontrolled cell growth in pa
tients with skin diseases. His work is
financed by grants from the John A.
Hartford Foundation, Inc. of New
York, and the National Institute of
Health.
