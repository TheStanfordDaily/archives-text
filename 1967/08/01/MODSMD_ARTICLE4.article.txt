# Tempo To Change In Jazz Tent With Zeitlin, Hendricks
## 
### 
Stanford's Summer Festival spot
light is on modern jazz this week,
when the trio of Denny Zeitlin and
the Jon Hendricks quartet set up shop
in the Jazz Tent.
Pianist Zeitlin and his group will
hold forth tonight and tomorrow
night, and will be followed by the
Hendricks quartet Thursday through
Saturday.
Zeitlin, together with bassist Char
lie Haden and drummer Jerry Gran
elli, provides some of the most inno
vative sounds to be heard in modern
jazz today. The 29-year-old Columbia

recording artist is only a part-time
musician, however. He is a resident
psychiatrist at Langley Porter Neuro
psychiatric Institute at San Francisco.
The Bay Area became his home
base when he took an internship at
San Francisco General Hospital in
1964. Prior to that he studied at Johns
Hopkins Me dical School in Baltimore
after graduating from the University
of Illinois with Phi Beta Kappa hon
ors. At the same time Zeitlin's piano
approach caused the Encyclopedia of
Jazz to describe him as "the most
versatile young pianist to come into
prominence in the early 19fi0's."
Jazz singer and poet Jon Hendricks
evokes a different kind of sound, but
no less innovative. He writes and
sings lyrics to jazz solos, and his vo
cal representations of jazz instrumen
talists are one of the great entertain
ments of jazz.
Hendricks found national acclaim
as a member of the Lambert-Hend
ricks-Ross vocal group, now disband
ed. He resides at Mill Valley now,
with the Bay Area as his singing base.
All performances are from 8:30 to
12:30, and tickets are available at the
Memorial Hall box office or nightly at
the door.
