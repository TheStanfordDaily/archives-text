## 
### 
Howard Taubman, distinguished cri
tic-at-large for The New York Times,
will discuss the American theater
Tuesday and Wednesday as another
part of the Summer Festival's focus
on the American stage.
Taubman's first lecture will be on
"The American Musical Theater"
which will be held at 8 p.m. Tuesday
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Wednesday
he will speak on "American Drama"
at 4:30 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
Taubman, well-known as an Ameri
can critic for the past 30 years, has
been both music and drama critic for
The New York Times. He recently
was assigned to survey the arts from
the broad spectrum of contemporary
society, international as well as Amer
ican.
He is also the author of "The Mak
ing of the American Theater" which,
with his 40 years experience as back
ground, makes a sensitive study that
analyzes each work of the American
stage and derives an over-all picture
of our national theater.
A frequent visitor to the campus,
Taubman has also been one of the
Summer Festival's strongest support
ers. In one article he called it "one of
the major cultural enterprises in the
West." Later, he praised the Festival
as "an important new center for the
arts."
With his new assignment under
way, Taubman has found himself
traveling outside the New York area
quite often. His major concern has
been the total relationship of art to
society.

In pursuing this total view of cul
ture, Taubman recently investigated
an Indian reservation in Arizona and
tried to salvage and create a contem
porary Indian culture.
Much of his time is spent in Wash
ington examining the interaction of
art and politics. Taubman has also
investigated computers and their re
lation to the humanities for The
Times.
Both of Taubman's lectures will
cover this culturally comprehensive
view of the American theater.
