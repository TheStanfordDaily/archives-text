# New Taxes Go Into Effect
## 
### 
The State Board of Equalization an
nounced Saturday that the 1967 tax
act contains two tax increases which
are of immediate concern to con
sumers and businessmen. Both of
these taxes are administered by the
State Board. The first one increases
the State sales tax and use tax rate
from 3 to 4 per cent effective August
1. This will bring the combined State
and local rate to 5 per cent. The new
rate will apply to all taxable retail
sales made on and after August 1.
The State Board said under the new
law the following is a part of the
sales tax schedule which will take ef
fect on August 1:
$ .01 - $ .10 $ .00
.11 - .27 01
.27 • .47 02
.48 - .68 03
.69 • .89 04
.90 - 1.09 05
1.10 - 1.29 06
1.30 - 1.49 07
1.50 - 1.69 08
1.70 - 1.89 09
1.90 - 2.09 10
2.10 • 2.29 11
2.30 - 2.49 12
2.50 • 2.69 13
2.70 - 2.89 14
2.90 - 3.09 15
More expensive purchases would
follow the same mathematical in
crease, the Board said. California's
100,000 retailers are being mailed the
full new tax schedules.
First Increase
This is the first increase in the
State's portion of the sales and use
tax since 1949. In 1956, one per cent
was added for cities and counties wish
ing to have the State collect their lo
cal sales and use taxes.
The conditions of some sales may
cause questions about whether the

old or new rate applies. In most cases,
this will be easy to determine. If title
passes to the purchaser on or after
August 1, the rate is 5 per cent, even
though the purchase order was placed
with the seller before that date. In
those instances where title to the prop
erty was transferred to the buyer
before August 1, the rate is 4 per
cent, even though delivery occurs on
or after August 1.
Where the retailer retains title to
the property as security until the pur
chase price is paid, such as in a con
ditional sales contract, the date the
property is transferred to the buyer
determines the proper tax rate.
Cigarettes
The second immediate tax increase
is on cigarettes. The State tax on a
standard package of 20 cigarettes will
be raised from 3 to 7 cents effective
August 1, 1967.
A floor stock tax of 4 cents a pack
age of 20 cigarettes is imposed on any
quantities on hand at midnight July
31, 1967. An inventory is required as
of 12:01 a.m. August 1, 1967. All
known sellers of cigarettes are being
mailed floor stock tax returns. Any
one affected who does not receive a
return by August 15, 1967, should se
cure the form from the nearest local
Board of Equalization office. The com
pleted return together with the pay
ment of the additional tax must be re
turned to the Board by August 31.
An additional cigarette tax of 3 cents
a package for the benefit of cities and
counties will go into effect on October
1, 1967. It is expected that the latter
increase will result in a discontinuance
of all locally-collected cigarette taxes.
Further information on this subject
will be mailed to taxpayers by the
Board early in September.
