the boisterous shawms to the
subtle viols.
Music for the concert will be
drawn from the work of France-
Flemish composers from 1450
to 1550. Much of the music on
the program is taken from the
Harmonica Musices Odhecaton
A, the first printed collection of
music (1501), a monumental
event in the history of music. A
variety of short secular pieces,
representing especially the com
poser Heinrich Isaac, dances of

the publisher Attaignant, and
sacred works comprise the bulk
of the program.
The "buzzy" krummhorn fam
ily will be used in quartet as
well as with other instruments,
as will the more demure record
ers. Solos will feature the harpsi

of vocal-instrumental combina
tions will be exploited in two ex
cerpts from a Mass by Alex
ander Agricola, and a setting of
the Magnificat by the same com
poser, which will close the pro
gram.
