40 INCH BUBBLE CHAMBER at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center lets physicists see the tracks of invisible
nuclear particles from the two mile linear accelerator as they bombard the nuclei of hydrogen atoms. The tracks
are photographed from three angles simultaneously through the ports in the large vacuum cylinder (left) which
protrudes from the rectangular, 300-ton electromagnet (center). The bubble chamber, filled with liquid hydrogen,
lies in the heart of the magnet.
