# Closed Mem What? Re-Opens Its Doors
## 
### GRAY CHAMBRES 
You may find this hard to be
lieve, but Tuesday night this
thing happened. No kidding —
happened — right here at Stan
ford. There were people just
enjoying themselves — no noses
in books, no noses in the air —
everybody just kind of standing
around listening to music and
smiling at each other and hav
ing a good time.
But on to the facts, for this
is for the Daily. It happened
behind Tresidder Union, on the
former site of the now defunct,
but groovy while it lasted Mem
What? coffee house. There was
a live band called the OJ Express

that was loud, and folky singer
Blind Nick Baran who was not
so loud and you'd never be
lieve he was just a kid to listen
to his songs and Joe Pennock
who flat-picked "Cripple-Creek"
and made even Betsy smile and
me Gray Chambres who sang
anyhow. There were also hot
dogs and other things to eat and
it's nice if people buy them, but
if not, John Hejl gives them
away anyhow.
What's really so strange about
all this is that it's happening
again tonight with all the usual
crowd plus a possible risque
light show by Tina and maybe
even a song by the "Girl from
Denver."
