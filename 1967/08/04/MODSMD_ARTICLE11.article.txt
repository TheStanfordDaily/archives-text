# Volunteers And Money Work Florentine Miracle

(Editor's Note: At the time of
the Florence flood there was a
great deal of concern at Stanford
for the fates of Stanford stu
dents studying at the Villa.
When word Anally reached cam
pus that they were safe, many
students here at home started to
raise funds to help with the mas
sive restoration project. The
more than $1,000 they raised
helped to make possible the final
restoration of the city as describ
ed below.)
National Geographic—Art and
history lovers will remember
1967 as the year of the "Miracle
cf Florence."
Italy's most elegant city lay
sleeping last November when
the Arno River flooded without
warning, taking lives, causing
incalculable grief, and despoiling
paintings, sculptures, books and
manuscripts in one of mankind's
richest centers of art.
The invading water glazed
Florence's handsome old stone
buildings and art works with a
greasy film of naftar—black fur
nace oil flushed from the city's
fuel tanks. Most museums and
libraries suffered damage; the
water caused losses to 7,800
workshops that carry on Renais
sance craftsmanship in leather,
wood, textiles, and precious
metals.
There is a saying: Florentinis
ingeniis nihil ardui est—"Noth
ing is beyond the powers of the
Florentines." With the help of
volunteers and donations from
abroad, the city has now over
come its disaster.
Business As Usual
"The city has regained in full
its former appearance," writes
Joseph Judge, of the National
Geographic's Senior Staff, in its
July issue. "Familiar hotels and
pensions are again open. Visitors
are finding thousands of shops
doing business as usual, and
best of all, artisans are back at
work. Countless acts of courage
and determination and the sup
port of a sympathetic world
have made it possible for beauti
ful Florence to rise, like Bot
ticelli's Venus, from the waters."
Mr. Judge tells about the
extraordinary operation that sal
vaged mansucripts, books, sculp
tures, and the paintings that
adorn the city's scores of mu
seums, palaces, churches, and li
braries.
The Biblioteca Nazionale Cen
trale, one of Europe's richest li
braries and the equivalent of the
United States' Library of Con
gress, contains more than three
million volumes; some 1,500,000
were damaged. The total for the
city exceeded two million.
Hundreds of student volun
teers —wearing gas masks be
cause of the stench of sewage

and carrion in the floodwaters—
carried mud-smeared books, one
by one, from the library stacks.
The books were taken on trucks
lent by the Italian and American
Armies to restoration centers as
far away as Rome.
Book Laundry
The heating plant of Flor
ence's railway station was press
ed into service as an emergency
center. Writes Mr. Judge: "In
the cavernous rooms, filled with
huge boilers and jungle gyms of
pipes, students stood at a bank
of washbasins and submerged
the old handmade pages in plain
tapwater mixed with fungicide.
The dried pages were apt to be
come brittle because the old siz
ing had run and gathered in pud
dles; the washing flushed out
this old glue. The crucial factor
was that the old inks and hand
made papers could be washed
without damage. Finally the in
dividual pages were flattened in
a press and hung out to dry."
Another remarkable effort
saved paintings in the Ufflzi, the
queen of Renaissance art gal
leries. Hastily summoned art ex
perts and custodians braved wa
ter steaming into the gallery to
move imperiled paintings by
Simone, Masaccio, Fra Filippo
Lippi, and other masters.
In the aftermath of the flood,
paintings all over Florence were
coated with absorbent mulberry

tissue paper—the standard emer
gency bandage for damaged
works of art. If the color has
moved or flaked, it will still be
under the paper.
Drowned statues, including
Michelangelo marbles in the Bar
gello, were tenderly covered with
poultices of benzene and talcurf
powder to draw moisture and oil
from the stone. Then powerful
detergents were put to work on
the stains.
Florence's magnificent spirit
during the disaster was shared
by the army of blue-jeaned stu
dents from the United States
and other countries. One dark
winter day Mr. Judge observed
a group of these students swing
ing along a street to dig muck
from cellars. He reports, "Mud
splattered, cold, and tired, they
were singing."

during the disaster was shared
by the army of blue-jeaned stu

National Geographic—Art and
history lovers will remember
1967 as the year of the "Miracle
cf Florence."
Italy's most elegant city lay
sleeping last November when
the Arno River flooded without
warning, taking lives, causing
incalculable grief, and despoiling
paintings, sculptures, books and
manuscripts in one of mankind's
richest centers of art.
The invading water glazed
Florence's handsome old stone
buildings and art works with a
greasy film of naftar—black fur
nace oil flushed from the city's
fuel tanks. Most museums and
libraries suffered damage; the
water caused losses to 7,800
workshops that carry on Renais
sance craftsmanship in leather,
wood, textiles, and precious
metals.
There is a saying: Florentinis
ingeniis nihil ardui est—"Noth
ing is beyond the powers of the
Florentines." With the help of
volunteers and donations from
abroad, the city has now over
come its disaster.
Business As Usual
"The city has regained in full
its former appearance," writes
Joseph Judge, of the National
Geographic's Senior Staff, in its
July issue. "Familiar hotels and
pensions are again open. Visitors
are finding thousands of shops
doing business as usual, and
best of all, artisans are back at
work. Countless acts of courage
and determination and the sup
port of a sympathetic world
have made it possible for beauti
ful Florence to rise, like Bot
ticelli's Venus, from the waters."
Mr. Judge tells about the
extraordinary operation that sal
vaged mansucripts, books, sculp
tures, and the paintings that
adorn the city's scores of mu
seums, palaces, churches, and li
braries.
The Biblioteca Nazionale Cen
trale, one of Europe's richest li
braries and the equivalent of the
United States' Library of Con
gress, contains more than three
million volumes; some 1,500,000
were damaged. The total for the
city exceeded two million.
Hundreds of student volun
teers —wearing gas masks be
cause of the stench of sewage

and carrion in the floodwaters—
carried mud-smeared books, one
by one, from the library stacks.
The books were taken on trucks
lent by the Italian and American
Armies to restoration centers as
far away as Rome.
Book Laundry
The heating plant of Flor
ence's railway station was press
ed into service as an emergency
center. Writes Mr. Judge: "In
the cavernous rooms, filled with
huge boilers and jungle gyms of
pipes, students stood at a bank
of washbasins and submerged
the old handmade pages in plain
tapwater mixed with fungicide.
The dried pages were apt to be
come brittle because the old siz
ing had run and gathered in pud
dles; the washing flushed out
this old glue. The crucial factor
was that the old inks and hand
made papers could be washed
without damage. Finally the in
dividual pages were flattened in
a press and hung out to dry."
Another remarkable effort
saved paintings in the Ufflzi, the
queen of Renaissance art gal
leries. Hastily summoned art ex
perts and custodians braved wa
ter steaming into the gallery to
move imperiled paintings by
Simone, Masaccio, Fra Filippo
Lippi, and other masters.
In the aftermath of the flood,
paintings all over Florence were
coated with absorbent mulberry

tissue paper—the standard emer
gency bandage for damaged
works of art. If the color has
moved or flaked, it will still be
under the paper.

ing had run and gathered in pud
dles; the washing flushed out
this old glue. The crucial factor
was that the old inks and hand
made papers could be washed
without damage. Finally the in
dividual pages were flattened in
a press and hung out to dry."
Another remarkable effort
saved paintings in the Ufflzi, the
queen of Renaissance art gal
leries. Hastily summoned art ex
perts and custodians braved wa
ter steaming into the gallery to
move imperiled paintings by
Simone, Masaccio, Fra Filippo
Lippi, and other masters.
In the aftermath of the flood,
paintings all over Florence were
coated with absorbent mulberry

tissue paper—the standard emer
gency bandage for damaged
works of art. If the color has
moved or flaked, it will still be
under the paper.
Drowned statues, including
Michelangelo marbles in the Bar
gello, were tenderly covered with
poultices of benzene and talcurf
powder to draw moisture and oil
from the stone. Then powerful
detergents were put to work on
the stains.
Florence's magnificent spirit
during the disaster was shared
by the army of blue-jeaned stu
dents from the United States
and other countries. One dark
winter day Mr. Judge observed
a group of these students swing
ing along a street to dig muck
from cellars. He reports, "Mud
splattered, cold, and tired, they
were singing."
