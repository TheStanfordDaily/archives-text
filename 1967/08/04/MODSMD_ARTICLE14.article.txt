# 'Dutchman'â€”Powerful Significant
## 
### BARBARA DEUTSCH 
Senator Robert Kennedy has
called this summer's urban riots
"the greatest domestic crisis
since The War between the
States." For their own survival,
Americans must understand the
motivation behind the chaos be
fore they can attempt a mean
ingful solution. One of the most
significant, powerful and beauti
fully written comments on black
white relations (or lack of them)
Is the drama Dutchman, by
Black Power author Le Roi
Jones.
The play is now an equally
fine film which should open
shortly in the Stanford area.
The acting is superb, the plot is
superb, the plot is simple, and
the meaning is complex and ex
pansive. A refined, easy-going,
three-button-suited Negro poet
(A 1 Ereeman Jr.) is picked up
on an empty subway car by a
neurotic white slut (Shirley
Knight) who is entranced by
the myth of Negro sexuality.
Their relationship begins with
the poet's fascinated disbelief in
the girl's advances. He then de
cides to go along with her be
cause of her seductive promises.
As their conversation continues,
the girl becomes increasingly
ugly and intense in her com
ments on The Negro. Einally,
pushed to the brink, the young
man explodes with his own bit
ter feelings on black and white
people in America. By now, the
subway car has filled with peo
ple, the girl stabs the Negro to
death, the passengers remain

silent, and the girl is free to hurl
herself upon the next young
Negro in a subway train.
What renders Dutchman bril
liant is its ability to present this
story as a fascinating drama of
the passions of specific human
beings, while simultaneously
creating an allegory of the past
and present racial situation in
the United States.
Miss Knight is Everywhite
man, intellectual but stupid,
lewd but sexless, hip without
style, and as Ralph Ellison shows
in his Invisible Man, using the
Negro to satisfy whatever, her
individual insanity requires. As
she herself points out, she "lies
a lot ... to control the world"
but is actually "nothing, and
don't you forget it."
Ereeman, as Eveiyblackman,
does not forget it. He, however,
sublimates his realization. At
first, he is the quiet, humorous
Negro, reminiscent of the pre
civil rights era, understanding
the white man totally yet pity
ing his hopeless foolishness and
joking with and at him. Later,
he is the urban Negro, channel
ing his growing anger into the
arts. One of the greatest insults
is the white man's envy and imi
tation of the Negro's music and
life-style ("I love Bessie Smith,"
he proclaims) while he continues
to misunderstand the motivation
behind its creation and to destroy
its creator.
But underlying these sublima
tions of the Negro is violence,
crouching in anticipation of the
kill. Einally, the hatred is ver
bally expressed, and according to

Mr. Jones, because the murder
which the young man threatens
is not performed, the man dies.
Kill or be killed seems to be
the motto.

Before his death, the quiet,
young poet warns the girl, "I'm
going to murder you." It appears
that his soul has been ressur
rected these past few weeks.
