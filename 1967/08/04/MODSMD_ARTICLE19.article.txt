# A 						Parting Thought

Six weeks ago we began publishing the Stan
ford Daily, Volume 151 A. At that time we out
lined some goals that we hoped to achieve with
our "experiment."
Now, six weeks later, the time has come for
! us to look back on our efforts and see just what
« we have accomplished.
' We stated in our first effort that we hoped to
prove that this campus needed a daily publica
tion during the summer and that a daily publi
» cation was indeed feasible. We have, wc feel,
proved both these points.
£ Stanford University does not fold up and die
S during the summer months and the activity that
R abounds deserves notice. We feel deep regret
£ at all the worthy items that we had to pass up
2 simply because we did not have room for them.
The feasibility of publishing a daily during the
J summer lies almost entirely with the adver-
J tisers. While every newspaperman will tell you
how sad it is that advertising regulates the size
S of a paper, the truth of that regulation is a jour
nalistic fact of life. We have often heard during
the summer that the Daily is little more than

an ad sheet. While we must agree in part, we
hasten to point out that every extra advertise
ment means more news space in the long run.
We have learned many things this summer
about all aspects of running a newspaper. We
have made our mistakes and had our scoops. We
have gained an invaluable knowledge about ex
actly what we can hope to offer to future gener
ations of summer residents, and, more important,
exactly how we should go about laying the
groundwork for that presentation.
But, above all, we have provided a forum in
which ideas can be exchanged. We have had our
criticisms and our words of praise. These com
ments are the yardstick by which, in the final
analysis, we must judge ourselves and what we
have or have not accomplished.
Our self-analysis will take a long, long time.
Regardless of what we find, we would like to
leave you with the following thought. Until the
summer publication, whatever it is called and
whatever form it may take, provides the summer
residents with all the news, it is offering less than
its readers deserve.
