## Ram's Head, Zeitlin Show Polish 
### PAUL POTYEN 
The music of the Denny Zeitlin
trio encompasses a variety of sounds
that is astonishing.
Wednesday night in the Jazz Tent
the bearded psychiatrist-jazz pianist
and his group presented a program
of original Zeitlin tunes, current bal
lads, a children's melody, some
wild treatments of shabby old show
tunes and some "free, experimental
sounds."
Zeitlin's own compositions are us
ually harmonically complex and
fresh as a crisp apple. Sometimes
they are rhythmically involved, as
in his "Sevens Thing," an up-tempo
number with a seven-eighths time
signature. The trio breezed through
it with surprising ease. Oliver John
son, the group's drummer, never
lost himself on this one, although he
began the evening lacking the sure
ty displayed by bassist Joe Halpin
and Zeitlin. The leader also used this
tune to bang out an orgy of rhythm
on tambourine.
On the quieter side, the group
played its version of the tender bal
lad, "Here's That Rainy Day." Again
Zeitlin's unusual arrangement of
harmonies helped make an already
beautiful tune glitter.
The trios treatment of the ditty,
"Put Your Little Foot Right Out,"
was delicate and exquisite. Halpin
and Zeitlin had a telepathic rapport
here, as well as throughout the eve
ning. The fact that Halpin is a very

recent replacement in the group
makes me wonder if he and Zeitlin
have been doing psychic homework
in the Doctor's office.
"The Way You Look Tonight" was
another showcase of rhythm, with its
constantly shifting time signatures.
The group started at a whisper, and
climaxed to a shout before subsiding
to the relaxed closing theme.
On another standard, "I Got Rhy
them," Zeitlin showed how well he
can dart and weave with blinding
speed on a fast-paced piece. Halpin's
dexterity on his instrument was equal
ly amazing.
The group also pierced the fron
tiers of avante-garde jazz in some
"free improvisational pieces." Strange
and sometimes alarming collages of
sound were concocted by striking
microphone against cymbal, pummel
ling the inner strings of the piano
and bowing the string bass. Zeitlin
and drummer Johnson provided addi
tional sounds from sources such as
chimes, tambourine, transistor radio,
a sitar-like stringed instrument and a
small item the leader calls "an African
thumb piano."
Much of the "new jazz" performed
today speaks of hate and anger. Zeit
lin and his sidemen speak of so much
more: peace, introspection, tension,
frenzy, playfulness, humor. And they
speak it so well.
Zeitlin and the trio provided an
evening of top notch music Wednes
day night. Their music was a thor
oughly enjoyable fountain of variety.

ning. The fact that Halpin is a very

recent replacement in the group
makes me wonder if he and Zeitlin
have been doing psychic homework
in the Doctor's office.
"The Way You Look Tonight" was
another showcase of rhythm, with its
constantly shifting time signatures.
The group started at a whisper, and
climaxed to a shout before subsiding
to the relaxed closing theme.
On another standard, "I Got Rhy
them," Zeitlin showed how well he
can dart and weave with blinding
speed on a fast-paced piece. Halpin's
dexterity on his instrument was equal
ly amazing.
The group also pierced the fron
tiers of avante-garde jazz in some
"free improvisational pieces." Strange
and sometimes alarming collages of
sound were concocted by striking
microphone against cymbal, pummel
ling the inner strings of the piano
and bowing the string bass. Zeitlin
and drummer Johnson provided addi
tional sounds from sources such as
chimes, tambourine, transistor radio,
a sitar-like stringed instrument and a
small item the leader calls "an African
thumb piano."
Much of the "new jazz" performed
today speaks of hate and anger. Zeit
lin and his sidemen speak of so much
more: peace, introspection, tension,
frenzy, playfulness, humor. And they
speak it so well.
Zeitlin and the trio provided an
evening of top notch music Wednes
day night. Their music was a thor
oughly enjoyable fountain of variety.

The music of the Denny Zeitlin
trio encompasses a variety of sounds
that is astonishing.
Wednesday night in the Jazz Tent
the bearded psychiatrist-jazz pianist
and his group presented a program
of original Zeitlin tunes, current bal
lads, a children's melody, some
wild treatments of shabby old show
tunes and some "free, experimental
sounds."
Zeitlin's own compositions are us
ually harmonically complex and
fresh as a crisp apple. Sometimes
they are rhythmically involved, as
in his "Sevens Thing," an up-tempo
number with a seven-eighths time
signature. The trio breezed through
it with surprising ease. Oliver John
son, the group's drummer, never
lost himself on this one, although he
began the evening lacking the sure
ty displayed by bassist Joe Halpin
and Zeitlin. The leader also used this
tune to bang out an orgy of rhythm
on tambourine.
On the quieter side, the group
played its version of the tender bal
lad, "Here's That Rainy Day." Again
Zeitlin's unusual arrangement of
harmonies helped make an already
beautiful tune glitter.
The trios treatment of the ditty,
"Put Your Little Foot Right Out,"
was delicate and exquisite. Halpin
and Zeitlin had a telepathic rapport
here, as well as throughout the eve
ning. The fact that Halpin is a very

recent replacement in the group
makes me wonder if he and Zeitlin
have been doing psychic homework
