## Mr. 'Educator'—I Accuse! 
### Robert E. Stone 
The last time this column ap
peared it was dedicated to point
ing out one of the big faults
with college "education." That
column was written with the ex
press intention of stirring up
some of those people whom it
criticized.
.j Today's column must express
great surprise that not one of
those people has chosen to de
fend himself or his profession.
Tfcc- previous column was, ad
mittedly, a shot in the dark;
perhaps even the bitter recrimi
nations of a student who has
not managed to break through
the system.
~ The lack of response makes
H more than that.
<■< The failure of those criticized
to reply to the charges made
can only indicate that no reply
Is possible. It is only the coward
or the guilty who will not re
ply when his entire way of life,
in fact the value of his way of
life, is challenged.
Professor after professor will
tell you that the education is
here, all you have to do is work
for it. Why then, bother with
the professor at all? Why pay
$1770 per year for the privilege
of being told to "do it your
self?"
There are of course excep
tions. There are professors like

Beye and Sibley who are gen
uinely concerned with educating
their students. Unfortunately,
there is a vast majority who
don't give a damn.
These professors who are
more concerned with their re
search than their students can
be seen every day. They are the
ones who deliver the same old
lectures from the same old pages
of yellow legal paper, who
know their lectures by heart,
who have stopped thinking.
There is no room at an insti
tution of higher learning for
this kind of professor. In fact,
if these professors are teaching
in the "correct manner," there
is no room for institutions of
higher learning.
Employers throughout the
country are learning the sad
truth that a college degree
doesn't mean much. Many are
now requiring Masters. And
when they discover that the
Masters is no better than the
Bachelors, they will ask for Doc
torates. When they discover that
the Doctorate isn't good for
anything, then what?
It is wrong for the people of
this country to be the victims of
the fraud known as "education."
It is a blight on the face of
every college and university that
their graduates are not pre

pared, that they have, with some
exceptions, no experience.
Therefore, I accuse the perpe
trators of this fraud:
I accuse the President of the
University for being more inter
ested in the dollar and where it
is coming from than in the stu
dents he is supposed to educate.
I accuse the Dean of Students
for allowing himself to be
drawn into the fraud against the
best interests of the students
he is supposed to speak for.
I accuse the Deans of the var
ious schools for permitting a
dead curriculum to be taught.
I accuse the professors for
having forgotten how to think
and for inhibiting the quest for
knowledge.
I accuse the Provost for his
faith in appearances rather than
facts.
I accuse the Academic Council
for its doctrine of "Publish or
Perish."
I accuse the students for be
ing blind to what is happening
to them.
If the future of this nation
and the world we live in are, as
is said, in the hands of today's
students, I accuse those respon
sible for our "education" for
not caring about that future, at
least not enough to see that its
guardians are adequately pre
pared to face it.

I accuse the Dean of Students
for allowing himself to be
drawn into the fraud against the
best interests of the students
he is supposed to speak for.
I accuse the Deans of the var
ious schools for permitting a
dead curriculum to be taught.
I accuse the professors for
having forgotten how to think
and for inhibiting the quest for
knowledge.
I accuse the Provost for his
faith in appearances rather than
facts.
I accuse the Academic Council
for its doctrine of "Publish or
Perish."
I accuse the students for be
ing blind to what is happening
to them.
If the future of this nation
and the world we live in are, as
is said, in the hands of today's
students, I accuse those respon
sible for our "education" for
not caring about that future, at
least not enough to see that its
guardians are adequately pre
pared to face it.
The last time this column ap
peared it was dedicated to point
ing out one of the big faults
with college "education." That
column was written with the ex
press intention of stirring up
some of those people whom it
criticized.
.j Today's column must express
great surprise that not one of
those people has chosen to de
fend himself or his profession.
Tfcc- previous column was, ad
mittedly, a shot in the dark;
perhaps even the bitter recrimi
nations of a student who has
not managed to break through
the system.
~ The lack of response makes
H more than that.
<■< The failure of those criticized
to reply to the charges made
can only indicate that no reply
Is possible. It is only the coward
or the guilty who will not re
ply when his entire way of life,
in fact the value of his way of
life, is challenged.
Professor after professor will
tell you that the education is
here, all you have to do is work
for it. Why then, bother with
the professor at all? Why pay
$1770 per year for the privilege
of being told to "do it your
self?"
There are of course excep
tions. There are professors like

Beye and Sibley who are gen
uinely concerned with educating
their students. Unfortunately,
there is a vast majority who
don't give a damn.
These professors who are
more concerned with their re
search than their students can
be seen every day. They are the
ones who deliver the same old
lectures from the same old pages
of yellow legal paper, who
know their lectures by heart,
who have stopped thinking.
There is no room at an insti
tution of higher learning for
this kind of professor. In fact,
if these professors are teaching
in the "correct manner," there
is no room for institutions of
higher learning.
Employers throughout the
country are learning the sad
truth that a college degree
doesn't mean much. Many are
now requiring Masters. And
when they discover that the
Masters is no better than the
Bachelors, they will ask for Doc
torates. When they discover that
the Doctorate isn't good for
anything, then what?
It is wrong for the people of
this country to be the victims of
the fraud known as "education."
It is a blight on the face of
every college and university that
their graduates are not pre

pared, that they have, with some
exceptions, no experience.
Therefore, I accuse the perpe
trators of this fraud:
I accuse the President of the
University for being more inter
ested in the dollar and where it
is coming from than in the stu
dents he is supposed to educate.
I accuse the Dean of Students
for allowing himself to be
drawn into the fraud against the
best interests of the students
he is supposed to speak for.
I accuse the Deans of the var
ious schools for permitting a
dead curriculum to be taught.
I accuse the professors for
having forgotten how to think

knowledge.
