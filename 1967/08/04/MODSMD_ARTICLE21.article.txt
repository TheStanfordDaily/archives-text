## Mulford Q. Sibley: One Man's Struggle

(Continued from August 1)
And there it stood.
Wallace Sterling said that the
case of Mulford Q. Sibley was
closed and, in effect, it was.
Neither he nor Terman acting
in their official capacities had
ever given any public explana
tion for Sibley's non-appoint
ment.
Of course, it had been rumor
ed that Sibley's published writ
ings were not acceptable to the
Search Committee. There seems
to be no way for the Search Com
mittee to defend itself on that
ground: Sibley had published
three books and numerous ar
ticles. Naturally, quantity does
not imply quality. What of the
quality of Sibley's works? One
indication may be that Stanford
currently owns seven of Sibley's
books or pamphlets.
Sterling had publicly stated
that Sibley's politics had noth
ing to do with his non-appoint
ment, and added that if such
considerations had, in fact, been
at work to prejudice the Sibley
case, Sibley would never have
been asked to come to Stanford
in the first place.
By itself, that statement
seems perfectly reasonable.
What it does not take into ac
count is the fact that the De
partment of Political Science —
and not Sterling or Terman —ac-
cepted Sibley as a visiting pro
fessor. Sterling never said what
pressures he would have brought
to bear had he known—prior to
the time that the invitation was
issued to Sibley—that Sibley was
coming to Stanford.
While Sterling never publicly
told why Sibley was not appoint
ed, he did do so privately with
an ad hoc group of five students.
As one of the students who at
tended the meeting recalled it,
"It is clear that Dr. Sibley's
political views did not control
the decision. . . . The decision of
the Administration was a care
ful one, animated by a desire
to do what was best for Stan
ford."
I am sure that the argument

Wallace Sterling presented that
day was concise and compelling,
for he is a man of immense
personal charm and unquestion
ed brilliance.
He is also very shrewd. One of
Sterling's prized tactics is to
answer questions perfectly
frankly — but not before he has
sworn his listeners to secrecy.
Everything said is "strictly off
the record."
I think it is not unreasonable
to say that Mulford Q. Silbey's
non-appointment and Stanford
University's quest for U.S. Gov
ernment aid to build "Project
M" (now the Stanford Linear
Accelerator) are closely related.
Sterling must have made the
variables in that relationship
quite clear to the five students.
He probably ended his spiel
with some line about the "best
interests of Stanford."
Naturally, what Sterling could
tell to five students — in confi
dence — he would never tell to
five thousand students. That
would have been admitting the
inadmissable: that "ban the
bomb" advocate Mulford Q. Sib
ley was sold-out to shore up a
government grant for atomic re
search.
In a certain sense, the "best
interests" of Stanford were
served by the Sibley case, even
though Wallace Sterling and
Fred Terman probably didn't
realize it: Mulford Q. Sibley
aroused more genuine student
concern in one year on campus
than Sterling and Terman have
in their entire careers. It wasn't
just because he could shake
campus apathy to the point
where 3000 students showed up
for "stop-the-test" demonstra
tions, or because he may have
proved that Stanford was not
good enough for Mulford Q. Sib
ley.
What is most important, I
think, is that with the coming
of Mulford Q. Sibley in 1957, stu
dents started to ask questions
about the type of education they
were receiving. And that in
fluence has never been stronger
than today.
