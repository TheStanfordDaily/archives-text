# Letters To The Editor
## Witch-hunts Everywhere 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Just for the fun of it, T wish
to take issue with at least a por
tion of Robert E. Stone's highly
critical review of The Crucible.
(As for ACT's performance of
it, I have not seen it and can
not comment.) I quote: "The
main problem with The Cruci
ble, however, is a fault of the
play itself. The book can hardly
be described as meaningful for
our time, and witchcraft? —
you've got to be kidding."
Perhaps Mr. Stone is kidding.
The play is about witch-hunting,
not witchcraft. Its theme, sadly,
is timeless, as is evidenced by
the crucifixion, the Inquisitions,
the Dreyfus affair, Nazi Ger
many, and the McCarthy era
(when the play was written).
The play, in my own opinion, is
not only good, but meaningful.

Editor, The Daily:
I am grateful that Mr. Stone
was able to see the ACT produc
tion of The Crucible. It is un
fortunate, however, that he was
in a position to review the play.
Miller wrote this play for the
many Mr. Stones who are un
able to recognize the fact that
witch hunts are still very much
in vogue with only the external
details having changed.
Miller wrote this timely work
during the black period of Mc-
Carthy witch hunts and the 1692
Salem setting only serves to
emphasize the timelessness of

social and political harassment.
Even today as the search goes
on in attempting to find an in
stigator and scapegoat for the
rioting we can find the elements
of a contemporary witch hunt
— spirit of suppression, desire
for conformity and mass hys
teria created by persecutors of
social and political "heretics"
are still with us.
Please Mr. Stone! It is you
who has "got to be kidding."

The rats have their friends
in the House of Representatives
That august body recently re
jected a bill giving Federal aid
of $40 million over three years
to city programs combating rats.
Among the rodents' friends
was Congressman Joel BroyhiU
(Rep. Va.) who reportedly said
"the 'rat' smart thing" for the
House to do was to reject "this
rat bill 'rat' now."
How can this "congressman"
joke about such a bill which
would mainly protect the poor
slum children of America — the
rat's favorite morsel?
Congress routinely votes funds
to protect cattle and crops from
rodents — why can't it do as
much for kids?
One hopes the House will re
consider as the President re
quested. As for Va. Congress
man Broyhill — SIC SEMPER,
STUPIDITY!
