## 
### MARY DEDINSKY 
Howard Taubman, critic-at-large
for The New York Times, concluded
in his lectures on the American the
ater Tuesday and Wednesday that
most progress in the theater will be
made on the musical stage.
"The biggest amounts of money are
being invested in the musical stage,"
he said Tuesday, "and there is more
leeway to take chances because every
one is trying to make a killing in this
form." Wednesday he added, "This
is not what I want, it is what I ex
pect."
vSpeaking on "The American Musi
cal Theater" Tuesday night in Cub
berley Auditorium, Taubman said,
"The musical theater owes it all to the
girls." lie went on to explain how in
1866 a play producer and a girl's bal
let troupe producer combined forces
to form one of the first musicals.
While tracing the beginnings of the
chorus girl and strip-teaser, Taubman
said, "Woman played an important
part in the shaping of the American
musical," bringing chuckles from the
audience at his unintentional pun.
laubman showed how the style of
songs and lyrics have changed since
1866 by playing excerpts from differ
ent eras, including ones as "I'm An

Indian," "Vagabond King," and "Var
sity Drag." Taubman attributed
much of the change in the musical
theater to such writers as Rogers and
Hart, Cole Porter, and George Ger
shwin.
Taubman said the American musi
cal is and is not a unique achieve
ment. "In a world perspective, no,"
he said. "I would say the best musical
is one like The Marriage of Figaro.'
But then, again, yes, as it brought to
gether in a fresh and new way, story,
dance, costume, and spectacle."
In his lecture on the "American
Drama" Wednesday afternoon, Taub
man said that the drama is in crisis
and that it always has been.
Explaining why the American the
ater is in such a poor state today.
Taubman criticized the producers as
working "for a buck" and the actors
as being "badly trained." He said the
good writers arc turning to television
and writing novels for better pay and
that possible loyal audiences are be
ing discouraged by too expensive
ticket prices.
Taubman looks with little hope to
Off-Broadway, Bepcrtorv Theaters
and University Theaters in helping to
revive the "substantial theater." He
sees government and foundation sup
port as the most significant help.

in his lectures on the American the
ater Tuesday and Wednesday that
most progress in the theater will be
made on the musical stage.
"The biggest amounts of money are
being invested in the musical stage,"
he said Tuesday, "and there is more
leeway to take chances because every
one is trying to make a killing in this
form." Wednesday he added, "This
is not what I want, it is what I ex
pect."
vSpeaking on "The American Musi
cal Theater" Tuesday night in Cub
berley Auditorium, Taubman said,
"The musical theater owes it all to the
girls." lie went on to explain how in
1866 a play producer and a girl's bal
let troupe producer combined forces
to form one of the first musicals.
While tracing the beginnings of the
chorus girl and strip-teaser, Taubman
said, "Woman played an important
part in the shaping of the American
musical," bringing chuckles from the
audience at his unintentional pun.
laubman showed how the style of
songs and lyrics have changed since
1866 by playing excerpts from differ
ent eras, including ones as "I'm An

Indian," "Vagabond King," and "Var
sity Drag." Taubman attributed
much of the change in the musical
theater to such writers as Rogers and
Hart, Cole Porter, and George Ger
shwin.
Taubman said the American musi
cal is and is not a unique achieve
ment. "In a world perspective, no,"
he said. "I would say the best musical
is one like The Marriage of Figaro.'
But then, again, yes, as it brought to
gether in a fresh and new way, story,
dance, costume, and spectacle."
In his lecture on the "American
Drama" Wednesday afternoon, Taub
man said that the drama is in crisis
and that it always has been.
Explaining why the American the
ater is in such a poor state today.
Taubman criticized the producers as
working "for a buck" and the actors
as being "badly trained." He said the
good writers arc turning to television
and writing novels for better pay and
that possible loyal audiences are be
ing discouraged by too expensive
ticket prices.
Taubman looks with little hope to
Off-Broadway, Bepcrtorv Theaters
and University Theaters in helping to
revive the "substantial theater." He
sees government and foundation sup
port as the most significant help.
