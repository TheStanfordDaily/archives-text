# Ram's Head Presents cummings' 'him'
## 
### BUCK NIEHOFF 
e. e. cummings' him is a three
ring Barnum and Bailey circus for
intellectuals. It's as bizarre as a side
show, as comic as the antics of
clowns and as breath-taking as the
careful movements of a tight rope
walker. An enjoyable production of
this play opened last night at the
Nitery. It is to be presented again
tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
The play concerns the conflict be
tween Him, a playwright, and his
beloved, Me, who has become preg
nant. Her pregnancy is represented
by a placard picturing a doctor anes
thetizing a woman and by a sur
realistic scene of a freak show at a
circus. Nine freaks, symbolizing her
months of pregnancy, are depicted.
The ninth is a depiction of Me and
her baby.
The cause of the lovers' conflict is
best explained by cummings' six
nonlectures, in which the poet-play
wright asserts that "Him's deepest
wish is to compose a miraculously
intense play-of-art—Me's underlying
ambition is to be entirely loved by
someone through whom she may
safely have a child. He loves, not
herself, but the loveliness of his
mistress. ... For him, sexual ecstasy
is a form of selftranscendence: for
her, it's a means to an end (mother
hood)."
In short, Him fears that the world
of Me and her baby entering his
life will destroy his ability to create
art. Therefore, when the ninth freak
at the circus side show — represent
ing Me and her baby — is revealed
to him, he utters a cry of terror and
runs away.
Him, played by Ed Graziano, is a
man who has found "the third voice
of 'life,'" which explains why his
name is in the third person. In other

words, Him is an artist, a sensitive,
special sort of person. And Graziano
plays Him with a very real feeling
for the complex moods and emotions
of an artist. He is convincingly cyn
ical, loving, depressed and confused.
Moreover, Graziano believes in the
character he portrays, a fact that
enables him to make some rather
confusing lines sound meaningful.
Me, however, is not quite as con
vincingly portrayed as Him. Played
by Jeanie Daigle, Me is a "poor old
fliver," who knows she hasn't any
brains. Unfortunately, Miss Daigle
fails to make Me an interesting char
acter. Her speech lacks variety and
her actions are too repititous even
for someone who is supposed to be
dull. Furthermore, she does not suc
ceed in conveying her love of Him.
There is no excitement in her voice
when she talks to Him. Nor is there
any longing in her eyes when she
looks at her lover.
Despite these few faults, the ac
tors are generally well directed. Ex
cept for one or two of the slap-stick
clowns of the second act, all the ac
tors seem to understand what they
are doing. Generally, Director Joel
Mills has succeeded in making his
production meaningful. He managed
to capture the circus-like spirit of the
play by making his audience so en
thralled that they become a part of
the production.
However, Mills failed to give his
actors a sense of timing or tempo.
Hut this fault is not entirely his. It
is the result of the technical limita
tions of the Nitery, which necessi
tated clumsy and time consuming
scene c hang es. D u ring these
changes, the show loses its rhythm.
In any case, Mills has created a sat
isfying and sometimes meaningful
production of a difficult play.

production meaningful. He managed
to capture the circus-like spirit of the
play by making his audience so en
thralled that they become a part of
the production.
However, Mills failed to give his
actors a sense of timing or tempo.
Hut this fault is not entirely his. It
is the result of the technical limita
tions of the Nitery, which necessi
tated clumsy and time consuming
scene c hang es. D u ring these
changes, the show loses its rhythm.
In any case, Mills has created a sat
isfying and sometimes meaningful
production of a difficult play.
e. e. cummings' him is a three
ring Barnum and Bailey circus for
intellectuals. It's as bizarre as a side
show, as comic as the antics of
clowns and as breath-taking as the
careful movements of a tight rope
walker. An enjoyable production of
this play opened last night at the
Nitery. It is to be presented again
tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
The play concerns the conflict be
tween Him, a playwright, and his
beloved, Me, who has become preg
nant. Her pregnancy is represented
by a placard picturing a doctor anes
thetizing a woman and by a sur
realistic scene of a freak show at a
circus. Nine freaks, symbolizing her
months of pregnancy, are depicted.
The ninth is a depiction of Me and
her baby.
The cause of the lovers' conflict is
best explained by cummings' six
nonlectures, in which the poet-play
wright asserts that "Him's deepest
wish is to compose a miraculously
intense play-of-art—Me's underlying
ambition is to be entirely loved by
someone through whom she may
safely have a child. He loves, not
herself, but the loveliness of his
mistress. ... For him, sexual ecstasy
is a form of selftranscendence: for
her, it's a means to an end (mother
hood)."
In short, Him fears that the world
of Me and her baby entering his
life will destroy his ability to create
art. Therefore, when the ninth freak
at the circus side show — represent
ing Me and her baby — is revealed
to him, he utters a cry of terror and
runs away.
Him, played by Ed Graziano, is a
man who has found "the third voice
of 'life,'" which explains why his
name is in the third person. In other

words, Him is an artist, a sensitive,
special sort of person. And Graziano
plays Him with a very real feeling
for the complex moods and emotions
of an artist. He is convincingly cyn
ical, loving, depressed and confused.
Moreover, Graziano believes in the
character he portrays, a fact that
enables him to make some rather
confusing lines sound meaningful.
Me, however, is not quite as con
vincingly portrayed as Him. Played
by Jeanie Daigle, Me is a "poor old
fliver," who knows she hasn't any
brains. Unfortunately, Miss Daigle
fails to make Me an interesting char
acter. Her speech lacks variety and
her actions are too repititous even
for someone who is supposed to be
dull. Furthermore, she does not suc
ceed in conveying her love of Him.
There is no excitement in her voice
when she talks to Him. Nor is there
any longing in her eyes when she
looks at her lover.
Despite these few faults, the ac
tors are generally well directed. Ex
cept for one or two of the slap-stick
clowns of the second act, all the ac
tors seem to understand what they
are doing. Generally, Director Joel
Mills has succeeded in making his
production meaningful. He managed
to capture the circus-like spirit of the
