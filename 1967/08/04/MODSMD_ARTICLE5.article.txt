# SLAC Builds Camera To 'See' Atomic Nuclei
## 
### 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has recently put into
operation a 40-inch hydrogen bubble
chamber, the third largest in the U.S.
Built in the record time of two and a
half years, the bubble chamber is
used to detect "nuclear events" that
occur when hydrogen nuclei are bom
barded by high-energy particles from
the two-mile long linear accelerator
at SLAC.
Bubble chambers are among the
most complex and sophistocated in
struments used to "see" sub-nuclear
particles in action. They are employ
ed by physicists to photograph tracks

left behind by the speeding invisible
bits of matter.
Cost $2.5 Million
The new SLAC chamber, which is
as large as a locomotive and as accu
rate as a Swiss watch, was built by a
50-man group of SLAC engineers and
technicians at a cost of $2.5 million.
Group leader Richard L. Blumberg
estimates the job represents about 90
man-years of work. Similar chambers
have required at least twice as long
to build.
Like the rest of SLAC operations,
the bubble chamber construction was
supported by the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission. It was under the super
vision of Professor Joseph Ballam,
SLAC's research division director.
Other key experts included Dr. Ste
phen J. St. Laurent, controls and re
frigeration specialist and John W.
Mark, mechanical engineer.
Holds Hydrogen
The chamber is a stainless-steel
cylinder, 40 inches in diameter and
20 inches deep. It holds 100 gallons
of liquid hydrogen. High-energy par
ticles enter the chamber through a
thin aluminum window on one side.
Simultaneously, three pictures are
taken through an eight-inch-thick
glass window at one end.

A high-vacuum tank, plus hundreds
of layers of aluminized plastic sheet,
insulate the chamber. Inside the li
quid hydrogen is kept at approxi
mately 414 degrees below zero (Fahr
enheit), or nine degrees above its
boiling point. A bellows-operated
piston at one end of the chamber
keeps the hydrogen at five times at
mospheric pressure, which prevents
its boiling. If nuclear events are to be
recorded, the piston lowers the pres
sure and the tracks of the high-energy
particles become visible.
How Pictures are Taken
When a physicist desires pictures
to be taken, the piston and camera
are triggered about 30 thousandths of
a second ahead of a single beam pulse
of particles from the accelerator.
Each pulse is less than two millionths
of a second long. The entire cycle of
operation takes half a second.
Professor Ballam, expects the re
sults with SLAC's bubble chamber to
be especially interesting because of
the accelerator's unique ability to
produce photons (X-ray and gamma
rays) of precisely known energies.
"It wil be the first time anywhere,"
Professor Ballam said, "that a high
energy, mono-energetic photon beam
has been produced."
