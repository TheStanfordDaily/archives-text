# MFA Student To Direct Word Show
## 
### 
The Word Show, a new concept
in sounds, using a kaleidoscope of
rhythms, is to be presented at the
Nitery next Friday, August 11, at 11
p.m. The play is directed hv Ellen
Perry, Stanford M.F.A. student in act
ing.
The idea for a word show origi
nated at Webster College in St. Louis
in 1963. Miss Perry explained that the
show is basically an exercise in rhy
thmic speech. The performers read
interesting items found in news
papers, parts of plays, poems and por
tions of books. Combined with the
reading is rhythmic finger clicking,
foot stomping and hand clapping. The
result seems similar to folk singing.
Miss Perry said that the works of
Amy Lowell, e. e. cummings, Robert
Frost, Carl Sandberg, Ocden Nash

and Ferlinghetti, among others will
be read. Also a few original works are
to be included. Some folk songs are
also to be performed.
