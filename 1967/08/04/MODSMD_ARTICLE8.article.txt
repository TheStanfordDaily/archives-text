### 
This morning's paper is the last is
sue of the Daily for the summer. In
it there are a number of technical ex
periments which are being performed
as an exercise in creative journalism.
Among these experiments are the
following: The use color; the setting
of the entire front page in ten point
rather than eight point type. These
experiments are forerunners of future
newspaper format. We hope that they
are as enjoyable as we think they are.
