# Bergman Tonight
## 
### 
Summer nights have three
smiles: the first one is for young
lovers who run away; the sec
ond one is for the simpleton;
and the third one is for the lone
ly. "Smiles of a Summer Night"
(Tresidder Union at 7:30 and
8:30; International Center at
9:30), one of Bergman's middle
career films, is probably one of
the best he ever made. It is full
of wit fun love smiles tears, in
and out of theatre nature life
within mirrors without mirrors.
Compared with "Persona", many
scenes will seem to be too full
and some camera work looks
pretty usual. But Bergman was
then still concerned with mir
rors and the theatre-in-life vs.
the life-in-theatre, in its very
wide range of shades and uncer
tainties which are rendered by
means of peculiar grey tones,
and the attempt of constructing
a cinematic continuity of what is
real theatre, seeming theatre,
seeming life, real life. Mirrors
disappear in "Persona": there is
no need for them anymore, the
symbolic form has become the
coherent expression of irrationa
lity, which is presented at differ
ent levels but does not need ra
tional instances to appear clear
ly as form in itself. The naked
ness Desiree talks about in
"Smiles" becomes the focus in
"Persona". The emphasis on ob
jects and particulars, the accu
rate study of ambiances, and
the cinematic relationships be
tween objects and characters are
reversed in focus from "Smiles"
through "The Magician" through
"Silence" to "Persona". "Smiles"
has a very quick pace in the
first part where the characters
are introduced: Fredrik, a law
yer, his wife Anne, his son Hen
rik, the maid, the actress De
siree, Count Malcolm and his
wife. Desiree has been Fredrik's
lover for some time, then he
got married to Anne, eighteen
years old and still a virgin after
two years of marriage. Malcolm
has taken Fredrik's place in De
siree's life, maybe for support
maybe for fun (he is an officer).
Henrik's character will be devel
oped in a number of movies
done after "Smiles", with differ
ent names and importance: here
he is a Theology student who
loves Anne but makes love with

the maid and worries about him
self others the entire world in
terms of meaning of words. Love
and making love and how to
make love and what is love and
what it takes to love and what
love brings: all this is the cen
ter of the discourse. We never
see on the screen (during the
first half of the movie) more
than three persons at a time, and
often the camera switches back
and forth between the two faces
in the scene while the third one
is there either as a chorus or as
another object. Desiree invites
everybody to her mother's home
—and this is probably the only
abstract character in this movie
—, and from this point on Berg
man's work seems to me to be
much more relaxed more subtle
more stringent than in any of his
previous movies, but also strictly
related to "Wild Strawberries".
True, some sequences will re
mind the spectator of the early
Dreyer ("The Master of the
House"), but the pace is very
slow on the surface only. Berg
man's love for objects becomes
here much more selective with
clearer symbols attached to
them; figurative jokes are of an
incredible inventiveness, some
gestures have a fantastic pictor
ial purity, as we go through the
three smiles of the summer
night. In "Persona" the en
tire story is at the symbolic
level, symbols and their re
lations are the elements of
the film; in "Smiles" we have
more of an outline of the rela
tionships between persons and
the characterization of symbols
is left to the photographic work
on objects and gestures. "Smiles"
seems to me to be one of the
best comedies (of errors with
out errors) ever done with a
very rare freshness, inventive
ness, and with a lot of style. The
elements of the comedy are laid
out and treated in such a way
that the spectator cannot allow
himself to rest; and every sen
tence, every frame is a critical
discussion of previous sentences,
frames. The actors are members
of the usual Bergman troupe,
known to everybody but never
appreciated enough. Tonight is
a summer night . . . ; see this
movie.

(Tresidder Union at 7:30 and
8:30; International Center at
9:30), one of Bergman's middle
career films, is probably one of
the best he ever made. It is full
of wit fun love smiles tears, in
and out of theatre nature life
within mirrors without mirrors.
Compared with "Persona", many
scenes will seem to be too full
and some camera work looks
pretty usual. But Bergman was
then still concerned with mir
rors and the theatre-in-life vs.
the life-in-theatre, in its very
wide range of shades and uncer
tainties which are rendered by
means of peculiar grey tones,
and the attempt of constructing
a cinematic continuity of what is
real theatre, seeming theatre,
seeming life, real life. Mirrors
disappear in "Persona": there is
no need for them anymore, the
symbolic form has become the
coherent expression of irrationa
lity, which is presented at differ
ent levels but does not need ra
tional instances to appear clear
ly as form in itself. The naked
ness Desiree talks about in
"Smiles" becomes the focus in
"Persona". The emphasis on ob
jects and particulars, the accu
rate study of ambiances, and
the cinematic relationships be
tween objects and characters are
reversed in focus from "Smiles"
through "The Magician" through
"Silence" to "Persona". "Smiles"
has a very quick pace in the
first part where the characters
are introduced: Fredrik, a law
yer, his wife Anne, his son Hen
rik, the maid, the actress De
siree, Count Malcolm and his
wife. Desiree has been Fredrik's
lover for some time, then he
got married to Anne, eighteen
years old and still a virgin after
two years of marriage. Malcolm
has taken Fredrik's place in De
siree's life, maybe for support
maybe for fun (he is an officer).
Henrik's character will be devel
oped in a number of movies
done after "Smiles", with differ
ent names and importance: here
he is a Theology student who
loves Anne but makes love with

the maid and worries about him
self others the entire world in
terms of meaning of words. Love
and making love and how to
make love and what is love and
what it takes to love and what
love brings: all this is the cen
ter of the discourse. We never
see on the screen (during the
first half of the movie) more
than three persons at a time, and
often the camera switches back
and forth between the two faces
in the scene while the third one
is there either as a chorus or as
another object. Desiree invites
everybody to her mother's home
—and this is probably the only
abstract character in this movie
—, and from this point on Berg
man's work seems to me to be
much more relaxed more subtle
more stringent than in any of his
previous movies, but also strictly
related to "Wild Strawberries".
True, some sequences will re
mind the spectator of the early
Dreyer ("The Master of the
House"), but the pace is very
slow on the surface only. Berg
man's love for objects becomes
here much more selective with
clearer symbols attached to
them; figurative jokes are of an
incredible inventiveness, some
gestures have a fantastic pictor
ial purity, as we go through the
three smiles of the summer
night. In "Persona" the en
tire story is at the symbolic
level, symbols and their re
lations are the elements of
the film; in "Smiles" we have
more of an outline of the rela
tionships between persons and
the characterization of symbols
is left to the photographic work
on objects and gestures. "Smiles"
seems to me to be one of the
best comedies (of errors with
out errors) ever done with a
very rare freshness, inventive
ness, and with a lot of style. The
elements of the comedy are laid
out and treated in such a way
that the spectator cannot allow
himself to rest; and every sen
tence, every frame is a critical
discussion of previous sentences,
frames. The actors are members
of the usual Bergman troupe,
known to everybody but never
appreciated enough. Tonight is
a summer night . . . ; see this
movie.
