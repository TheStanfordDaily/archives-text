# Speakers Identify Individual As Focal Point Of Education

### BARBARA LEVIN 
"Education is a struggle with
in yourselves, not a struggle
against an institution," empha
sized Peter Lyman, ASSU Presi
dent, in a speech to the class of
1971 in Memorial Auditorium
Thursday morning. His com
ments were part of an orienta
tion program in which Dean Joel
Smith, Dean of Students, and
sophomore Gail Anderson, also
spoke.
The trio of speeches, intended
to introduce the freshmen to the
University and its meaning,
stressed the individual as the
focal point of the educative proc
ess. The speakers presented
casual definitions of learning
and maintained an appropriate
air of personal discourse.
Smith, the first speaker, said
"the basic aspiration of an un
dergraduate education is the de
velopment of critical individuals
whose standards of judgments
are intellectual and uncommitted
to any claims of this world."
He defended education as a
relationship between the single
student and learning, and denied
the current view that the small
group or social experience is

more valuable. The desire for
relevance of learning was also
put aside by his supporting re
marks, but he acknowledged
this concern as a characteristic
of this student generation.
In his depiction of the schol
arly life, Smith commented upon
the hazards which could con
front the student. He warned
against developing an intellec
tual approach which would limit
"the awareness in non-intellec
tual or feeling dimensions of
life."
Smith recognized the possi
bility that the life of a student
could be lonely because it re
quired isolation and freedom.
Although he saw this form of
emancipation as necessary for
growth, he admitted the uncer
tainties involved.
Anderson Looks Back
Miss Anderson dwelled upon
this loss of security in her
speech. She looked back up
on her year as a freshman
and the mistakes she had made.
In her discussion of a free uni
versity environment, she de
scribed the complete feeling of
aloneness experienced by a

freshman: "those of you who
found a kind of security in re
bellion are discovering that
what was revolutionary in high
school is often taken for granted
here."
After exploring some of the
different attempts at escaping
from the trials of uncertainty,
Miss Anderson explained her
own realization that "education
meant a break from security —
change and growth and maturity
only come from placing your
self in situations where you do
not know what the outcome will
be."
By placing oneself into such
a position of self inquiry, Miss
Anderson believes that a stu
dent has the opportunity to add
to the university.
She said the university "was
never designed to lead you to
an education, to give you a
smooth, charted course with a
guaranteed end product. It was
designed to give you a challenge
whereby you might seek your
own education, and in doing so
contribute to the betterment of
the university."
