# Speakers Identify Individual As Focal Point Of Education

### BARBARA LEVIN 
"Education is a struggle with
in yourselves, not a struggle
against an institution," empha
sized Peter Lyman, ASSU Presi
dent, in a speech to the class of
1971 in Memorial Auditorium
Thursday morning. His com
ments were part of an orienta
tion program in which Dean Joel
Smith, Dean of Students, and
sophomore Gail Anderson, also
spoke.
The trio of speeches, intended
to introduce the freshmen to the
University and its meaning,
stressed the individual as the
focal point of the educative proc
ess. The speakers presented
casual definitions of learning
and maintained an appropriate
air of personal discourse.
Smith, the first speaker, said
"the basic aspiration of an un
dergraduate education is the de
velopment of critical individuals
whose standards of judgments
are intellectual and uncommitted
to any claims of this world."
He defended education as a
relationship between the single
student and learning, and denied
the current view that the small
group or social experience is

more valuable. The desire for
relevance of learning was also
put aside by his supporting re
marks, but he acknowledged
this concern as a characteristic
of this student generation.
In his depiction of the schol
arly life, Smith commented upon
the hazards which could con
front the student. He warned
against developing an intellec
tual approach which would limit
"the awareness in non-intellec
tual or feeling dimensions of
life."
Smith recognized the possi
bility that the life of a student
could be lonely because it re
quired isolation and freedom.
Although he saw this form of
emancipation as necessary for
growth, he admitted the uncer
tainties involved.
Anderson Looks Back
Miss Anderson dwelled upon
this loss of security in her
speech. She looked back up
on her year as a freshman
and the mistakes she had made.
In her discussion of a free uni
versity environment, she de
scribed the complete feeling of
aloneness experienced by a

freshman: "those of you who
found a kind of security in re
bellion are discovering that
what was revolutionary in high
school is often taken for granted
here."
After exploring some of the
different attempts at escaping
from the trials of uncertainty,
Miss Anderson explained her
own realization that "education
meant a break from security â€”
change and growth and maturity
only come from placing your
self in situations where you do
not know what the outcome will
be."
By placing oneself into such
a position of self inquiry, Miss
Anderson believes that a stu
dent has the opportunity to add
to the university.
She said the university "was
never designed to lead you to
an education, to give you a
smooth, charted course with a
guaranteed end product. It was
designed to give you a challenge
whereby you might seek your
own education, and in doing so
contribute to the betterment of
the university."
Lyman also spoke about the
active role which a student must
be committed to play in order
to derive benefit from an edu
cation.
"The single most important
purpose that the university can
perform is to aid in the process
of self-knowledge. However, do
not confuse going to a univer
sity with education," he warned.
Lyman explained one problem
of students today is their accep
tance of Clark Kerr's model of
the "multiversity" as a machine.
"The student sees his own edu
cation as a product of the ma
chine and is passive to it."
Lyman noted that the multi
versity is a reflection of a so
ciety and is designed to "make
you normal but will it make
you sane." He urged the fresh
men not to accept this form of
education and suggested ways
in which to avoid this pattern.
Test of A Teacher
In making these recommenda
tions, Lyman explained the test
of a teacher and also of knowl
edge. "A teacher is a man whose
life reflects his attitudes."
In contradiction to Smith. Ly
man felt that knowledge is find
ing the relationship between
facts and one's personal life. He
described mere facts as training
and not education.
Lyman concluded that Stan
ford requires a catalist to be
come a community of scholars,
which he defined as "a commu
nity of people sharing this strug
gle to know themselves."
The reactions of the freshmen
to the speeches were varied, but
generally favorable. One ex
pressed her appreciation for
Miss Anderson's remarks on the
loss of security. A man from one
of the Wilbur Houses asked
Peter Lyman after the meeting
to organize a discussion group
on his ideas about the definition
of a teacher. "I feel differently
now about the university than
I did before I heard these
speeches," concluded a Roble
girl.
