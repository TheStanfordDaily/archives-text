# WHY STANFORD?
## Freshmen Voice Opinions 
### 
Daily reporter Mark Weinberger was on the scene Wednesday
to greet the arriving tides of freshmen. To add to tlwir confusion,
he fuid a few questions ready for them.
Question No. 1: Why did you choose Stanford over your second
choice college?
RON KADZIEL, Madera House, Wilbur —"I figure that if I grad
uate from Stanford instead of my second choice college I'll be a
lot better off in the business world and make a little bit better
money and better social position. I'll get a better education."
MICHAEL MANDISH, Junipero House, Wilbur —"I really didn't
have a second choice college. Stanford was the only college I really
wanted to go to.
DICK HIGHFIELD, Muir House, Stem — "I didn't get into my
first choice college which was Air Force Academy. Over any other
university I like Stanford's academic standard. It was highly recom
mended to me by a neighbor of mine who will be a junior here."
PAUL SHERMAN, Muir House, Stern — "I like the light-hearted
educational atmosphere that appears here at Stanford, the friendly
people, and also the idea that it's a coeducational institution in
terested in all the people rather than just cataloguing their brain
power."
SHELLY HIGCINS, Roble — "I chose Stanford because it's so
much bigger and I felt there was much more opportunity in many
fields and much more excitement than at my second choice, Occi
dental. My first choice was Branner because I wanted to try it, but
being at Roble doesn't make much difference to me."
BONNIE KOBER, Roble —"Stanford is the one school I have
wanted to go to forever. 1 can't think of anv other place I'd rather

be. I expert to mature educationally, but I also expect to get a lot
of fun out of it, and I think I will. I wanted to live in Roble. I think
we'll pet enough of the boys, and at Roble we can get to know the
girls."


l>aily reporter Welnlierger listens to Eleanor Godwin, who praiMil
Grove House's "informal atmosphere."
CAROLINE McGILVRAY, Ro
hle- It's been a tradition for Me-
Gilvrays to go to Stanford sinee
it's been built, so I've been told
about Stanford all my life and
it's been built up until it was
the only school I even considered
going to. I worked toward it my
whole four years of high
school."

Question No. 2: Why did you de
cide to apply for a "Demonstra
tion" House?
MARIAN PALME It, Soto
House"l applied for Soto be
cause I think it gives the fresh
man student much more inter
action with upperclassmen and
graduate students. It gives him
more of a central theme to con
centrate on in his living house.
Creativity as a theme allows
people to explore more or less
what a university can give to
them and what they can give to
a university. I think that co-cd
living is a good idea because I

think that it gives the student
much more exposure to different
types of people and different
types of interests."
BRYAN QUIGLEY, Grove
House. ."I dig the coeducational
aspect and also the creativity
aspect—the seminar."
DENNIS SHAVER, GARY
STANWYCK, JOHN HAINS
WORTH, Serra House—They all
agreed that the house theme —
community service — was more
important than the coeducation
aspect. Dennis said, "You can
find girls anywhere."
MARTHA SWARD,
like the academic them£ of the
house, helping racial minorities
and underprivileged groups. I
thought it would be more inter
esting than just living with a
lot of other kids but not doing
anything academic with them.
The co-ed situation was not my
deciding factor. It was nice, but
I could do without it."
BECKY DANIELS, Otero
House, Wilbur—"l decided to
join Otero because of its theme
of international affairs. I'm in
terested in studying languages
and becoming an interpreter or
working for the government or

in Europe. I think the co-ed
dorm situation is a good idea
because I've always found it
natural to be friends with boys.
It's a great deal to be able to
live and talk with them."
JIM YOUNG, RICHARD
CARP, Otero Jim: "I decided
that an international hall could
give me more of a liberal type
of atmosphere in that you get
more of a diversity of viewpoint
than if I'd just applied for a
normal hall." Richard: "I chose
Otero because I'm planning on
taking a major in Far Eastern
Affairs History and I also have
an interest in politics. I think
that the hall, being both co-ed

and multi-classed, woula give a
little bit more individual free
dom, and a little bit less restric
tion."

Question No. 3: Why did you
choose to apply for co-ed living?
MARG GREER, JULIE
F R A N T Z, Branner — M a r g:
"Just because it's an experiment
and it's something new and it's
a good way to meet a lot of peo
ple. My older sister lived in
Branner and I thought I'd keep
up the family tradition." Julie:
"Because I like to meet people

as people and I want to know
boys as people, not just as dates.
I think it's a good way to learn
about people."
DIANE FISHER, Branner —
"Because I lived in one last sum
mer at Santa Barbara. It was
fun."

LARRY RUSSELL, Branner—
"I thought it would be a little
bit easier for me to find more
friends, and make more ac
quaintances, especially with fe
males. I figured the kids I'd
meet up with would be my
type."
STEWART WILLIAMS, Bran
ner —"My first choice was the
international dorm and my next
was all men's dorm and my
third was the coeducational
dorm. I think it will work out
alright because there's nothing
to it. It's been this way all my
life. At my high school there
were- girls and boys, so actually
I find it nothing new."
FRED WITTER, Branner —
"It doesn't make any difference
to me. Of course, if there were
co-ed rooms it would make a dif
ference, but unfortunately they
haven't made that modification
yet."
