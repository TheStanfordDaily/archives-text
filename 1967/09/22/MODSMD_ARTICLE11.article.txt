### 
Daily reporter Mark Weinberger was on the scene Wednesday
to greet the arriving tides of freshmen. To add to tlwir confusion,
he fuid a few questions ready for them.
Question No. 1: Why did you choose Stanford over your second
choice college?
RON KADZIEL, Madera House, Wilbur —"I figure that if I grad
uate from Stanford instead of my second choice college I'll be a
lot better off in the business world and make a little bit better
money and better social position. I'll get a better education."
MICHAEL MANDISH, Junipero House, Wilbur —"I really didn't
have a second choice college. Stanford was the only college I really
wanted to go to.
DICK HIGHFIELD, Muir House, Stem — "I didn't get into my
first choice college which was Air Force Academy. Over any other
university I like Stanford's academic standard. It was highly recom
mended to me by a neighbor of mine who will be a junior here."
PAUL SHERMAN, Muir House, Stern — "I like the light-hearted
educational atmosphere that appears here at Stanford, the friendly
people, and also the idea that it's a coeducational institution in
terested in all the people rather than just cataloguing their brain
power."
SHELLY HIGCINS, Roble — "I chose Stanford because it's so
much bigger and I felt there was much more opportunity in many
fields and much more excitement than at my second choice, Occi
dental. My first choice was Branner because I wanted to try it, but
being at Roble doesn't make much difference to me."
BONNIE KOBER, Roble —"Stanford is the one school I have
wanted to go to forever. 1 can't think of anv other place I'd rather

be. I expert to mature educationally, but I also expect to get a lot
of fun out of it, and I think I will. I wanted to live in Roble. I think
we'll pet enough of the boys, and at Roble we can get to know the
girls."

Grove House's "informal atmosphere."
