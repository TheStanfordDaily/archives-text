# Brinks And Barriers
## 
### 
Throughout the summer, parents counseled
their soon-to-be freshmen pn how to make the
most of college. For many of these freshmen,
now arrived at Stanford, the advice may have
done more to place a barrier in front of them
than to enable them to gain the education they
deserve.
Most parents try to teach their children the
ethic of productivity — that hard work and
•material success form the meaning of life. If
man- fits well Into society, if he learns to per
form a defined role well, if he can support him
self, he is said to he a success.
Hf he can get good grades, do well in extracur
ricular activities, then society will say he has
made the most of college. Education becomes
the process of learning "how to work."
Many parents seem to care little for the
realities of the world and identities of their
children. The questioning and challenging "of
all one sees around him must be the stuff of
life. The university years should not he unique.
One should not question everything now and
then stop at forty or fifty. There is always so
much more to consider and to assimilate, and
the university environment must become the
environment of life.
Education cannot be learning only how to be
productive, how to disciplirie oneself, how to
fi tinto society.
Education should be discovering what is
really important to you, what things make it
possible for you 'o lead a life that has meaning
in a world that is too. often absurd. For more
and more students, that life of meaning must
be lived trying to change our society.
In their pursuit of education through ques
tioning, students walk the brink of two dis
asters, both more severe than never to have
questioned at all. *

The first is to emphasize so much the harm
done by following society blindly that one can
not understand any elements of that society.
Rejection of that, society then is illicit if one
cannot tolerate any discussion and exchange of
ideas, or even attempt to understand the mem
bers of that society.
Our educational philosophy states we must
question and understand before we accept or
reject something before us. Too many students
never try to understand the society they reject.
They have adopted a "new establishment" posi
tion just as misguided as the one held by those
blindly following the old establishment. Both
are closed to a myriad of ideas and both are
fanatically clinging, the old establishment to
security and the new establishment to a false
freedom.
The second disaster is to allow intense ques
tioning and an emphasis on the social aspects
of education 'to exclude the disciplined investi
gation of the ideas 'one encounters.
•It is easy to question all one confronts and to
challenge every value one sees in society. How
ever, it is difficult to come to an understanding
of these values and ideas. Too many students
make a sham of education by always question
ing and never seriously seeking answers, by
proclaiming the glories of * interpersonal rela
tionships but never studying the ideas such re
lationships stimulate. These people are open
and have discovered the way to education, but
fall into a sophisticated laziness.
Summer parental advice may save many
from these two disasters. But if it does, the
barriers placed before a freshman will have the
same effect — to limit his understanding of
what tiffs v world and this life might be. A fourth
alternative is needed, then, but each must find
it for himself.

•It is easy to question all one confronts and to
challenge every value one sees in society. How
ever, it is difficult to come to an understanding
of these values and ideas. Too many students
make a sham of education by always question
ing and never seriously seeking answers, by
proclaiming the glories of * interpersonal rela
tionships but never studying the ideas such re
lationships stimulate. These people are open
and have discovered the way to education, but
fall into a sophisticated laziness.
Summer parental advice may save many
from these two disasters. But if it does, the
barriers placed before a freshman will have the
same effect — to limit his understanding of
what tiffs v world and this life might be. A fourth
alternative is needed, then, but each must find
it for himself.
Throughout the summer, parents counseled
their soon-to-be freshmen pn how to make the
most of college. For many of these freshmen,
now arrived at Stanford, the advice may have
done more to place a barrier in front of them
than to enable them to gain the education they
deserve.
Most parents try to teach their children the
ethic of productivity — that hard work and
•material success form the meaning of life. If
man- fits well Into society, if he learns to per
form a defined role well, if he can support him
self, he is said to he a success.
Hf he can get good grades, do well in extracur
ricular activities, then society will say he has
made the most of college. Education becomes
the process of learning "how to work."
Many parents seem to care little for the
realities of the world and identities of their
children. The questioning and challenging "of
all one sees around him must be the stuff of
life. The university years should not he unique.
One should not question everything now and
then stop at forty or fifty. There is always so
much more to consider and to assimilate, and
the university environment must become the
environment of life.
Education cannot be learning only how to be
productive, how to disciplirie oneself, how to
fi tinto society.
Education should be discovering what is
really important to you, what things make it
possible for you 'o lead a life that has meaning
in a world that is too. often absurd. For more
and more students, that life of meaning must
be lived trying to change our society.
In their pursuit of education through ques
tioning, students walk the brink of two dis
asters, both more severe than never to have
questioned at all. *

The first is to emphasize so much the harm
done by following society blindly that one can
not understand any elements of that society.
Rejection of that, society then is illicit if one
cannot tolerate any discussion and exchange of
ideas, or even attempt to understand the mem
bers of that society.
Our educational philosophy states we must
question and understand before we accept or
reject something before us. Too many students
never try to understand the society they reject.
They have adopted a "new establishment" posi
tion just as misguided as the one held by those
blindly following the old establishment. Both
are closed to a myriad of ideas and both are
fanatically clinging, the old establishment to
security and the new establishment to a false
freedom.
