# Daily's Anniversary
## 
### 
The 75th Anniversary of The Stanford Daily
is not a particularly happy one. To evaluate
the performance of The Daily against the cri
teria of an ideal educational environment can
only show the void between what The Daily
might be and what it has been. Too often The
Daily has been something less than an educa
tional organ for its staff and the whole uni
versity.
Too often The Daily has been guilty of the
same cloSe-mindedness and lack of understand
ing that it sees throughout the university and
society. But the understanding does come hard
and The Daily clearly realizes its goal is dis
ciplined investigation. The investigation is not
for the benefit of the staff miter, but of the
over 15,000 persons who read, each issue.
The Daily must be totally, free to pursue its
investigation of society outside and inside the
university. Its perceptions may cause more
marked reactions than the utterings of indivi

â€¢ duals, but it is aware of that and is willing to
take the risk.
The Daily this volume'will dedicate itself to
careful investigation and open commentary. Its
news pages will reflect a balance of the events
significant to all of the Stanford Community.
Recognizing the impossibility of complete ob
jectivity in the news, The Daily yet acknowl
edges its obligation to understand the various
segments of that university community and
what should be' the issues significant to those
segments.
The Daily rejects any claim that it must be
an impartial observer to the happenings of the
University. It must always comment actively on
the prime" concerns for that society. It can only
take an active and independent part in the af
fairs of the University.
Newspapers have always tried, and often
failed, to separate fact and opinion. But The
Daily, now entering its 76th year, intends to
keep trying.
