# Guided Miscellany
## Getting Your Money's Worth 
### Christopher Hargrove 
Dear Freshmen,
Now that you are about to
plunk down your $590 for tui
tion and $380 for room and
board, you can -relax. You've
made it—welcome to the Farm.
Looking back to last April when
the acceptances and rejections
were .finding their way through
the mail, perhaps you can laugh
a little now.
It does seem a" little funny
that you worried so much. Re
member- how your scalp tingled
when the letter came from Stan
ford? Remember the heartburn
and the .nervous tension while
you waited for that day? .
Well, it's all over now. For
four years you can relax, be
cause it's a fact that once you're
into Stanford, 'it's pretty hard
to flunk out. All you have to do
is pile up 180 units, and big cor
porations will come knocking on
your door. It. sounds easy, and
it "is.

The hard part about being at
Stanford,, in fact, is.getting an
education. This -.paradox i§ not
so curious if you think about
it. After all, how much did you
learn in high school?
If you spent your high school
days grinding for- the grades
that got you into Stanford, you
will probably find the habit hard
to kick. And you may be well
rewarded; g<?od grades are not
hard to get here. Simply doing
the work will get you a B in
almost any 'course,, and with a
little more effort and a bare
minimum of imagination, you
can probably get an A. • '
Getting an A, however, is not
the same as getting an educa
tion, and this is where the going
gets a little tough. You will find
before long that there seems to
be a positive conspiracy to keep
you fro.m becoming, educated.
Stanford is just like high
school, except that 'now your

parents aren't around to keep
you on the straight and narrow.
The' University has taken over
this role. . ;
The job at hand is to prepare
you for comfortable places in
comfortable middle-class' Ameri
can society. You are supposed to
be intelligent, ambitious, imagi
native (but not too imaginative)
and curious (but not too curi
ous).
You have already seen some
thing of how Stanford works.
Pre-reg is five days of being
scheduled, programmed, talked
at, introduced — in short, of be
ing l?d by the nose.
This is not the fault of the prq
committee, which has worked
very hard to get you off to a
good start and open your minds
to th(? possibilities of Stanford.
But the way this is done is
typical of Stanford, as I sus
pect "it is of most universities.
After pre-reg is over you will

continue to have thi n g S made
easy for you. .But tl ie parallel
ends there. Beginnj ng nex t
Wednesday you will be grub
bing- for grades, and grubbing
makes it hard to conc en t ra te on
education.
The point was by
own father when I P-oudly told
him, last year, that I had gotten
some good grades oi ie Quarter
"When are you going t0 cut this
nonsense," he said "and get an
education?"
(For some good tJ lOU g hts on
what "education" is rea( j the
two books Peter Lyni an recom
mended in his letter t<_ you.)
So here are a- few w>rd s of
advice, this column's contribu
tion towards your "next cu*> 0 f
coffee:
Forget all about competition
and grades at least for this year.
If you want to go to a graduate
school, be assured that not one
cares an iota about your fresh
man grades. Use the energy yon
will thus save to read a few
more books that aren't on the
reading lists, make a few more
good friends and think some
more about the meaning of your
life.
Choose" your professors very
carefully. Most of them are a
staid lot who look forward only
to retiring after staid careers.
But a very few want to help
you get excited about life and
learning. These few professors
are the only thing you Can get
at Stanford that you can't find
anywhere else.
Don't be tempted by the
route the University lays oirt
before you. If all you want is a
good time and a degree, you
have eome to the right place.
But if you want an education,
you will have to work hard to
get your money's worth.

more books that aren't on the
reading lists, make a few more
good friends and think some
more about the meaning of your
life.
Choose" your professors very
carefully. Most of them are a
staid lot who look forward only
to retiring after staid careers.
But a very few want to help
you get excited about life and
learning. These few professors
are the only thing you Can get
at Stanford that you can't find
anywhere else.
Don't be tempted by the
route the University lays oirt
before you. If all you want is a
good time and a degree, you
have eome to the right place.
But if you want an education,
you will have to work hard to
get your money's worth.
Dear Freshmen,
Now that you are about to
plunk down your $590 for tui
tion and $380 for room and
board, you can -relax. You've
made it—welcome to the Farm.
Looking back to last April when
the acceptances and rejections
were .finding their way through
the mail, perhaps you can laugh
a little now.
It does seem a" little funny
that you worried so much. Re
member- how your scalp tingled
when the letter came from Stan
ford? Remember the heartburn
and the .nervous tension while
you waited for that day? .
Well, it's all over now. For
four years you can relax, be
cause it's a fact that once you're
into Stanford, 'it's pretty hard
to flunk out. All you have to do
is pile up 180 units, and big cor
porations will come knocking on
your door. It. sounds easy, and
it "is.

The hard part about being at
Stanford,, in fact, is.getting an
education. This -.paradox i§ not
so curious if you think about
it. After all, how much did you
learn in high school?
If you spent your high school
days grinding for- the grades
that got you into Stanford, you
will probably find the habit hard
to kick. And you may be well
rewarded; g<?od grades are not
hard to get here. Simply doing
the work will get you a B in
almost any 'course,, and with a
little more effort and a bare
minimum of imagination, you
can probably get an A. • '
Getting an A, however, is not
the same as getting an educa
tion, and this is where the going
gets a little tough. You will find
before long that there seems to
be a positive conspiracy to keep
you fro.m becoming, educated.
Stanford is just like high
school, except that 'now your

parents aren't around to keep
you on the straight and narrow.
The' University has taken over
this role. . ;
The job at hand is to prepare
you for comfortable places in
comfortable middle-class' Ameri
can society. You are supposed to
be intelligent, ambitious, imagi
native (but not too imaginative)
and curious (but not too curi
ous).
You have already seen some
thing of how Stanford works.
Pre-reg is five days of being
scheduled, programmed, talked
at, introduced — in short, of be
ing l?d by the nose.
This is not the fault of the prq
committee, which has worked
very hard to get you off to a
good start and open your minds
to th(? possibilities of Stanford.
But the way this is done is
typical of Stanford, as I sus
pect "it is of most universities.
After pre-reg is over you will

continue to have thi n g S made
easy for you. .But tl ie parallel
ends there. Beginnj ng nex t
Wednesday you will be grub
bing- for grades, and grubbing
makes it hard to conc en t ra te on
education.
The point was by
own father when I P-oudly told
him, last year, that I had gotten
some good grades oi ie Quarter
"When are you going t0 cut this
nonsense," he said "and get an
education?"
(For some good tJ lOU g hts on
what "education" is rea( j the
two books Peter Lyni an recom
mended in his letter t<_ you.)
So here are a- few w>rd s of
advice, this column's contribu
tion towards your "next cu*> 0 f
coffee:
Forget all about competition
and grades at least for this year.
If you want to go to a graduate
school, be assured that not one
cares an iota about your fresh
man grades. Use the energy yon
will thus save to read a few
more books that aren't on the
reading lists, make a few more

"When are you going t0 cut this
nonsense," he said "and get an
education?"
(For some good tJ lOU g hts on
what "education" is rea( j the
two books Peter Lyni an recom

So here are a- few w>rd s of
advice, this column's contribu
tion towards your "next cu*> 0 f
coffee:
Forget all about competition
and grades at least for this year.
If you want to go to a graduate
school, be assured that not one
cares an iota about your fresh
man grades. Use the energy yon
will thus save to read a few
more books that aren't on the
reading lists, make a few more
good friends and think some
more about the meaning of your
life.
Choose" your professors very
carefully. Most of them are a
staid lot who look forward only
to retiring after staid careers.
But a very few want to help
you get excited about life and
learning. These few professors
are the only thing you Can get
at Stanford that you can't find
anywhere else.
Don't be tempted by the
route the University lays oirt
before you. If all you want is a
good time and a degree, you
have eome to the right place.
But if you want an education,
you will have to work hard to
get your money's worth.
