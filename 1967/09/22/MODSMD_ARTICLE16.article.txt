# With A Fillip
## Is Pre-Reg Week Unreal? 
### Philip Taubman 
The main problem with Pve
re|j is that it ends. On Wednes
day next, the "HANDLE WITH
CARE" signs are removed from
the . freshmen and they are
thrust out into Stanford Uni
versity.
Not that Stanford's such a
bad place to be. It's just that
the freshmen haven't gone
through the proper Pre-thrust
ing.
. For the past two days and for
the next five days Stanford rolls
out the red carpet for' the Class
of 1971. It's a time for orienta
tion, but the problem is the
freshmen are being oriented for
something that really doesn't
exist.
For example, no one will deny
that going to a faculty mem
ber's home for .dinner is a great
deal. And no one will deny that
Stanford has an environment in
which many professors and ad
ministrators feel comfortable
with, students and enjoy their
company. • •
But Stanford isn't the type of
place where such occasions fall
into your lap as they did yester
day. It's going to take a little
effort on each freshman's part
to meet other adults and get in
vited to dinners-.
Maybe the idea is that if you
expose freshmen td this type of
experience, they will want to do
it again and will exert some
energy to achieve that goal.
That's fine, if you indicate to
the freshmen that future con
tacts will develop from their
own intiativo rather thanu from
the energy of Pre-regers.
Instead, Pre-x-eg a tone
that leads many students down
the road to that peculiar malise.
"freshman withdrawal." Every
thing is presented TO the fresh
men. They do not seek, but
rather are sought. So when
Wednesday comes, and all that
special attention vanishes, the
freshmen run back to their
dorms and their fellow fresh
men, t giving themselves a sense
of mass security.
It normally takes several
weeks to" recover, but the germ
can linger for months and even
a year. This year, the addition
of co-ed, mixed-class dorms
should alleviate the problem,
since there won't be a place in
which to withdraw. '
But this will affect, only a mi
nority of the class. The other
wastelands of all-freshman liv
ing will continue* to house their
afflicted.
In essence, the concept of a

Pre-.reg period is good. But the
goal should be more than just
introducing the freshmen to" the
places and faces of Stanford.
Most freshmen are on their
own for the first time and what
they need more thaji anything
else is a time to gain confidence,
both in themselves and in their
judgment.
Pre-reg seems to sense this
need and tries to serve it by ex
posing freshmen to ideas as well
as bodies and buildings. But

Pre-reg falters when it attempts
to instill a sense of confidence
and enjoyment in freshmen.
Everything seems to work
right this first . week. And it
should, because its' planned to
do just that. But next week and
the week after each individual
freshman must make his own
plans and live with them.
It's too late to fix Pr*e-reg in
1967,' but it's not too soon to
plan dropping the kid stuff in
'68. •
