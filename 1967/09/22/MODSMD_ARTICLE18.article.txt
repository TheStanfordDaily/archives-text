## ASSU Committee Cites Housing Reform Needs 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The wide
range of Freshman and upper
class living alternatives available
this year are due in large part
to the initiative of the A.S.S.U.
Housing Commission in a re
port published last winter. Many
of the Commission's recommen
dations became an integral part
of the experimental housing
programs approved late last
Spring by the Board of Trustees.
Following are excerpts from the
Housing Commission's report
relevant to Freshman living. . . .
To examine the concept of a
residence university is first to
inquire into the nature of educa
tion. And to make that inquiry
is to ask not about the univers
ity but about the individual. For
the essence of education does
not consist in reading, in going

to classes, in writing papers, but
rather invisibly and intangibly
in the changing and developing
mind of the individual. Educa
tion is the assimilation of
knowledge and skills into the
mental faculties of a singl? per
son. It is the disciplining of a
mind, the development of a feel
ing for scientific and scholarly
methodology. It is the realiza
tion within the individual of con
ceptual ideas such as order,
freedom and justice. It is the
development of self-confidence,
the discovery of wisdom, the
honing of the personal creative
instinct. It is, in short, the soli
tary growth of consciousness.
External Stimuli
But although education ulti
mately occurs in the mind of the
individual, that mind cannot

grow and change without
stimuli from the external world.
Before the individual can know,
he must first perceive. And be
fore he can gain understanding
and ultimately wisdom, he must
first be exposed to a varietv of
thought and experience and be
challenged to reconcile and syn
thesize that which is before him.
The function of a university be
comes, then, not to educate per
se, but rather to provide as
open, challenging, and stimulat
ing an environment as possible
in which individuals can best
pursue the creative process of
self-education.
By proclaiming itself a uni
versity, Stanford implicitly ac
cepts as its objective to provide
for individual students such an
environment. By proclaiming

itself a residential university,
Stanford asserts that that envir
onment should extend beyond
the classroom into an individ
ual's living situation, "that liv
ing and learning, social and in
tellectual life, should not be sep
arate but together."
(Stanford University Bulletin, p.
47.)
Through its residence system,
the University promises a cli
mate in which the total indivi
dual can learn and grow.
Peer Group
Evidence from
logical studies of student life in
dicates that the dominant influ
ence on an individual's develop
ment during his college years is
exerted by his peer group, with
such influences as books and
professors rating as secondary
factors. It is in the confronta
tion with another person similar
to him in that he is a student
but of a different background
and with different values and be
liefs â€” that the individual be
gins to find himself and begins
to realize the variety of dimen
sions in man. His own ideas and
beliefs are challenged and re
challenged, changed and re
changed, and in the process he
comes to know other people
(and himself) as more than am
algamations of roles. Moreover,
the same confrontation brings
deeper understanding and
broader and more varied per
spectives to the ideas and con
cepts presented through the for
mal curriculum, making the in
tellectual life relevant and at
tractive to the individual.
The optimum situation for en
couraging such confrontation
seems to be a group character
ized by frequent contact, similar
concerns, divergent opinions
and attitudes, and a sense of
community.
Ideal of Community
Commitment to this ideal of
community must be the goal
of a residential university. With
out such a commitment Stan
ford will continue to be an in
stitution of rigid and detri
mental dichotomies between edu
cation and residences, between
a student's intellectual and
social lives.
Recent criticisms of the Uri
versity have focused 011 these
dichotomies in the area of hous
ing. The fraternity system has
been attacked, from both within
and without, as an anachonrism
and a hindrance to Stanford's
development as an intellectual
community. Repeatedly, Wilbur

Hall has been criticized ai im
pairing the intellectual and per
sonal growth of its residents,
perpetuating a high school value
orientation, and impeding the
freshman's assimilation into the
University. Common to both
these residence systems, and in
fact to the whole of Stanford
residences, is the failure to see
the student and his university
in terms of total education.
Rather than comprehending the
student's experiences as an in
tegrated whole, the classroom
and the residence, the student's
social and intellectual interests,
his personality and intellect are
seen as separate, mutually ex
clusive factors.
Interaction
To eliminate this educational
fragmentation, Stanford must
dedicate itself to creating com

munities which fuse these seem
ingly diffuse elements into an
inter-connected whole. We main
tain that the expansion of the
intellect deepens and comple
ments interpersonal relation
ships; that the pursuit of knowl
edge, too often seen narrowly as
a function of the classroom, can
not be divorced from the de
velopment in the student of ma
ture and thoughtful values; and
that in a university residential
community the knowledge and
intellectual insight presented in
the formal academic curriculum
and the experiences and per
sonal interaction of a living
group cannot be separated, but
rather intertwine and stimulate
each other.
It is the intent of the Housing
Commission to direct attention
to University residences as an

agent of this integrative func
tion. In this study we have con
sidered the relationship of Stan
ford residences to the individual
student's total education. We
have evaluated living groups
and the quality of student life
therein not primarily by their
relevance to the demands placed
on students by society or to the
present standards and defini
tions students hold about them
selves, but by their relevance to
a community of learning and
personal development. . . .
We are confident that with
serious and thoughtful re-evalu
ation of the residences and earn
est co-operation of the entire
Stanford community, Stanford
residences can realize the ideal
of community and enhance and
profoundly intensify the mean
ing of a Stanford education.
