# Tresidder 'Happening' To Stress The Unusual
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening the Pre-
Reg Commission will present
"It Happens at Tresidder," a col
lection of casual social activities
with a new accent on the un
usual. Festivities begin at 8 p.m.
Among the thirteen attrac
tions are experimental film
shows, folk dancing, a hootena
ny, light and sound show, a ful
ly-operating mock gambling ca
sino, and a Hofbrau. Highlights
of the evening will be Jon Hen
drix's jazz casual in the large
lounge and Bernie Gunther's
session on sensory awareness.
"Mem What?" Stanford's on
again-off-again coffee house, will
be open downstairs at Tresidder.
In a search to regain or re
tain youth, "The Booth" will
sell animal crackers, balloons
and lollipops. Pre Reg Commis

sion member Kirk Brown is in
vestigating the possibility of
free red licorice, too.
Some of the events will be re
stricted to freshmen and trans
fers, said Sandy Shapiro, Pre-
Reg co-chairman, due to lack of
space.
The"It Happens at Tresidder"
night replaces the usual Satur
day night dance of Pre-Reg
week. Ted Anstedt, chairman for
the evening, says the small-ac
tivity format was substituted to
conform to the theme of the
1967 Pre-Registration, which
stresses small-group experi
ences. "Learning is not a some
time thing and it often tends to
happen at strange times, in
strange places and under strange
circumstances," he says. An
stedt hopes the evening will en
courage "effortless learning."
