# Report Of Freshman Year Committee
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following
are excerpts from the ASSU
Housing 1 Commission report of
last February. The report's sec
tion on freshman housing spur
red developments leading to the
present experimental dormi
tories.)
The committee firmly believes
that:
1. An education is, or should be,
a continuum, the freshman
year cannot be considered in
isolation from the entire un
dergraduate program, and al
though it has a special func
tion as the first step, it is an
integral part of the whole.
2. There is a grave imbalance in
the university's educational
emphasis, which tends to
widen the needless, and in our
view harmful, gap between
the getting of knowledge and
the important business of liv
ing.
3. The deepest personal and in
tellectual concerns of students
— their relationships to them
selves, and to an uncertain
world, — are not receiving
the institutional recognition
and effort they deserve.
4. That people learn most deep
ly by living, and by forming
personal relationships, and
that when the residence pro
gram, as at present, is orient
ed to bed, board, and social
needs, the opportunities for
internalizing intellectual
knowledge and values are
meager, and the tendencies to
reject academic values as per

sonally irrelevant are rein
forced.
5. That choice and learning to
choose critically are central
educational goals, but that it
must depend on close and re
peated exposure to a wide
range of ideas, values, styles,
and people — people of dif
ferent ages, disciplines, sexes,
and backgrounds, — and not
be prematurely forced into
constricting channels based
primarily on social and not
intellectual values.
6. Such close exposure to diver
sity, over sufficient time, and
if taken as the norm, would
go far in preventing the for
mation of narrowed and
sterotypic attitudes and
thought — the surest signs
of the ill-educated man.
7. The way in which students
live very directly affects the
whole quality of their educa
tion: this single principle un
derpins the whole concept of
the residential university.
The freshman, more poignant
ly than any other undergraduate,
in his transition from a narrow
er to a hopefully-wider identity,
wants the understanding of his
old world, personal acceptance
by the new — and fears he may
have neither.
He is thus enormously vulner
able, and as Steve Hurlbut has
written in his excellent paper,
is characterized by a "pervasive
anxiety." Until he has assimi
lated workable norms, he feels
he's got to satisfy some kind of

external standard, and is anxious
until he does.
Some more specific stresses
that ten to promote anxiety
are:
1. The sudden change of status
that comes from being taken
out of a high school situation
where one is enormously suc
cessful and being put in a
class of similar big frogs
from small ponds, and feeling
that they are tougher frogs
than he is:
2. The doubt about being able
to live up to tough academic
demands:
3. Doubts about his being ac
cepted by his peers — of both
sexes:
4. Being away from home:
5. Confrontation with different
religious and social values
than those the student has
learned in his family and
home community:
6. Ambivalence about authority,
and older people in general.
This anxiety and vulnerability
are by no means bad in them
selves — and indeed offer the
most fertile soil for cultivation
of the seeking young mind. But
the thrust of this searchng anxi
ety is in essence social, and ap
proval-seeking — and therefore
related to persons and social
groups, or the winning of ac
ceptable symbols of achievement.
The Committee feels that the
pervasive, and expectable fresh
man anxiety and search for some
group identity is a double-edged
sword, with potential for both
regression and for growth.

This anxiety and vulnerability
are by no means bad in them
selves — and indeed offer the
most fertile soil for cultivation
of the seeking young mind. But
the thrust of this searchng anxi
ety is in essence social, and ap
proval-seeking — and therefore
related to persons and social
groups, or the winning of ac
ceptable symbols of achievement.
The Committee feels that the
pervasive, and expectable fresh
man anxiety and search for some
group identity is a double-edged
sword, with potential for both
regression and for growth.
(Editor's note: The following
are excerpts from the ASSU
Housing 1 Commission report of
last February. The report's sec
tion on freshman housing spur
red developments leading to the
present experimental dormi
tories.)
The committee firmly believes
that:
1. An education is, or should be,
a continuum, the freshman
year cannot be considered in
isolation from the entire un
dergraduate program, and al
though it has a special func
tion as the first step, it is an
integral part of the whole.
2. There is a grave imbalance in
the university's educational
emphasis, which tends to
widen the needless, and in our
view harmful, gap between
the getting of knowledge and
the important business of liv
ing.
3. The deepest personal and in
tellectual concerns of students
— their relationships to them
selves, and to an uncertain
world, — are not receiving
the institutional recognition
and effort they deserve.
4. That people learn most deep
ly by living, and by forming
personal relationships, and
that when the residence pro
gram, as at present, is orient
ed to bed, board, and social
needs, the opportunities for
internalizing intellectual
knowledge and values are
meager, and the tendencies to
reject academic values as per

sonally irrelevant are rein
forced.
5. That choice and learning to
choose critically are central
educational goals, but that it
must depend on close and re
peated exposure to a wide
range of ideas, values, styles,
and people — people of dif
ferent ages, disciplines, sexes,
and backgrounds, — and not
be prematurely forced into
constricting channels based
primarily on social and not
intellectual values.
6. Such close exposure to diver
sity, over sufficient time, and
if taken as the norm, would
go far in preventing the for
mation of narrowed and
sterotypic attitudes and
thought — the surest signs
of the ill-educated man.
7. The way in which students
live very directly affects the
whole quality of their educa
tion: this single principle un
derpins the whole concept of
the residential university.
The freshman, more poignant
ly than any other undergraduate,
in his transition from a narrow
er to a hopefully-wider identity,
wants the understanding of his
old world, personal acceptance
by the new — and fears he may
have neither.
He is thus enormously vulner
able, and as Steve Hurlbut has
written in his excellent paper,
is characterized by a "pervasive
anxiety." Until he has assimi
lated workable norms, he feels
he's got to satisfy some kind of

external standard, and is anxious
until he does.
Some more specific stresses
that ten to promote anxiety
are:
1. The sudden change of status
that comes from being taken
out of a high school situation
where one is enormously suc
cessful and being put in a
class of similar big frogs
from small ponds, and feeling
that they are tougher frogs
than he is:
2. The doubt about being able
to live up to tough academic
demands:
3. Doubts about his being ac
cepted by his peers — of both
sexes:
4. Being away from home:
5. Confrontation with different
religious and social values
than those the student has
learned in his family and
home community:
6. Ambivalence about authority,
and older people in general.
This anxiety and vulnerability
are by no means bad in them
selves — and indeed offer the
most fertile soil for cultivation
of the seeking young mind. But
the thrust of this searchng anxi
ety is in essence social, and ap
