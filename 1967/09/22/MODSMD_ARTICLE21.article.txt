# Social Reg Success Is Up To Students
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
"Individual responsibility" is
the key to effective and satisfac
tory enforcement of social regu
lations. This is what the fresh
men hear from the directors of
housing, resident assistants, tu
tors, and sponsors.
Although freshmen are given
packets and parcels of rules
about open house hours and, for
women, sign-out procedures, no
one stands guard over them.
Adherence to the rules depends
on their cooperation. Director
of Wilbur Hall Joseph Higgins
explains, "The emphasis should
not be placed on the word 'en
forcement', but on 'compli
ance.' "
New Open House Hours
University policy on social reg
ulations has recently been up
dated considerably. In previous
years, open house was only
held on Wednesday and Sunday,
but many residences expanded
the hours in open defiance of
University policy. Now the Uni
versity has greatly extended the
open house hours although sign
out and late leave procedures re
main unchanged.
The regulations for freshmen
are as follows:
The new limits on open house
hours for all University resi
dences are noon until 10:30 p.m.
Sunday through Wednesday,
and noon until midnight on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
Each house is to choose its own
hours within these limits.
Freshman women's late leave
regulations say that during the
first quarter they must be in
their residence by midnight ex
cept for 25 late leaves until 1:30
a.m., ten of which may be ex
tended until 2:30. For second
and third quarters the quota is
twenty-five late leaves a quarter.
Freshmen women may also take
overnights on Friday and Satur
day and one midweek overnight
per week. Each overnight counts
as a late leave. Women must
also sign-out when they plan to
be away from the residence af
ter midnight.
Upperclass women have more
liberal social regulations. Sopho
mores have 35 2:30 late leaves
autumn quarter, and unlimited
2:30 late leaves thereafter. Jun
ior and senior women have very
few restrictions.
The Dean of Students office
has requested housing directors
to see that social regulations are
upheld. The increased emphasis
on enforcing open house hours
and other regulations is due in
part to the desire not to endan
ger the new coeducational hous
ing programs. William Leland,
director of Stern Hall, says,"It
would be regrettable if social
regulation offenses stood in the
way of the progress of residen
tial education."
Third Person Problem
One problem freshmen always
face concerns third person re
sponsibility. Third person re
sponsibility involves a student
knowing another person has vio
lated some regulation and being

obligated to ask the person to
turn himself in voluntarily and
to turn the offender in if he re
fuses. Higgins is hopeful that
third person responsibility will
work now that the rules have
been revised. But a sponsor who
is now a junior recalls that even
during her freshman year her
sponsor admitted that few ac
cepted the third person respon
sibility. The situation has not
changed.
The lack of support for third
person responsibility is partly

the reason for the emphasis on
each person accepting the re
sponsibility for himself and his
living group. This attitude to
ward social regulations reflects
the change from "enforcement"
to "cooperation."
Barbara Levin, co-head fresh
man coordinator at Florence
Moore, tells freshmen, "The way
I see the rules, there will be no
need to enforce them. Live with
in them to the best of your abil
ity." A tutor adds, "I hope not
to have to enforce them."
