# Staff, Merger Push Religious Program
## 
### 
Stanford's program of reli
gious activities will be signifi
cantly altered this fall with an

expanded staff, expanded facili
ties, and a new ecumenical ven
ture involving the major Chris
tian groups on campus.
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Chapel, will be aided this fall
by Robert M. Minto, Chaplain,
who returns to Stanford after a
year's sabbatical, and Timothy
Buxton, Assistant to the Dean
of the Chapel, who comes from
Union Theological Seminary In
New York. There will be a rec
ord 24 members of the Stanford
United Ministry this fall quar
ter.
Minto and Buxton and the
other members of the Stanford
United Ministry will have their
offices in the partially remodeled
Clubhouse, adjacent to the Old
Union Student Services Build
ing.
A new ecumenical union of
Christian denominations was
forged this summer by student
leaders in the Catholic, Episco
pal, United Campus Christian
Ministry, and YWCA groups.
The students then enlisted the
support of the chaplains and staff
who work with the groups and
the University Christian Move
ment (UCM) at Stanford was
formed.
The new union will sponsor a
wide range of programs includ
ing social action, study and dis
cussions seminars, worship ser
vices, retreats, and community
dinners and hikes. Its organiza
tion closely parallels the national
University Christian Movement.
The steering committee of the
UCM, composed of members
from each of the participating
groups, will meet this weekend
at the Newman Center for semi
nars and discussions on the place
and potential for Christian action
on the campus.
Dean Napier will preach Sun
day morning at the eleven
o'clock University Service of
Worship. The UCM will host a
reception Monday evening at 7:30
p.m. in the Clubhouse for all new
students. Visits to the Newman
Center of the Lutheran Center
will follow.
