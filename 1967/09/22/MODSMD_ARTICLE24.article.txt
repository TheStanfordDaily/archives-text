# Depth' Sought In Admission Policy

How does Stanford choose its
freshman class?
Dr. Rixford K. Snyder, Di
rector of Admissions, sums up
the fierce competition for ad
mission to Stanford nicely when
he says that "Stanford is about
as difficult as any university in
the country for women's admis
sions and is among the top for
men."
The new freshmen who form
the class of 1971 have been
chosen from among one of the
most highly qualified group of
applicants to any university.
Exactly how those choices are
made may, at times, seem to be
a dark mystery but actually
they ai e the result of a formal
admissions procedure developed
by the faculty Committee on
Admissions over the past decade.
Last year's record 8040 appli
a.nts for the 1290 places in this
yea freshman class indicates
competition for admission
to Stanford is still increasing, as
it has over the past ten years.
Applications for admission have

nearly doubled since 1957 when
only 4766 applied.
The Great Guess
The prime means of rating an
applicant for admission is a pre
diction, made by the Admissions
Office, of what his grade point
average (CPA) would be as a
Stanford freshman. To make
this prediction the office exam
ines an applicant's high school
grades and his Scholastic Apti
tude Test (SAT) scores. High
school grades are considered
more important than SAT scores
and the SAT verbal score is
rated above the SAT math score.
On this basis applicants are
given a rating from A through
E. Each is then judged on what
the Admissions Office terms the
"personal dimension" and is
given another score between 1
and 8.
According to Snyder, the Uni
versity is most interested in a
student with "depth of achieve
ment, one activity done well"
rather than in someone who has
"sought to fill his activity rec
ord with a smattering of differ

ent activities â€”none to any great
depth." The predicted GPA
score and an applicant's "per
sonal dimension" score are com
bined to give an applicant an
overall rating. The best appli
cant is an A-l while an E-8 is
the least likely to gain admis
sion.
Maybe You Weren't A-l
Approximately two-thirds of
an incoming class is selected on
the basis of this admissions for
mula. The remaining third is
selected by vote of a seven-man
admissions staff. At this time
a personal evaluation of a can
didates record and recommenda
tions is made in an effort to
consider individual qualities not
reflected by the formula. Recom
mendations from the music and
athletic departments are also
considered at this time.
Although there are no geo
graphic distribution or state
quotas a consistent 50 per cent
of Stanford undergraduates
come from California. The Uni
versity does actively search for
Negroes and students from the
deep South. "We try to get as
many qualified Negroes as we
can. If they can do satisfactory
work here we don't expect them
to meet the admissions competi
tion," says Snyder.
Although interviews are not
required, many are conducted.
Seven representatives of the ad
missions staff visited schools in
40 states to interview between
2000 and 3000 applicants for the
class of '71. An additional 3500
interviews were held on campus.
Admissions policies and criteria
are now under study by the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) headed by Dr. Herbert
Packer (see p. 11).
Last year Dr. John D. Black,
Director of Counseling and Test
ing Center, issued a report
which provided additional infor
mation about the type of appli
cant who is successful in his
bid for admission. A similar sur
vey is planned for this year's
freshman class. Black, using a
questionaire developed by the
American Council on Education,
found that among other things
Stanford students were more
wealthy than those attending
other private universities. Over
80 percent came from families
with a yearly income over
$10,000. The typical figures for
private universities was 50 per
cent.
One fifth of last year's fresh
men stated no religious prefer
ence, 66 per cent indicated they
were Protestants. Only 14.4 per
cent indicated a Roman Catholic
preference and 6.8 percent were
Jewish. The Catholic and Jewish
figures also fell below those in
other private schools where the
figures stood at 31.6 percent for
Catholics and 17.7 percent for
Jews.
You Are 27.6 Percent Preppy
Over 70 percent of the class of

1970 came from public schools
while 27.6 percent attended pri
vate high schools. They had
done well in high school, 95 per
cent having "B" averages or
better and 39.4 percent having
"A" or "A-plus" averages. Sixty
percent had participated in one
or more school activity, 50 per
cent had earned a varsity sports

letter and nearly onein-five had
edited the school newspaper,
yearbook or literary magazine.
When asked to rate their per
sonal traits, freshmen said they
were high in academic ability,
athletic ability, drive to achieve,
leadership, mathematical ability,
originality, popularity and mod
esty.
