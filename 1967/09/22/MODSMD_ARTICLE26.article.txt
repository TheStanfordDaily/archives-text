# Studio Remodeling Delays Radio KZSU
## 
### HERBERT TERRY 
Buried in the catacombs be
neath Memorial Auditorium is
the newly remodeled studio of
Stanford's student-operated ra
dio station KZSU. The station,
according to Program Director
Tim Logan, hopes to offer
"something of great interest +r<
everyone at the University"
when it begins another year of
broadcasting during the firvt
week of October.
When all the problems with
the remodeled studios are
solved, KZSU will broadcast to
Stanford dormitories at 880 on
the AM dial and to the surround
ing community at 90.1 FM.
Drawing upon the diverse pro
gram possibilities of the Uni
versity, the station plans to pre
sent two lecture series this quar
ter as well as the campus
speeches, concerts, football
games, folk music, jazz, news
and church services it has car
ried in the past. Separate pro
gramming is planned for the
AM and FM channels.
Operated by 170
Keeping KZSU on the air is
not an easy job. The station is
operated by 170 students, most
of whom joined the staff as nov
ices. Yearly operating costs ap
proach $5,000. Although the sta
tion is owned by the trustees of
the University, responsibility for
running it belongs entirely to
its student staff. No outside help,
other than the printing of pro
gram guides, is used and all ex
penses are met by advertising
revenue.
Small Beginning
KZSU began shortly after
World War II as a small, stu
dent-oriented station and re
mained as such for a number
of years. With the addition of
FM broadcasting in 1964, how
ever, the potential audience

jumped to an estimated 200,000
people and the station changed
its programming to reflect its
role, as a University voice to
the surrounding community.
This year's remodeling was
paid for from the proceeds of a
KZSU-sponsored concert by the
Philadelphia Symphony Orches
tra held last year. Staff mem
bers provided the labor for the
remodeling while new turnta
bles, control boards, paint and
building materials were pur
chased from the Philadelphia
Orchestra concert profits.
This year's $t.aff a ,is headed by
Station Manager Michael Heath
man, who recently returned
from Stanford-in-Austria. Second
in command will be Chief Engi
neer Bill Lundell. Program Di
rector Logan and Business Man
ager Carol Ryerson are the sta
tion's other elected officers.

jumped to an estimated 200,000

its programming to reflect its
role, as a University voice to
the surrounding community.
This year's remodeling was
paid for from the proceeds of a
KZSU-sponsored concert by the

remodeling while new turnta

Buried in the catacombs be
neath Memorial Auditorium is
the newly remodeled studio of
Stanford's student-operated ra
dio station KZSU. The station,
according to Program Director
Tim Logan, hopes to offer
"something of great interest +r<
everyone at the University"
when it begins another year of
broadcasting during the firvt
week of October.
When all the problems with
the remodeled studios are
solved, KZSU will broadcast to
Stanford dormitories at 880 on
the AM dial and to the surround
ing community at 90.1 FM.
Drawing upon the diverse pro
gram possibilities of the Uni
versity, the station plans to pre
sent two lecture series this quar
ter as well as the campus
speeches, concerts, football
games, folk music, jazz, news
and church services it has car
ried in the past. Separate pro
gramming is planned for the
AM and FM channels.
Operated by 170
Keeping KZSU on the air is
not an easy job. The station is
operated by 170 students, most
of whom joined the staff as nov
ices. Yearly operating costs ap
proach $5,000. Although the sta
tion is owned by the trustees of
the University, responsibility for
running it belongs entirely to
its student staff. No outside help,
other than the printing of pro
gram guides, is used and all ex
penses are met by advertising
revenue.
Small Beginning
KZSU began shortly after
World War II as a small, stu
dent-oriented station and re
mained as such for a number
of years. With the addition of
FM broadcasting in 1964, how
ever, the potential audience

jumped to an estimated 200,000
people and the station changed
its programming to reflect its
role, as a University voice to
the surrounding community.
