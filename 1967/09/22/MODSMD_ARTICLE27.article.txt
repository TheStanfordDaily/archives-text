# Police Dept. Lists Bike Safety Regs
## 
### 
Bicyclists who go zipping
down University Avenue dressed
in dark outfits after dark are
"increasing their chances of be
coming a statistic," the Stan
ford Police Dept. warns.
All bicycles should have a
white light on the front and a
reflector and red light on the
rear, and riders should wear
light colored clothing for night
riding, cautions the department.
Bicycle paths should be used
when available.
In addition, riders running
stop signs, weaving through
traffic, or riding inside the ar
cades of Quad may find them
selves heading another list of
statisticsâ€”as the latest contrib
utors to the University's most
unpopular fund-raising program,
traffic tickets.
