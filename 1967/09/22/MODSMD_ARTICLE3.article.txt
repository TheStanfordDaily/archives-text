# It's Coed (And Legal) For This Year's Frosh

Men in Branner?
Women in Wilbur?
With University approval!
Residential alternatives ex
pand this year for freshman
(and the entire campus) wiih
wide-scale adoption of coedu
cation, residence seminars, and
integration of Freshmen with
the other classes.
All-male Wilbur and Stern
Halls are no more. And Bran
ner, once for freshmen women,
is now coeducational.
Freshmen women, eight-two
in number, moved into previous
ly all upperclass Florence Moore
Housing. This alternative makes
integrated women's residences
possible for the first time.
Branner First Choice
Branner was the most popular
choice of both men and women
in the summer draw, and the
academic â€¢ oriented Creativity,
Community Service, Grove, and
International Houses had two
to three times as many appli

cants as places available, re
vealed Michael Roster of the
Dean of Students office, who
assisted with residence assign
ments.
"People keep asking 'Are you
sure?' when I tell them I'm liv
ing in Branner," commented one
freshman fellow. "Others just
wince."
Programs and activities of the
various residences range from
three hours of community ser
vice each week in the Commu
nity Action house in Stern to
the non-directed seminars in
Wilbur.
Wilbur head sponsor Steve
Tipton explained that activities,
as such, will be left up to the
imagination and initiative of
freshman and individual spon
sors.
He did, however, say that op
portunities will be made avail
able for "people to do real things
with one another, rather than
just getting along."
Further Plans
Plans include a modified
guest-in-residence program, an
Extensive associate program,
tutors, and classes held in the
individual houses.
Tipton said the guest-in-resi
dence program this year would
include "less big name people,"
and more Bay Area musicians,
scholars, and artists, who will
"live in the houses and be avail
able for informal discussions at
any time, rather than give for
mal talks during most of their
stays."
Tipton explained that in this
way each freshman involved
could develop a "much more
personal" relationship as the
number of freshmen per guest
would be less.

Pam Lawrence, Roble head
sponsor, stressed the individ
uality of programs available to
freshmen. She explained that
the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter was interested in initiating
a seminar in "personal develop
ment" with a Roble corridor
and Madera house.
She also described the possi
bilities of a recreation room in
the basement for student dra
ma and the possibility of a Wil
bur-Roble seminar on magic.
Cooperation Sought
Tipton also said that the aca
demic-themed houses and other
housing were "certainly not mu
tually exclusive," and hoped that
residences could "cooperate and
gain much from one another."
Freshman will eat some meals
in the other houses, and have a
chance for informal discussion,
he said. "It is less an institu
tional change than it is a change
of atmosphere," he concluded.
The new housing situation in
cluding the coeducational, aca
demic-themed, and integrated
residence became a reality last
May when the Board of Trus
tees approved the present resi
dence pattern. Proposals had
first come from an ASSU Hous
ing Committee for "A Wilbur
Experiment," which called for
"drastically overhauling the
University residence pattern."
Some Stern houses will take
on a major change in composi
tion by class with more fresh
man assigned there than ever
before. Freshman compose 707r
of Lassen House and 33 per cent
in Muir and Burbank. These
changes do not affect Grove
and Community Service houses
located there.
