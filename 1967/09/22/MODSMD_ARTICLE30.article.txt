# Intensive Overhaul Set ForStanford Education
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
By now most freshmen are
questioning the efficiency of
Stanford. Their basis for skep
ticism is simple. Stanford is run
ning five different programs of
re-evaluation: The Study, The
Study of Education at Stanford,
SES, the Packer Committee and
the Steering Committee.
To prevent further confusion,
the facts are these: There is
only one re-evaluation
called The Study of Education
at Stanford, hence The Study
and SES. It is headed by Vice
Provost Herbert L. Packer,
hence Packer Committee, and
is directed by a small group of
faculty and students known as
the Steering Committee, of
which Packer is chairman.
The Study has been at work
for eight months, but its origins
can be traced back several years.
In 1965 President Sterling sug
gested Stanford could stand a
careful re-examination of all its
educational processes.
Ten years earlier, the uni
versity had run a study of un
dergraduate education which re
sulted, among other things, in
the adoption of the present
General Studies program.
Planning Committee
Last fall, the President estab
lished a faculty-student group
called the Planning Committee
for the Study of Stanford's Edu
cational Program. This group
concluded its work in early
December by suggesting that a
broad, two-year study be con
ducted.
While this group was meet
ing, student demands for educa
tional reform began to grow,
led by David Harris, student
body president, who was also a
member of this Planning Com
mittee.
Last January Herbert Packer,
who had recently been ap
pointed Vice Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
was named by President Ster
ling to be Chairman of the
Steering Committee.
Steering Committee
In the following weeks, the
other members of the commit
tee were selected, a total of six
faculty and three students. Mem
bers of the committee are:
Herbert L. Packer (Vice Pro
vost and Professor of Law)

Norton T. Batkin (Junior,
Philosophy)
James E. Gibbons (Associate
Professor of Electrical Engi
neering)
Joshua Lederberg (Executive
Head and Professor of Genetics)
Mark Mancall (Assistant Pro
fessor of History)
Michael M. Menke (Graduate
Student, Physics)
Anne G. Osborn (Graduate
Student, Medicine)
Leonard I. Schiff (Professor
oi Physics)
The method for selecting stu
dent members generate a con
troversy that left the Study
with a good deal of student
enmity as it began its work.
Some students felt that student
members should have been sel
ected by the student body rather
than by Packer himself.
Through open meetings and
time, however, much of the ini
tial resentment faded, and the
Study now operates with coop
eration from the students.
First Agenda
Soon after its inception, the
Study published a preliminary
agenda which it has since modi
fied slightly. The agenda in
cludes over 250 questions about
the University. These are broken
down into fifteen broad topics.
1. Nature and Basic Char
acteristics of the University.
2. Academic Programs
A. Undergraduate Educa
tion
B. Graduate Education
C. Instructional Programs
and Practices
D. Academic Calendar
3. International Education
4. Admissions and Financial
Aids
5. Advising and Counseling
6. Residence Programs and
Policies
7. The Extra-curriculum
8. Sex Differentials in Educa
tion
9. Campus Environment
10. Libraries
11. Research
12. Teaching
13. Government of the Univers
ity
14. Institutionalizing Educa
tional Review and Innovation
15. Academic Priorities
For study of these areas,
Topic Committees are being
established. To date there are
five such groups, which include
students, faculty and adminis
trators.

They are: Admissions and Fi
nancial Aids, (W ill ia m A.
Clebsch, Professor of Religion
and Humanities, Chairman);
Residences, (Lewis W. Spitz,
Professor of History, Chair
man); International Education,
(the chairman is Ivo J. Led
erer, Associate Professor of His
tory); Government of the Uni
versity, (Herbert Packer is
Chairman) ; and Advising and
Counseling, (Edwin M. Good,
Associate Professor of Religion
and Hebrew, Chairman).
Summer Work
This summer, a staff, most
of whom are recent or enrolled
students, worked on position
papers, digesting material and
researching topics. Committees
will thus be able to move ahead
this fall beginning with the
many facts and ideas the staff
has supplied.
After the initial controversy
over selection, the Study has
offered several channels for stu
dent input. Aside from having
students on the committees and
staff, the Study has held hear
ings and open meetings where
students were encouraged to
question and criticize.
This coming year there will be
a series of regular University
seminars on topics related to
the study which will be open
for all students. These are be
ing organized jointly by ASSU
and SES.
A list of seminars will be
printed in Monday's Daily. One
seminar in particular should in
terest freshmen. Its topic is
the Freshman Year and after
several meetings of its sopho
more members, it will be avail
able for freshmen.
The Study will conclude in
late 1968, making recommenda
tions to the faculty and admini
stration. Its office is in the un
dergraduate library in ground
floor seminar rooms 142 and
143. Since ideas are its main
product and freshmen are sup
posed to have fresh ideas, they
are encouraged to stop by the
office, even if just to chat.
Stanford Quad Praised
For the third year in a row,
Stanford's student yearbook has
been rated "excellent" by the Na
tional School Yearbook Associa
tion.
Called The Stanford Quad, the
1967 yearbook was edited by Pa
tricia Newport.
