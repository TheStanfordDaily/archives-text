# ARMY ROTC "QUARTERBACKS" SCORE TWICE
## 
### 
It Lakes special qualities and,
training to make a good quarter
back. He must be able to think
fast under pressure, call plays to
keep his opponents off-balance,
mpve the ball, and do his share of
the blocking and tackling.
Coaches give a lot of thought to
thfcir quarterbacks. They usually
have at .least two ready to go, and
a cumber of others under develop
ment for the years ahead. They
know that their teams cannot win
without quarterbacks who are
capable and cool, trained and
tough.
'The United States Army is in
much the same position. It needs
approximately 20,000 new
"quarterbacks" each year for the
Active Army and its Reserve
Components—men who can be
trained to call plays on a team
tKat cannot settle for anything
leSs than the conference title
season after seasoVi.
'Approximately 75', of these
new "quarterbacks" — Second
lieutenants entering 'the United
States Army—are provided each
year by -the Arnjv ROTC pro
gram. The remainder are provided
by the United States Military
/Vcademy at West Point, Officer
Candidate Schools and by direct
appointment. Most Army ROTC
graduates are commissioned as
Reserve Officers.and serve for
two years on active duty, but
more than one thousand of them
e?irn Regular Armv commissions
each year.
« After operating for forty-eight

years under virtually the same
"rule book," the ROTC program
received some new "rules" with
the passing of the ROTC Vital
ization Act of 1964. This legisla
tion has produced several
important changes. Two of Uiem
are of special interest to college
and high school men —and to
their parents.
The first of these is a new
financial assistance program un
der which outstanding students
may compete'for ROTC scholar
ships. These scholarships pay for
the student's tuition, books and
Fab fees, and provide $50.00 a
mont«h for the duration of the
award. Two thousand of these
scholarships have already been
awarded, one thousand starting
with school year 1965-66 and one
thousand with school year 19(36-
67. Of the two thousand, eight
hundred were four-year scholar
ships and twelve hundred were
for two years The Vitali/.ation
Act authorizes additional scholar
ships to be awarded until approx
imately 5.500 are in eflVct by
school year 1970-71.
• The second significant change
is a program which enables stu
dents who have already had two
years of college to earn an officer's
commission in just two years. The
program is designed specifically
for junior college graduates and
for sophomores at four-year col
leges who did not take ROTC
during their first two years.

By completing either the tradi

whp has* ambition "scores" twice
— he earns a college degree in a
field of his choice "and a position'
of leadership as an officer in the

so he makes the Use of his
opportunities while in college and
receives training which will con
tribute to success in either a
civilian or military career.
Civilian firms employing large
numbers of college graduates rec
ognize the value of ROTC train

graduate who has" had military
training and active duty experi
ence as an officer usually advances
faster and farther. They prefer to
hire such men, and frequently are
willing Ur pay a premium'to get
them.
