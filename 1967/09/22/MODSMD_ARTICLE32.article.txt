The name game—or how to
communicate at Stanford with
out really trying.
"In order to integrate fresh
men into the mainstream of
Stanford life," someone • once
said, The Daily offers this%glos
sary of The Farm vernacular —
a brief summary of- campus
terms and, institutions:

Bitchin' R.F.—The colloquial
term for a Real Funny practical
joke. The origin t>f the latter
half of the, term my be found
in the June, 1957, issue of Play/

Captain Midnight — A certain
cop in the Stanford Police De
partment, or more commonly,
any Stanford fuzz.
Chaparral — See "Hoo Tow."
Flicks — The Sunday evening
movies in Memorial Auditorium.
Fun Stan — The Fundamental
Standard of Student Conduct,
formulated by Stanford's lirst
President, David Starr Jordan,
which states that a student may
be removed from the University
if he does not ".sh'ow both within
and without the University such
respect for order, morality, per#
sonal honor, and the lights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens."
This forms a bone of contention
between students and the ad
ministration, as many students
do not believe that the adminis
tration has the right to impose
its moral standards upon the
younger .generation: Numerous
students have been suspended
in the past for their private sex
ual behavior and drinking prac
tices.

ial to Herbert Hoover '92,
-twenty-three years before he
died, Hoover Tower is now well
fenced in with "dropper stop

tower in six months in 1965. The
•Chaparral, Stanford's humor
magazine, is able to remain sol
vent by playing up Hoo Tow as
a campus phallic symbol. ,
Joi'k — In' the colloquial, as
contrasted to the literal, "Jock"
refers to any individual who
participates heavily in athletic
activities. The term can also re
fer to an individual who is deep
