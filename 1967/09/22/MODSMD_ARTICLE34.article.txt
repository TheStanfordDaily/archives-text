# Napier Speech Urges Control Over Change
## 
### PENNY HILL 
Beginning, with Winnie the
Pooh and the Beatles' "She's
Leaving Home," and exiting
with a standing ovation, B.
Davie Napier, Dean of the Chap
el, greeted students in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday.
He repeatedly emphasized
that "it is a long way from
June to September." Napier
stressed that the world, its peo
ple and their lives are changing
and that there is no way of re
claiming wasted time.
An example of this change,
Napier said, was exhibited in
Expo 67, which acclaimed the
glory of human achievement,
and at the same time acknowl
edged tho seriousness of the
human predicament. Napier re
marked that his senses and emo
tions were bombarded by man,
the conquerer of his environ
ment, and man, the victim of
his human environment.
The refusal of man to indulge
in illusion was best exhibited in
the Czech pavillion, which de
picted the contrast between the
Universal Child's fantasies and
his realities, showing the dreams
devastated and shattered by loss
of innocence.
Youth's voice pro testing the
contradicitions of humanity,
Napier said, "has been heard ...
as it will continue to be heard
at Stanford." He encouraged this
and youth's philosophy that
"we may not find the answers,
but we mean to go on looking."
"Don't let anyone, young or
old," he challenged, "impose his
own jaundice, his own sophisti
cation, his own prejudice, his
own discouragement, his own
cynicism on you."
Napier presented what he
terms an "estrangment effect"—
any device that makes it pos
sible to break through stereo
types. "We are up against a ...
culture mass." He said it is im
portant to "know your culture
and work the estrangment ef
fect any way you can."
This "mass," he pointed out,
is a cloud of precipitation "that
washed Romney's brain and, in

varying degrees of thorough
ness, washed your own."
Man, according to Napier, is
being brought to accept a dis
torted, fractured, and perverted
man and is being made to believe
that this image of man is na
tural.
Man's problem, Napier said, is
the problem of humanity. Man is
confronted with the simple, aw

ful problem of being a person.
"Man's struggle to be man," he
remarked, "is one struggle."
"Thank God that the dissident
voices are heard in our land,"
he said. "You've got to join the
chorus of negation when nega
tion is called for."
"Time is lost, history is lost,
and we are lost," Napier stated,
but he expressed confidence that
young people are becoming more
aware that they, and especially
Stanford students, will not wait,
but will work towards effecting
change.

Napier said, was exhibited in
Expo 67, which acclaimed the
glory of human achievement,
and at the same time acknowl
edged tho seriousness of the
human predicament. Napier re
marked that his senses and emo
tions were bombarded by man,
the conquerer of his environ
ment, and man, the victim of
his human environment.
The refusal of man to indulge
in illusion was best exhibited in
the Czech pavillion, which de
picted the contrast between the
Universal Child's fantasies and
his realities, showing the dreams
devastated and shattered by loss
of innocence.
Youth's voice pro testing the
contradicitions of humanity,
Napier said, "has been heard ...
as it will continue to be heard
at Stanford." He encouraged this
and youth's philosophy that
"we may not find the answers,
but we mean to go on looking."
"Don't let anyone, young or
old," he challenged, "impose his
own jaundice, his own sophisti
cation, his own prejudice, his
own discouragement, his own
cynicism on you."
Napier presented what he
terms an "estrangment effect"—
any device that makes it pos
sible to break through stereo
types. "We are up against a ...
culture mass." He said it is im
portant to "know your culture
and work the estrangment ef
fect any way you can."
This "mass," he pointed out,
is a cloud of precipitation "that
washed Romney's brain and, in

varying degrees of thorough
ness, washed your own."
Man, according to Napier, is
being brought to accept a dis
torted, fractured, and perverted
man and is being made to believe
that this image of man is na
tural.
Man's problem, Napier said, is
the problem of humanity. Man is
confronted with the simple, aw

ful problem of being a person.
"Man's struggle to be man," he
remarked, "is one struggle."
"Thank God that the dissident
voices are heard in our land,"
he said. "You've got to join the
chorus of negation when nega
tion is called for."
"Time is lost, history is lost,
and we are lost," Napier stated,
but he expressed confidence that
young people are becoming more
aware that they, and especially
Stanford students, will not wait,
but will work towards effecting
change.
Beginning, with Winnie the
Pooh and the Beatles' "She's
Leaving Home," and exiting
with a standing ovation, B.
Davie Napier, Dean of the Chap
el, greeted students in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday.
He repeatedly emphasized
that "it is a long way from
June to September." Napier
stressed that the world, its peo
ple and their lives are changing
and that there is no way of re
claiming wasted time.
An example of this change,
Napier said, was exhibited in
Expo 67, which acclaimed the
glory of human achievement,
