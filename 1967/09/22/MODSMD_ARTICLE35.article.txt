# Pride, Spirit, Theft All Part Of The Axe

### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The Axe.
The very words stir the hearts
of Stanford men and women
everywhere, and have since the
Stanford Axe first appeared at
a baseball game in 1899.
Now—Alas! —the Axe is gone,
stolen from its burglar-proof
display case in Tresidder Union
and hidden somewhere in the
nether regions of Berkeley. Or
so rumor has it.
At Berkeley
A few days after it was stolen
last spring, the thieves took a
picture of it with the Berkeley
campenile in the background
and sent the picture to the var
ious news media.
Since then no clue to the
Axe's whereabouts has been
found. It is presumed to be still
alive.
The Axe came into the world
April 15, 1899, at a baseball
game with Cal. The head yell
leader, Billy Erb, decided some
thing was needed to lift sagging
spirits, since Stanford had lost
to Cal in football and basketball
already that year.
Bonfire
A giant bonfire and rally were
set for two days before the
game so the team and specta

tors could get in the right frame
of mind for beating Cal.
During the rally Erb brought
out the 15-inch blade, painted
red with a white S in the mid
dle, and sharpened it. Then amid
screams of "Give 'em the Axe,"
he chased an effigy of a bear,
caught it, chopped off its head
and threw it in the bonfire.
Thus are traditions born. The
yell leaders brought the Axe
to the game two days later in
San Francisco and paraded it
around the field. Stanford lost
9-7.
Axe Lost
Stanford also lost the Axe.
A Cal football player named
Paul Castlehun grabbed it soon
after the game and ran off
down the streets of San Fran
cisco, surrounded by a Cal mob.
Stanford's Frank Strout man
aged to grab it back momentar
ily but it was snatched from his
hands by Cal's "wonder quarter
back," Jim Hopper.
For the next 31 years the
precious Axe was the de facto
property of Cal. An attempt to
steal it back in 1929 failed be
cause the L.A. Police refused
to supply tear gas to the Stan
ford conspirators.
Immortal 21
And then the fateful year 1930

came and with it . . . the Im
mortal 21!
The Immortal 21, as they
came to be called, were 21 Stan-
Stanford students — dedicated,
clear-eyed, ingenious, daring —
who decided, on April Fool's
Day of 1930, to retrieve the
sacred Axe.
The plan was pure genius in
its simplicity.
The Plan
Every year for the past 30,
the Axe had appeared at Cal's
pre - Stanford • game rallies,
guarded by Cal men. This year,
the Axe appeared again on
April 3.
That afternoon the Immortal
21 drove up to Cal in three cars.
One went to the bank where the
Axe was to be taken after the
rally. Another went to the
Greek Theater, where Cal's ral
ly was being held. The third
went to join the parade from
the theater to the bank.
Tear Gas
The first group, armed with
tear gas grenades, posed as
photographers at the bank.
When the armored truck carry
ing the Axe arrived at the bank
and the custodian stepped off it,
Howard Avery jumped him
from the top of the truck and
grabbed the Axe.
In the confusion that fol
lowed, the handle was removed
from the Axe and Robert Loof
bourow tucked it in his sweater
and calmly strolled away. At
that moment, Art Miller set off
his tear gas bomb.
The angry mob pushed into
the bank to escape the tear gas.
It grabbed Avery, thinking he
had the Axe, but Matt Lehman
and Eric Hill managed to get
him away.
Parade
In the meantime, Loofbourow
and James Trimingham sped
back to the Stanford campus.
When they arrived, a jubilant
crowd held an impromptu par
ade through the campus ending
with a rally at Roble.
The next day classes were
called off and a huge rally was
held in front of the Main Li
brary. The Axe was escorted to
safe-keeping in the vault of the
American Trust Co. in Palo
Alto.
For their heroic deed the Im
mortal 21 were awarded varsity
letters.
But Cal beat Stanford anyway
that year, 7-6. Cal's pitcher was
the very man from whose slip
pery hands the Axe had been
snatched two days before.
Perhaps the game was fate's
consolation prize.
In any case, the Immortal 21
turned the Axe over to the
Board of Athletic Control, which
became its permanent guardian.
Big Game Prize
It was then proposed that the
Axe become a Big Game prize,
passing from year to year into
the hands of the Stanford-Cal
football game winner.
Campus reaction was swift
and immediate. "The Axe is not
and never was a trophy to be
passed from hand to hand,"
fumed The Daily in its April 7,
1930, editorial.
"If men and women here on
the Farm are inclined to treat
this matter seriously, they
should propose that Cal put up
their Golden Bear along with
the Cardinal Axe as the Big
Game trophy."
Such unanswerable logic was
to no avail. The Axe became a
trophy. Last year Stanford set a
record by winning its sixth Big
Game in a row and thus its
right to keep the Axe.
But this year there is a void
in the hearts of Stanford, as
empty as the not-quite-burglar
proof glass case in Tresidder
Union.
The Axe.

clear-eyed, ingenious, daring —
who decided, on April Fool's
Day of 1930, to retrieve the
sacred Axe.
The plan was pure genius in
its simplicity.
The Plan
Every year for the past 30,
the Axe had appeared at Cal's
pre - Stanford • game rallies,
guarded by Cal men. This year,
the Axe appeared again on
April 3.
That afternoon the Immortal
21 drove up to Cal in three cars.
One went to the bank where the
Axe was to be taken after the
rally. Another went to the
Greek Theater, where Cal's ral
ly was being held. The third
went to join the parade from
the theater to the bank.
Tear Gas
The first group, armed with
tear gas grenades, posed as
photographers at the bank.
When the armored truck carry
ing the Axe arrived at the bank
and the custodian stepped off it,
Howard Avery jumped him
from the top of the truck and
grabbed the Axe.
In the confusion that fol
lowed, the handle was removed
from the Axe and Robert Loof
bourow tucked it in his sweater
and calmly strolled away. At
that moment, Art Miller set off
his tear gas bomb.
The angry mob pushed into
the bank to escape the tear gas.
It grabbed Avery, thinking he
had the Axe, but Matt Lehman
and Eric Hill managed to get
him away.
Parade
In the meantime, Loofbourow
and James Trimingham sped
back to the Stanford campus.
When they arrived, a jubilant
crowd held an impromptu par
ade through the campus ending
with a rally at Roble.
The next day classes were
called off and a huge rally was
held in front of the Main Li
brary. The Axe was escorted to
safe-keeping in the vault of the
American Trust Co. in Palo
Alto.
For their heroic deed the Im
mortal 21 were awarded varsity
letters.
But Cal beat Stanford anyway
that year, 7-6. Cal's pitcher was
the very man from whose slip
pery hands the Axe had been
snatched two days before.
Perhaps the game was fate's
consolation prize.
In any case, the Immortal 21
turned the Axe over to the
Board of Athletic Control, which
became its permanent guardian.
Big Game Prize
It was then proposed that the
Axe become a Big Game prize,
passing from year to year into
the hands of the Stanford-Cal
football game winner.
Campus reaction was swift
and immediate. "The Axe is not
and never was a trophy to be
passed from hand to hand,"
fumed The Daily in its April 7,
1930, editorial.
"If men and women here on
the Farm are inclined to treat
this matter seriously, they
should propose that Cal put up
their Golden Bear along with
the Cardinal Axe as the Big
Game trophy."
Such unanswerable logic was
to no avail. The Axe became a
trophy. Last year Stanford set a
record by winning its sixth Big
Game in a row and thus its
right to keep the Axe.
But this year there is a void
in the hearts of Stanford, as
empty as the not-quite-burglar
proof glass case in Tresidder
Union.
The Axe.
The very words stir the hearts
of Stanford men and women
everywhere, and have since the
Stanford Axe first appeared at
a baseball game in 1899.
Now—Alas! —the Axe is gone,
stolen from its burglar-proof
display case in Tresidder Union
and hidden somewhere in the
nether regions of Berkeley. Or
so rumor has it.
At Berkeley
A few days after it was stolen
last spring, the thieves took a
picture of it with the Berkeley
campenile in the background
and sent the picture to the var
ious news media.
Since then no clue to the
Axe's whereabouts has been
found. It is presumed to be still
alive.
The Axe came into the world
April 15, 1899, at a baseball
game with Cal. The head yell
leader, Billy Erb, decided some
thing was needed to lift sagging
spirits, since Stanford had lost
to Cal in football and basketball
already that year.
Bonfire
A giant bonfire and rally were
set for two days before the
game so the team and specta

tors could get in the right frame
of mind for beating Cal.
During the rally Erb brought
out the 15-inch blade, painted
red with a white S in the mid
dle, and sharpened it. Then amid
screams of "Give 'em the Axe,"
he chased an effigy of a bear,
caught it, chopped off its head
and threw it in the bonfire.
Thus are traditions born. The
yell leaders brought the Axe
to the game two days later in
San Francisco and paraded it
around the field. Stanford lost
9-7.
Axe Lost
Stanford also lost the Axe.
A Cal football player named
Paul Castlehun grabbed it soon
after the game and ran off
down the streets of San Fran
cisco, surrounded by a Cal mob.
Stanford's Frank Strout man
aged to grab it back momentar
ily but it was snatched from his
hands by Cal's "wonder quarter
back," Jim Hopper.
For the next 31 years the
precious Axe was the de facto
property of Cal. An attempt to
steal it back in 1929 failed be
cause the L.A. Police refused
to supply tear gas to the Stan
ford conspirators.

passed from hand to hand,"
fumed The Daily in its April 7,
1930, editorial.
"If men and women here on
the Farm are inclined to treat
this matter seriously, they
should propose that Cal put up
their Golden Bear along with
the Cardinal Axe as the Big
Game trophy."
Such unanswerable logic was
to no avail. The Axe became a
trophy. Last year Stanford set a
record by winning its sixth Big
Game in a row and thus its
right to keep the Axe.
But this year there is a void
in the hearts of Stanford, as
empty as the not-quite-burglar
proof glass case in Tresidder
Union.
The Axe.
The very words stir the hearts
of Stanford men and women
everywhere, and have since the
Stanford Axe first appeared at
a baseball game in 1899.
Now—Alas! —the Axe is gone,
stolen from its burglar-proof
display case in Tresidder Union
and hidden somewhere in the
nether regions of Berkeley. Or
so rumor has it.
At Berkeley
A few days after it was stolen
last spring, the thieves took a
picture of it with the Berkeley
campenile in the background
and sent the picture to the var
ious news media.
Since then no clue to the
Axe's whereabouts has been
found. It is presumed to be still
alive.
The Axe came into the world
April 15, 1899, at a baseball
game with Cal. The head yell
leader, Billy Erb, decided some
thing was needed to lift sagging
spirits, since Stanford had lost
to Cal in football and basketball
already that year.
Bonfire
A giant bonfire and rally were
set for two days before the
game so the team and specta

tors could get in the right frame
of mind for beating Cal.
During the rally Erb brought
out the 15-inch blade, painted
red with a white S in the mid
dle, and sharpened it. Then amid
screams of "Give 'em the Axe,"
he chased an effigy of a bear,
caught it, chopped off its head
and threw it in the bonfire.
Thus are traditions born. The
yell leaders brought the Axe
to the game two days later in
San Francisco and paraded it
around the field. Stanford lost
9-7.
Axe Lost
Stanford also lost the Axe.
A Cal football player named
Paul Castlehun grabbed it soon
after the game and ran off
down the streets of San Fran
cisco, surrounded by a Cal mob.
Stanford's Frank Strout man
aged to grab it back momentar
ily but it was snatched from his
hands by Cal's "wonder quarter
back," Jim Hopper.
For the next 31 years the
precious Axe was the de facto
property of Cal. An attempt to
steal it back in 1929 failed be
cause the L.A. Police refused
to supply tear gas to the Stan
ford conspirators.
Immortal 21
And then the fateful year 1930

came and with it . . . the Im
mortal 21!
The Immortal 21, as they
came to be called, were 21 Stan-
Stanford students — dedicated,
clear-eyed, ingenious, daring —
who decided, on April Fool's
Day of 1930, to retrieve the
sacred Axe.
The plan was pure genius in
its simplicity.
The Plan
Every year for the past 30,
the Axe had appeared at Cal's
pre - Stanford • game rallies,
guarded by Cal men. This year,
the Axe appeared again on
April 3.
That afternoon the Immortal
21 drove up to Cal in three cars.
One went to the bank where the
Axe was to be taken after the
rally. Another went to the
Greek Theater, where Cal's ral
ly was being held. The third
went to join the parade from
the theater to the bank.
Tear Gas
The first group, armed with
tear gas grenades, posed as
photographers at the bank.
When the armored truck carry
ing the Axe arrived at the bank
and the custodian stepped off it,
Howard Avery jumped him
from the top of the truck and
grabbed the Axe.
In the confusion that fol
lowed, the handle was removed
from the Axe and Robert Loof
bourow tucked it in his sweater
and calmly strolled away. At
that moment, Art Miller set off
his tear gas bomb.
The angry mob pushed into
the bank to escape the tear gas.
It grabbed Avery, thinking he
had the Axe, but Matt Lehman
and Eric Hill managed to get
him away.
Parade
In the meantime, Loofbourow
and James Trimingham sped
back to the Stanford campus.
When they arrived, a jubilant
crowd held an impromptu par
ade through the campus ending
with a rally at Roble.
The next day classes were
called off and a huge rally was
held in front of the Main Li
brary. The Axe was escorted to
safe-keeping in the vault of the
American Trust Co. in Palo
Alto.
For their heroic deed the Im
mortal 21 were awarded varsity
letters.
But Cal beat Stanford anyway
that year, 7-6. Cal's pitcher was
the very man from whose slip
pery hands the Axe had been
snatched two days before.
Perhaps the game was fate's
consolation prize.
In any case, the Immortal 21
turned the Axe over to the
Board of Athletic Control, which
became its permanent guardian.
Big Game Prize
It was then proposed that the
Axe become a Big Game prize,
passing from year to year into
the hands of the Stanford-Cal
football game winner.
Campus reaction was swift
and immediate. "The Axe is not
and never was a trophy to be
passed from hand to hand,"
fumed The Daily in its April 7,
1930, editorial.
