# A 						Day In The Life... ...Of A Freshman
## 
### 
Pre-Reg fun and games don't
last forever, you know.
Starting Wednesday life re
verts to a rhythm of people and
places that will last at least until
the end of the quarter; perhaps
until the end of the year.
Pictured on this page are some
of the places and situations you
will find yourself in again and
again and again . . .
Lest the mere sight of them
make you despondent, we've
brightened them up with the
smiling face of freshman M artha
Sward from Santa Monica, Calif.

Martha studies in the J. Henry Meyer Memorial Library. Also known as UGLY. You can throw
pa{>er airplanes from the fourth floor to the second here.


Martha sits iii the Physics Tank where Physics professors lecture
freshmen on meelianics and electromagnetisni. Why is she so
happy? Maybe it was something: our photographer said.


Did you know that drinking' 431 cups of Tresidder Union coffee
in 17 minutes turns you on just like LSD?


I cDi'rs from home arrive :*t th«> mailboxes outside the Post Office. Martha looks for one. What
will the letters from honv> contain? Love, money, old news and a flickering reflection of a lif«* that
was comfortable and M>eure, hut so limited.


Martha ffaaes awestruck at Memorial Church. She goes there to
listen to Dean Napier.


Martha stands at the Reserved Book desk in UGLY. If you can't afford to spend $60 to buy all
the English and Western Civ books, you will visit here frequently.
