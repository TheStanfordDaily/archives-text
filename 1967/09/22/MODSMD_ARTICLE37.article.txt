# Cards Keep Pool Boiling; Buckingham Tops IM Best
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's NCAA champion
swimmers kept the water boil
ing last summer, as most of the
team competed for the omni
potent Santa Clara Swim Club.
Greg Buckingham cracked the
world record for the 200 meters
individual medley, lowering his
previous record by a second to
2:11.5. Buckingham had only six
weeks of workout before the na
tional AAU championships af
ter a typhoid quarantine period
kept him out of spring training.
In the last year's collegiate
season, Buckingham won three
gold medals and a silver at the
NCAA championships.. The
NCAA record board sports a
red "Buckingham" in four slots.
Buckingham was recently ruled
ineligible to compete in another
swimming season.
Wall Rallies For AAU's
Mike Wall started the sum
mer swimming season in the
hospital with typhoid fever, but
rallied in time to throw in some
superb individual performances
at the national AAU's, among
them a leg on Santa Clara's
world-record-tying 800 freestyle
relay.
Wall took seventh in the 1500
meters freestyle and eighth in
both the 200 and 400. Wall, now
a Stanford senior, hit 1:59.1 for
his share in the relay record.
Don Schollander and Gary ll
man, both members of the Olym

pic team that held the old rec
ord, and Mark Spitz were the
other three.
Momsen's Silver
Bob Momsen, elected Stanford
team captain last spring, gar
nered the silver medal in the
200 breaststroke at the Pan
American Games in Winnipeg.
Momsen beat the defending US
champion, Ken Merten, but lost
the gold medal to Brazil's Jose
Fiolo.
Bill Meyer, who swam the
fastest leg on Stanford's Ameri
can record 400 freestyle relay at
the NCAA's, took seventh in
the 100 freest* ie at the Nation
al AAU's.
Meyer anchored Santa Clara's
B medley relay and swam on
the Santa Clara B 400 and 800
freestyle relays. Meyer's 2:00.8
split for 200 meters is compara
ble to a 1:44 for 200 yards, his
best by a large margin.
Roth Misses Summer
Dick Roth, stricken with the
worst case of typhoid among
the swimmers, did not swim
with Santa Clara Swim Club,
but trained on long distance
swimming in the ocean. Both
Roth and Buckingham relin
quished their berths on the Pan
Am team.
Luis Nicolao, plagued with
strep throat, lost his world rec
ord for 100 meters butterfly to
Santa Clara teammate Mark
Spitz. Spitz also broke world

records in the 200 fly and 400
freestyle.
Stanford freshman John Fer
ris disposed of Spitz's 200 fly
record and USC's Greg Charl
ton nipped his 400 free record
in Tokyo.
Pete Siebert, whose surpris
ing performances at the NCAA's
gave Stanford points that no
body figured were there, came
down with typhoid at the be
ginning of the season and did
not test negative until August.
Siebert trained with Roth in the
ocean.
'68 OUTLOOK
The Stanford swimming team
will obviously suffer from the
loss of Buckingham. The only
other swimmer who does not re
turn from the NCAA champion
ship squad is last year's captain
Jim Laney.
With transfer sprinter Ken
Hammer and improvement on
the rest of the team, however,
coach Jim Gaughran is far from
ready to throw in the towel.
"Without Buck," figures
Gaughran, "nobody will give us
much of a chance to win it
again. And strange things hap
pen when you aren't supposed
to be able to win."
Before worrying about the
NCAA swimming champion
ship, however, Gaughran points
to what could be Stanford's best
water polo team since the 1963
NCAA Champion squad.

'68 OUTLOOK
The Stanford swimming team
will obviously suffer from the
loss of Buckingham. The only
other swimmer who does not re

ship squad is last year's captain
Jim Laney.
With transfer sprinter Ken
Hammer and improvement on
the rest of the team, however,
coach Jim Gaughran is far from

"Without Buck," figures
Gaughran, "nobody will give us
much of a chance to win it
again. And strange things hap

Before worrying about the
NCAA swimming champion
ship, however, Gaughran points
to what could be Stanford's best
water polo team since the 1963
NCAA Champion squad.
Stanford's NCAA champion
swimmers kept the water boil
ing last summer, as most of the
team competed for the omni
potent Santa Clara Swim Club.
Greg Buckingham cracked the
world record for the 200 meters
individual medley, lowering his
previous record by a second to
2:11.5. Buckingham had only six
weeks of workout before the na
tional AAU championships af
ter a typhoid quarantine period
kept him out of spring training.
In the last year's collegiate
season, Buckingham won three
gold medals and a silver at the
NCAA championships.. The
NCAA record board sports a
red "Buckingham" in four slots.
Buckingham was recently ruled
ineligible to compete in another
swimming season.
Wall Rallies For AAU's
Mike Wall started the sum
mer swimming season in the
hospital with typhoid fever, but
rallied in time to throw in some
superb individual performances
at the national AAU's, among
them a leg on Santa Clara's
world-record-tying 800 freestyle
relay.
Wall took seventh in the 1500
meters freestyle and eighth in
both the 200 and 400. Wall, now
a Stanford senior, hit 1:59.1 for
his share in the relay record.
Don Schollander and Gary ll
man, both members of the Olym

pic team that held the old rec
ord, and Mark Spitz were the
other three.
Momsen's Silver
Bob Momsen, elected Stanford
team captain last spring, gar
nered the silver medal in the
200 breaststroke at the Pan
American Games in Winnipeg.
Momsen beat the defending US
champion, Ken Merten, but lost
the gold medal to Brazil's Jose
Fiolo.
Bill Meyer, who swam the
fastest leg on Stanford's Ameri
can record 400 freestyle relay at
the NCAA's, took seventh in
the 100 freest* ie at the Nation
al AAU's.
Meyer anchored Santa Clara's
B medley relay and swam on
the Santa Clara B 400 and 800
freestyle relays. Meyer's 2:00.8
split for 200 meters is compara
ble to a 1:44 for 200 yards, his
best by a large margin.
Roth Misses Summer
Dick Roth, stricken with the
worst case of typhoid among
the swimmers, did not swim
with Santa Clara Swim Club,
but trained on long distance
swimming in the ocean. Both
Roth and Buckingham relin
quished their berths on the Pan
Am team.
Luis Nicolao, plagued with
strep throat, lost his world rec
ord for 100 meters butterfly to
Santa Clara teammate Mark
Spitz. Spitz also broke world

records in the 200 fly and 400
freestyle.
Stanford freshman John Fer
ris disposed of Spitz's 200 fly
record and USC's Greg Charl
ton nipped his 400 free record
in Tokyo.
Pete Siebert, whose surpris

gave Stanford points that no
body figured were there, came
down with typhoid at the be
ginning of the season and did
not test negative until August.
