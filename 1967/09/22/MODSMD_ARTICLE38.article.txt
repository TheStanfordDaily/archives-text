## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's Gary Sheerer led
the United States' water polo
team to a gold medal in the Pan
American Games at Winnipeg.
Sheerer, now a Stanford senior,
topped all scorers in the Games
with 12 goals and earned the

coveted "Outstanding Player"
award of the tournament.
John Parker played with
Sheerer on the Foothill Aquatic
Club, victors in the Pan Ameri
can Trials. Parker travelled to
Winnipeg and later toured Eu
rope with Sheerer and the rest

of the United States national
team.
Parker Works Self Up
Art Lambert, coach of the
Foothill AC and recently named
Head Coach of the Olympic
team, said that Parker worked
himself up to number four man
over the European tour.
Sheerer made collegiate Ail-
American in both his sophomore
and junior years, despite early
season injuries in both. Last
year, gheercr and Parker scored
more than 80 goals between
them in 20 games.
Mark Parmely came down
with typhoid at the end of
spring quarter and could not
enter a pool until late August.
Parmely, an ambidextrous 210
pound powerhouse, will work
primarily from the "hole" in
front of the goal this season.
First Game: Alumni
Stanford plays the Alumni
Sept. 30 at 10 a.m. at the Encina
Pool and next faces an extreme
ly gritty Cal team Oct. 6 at
