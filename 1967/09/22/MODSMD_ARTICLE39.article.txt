# Mistakes, Mistakes
## OSU Spoils Card Opener 
### ART SNYDER 
Despite the aggressive enthu
siasm of this year's varsity, the
Tribe football team fell victim
to its own mistakes, losing the
opening game to Oregon State
13-7.
Between 82 yards in penalties,
3 interceptions, fumbles at key
times (none of which were lost),
and the end-option running of
Oregon State, the Cards could
not sustain any drives.
But on the good side of the
picture, Stanford seemed to dom
inate the game physically. Both
the offensive and defensive lines
performed with outstanding
blocking and tackling. The
crackling of helmets and pads
indicated fierce play, a fact sus
tained by the coaching films.
Second Quarter Scores
All of the scoring occurred
early in the second quarter. Ore
gon halfback Bill Main scored
on a five yard pitchout play with
14:14 left.
The Cards bounced right back
with a Stanford record-breaking
kickoff return by Nate Kirtman

that covered 98 yards. Kirtman
was momentarily stopped on the
Stanford 28, hut broke free to
the right sideline, and raced un
touched the rest of the way.
Turf For N'ags Only
Later in the quarter Stanford
started to drive. But Williams,
fading to pass, slipped to one
knee on the loose turf covering
the stadium infield, losing 7 val
uable yards in the process.
This forced the Tribe to punt,
and OSU marched 34 yards to
the Stanford 5, where the de
fense dammed the Beavers for
three consecutive plays with no
gain, forcing Mike Haggard to
kick a field goal.
Misfortune Strikes
Then came one of the most
dramatic misfortunes to hit
the Cards all night. OSU
kicked off, and Gene Washing
ton, thinking he was in the end

zone, downed the ball on the
Stanford 2.
For three plays Williams was
forced to punt and slipped on
the end zone astroturf, giving
the Beavers the ball on the Stan
ford 15. Three plays later Hag
gard made another field goal,
making the score OSU 13 - Stan
ford 6 at the half.
Second Half Stalls
In the second half the Tribe
moved methodically down to
the OSU 15 yard line where an
illegal procedure penalty set
them back to the 31, and the
drive sputtered and died.
Later in the third quarter the
Cards failed on another scoring
opportunity after Parish blocked
an OSU punt on the Beaver 40.
Four plays later an offside
penalty forced the Indians to
try a field goal which was wide.
The pattern held true for the

4th quarter. Stanford tried to
gain momentum, but penalties
and dropped passes from center
gummed up the Tribe's thrust.
Coach Ralston singled out the
defensive ends Tom Hazelrigg
and Stu Kellner, as well as de
fensive tackles Blaine Nye and
Doug "Lizard" McKenzie fo
their hard hitting. Several times
McKenzie and Nye made some
key stops. Halfback Dick Oliver,
playing in his first varsity game
performed well.
Both Nate Kirtman, who re
ceived Back of the Game honors
gaining 55 yards besides his
98 yard TD run, and Greg
Broughton turned in excellent
running performances, Ralston
said.

All of the scoring occurred
early in the second quarter. Ore
gon halfback Bill Main scored
on a five yard pitchout play with
14:14 left.
The Cards bounced right back
with a Stanford record-breaking
kickoff return by Nate Kirtman

that covered 98 yards. Kirtman
was momentarily stopped on the
Stanford 28, hut broke free to
the right sideline, and raced un
touched the rest of the way.
Turf For N'ags Only
Later in the quarter Stanford
started to drive. But Williams,
fading to pass, slipped to one
knee on the loose turf covering
the stadium infield, losing 7 val
uable yards in the process.
This forced the Tribe to punt,
and OSU marched 34 yards to
the Stanford 5, where the de
fense dammed the Beavers for
three consecutive plays with no
gain, forcing Mike Haggard to
kick a field goal.
Misfortune Strikes
Then came one of the most
dramatic misfortunes to hit
the Cards all night. OSU
kicked off, and Gene Washing
ton, thinking he was in the end

zone, downed the ball on the
Stanford 2.
For three plays Williams was
forced to punt and slipped on
the end zone astroturf, giving
the Beavers the ball on the Stan
ford 15. Three plays later Hag
gard made another field goal,
making the score OSU 13 - Stan
ford 6 at the half.
Second Half Stalls
In the second half the Tribe
moved methodically down to
the OSU 15 yard line where an
illegal procedure penalty set
them back to the 31, and the
drive sputtered and died.
Later in the third quarter the
Cards failed on another scoring
opportunity after Parish blocked
an OSU punt on the Beaver 40.
Four plays later an offside
penalty forced the Indians to
try a field goal which was wide.
The pattern held true for the

4th quarter. Stanford tried to
gain momentum, but penalties
and dropped passes from center
gummed up the Tribe's thrust.
Coach Ralston singled out the
defensive ends Tom Hazelrigg
and Stu Kellner, as well as de
fensive tackles Blaine Nye and
Doug "Lizard" McKenzie fo
their hard hitting. Several times
McKenzie and Nye made some
key stops. Halfback Dick Oliver,
playing in his first varsity game
performed well.
Both Nate Kirtman, who re
ceived Back of the Game honors
gaining 55 yards besides his
98 yard TD run, and Greg
Broughton turned in excellent
running performances, Ralston
said.

OSU game for THE DAILY.)
Despite the aggressive enthu
siasm of this year's varsity, the
Tribe football team fell victim
to its own mistakes, losing the
opening game to Oregon State
13-7.
Between 82 yards in penalties,
3 interceptions, fumbles at key
times (none of which were lost),
and the end-option running of
Oregon State, the Cards could
not sustain any drives.
But on the good side of the
picture, Stanford seemed to dom
inate the game physically. Both
the offensive and defensive lines
performed with outstanding
blocking and tackling. The
crackling of helmets and pads
indicated fierce play, a fact sus
tained by the coaching films.
