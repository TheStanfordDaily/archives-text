# Froshbook Delayed 'Til Early November
## 
### 
Stanford's Froshbook, the tra
ditional dating guide containing
pictures of the entire freshman
class, will not appear until early
November.
The Froshbook is usually dis
tributed during Pre-Registra
tion.
Bruce Howard, Froshbook edi
tor, says the delay results from
the many new housing arrange
ments for freshmen. Lists of
freshmen and their residence as
signments were released a
month later than usual by the
Dean's office.
