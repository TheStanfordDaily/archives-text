# Cards To Reform For Jayhawk Test
## 
### NICK SELBY 
"If you lose, you change. If
you don't change, you probably
will lose again."
Coach John Ralston and the
Stanford football team hope to
apply this maxim tomorrow af

ternoon when they meet the
University of Kansas Jayhawks
in the Stanford Stadium at 1:30.
The need to reform applies not
so much to strategy as to per
formance and alertness.
Ralston dourly admits that

the '67 Cardinal squad needs a
lot of work to change a bad
habit of making mistakes. Sev
eral miscues resulted in a 13-7
loss to Oregon State last week
end.
Mistakes Dictate Cluinge
Among the principal mistakes
was a lack of timing which re
sulted in 82 yards of penalties,
including three offsides in the
first series of plays. And al
though amassing 14 first downs,
the Indians were never inside the
Beaver 20, unable to create any
momentum for a scoring drive.
The play typified Indian
games of last year when the
Tribe broke even with a 5-5

record and finished last in the
Pacific-8 conference with one
win and four losses.
Jayhawks Revamped
Coach Ralston warns that al-

Other stories and pictures on
the Stanford-Oregon State
game appear on page 18. A
summer wrap-up, rei»orts on
Stanford's swimmers, and tick
et information, appear on
pages 17 and 19.

though the Jayhawks finished
last in the Big-8 conference with

a 2-7-1 log last fall, they repre
sent a very strong opponent.
One reason the Tribe will have
to avoid mistakes is the Jay
hawk quarterback, Bobby Doug
lass, whom Ralston calls a "left
handed Gary Beban."
Douglass' passing style prob
ably comes from the Jayhawk
coach, Pepper Martin, who
coached the backfield at UCLA
under Tommy Prothro and has
revamped the Kansas offense.
Douglass will have John Jack
son, a 9.5 sprinter, at one end,
plus NCAA long jump cham
pion Gary Ard and sixth-fastest
-440-man Ben Olison to alternate
at flanker with Mike Reeves.
Defense To Shine Again?
The Jayhawk passing threat
comes against at a Card defense
that stood out against the Bea
vers but is also hurt by the loss
of senior safety Dave Nelson,
out with a broken collarbone.
Sophomore Bob Rinker will
fill that spot, flanked by another
sophomore whom Ralston says
could start on any college team,
Dick Oliver. The third back in
the Cards' 'Oklahoma' defense is
Donn Renwick.
Mistakes were not a problem
for the defensive line, which
earned credit from Ralston,
after the Oregon State game.
Standout ends Tom Hazelrigg
and Stu Kellner and tackles
Blaine Nye and Doug Mackenzie
all hope to continue their flaw
less play against the Jayhawks.
John de la Forest fills the mid
dle guard spot, while Tom Wein
gartner, Andy Carrigan, and
John Haygood, a roving 'mon
ster', start as linebackers.
Marquess Surprise!
The Stanford offense will have
to come up with several sur
prises to prove more effective
than it has been in practices and
the OSU game.
A major change comes at
quarterback, where it appears
that Junior Mark Marquess will
start.
Marquess, a defensive back
last year and also a member of
the USA Pan-Am baseball team
during the summer, worked
only two plays in the OSU game.
Marquess will replace Chuck
Williams, who sprained his an
kle very severely in the OSU
game after he completed 10 of
21 and had three passes inter
cepted.

The lefthandod Marquess re
portedly is extremely accurate
on short passes but lacks deep
strike authority.
Receiving Solution
Ralston seems to have come
up with the solution to any re
ceiver problems with the switch
of fleet Gene Washington, a
quarterback last year, to flank
er.
Washington and transfer stu
dent Jim Cross each caught five
passes last weekend. The tight
end for the Cards is mammoth
250 pound George Buehler.
Ralston will make no changes
in his setbacks from last week.
Greg Broughton averaged 4.2
yards a carry, while Nate Kirt
man averaged 4.6 and set a new
Tribe record when he returned

a kickoff 98 yards for the only
Card tally.
Punting proved a major prob
lem for the Cards last week
when Williams averaged only
29.5 yards. One ten yarder gave
the Beavers the ball on the Card
15 and led to a score.
Bob Reinhard, Howie Williams,
and Bob Rinker assume the kick
ing responsibilities. A new rule,
allowing only eligible receivers
to go down field before the punt,
places a premium upon height
and accuracy.
The Kansas defense features
giant Vernon Vanoy at defen
sive end. The 6'B" Sophomore of
the Year in the Big-8 is joined
by captain Mike Sweatman, an
all league selection, in defensive
terror tactics.

you don't change, you probably

the Indians were never inside the
Beaver 20, unable to create any
momentum for a scoring drive.
The play typified Indian
games of last year when the
Tribe broke even with a 5-5

record and finished last in the
Pacific-8 conference with one
win and four losses.
Jayhawks Revamped
Coach Ralston warns that al-

Other stories and pictures on
the Stanford-Oregon State
game appear on page 18. A
summer wrap-up, rei»orts on
Stanford's swimmers, and tick
et information, appear on
pages 17 and 19.

though the Jayhawks finished
last in the Big-8 conference with

a 2-7-1 log last fall, they repre
sent a very strong opponent.
One reason the Tribe will have
to avoid mistakes is the Jay
hawk quarterback, Bobby Doug
lass, whom Ralston calls a "left
handed Gary Beban."
Douglass' passing style prob
ably comes from the Jayhawk
coach, Pepper Martin, who
coached the backfield at UCLA
under Tommy Prothro and has
revamped the Kansas offense.
Douglass will have John Jack
son, a 9.5 sprinter, at one end,
plus NCAA long jump cham
pion Gary Ard and sixth-fastest
-440-man Ben Olison to alternate
at flanker with Mike Reeves.
Defense To Shine Again?
The Jayhawk passing threat
comes against at a Card defense
that stood out against the Bea
vers but is also hurt by the loss
of senior safety Dave Nelson,
out with a broken collarbone.
Sophomore Bob Rinker will
fill that spot, flanked by another
sophomore whom Ralston says
could start on any college team,
Dick Oliver. The third back in
the Cards' 'Oklahoma' defense is
Donn Renwick.
Mistakes were not a problem
for the defensive line, which
earned credit from Ralston,
after the Oregon State game.
Standout ends Tom Hazelrigg
and Stu Kellner and tackles
Blaine Nye and Doug Mackenzie
all hope to continue their flaw
less play against the Jayhawks.
John de la Forest fills the mid
dle guard spot, while Tom Wein
gartner, Andy Carrigan, and
John Haygood, a roving 'mon
ster', start as linebackers.
Marquess Surprise!
The Stanford offense will have
to come up with several sur
prises to prove more effective
than it has been in practices and
the OSU game.
A major change comes at
quarterback, where it appears
that Junior Mark Marquess will
start.
Marquess, a defensive back
last year and also a member of
the USA Pan-Am baseball team
during the summer, worked
only two plays in the OSU game.
Marquess will replace Chuck
Williams, who sprained his an
kle very severely in the OSU
game after he completed 10 of
21 and had three passes inter
cepted.

The lefthandod Marquess re
portedly is extremely accurate
on short passes but lacks deep
strike authority.
Receiving Solution
Ralston seems to have come
up with the solution to any re
ceiver problems with the switch
of fleet Gene Washington, a
quarterback last year, to flank
er.
Washington and transfer stu
dent Jim Cross each caught five
passes last weekend. The tight
end for the Cards is mammoth
250 pound George Buehler.
Ralston will make no changes
in his setbacks from last week.
Greg Broughton averaged 4.2
yards a carry, while Nate Kirt
man averaged 4.6 and set a new
Tribe record when he returned

a kickoff 98 yards for the only
Card tally.
Punting proved a major prob
lem for the Cards last week
when Williams averaged only
29.5 yards. One ten yarder gave
the Beavers the ball on the Card
15 and led to a score.
Bob Reinhard, Howie Williams,
and Bob Rinker assume the kick
ing responsibilities. A new rule,
allowing only eligible receivers
to go down field before the punt,
places a premium upon height
and accuracy.
The Kansas defense features
giant Vernon Vanoy at defen
sive end. The 6'B" Sophomore of
the Year in the Big-8 is joined
by captain Mike Sweatman, an
all league selection, in defensive
terror tactics.
"If you lose, you change. If
you don't change, you probably
will lose again."
Coach John Ralston and the
Stanford football team hope to
apply this maxim tomorrow af

ternoon when they meet the
University of Kansas Jayhawks
in the Stanford Stadium at 1:30.
The need to reform applies not
so much to strategy as to per
formance and alertness.
Ralston dourly admits that

the '67 Cardinal squad needs a
lot of work to change a bad
habit of making mistakes. Sev
eral miscues resulted in a 13-7
loss to Oregon State last week
end.
Mistakes Dictate Cluinge
Among the principal mistakes
was a lack of timing which re
sulted in 82 yards of penalties,
including three offsides in the
first series of plays. And al
though amassing 14 first downs,
the Indians were never inside the
Beaver 20, unable to create any

lass, whom Ralston calls a "left
handed Gary Beban."
Douglass' passing style prob
ably comes from the Jayhawk
coach, Pepper Martin, who
coached the backfield at UCLA
under Tommy Prothro and has
revamped the Kansas offense.
Douglass will have John Jack
son, a 9.5 sprinter, at one end,
plus NCAA long jump cham
pion Gary Ard and sixth-fastest
-440-man Ben Olison to alternate
at flanker with Mike Reeves.
Defense To Shine Again?
The Jayhawk passing threat
comes against at a Card defense
that stood out against the Bea
vers but is also hurt by the loss
of senior safety Dave Nelson,
out with a broken collarbone.
Sophomore Bob Rinker will
fill that spot, flanked by another
sophomore whom Ralston says
could start on any college team,
Dick Oliver. The third back in
the Cards' 'Oklahoma' defense is
Donn Renwick.
Mistakes were not a problem
for the defensive line, which
earned credit from Ralston,
after the Oregon State game.
Standout ends Tom Hazelrigg
and Stu Kellner and tackles
Blaine Nye and Doug Mackenzie
all hope to continue their flaw
less play against the Jayhawks.
John de la Forest fills the mid
dle guard spot, while Tom Wein
gartner, Andy Carrigan, and
John Haygood, a roving 'mon
ster', start as linebackers.
Marquess Surprise!
The Stanford offense will have
to come up with several sur
prises to prove more effective
than it has been in practices and
the OSU game.
A major change comes at
quarterback, where it appears
that Junior Mark Marquess will
start.
Marquess, a defensive back
last year and also a member of
the USA Pan-Am baseball team
during the summer, worked
only two plays in the OSU game.
Marquess will replace Chuck
Williams, who sprained his an
kle very severely in the OSU
game after he completed 10 of
21 and had three passes inter
cepted.

The lefthandod Marquess re
portedly is extremely accurate
on short passes but lacks deep
strike authority.
Receiving Solution
Ralston seems to have come
up with the solution to any re
ceiver problems with the switch
of fleet Gene Washington, a
quarterback last year, to flank
er.
Washington and transfer stu
dent Jim Cross each caught five
passes last weekend. The tight
end for the Cards is mammoth
250 pound George Buehler.
Ralston will make no changes
in his setbacks from last week.
Greg Broughton averaged 4.2
yards a carry, while Nate Kirt
man averaged 4.6 and set a new
Tribe record when he returned

a kickoff 98 yards for the only
Card tally.
Punting proved a major prob
lem for the Cards last week
when Williams averaged only
29.5 yards. One ten yarder gave
the Beavers the ball on the Card
15 and led to a score.
Bob Reinhard, Howie Williams,
and Bob Rinker assume the kick
ing responsibilities. A new rule,
allowing only eligible receivers
to go down field before the punt,
places a premium upon height
and accuracy.
The Kansas defense features
giant Vernon Vanoy at defen
sive end. The 6'B" Sophomore of
the Year in the Big-8 is joined
by captain Mike Sweatman, an
all league selection, in defensive
terror tactics.
"If you lose, you change. If
you don't change, you probably
will lose again."
Coach John Ralston and the
Stanford football team hope to
apply this maxim tomorrow af

ternoon when they meet the
University of Kansas Jayhawks
in the Stanford Stadium at 1:30.
The need to reform applies not
so much to strategy as to per
formance and alertness.
Ralston dourly admits that

the '67 Cardinal squad needs a
lot of work to change a bad
habit of making mistakes. Sev
eral miscues resulted in a 13-7
loss to Oregon State last week
end.
Mistakes Dictate Cluinge
Among the principal mistakes
was a lack of timing which re
sulted in 82 yards of penalties,
including three offsides in the
first series of plays. And al
though amassing 14 first downs,
the Indians were never inside the
Beaver 20, unable to create any
momentum for a scoring drive.
The play typified Indian
games of last year when the
Tribe broke even with a 5-5

record and finished last in the
Pacific-8 conference with one
win and four losses.
Jayhawks Revamped
Coach Ralston warns that al-

though the Jayhawks finished
last in the Big-8 conference with

a 2-7-1 log last fall, they repre
sent a very strong opponent.
One reason the Tribe will have
to avoid mistakes is the Jay
hawk quarterback, Bobby Doug
