# Called 'Disastrous'
## Grade Deferral Out 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Freshman English and His
tory of Western Civilization pro
grams of giving no grades until
the year's end have been vir
tually eliminated for the coming
year after a one-year trial peri
od that involved almost one-half
of last year's freshmen.
Comments on the deferred
grade program ranged from
"disastrous" to "a poor compro
mise" to "simply unworkable."
There will be no deferred sec
tions in Freshman English and
only a few are scheduled for
Western Civ for the coming
year, according to Dr. Robert
Walker, Director of General
Studies.
Walker termed the program
"an apparent disaster" while
speaking before Freshmen spon
sors-earlier this week.
In the experiment, Freshmen
were permitted to take either
Freshman English or Western
Civ—or both —without receiving
a grade until the end of Spring
Quarter. Then, students were
given one grade covering their
work for the entire year.
Nearly Half Involved
Last year, almost half of the
sixty Western Civ classes and
17 of 57 Freshman English sec
tions followed the deferred
grades program.
"Only three or four Western
Civ sections will continue the
program this year," commented
Paul Seaver, Director of the
Western Civ program.
Seaver termed last year's ex

periment "an unsatisfactory
compromise." He said that "the
real alternatives that we face
are a traditional, graded ap
proach or a non-graded, pass
fail situation."
"The idea behind the experi
ment was to relieve the pres
sures and anxieties of the fresh
man year," Seaver explained.
"But instead of taking off the
pressure, it only deferred it all
until the third quarter. It didn't
solve the grade problems; the
old system was just as effective."
Seaver Wants Pass-Fail
Seaver looks to a pass-fail
graded freshman year in order
to "get rid of the competitive
atmosphere so that we can form
a new, different approach to
education. Deferred grading was
no solution; it was only a com
promise."
Seaver favors* either a com
pletely ungraded freshman year
or a modified pass-fail program
with grades given internally
within departments, but no
grades appearing on transcripts.
Reed College does this.
"It would take the pressure
off the student if no grades
were on transcripts and they
were given a one-year leeway.
Grades would serve only as an
indicator," he said.
Lift The Pressure
He supports the idea that all
Freshman courses—math, sci
ence, and language in addition
to Freshman English and West

ern Civ—should be ungraded.
The pressure, he feels, should
be lifted, not merely shifted to
math and science.
Seaver indicated that only one
instructor found the deferred
grading successful and will con
tinue the program. "He, too,
would like to see an ungraded
freshman year, but considers de
ferred grading a good interme
diary step," Seaver added.
The English Department faced
more practical problems in its
experiment with deferred grad
ing, according to Robert Polhe
mous, Director of Freshman En
glish.
"The experiment produced
some good results," Polhemous
stated. "In many cases, however,
it was very difficult to assign a
fair grade. It was often unwork
able."
"A lot of TAs (Teaching As
sistants) or regular professors
don't teach the same section all
the way through the year. They
switch students, drop sections,
or even leave the university or
the country. That makes it dif
ficult to be fair," he said.
Polhemous assigns part of the
problem to understaffing. "Regu
lar professors simply can't carry
through the whole year with
the same students with the
shortage the way it is."
Polhemous cites another prob
lem of the "student who does
fine work fall and winter quar
ters but who does little or noth
ing in the spring. The instructor
is then faced with giving the
student a horrendous grade for
all nine units."
Polhomous reports that by
spring "many weren't doing the
work assigned. A lot of it didn't
get in."
For the coming year, students
will receive a grade at the end
of each quarter. They will not,
however, receive grades on in
dividual papers. The policy of
comprehensive comments on pa
pers instead of grades will con
tinue.
For the future, Polhemous en
visions theme-centered Fresh
man English rather than the
present system without alterna
tives. There may be six to twelve
choices of subject matter with
in English literature or philoso
phy.
"Students would have far
more options. They would
change topics every quarter or
two," Polhemous said.
