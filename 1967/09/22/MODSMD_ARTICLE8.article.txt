# Sterling Advises-- Take Long View
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
J. E. Wallace Sterling gave
his last welcoming address to
new students at the Freshman
Convocation Wednesday.
He asked 1290 young people
to think and act as though they
were much older.
He pictured his audience of
17 and 18-year-olds as having
reached age 50, immersed in the
worries and nostalgia of late
middle-age.
In short, Stanford's president
sounded a theme he has used
often in his speeches at 19 Fresh
man Convocations. In his words,

"I invite you to learn to take
the long view."
Sterling's familiar address en
hanced the solemn, archaic at
mosphere of the traditional Con
vocation ceremonies beginning
Pre-RegLstration activities. Ster
ling himself will not be at Stan
ford much longer. The 62-year
old president, who took office be
fore many members of the class
of '71 were born, intends to re
tire as soon as the Board of
Trustees appoint his successor.
As always, Sterling told the
freshmen gathered in Frost
Amphitheater that "Stanford
probably knows more about you
as a class than you know about
yourselves." He said 859 were
men, 431 were women, and threw
in the apparently ageless joke
that this is "a ratio which con
tinues to afford a numerical
advantage to the men and a
matrimonial advantage to the
women."
The joke drew laughs, as it
always has.
New Identity Stressed
After Sterling put his audience
at ease by light banter, including
a suggestion to the nervously
standing freshmen that "you
will be much more comfortable
sitting down," he tried to get
them thinking about their new
identity as college students.
In former years, he has asked
freshmen, "What do you expect
to get out of college?" (1965).
Or he has warned, "You will
never be 18 to 22 again . . . you
will never again be so carefree."
(1964).
In 1967 the message was,
"It takes the long view into
the past to appreciate what has
been achieved, and I urge the
long view into the future if hope

and faith are not to be eroded
by impatience and the frustra
tion of momentary failure."
And he warned: "No one can
effectively take the long view
without thought and effort."
And he promised: "The long
view . . . will help you to put
knowledge and ignorance in
sharper perspective; it might
even add wisdom to knowledge.
Sterling said after the Con
vocation that "in all probability"
it was the last he would preside
over. March 24 he announced
plans to retire, requesting the
Board of Trustees to appoint his
successor "not later than Sep
tember 1, 1968." The Canadian
born educator has been presi
dent here since 1949.
Provost Speaks
Sterling's welcoming address
to the class of '71 followed re
marks by Vice-President and
Provost Richard W. Lyman, who
spoke to the question, "What
ought a university be?"
Lyman said later his speech
was "in part a rebuttal" to stu
dent critics of Stanford, but he
added, "It was not a fighting
talk."
Lyman showed his academic
background as a history profes
sor when he compared univer
sities today with those of the
19th century, where "freedom
of inquiry ... did not exist."
"The university of today," he
asserted, "whatever its defects,
is an almost infinitely more
open, free and intellectually ven
turesome institution than was
the college of old."
The provost said the univer
sity should resist "critics from
the Left" who "are obsessed
with fears" that the campus will
fail to become "the seedbed of
revolutionary conspiracy against
the status quo.
"Most of the trouble with uni
versities, according to some,
stems from this notion that they
exist to serve society," Lyman
said. He asserted that univer
sities should neither be "apolo
gists for all existing institutions"
or "leap to the barricades" of
radical protest.
"Universities do not exist to
promote ideologies, but to seek

truth," Lyman told the freshmen
emphatically.
Lyman vs. Lyman
The provost's remarks con
trasted sharply with the con
troversial letter sent by ASSU
President Peter Lyman to fresh
men in August. In that letter he
said "Stanford serves the vested
interests of our society before
it serves the needs of educa
tion." Peter Lyman warned that
real education demands noncon
formity, and "will require you
to put yourself in conflict with
your society."
Provost Lyman said after his
Convocation address that he had
read Peter Lyman's letter. The
provost commented only that he
was against "simplicity" in
recommending answers to the
question of the role of the uni
versity.
"The complexities of the uni
versity role," the provost said,
"have produced both problems
and strong bulwarks protecting
university independence."

Pre-RegLstration activities. Ster
ling himself will not be at Stan
ford much longer. The 62-year
old president, who took office be
fore many members of the class
of '71 were born, intends to re
tire as soon as the Board of
Trustees appoint his successor.
As always, Sterling told the
freshmen gathered in Frost
Amphitheater that "Stanford
probably knows more about you
as a class than you know about
yourselves." He said 859 were
men, 431 were women, and threw
in the apparently ageless joke
that this is "a ratio which con
tinues to afford a numerical
advantage to the men and a
matrimonial advantage to the
women."
The joke drew laughs, as it
always has.
New Identity Stressed
After Sterling put his audience
at ease by light banter, including
a suggestion to the nervously
standing freshmen that "you
will be much more comfortable
sitting down," he tried to get
them thinking about their new
identity as college students.
In former years, he has asked
freshmen, "What do you expect
to get out of college?" (1965).
Or he has warned, "You will
never be 18 to 22 again . . . you
will never again be so carefree."
(1964).
In 1967 the message was,
"It takes the long view into
the past to appreciate what has
been achieved, and I urge the
long view into the future if hope

and faith are not to be eroded
by impatience and the frustra
tion of momentary failure."
And he warned: "No one can
effectively take the long view
without thought and effort."
And he promised: "The long
view . . . will help you to put
knowledge and ignorance in
sharper perspective; it might
even add wisdom to knowledge.
Sterling said after the Con
vocation that "in all probability"
it was the last he would preside
over. March 24 he announced
plans to retire, requesting the
Board of Trustees to appoint his
successor "not later than Sep
tember 1, 1968." The Canadian
born educator has been presi
dent here since 1949.
Provost Speaks
Sterling's welcoming address
to the class of '71 followed re
marks by Vice-President and
Provost Richard W. Lyman, who
spoke to the question, "What
ought a university be?"
Lyman said later his speech
was "in part a rebuttal" to stu
dent critics of Stanford, but he
added, "It was not a fighting
talk."
Lyman showed his academic
background as a history profes
sor when he compared univer
sities today with those of the
19th century, where "freedom
of inquiry ... did not exist."
"The university of today," he
asserted, "whatever its defects,
is an almost infinitely more
open, free and intellectually ven
turesome institution than was
the college of old."
The provost said the univer
sity should resist "critics from
the Left" who "are obsessed
with fears" that the campus will
fail to become "the seedbed of
revolutionary conspiracy against
the status quo.
"Most of the trouble with uni
versities, according to some,
stems from this notion that they
exist to serve society," Lyman
said. He asserted that univer
sities should neither be "apolo
gists for all existing institutions"
or "leap to the barricades" of
radical protest.
"Universities do not exist to
promote ideologies, but to seek

truth," Lyman told the freshmen
emphatically.
Lyman vs. Lyman
The provost's remarks con
trasted sharply with the con
troversial letter sent by ASSU
President Peter Lyman to fresh
men in August. In that letter he
said "Stanford serves the vested
interests of our society before
it serves the needs of educa
tion." Peter Lyman warned that
real education demands noncon
formity, and "will require you
to put yourself in conflict with
your society."
Provost Lyman said after his
Convocation address that he had
read Peter Lyman's letter. The
provost commented only that he
was against "simplicity" in
recommending answers to the
question of the role of the uni
versity.
"The complexities of the uni
versity role," the provost said,
"have produced both problems
and strong bulwarks protecting
university independence."
ASSU President Lyman is not
related to Provost Lyman.
J. E. Wallace Sterling gave
his last welcoming address to
new students at the Freshman
Convocation Wednesday.
He asked 1290 young people
to think and act as though they
were much older.
He pictured his audience of
17 and 18-year-olds as having
reached age 50, immersed in the
worries and nostalgia of late
middle-age.
In short, Stanford's president
sounded a theme he has used
often in his speeches at 19 Fresh
man Convocations. In his words,

"I invite you to learn to take
the long view."

hanced the solemn, archaic at

New Identity Stressed
After Sterling put his audience
at ease by light banter, including
a suggestion to the nervously
standing freshmen that "you
will be much more comfortable
sitting down," he tried to get
them thinking about their new
identity as college students.
In former years, he has asked
freshmen, "What do you expect
to get out of college?" (1965).
Or he has warned, "You will
never be 18 to 22 again . . . you
will never again be so carefree."
(1964).
In 1967 the message was,
"It takes the long view into
the past to appreciate what has
been achieved, and I urge the
long view into the future if hope

and faith are not to be eroded
by impatience and the frustra
tion of momentary failure."
And he warned: "No one can
effectively take the long view
without thought and effort."
And he promised: "The long
view . . . will help you to put
knowledge and ignorance in
sharper perspective; it might
even add wisdom to knowledge.
Sterling said after the Con
vocation that "in all probability"
it was the last he would preside
over. March 24 he announced
plans to retire, requesting the
Board of Trustees to appoint his
successor "not later than Sep
tember 1, 1968." The Canadian
born educator has been presi
dent here since 1949.
Provost Speaks
Sterling's welcoming address
to the class of '71 followed re
marks by Vice-President and
Provost Richard W. Lyman, who
spoke to the question, "What
ought a university be?"
Lyman said later his speech
was "in part a rebuttal" to stu
dent critics of Stanford, but he
added, "It was not a fighting
talk."
Lyman showed his academic
background as a history profes
sor when he compared univer
sities today with those of the
19th century, where "freedom
of inquiry ... did not exist."
"The university of today," he
asserted, "whatever its defects,
is an almost infinitely more
open, free and intellectually ven
turesome institution than was
the college of old."
The provost said the univer
sity should resist "critics from
the Left" who "are obsessed
with fears" that the campus will
fail to become "the seedbed of
revolutionary conspiracy against
the status quo.
"Most of the trouble with uni
versities, according to some,
stems from this notion that they
exist to serve society," Lyman
said. He asserted that univer
sities should neither be "apolo
gists for all existing institutions"
or "leap to the barricades" of
radical protest.
"Universities do not exist to
promote ideologies, but to seek

truth," Lyman told the freshmen
emphatically.
Lyman vs. Lyman
The provost's remarks con
trasted sharply with the con
troversial letter sent by ASSU
President Peter Lyman to fresh
men in August. In that letter he
said "Stanford serves the vested
interests of our society before
it serves the needs of educa
tion." Peter Lyman warned that
real education demands noncon
formity, and "will require you
to put yourself in conflict with
your society."
Provost Lyman said after his
Convocation address that he had
read Peter Lyman's letter. The
provost commented only that he
was against "simplicity" in
recommending answers to the
question of the role of the uni
versity.
"The complexities of the uni
versity role," the provost said,
"have produced both problems
and strong bulwarks protecting
university independence."

J. E. Wallace Sterling gave
his last welcoming address to
new students at the Freshman
Convocation Wednesday.
He asked 1290 young people
to think and act as though they
were much older.
He pictured his audience of
17 and 18-year-olds as having
reached age 50, immersed in the
worries and nostalgia of late
middle-age.
In short, Stanford's president
sounded a theme he has used
often in his speeches at 19 Fresh
man Convocations. In his words,

"I invite you to learn to take
the long view."
Sterling's familiar address en
hanced the solemn, archaic at
mosphere of the traditional Con
vocation ceremonies beginning
Pre-RegLstration activities. Ster
ling himself will not be at Stan
ford much longer. The 62-year
old president, who took office be
fore many members of the class
of '71 were born, intends to re
tire as soon as the Board of
Trustees appoint his successor.
As always, Sterling told the
freshmen gathered in Frost
Amphitheater that "Stanford
probably knows more about you
as a class than you know about
yourselves." He said 859 were
men, 431 were women, and threw
in the apparently ageless joke
that this is "a ratio which con
tinues to afford a numerical
advantage to the men and a
matrimonial advantage to the
women."
The joke drew laughs, as it
always has.
