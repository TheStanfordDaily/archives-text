Should You Be A
Daily Worker
• NOT if you plan to spend four placid years on the farm,
away from all the hurly-burly of change, controversy and dis
sent.
• NOT if the prospect of hob-nobbing with student leaders,
top faculty members and key university officials brings forth a
barely concealed yawn.
• NOT if the thought of interviewing such noted Stanford
visitors as Mark Hatfield, Arnold Toynbee or Joan Baez leaves
you cold.
If you fit into one of these categories, there is probably no
reason for you to come to THE DAILY's organizational meet
ing Sunday.
