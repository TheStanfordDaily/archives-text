14,000 cheering fans, taking up every seat of a sports
stadium to hear ... a poetry reading?
Yes, it has happened — is still happening, in fact. But not,
you will be unsurprised to learn, in the United States. It
happens in Russia, and the poet they come to cheer is Andrei
Voznesensky.
Of course, while his readings may draw a few thousand
fewer souls elsewhere, Voznesensky's reputation as a great
poet is not confined to Russia. Robert Lowell has written
of him, "He is full of invention, fireworks and humor ... a
first rate craftsman who has had the heroic patience and
imagination to be himself."
Anchor Books has just published a volume of Voznesen
sky's verse, including eight new poems, entitled Antiworlds
and"The Fifth Ace" (edited by Patricia Blake and Max
Hay ward; $1.95). It is a bilingual edition, with the Russian
texts on left hand pages and English versions facing them.
And it is a remarkable venture in the art of translation,
because six American poets — W. H. Auden, Jean Garrigue,
Stanley Kunitz, Stanley Moss, William Jay Smith, and
Richard Wilbur — worked with the editors from literal
translations of the poems to create English equivalents.
Voznesensky has written the translators of Antiworlds: "I
have long been convinced that poetry must be translated by
poets. A poet understands another poet, even without the
help of a dictionary . .."
W. H. Auden, in a foreword to this volume, tells why he —
and many thousands of non-Russians throughout the world
— want to hear and read Voznesensky's poetry: "One of the
primary proofs that a poem, or any work of art, has value
is that, wherever, whenever, and by whomever it was made,
we find it relevant to ourselves, our time, and our place. I
am certain that Mr. Voznesensky is a good poet because,
though I know no Russian and have never been to Russia,
his poems, even in English translation, have much to say to
me."

14,000 cheering fans, taking up every seat of a sports
stadium to hear ... a poetry reading?
Yes, it has happened — is still happening, in fact. But not,
you will be unsurprised to learn, in the United States. It
happens in Russia, and the poet they come to cheer is Andrei
Voznesensky.
Of course, while his readings may draw a few thousand
fewer souls elsewhere, Voznesensky's reputation as a great
poet is not confined to Russia. Robert Lowell has written
of him, "He is full of invention, fireworks and humor ... a
first rate craftsman who has had the heroic patience and
imagination to be himself."
Anchor Books has just published a volume of Voznesen
sky's verse, including eight new poems, entitled Antiworlds
and"The Fifth Ace" (edited by Patricia Blake and Max
Hay ward; $1.95). It is a bilingual edition, with the Russian
texts on left hand pages and English versions facing them.
And it is a remarkable venture in the art of translation,
because six American poets — W. H. Auden, Jean Garrigue,
Stanley Kunitz, Stanley Moss, William Jay Smith, and
Richard Wilbur — worked with the editors from literal
translations of the poems to create English equivalents.
Voznesensky has written the translators of Antiworlds: "I
have long been convinced that poetry must be translated by
poets. A poet understands another poet, even without the
help of a dictionary . .."
W. H. Auden, in a foreword to this volume, tells why he —
and many thousands of non-Russians throughout the world
— want to hear and read Voznesensky's poetry: "One of the
primary proofs that a poem, or any work of art, has value
is that, wherever, whenever, and by whomever it was made,
we find it relevant to ourselves, our time, and our place. I
am certain that Mr. Voznesensky is a good poet because,
though I know no Russian and have never been to Russia,
his poems, even in English translation, have much to say to
me."
