# Housing Crisis
## 
### 
The shortage of suitable student housing in
the Stanford area has reached crisis proportions.
With the influx this week of new students and
returning students who wish to find housing, the
lines at the housing office and at the Palo Alto
Times are getting longer and more frustrated.
The shortage is first apparent on the campus
where the demonstration houses and the atten
dant shuffling of housing groups have left sopho
more men sleeping in the Tresidder parking lot
and in Durand House. The cancellation last year
of the Moore and Jack houses has substantially
reduced the total number of on-campus resi
dence spots available.
Off-campus the conditions are even worse.
With more students than ever looking for off
campus apartments or rooms, the available
places in Palo Alto and surrounding communities
are severely restricted. The tight money situa
tion over the last two years has curtailed new
apartment building and the great influx of white
collar workers in the area has jammed the hous
ing that is available.
Such conditions might be somewhat bearable
if the University gave students enough help in
seeking housing. The Dean of Students office
is obviously limited by the absolute number of
on-campus residence spaces available, and has
made an attempt to get fraternities to fill empty
spaces with boarders. However, a few boarders
in Alpha Delt and a few in the resurrected Phi
Delts have hardly alleviated the problem.
The transfer students have it worst. The Trans
fer Pre-Reg committee during the summer of
fered to help them get settled at Stanford, but

neglected to tell them a housing shortage existed.
When the transfers began arriving a week ago,
the transfer Pre-Reg group was nowhere in sight.
The transfers who arrived late in the week ex
pected to easily find housing suddenly faced the
crisis all the more acutely.
When they went looking for housing, they
found little or no help from the Pre-Reg commit
tee, a Housing office that makes postings, but
whose small staff is equipped to do little else
for the student who seeks off-campus housing.
In many ways, the efforts of the University seem
to be more concerned with keeping the dor
mitories full so that they do not lose money
rather than in helping to find satisfactory hous
ing for all students.
The Planning Office has failed to plan ade
quate and attractice housing for Stanford stu
dents. Although we must admit that the cancel
lation of the Moore-Jacks housing was a dis
guised blessing due to the miscredited plan
ning that went into it, the need for the cancella
tion only shows the dimensions of the crisis. The
whole question of residence living will be a
major issue throughout the year and is tied to the
definition of education, now being pursued not
only by student leaders, but by administrators
as well.
The housing crisis emphasizes the urgency of
finding a housing concept that is consistent with
the education Stanford is trying to make pos
sible for its students. The crisis also reflects upon
the need for greater efforts by the University and
the Pre-Reg committee on behalf of transfers
and all students seeking to find adequate hous
ing.
