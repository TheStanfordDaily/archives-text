# Letters To The Editor
## Harvard's Honesty And Honor 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I was pleased with the gen
eral endorsement given to the
principle of the Honor Code in
last spring's election. As an
alumna now enrolled in the
"Stanford of the East", I have
just had occasion to realize even
more my respect for Stanford's
system.
Exams at Harvard are a dis
mal business (aside from the
usual reasons for grief during
exams). You enter the assigned
room, usually a gymnasium-like
hall with a collection of four
man rectangular tables. All stu
dents taking exam "a" must sit
on one side of the tables and
face one direction; students
taking another exam sit on the
opposite side of each table.
One of several "proctors"
(people paid to police the
exams) announces that you
must place all books, papers,
notebooks, etc. at the front or
back of the room. You are then
told to "move your chair so that
its leg touches the leg of the
table." Blue books and exams
are passed out, but not opened.
First you must fill out a slip
certifying your attendance,
which may or may not be
checked with the signature list
at the registrar's office, to be
sure that no one else is taking

your exam. At some precise
second, you may, upon direc
tion, open your bluebook and be
gin.
Ah, you think, that's not so
bad — a little troublesome, per
haps. But ... no one may leave
the room until 90 minutes have
passed. If you leave to get a
drink of water, someone goes
with you; if you leave to go to
the restroom, someone accom
panies you. If you drop dead,
presumably a proctor would
have to go along.
The ridiculousness of these
regulations is surpassed only by
the further checks on you. If
you miss an exam because of
illness, you are placed in soli
tary confinement until you take
the exam. You may speak to no
one, not even someone "proc
tored" by the (by logical exten
tion) "honest" hospital staff.
You may not keep your final
exam after it is graded; you
may look at it, if you go to the
correct place at the correct
time, but you can't show your
definitive work to anyone else.
After four years of adult re
sponsibility in this area, I find
the assumptions underlying
these regulations more serious
than ridiculous. Apparently no
one else does. No editorials ap
pear in the Crimson on this sub

ject, no letters, no mention. Peo
ple here seem to feel that the
proctoring protects you from all
those who might get a higher
grade than you by some chi
canery. Undergraduates I've
talked to see an honor system
as a license for cheating.

Editor, The Daily:
When the freshman edition of
The Daily May 15 finally made
its way overseas to Harlaxton
Manor, I noticed with particular
interest the front page article by
Philip Taubman. During the past
few months, it had occurred to
me that perhaps the current staff
was not going to be able to find
enough willing neophytes to car
ry on the ultra-liberal, anti-fra
ternity, and anti-school spirit
traditions that have become
such an integral part of this
great newspaper, Mr. Taubman's
"Panoramic View" has allayed
my fears, and I now rest as
sured that the views of the fall's
Dailies will not differ substan
tially from those of the current
edition.

After four years of adult re

the assumptions underlying

than ridiculous. Apparently no

When the freshman edition of
The Daily May 15 finally made
its way overseas to Harlaxton
Manor, I noticed with particular
interest the front page article by
Philip Taubman. During the past
few months, it had occurred to
me that perhaps the current staff
was not going to be able to find
enough willing neophytes to car
ry on the ultra-liberal, anti-fra
ternity, and anti-school spirit
traditions that have become
such an integral part of this
great newspaper, Mr. Taubman's
"Panoramic View" has allayed
my fears, and I now rest as
sured that the views of the fall's
Dailies will not differ substan
tially from those of the current
edition.

I was pleased with the gen
eral endorsement given to the
principle of the Honor Code in
last spring's election. As an
alumna now enrolled in the
"Stanford of the East", I have
just had occasion to realize even
more my respect for Stanford's
system.
Exams at Harvard are a dis
mal business (aside from the
usual reasons for grief during
exams). You enter the assigned
room, usually a gymnasium-like
hall with a collection of four
man rectangular tables. All stu
dents taking exam "a" must sit
on one side of the tables and
face one direction; students
taking another exam sit on the
opposite side of each table.
One of several "proctors"
(people paid to police the
exams) announces that you
must place all books, papers,
notebooks, etc. at the front or
back of the room. You are then
told to "move your chair so that
its leg touches the leg of the
table." Blue books and exams
are passed out, but not opened.
First you must fill out a slip
certifying your attendance,
which may or may not be
checked with the signature list
at the registrar's office, to be
sure that no one else is taking

your exam. At some precise
second, you may, upon direc
tion, open your bluebook and be
gin.
Ah, you think, that's not so
bad — a little troublesome, per
haps. But ... no one may leave
the room until 90 minutes have
passed. If you leave to get a
drink of water, someone goes
with you; if you leave to go to
the restroom, someone accom
panies you. If you drop dead,
presumably a proctor would
have to go along.
The ridiculousness of these
regulations is surpassed only by
the further checks on you. If
you miss an exam because of
illness, you are placed in soli
tary confinement until you take
the exam. You may speak to no
one, not even someone "proc
tored" by the (by logical exten
tion) "honest" hospital staff.
You may not keep your final
exam after it is graded; you
may look at it, if you go to the
correct place at the correct
time, but you can't show your
definitive work to anyone else.

sponsibility in this area, I find
