# I Won't Go
## 'What Can Anyone Do For Stanford?' 
### Herbie Hinckes 
President Wallace J. Tar
nished took a deep breath.
"Well, Puppet," he said to his
esteemed aide, Frederick O.
Puppet, administrative valet to
the President, "it looks like
another freshman class."
"Yeah boss," Puppet declared,
his mouth foaming with glee,
"it look like another freshman
class."
Tarnished glanced reflectively
at a nearby mirror. "We'll whip
those neophytes into shape. Just
four years from now they'll be
respectable citizens, ready to
take their place in society."
"Did you see those creeps
pulling in today, Boss?" Puppet
queried. "Something tells me
they have a long way to go."
"Right, Puppet, when they
first get here, we hardly know
what to do with them. Some
don't even know what a tooth
brush is; others have to become
acquainted with indoor plumb
ing. But that's what the Univer
sity is for, to teach them about
life and h.ow to live it."
"Tell it like it is, Boss."
Who For Whom?
"This is how it is, Puppet.
One of them asked me after my
Convocation address this after
noon if the University exists for
the students or the administra
tion. Can you believe . . ."
Puppet had already fallen off
his chair. He lay staring at a
picture of Little Leland. His
eyes were glassy and somewhat
moist.
"Are you all right, Fred?
"Fred?"
"I'm O.K. Boss, but how could
he ... I mean, doesn't he
know . . ."
"Not only that, but he asked
me why, if this was such a good
school, we had a football team."
Puppet started inching toward
the nearest wastebasket.
"Then another freshman came
up to me and said that we ought
to abolish fraternities, Puppet.
Following him was a girl who
wanted to have open house
hours 24 hours a day."
"Don't tell me any more,
Boss," Puppet's voice echoed
from the wastebasket. "I can't
take it."
"But listen to this, Fred.
While I was giving the Convo
cation address, I said "Ask not
what Stanford can do for you,
ask what you can do for Stan
ford." And some smart alec
stood up and shouted, "W hat
can anybody do for Stanford?"
"What are we going to do
about them, Boss?" Puppet

asked weakly as he climbed back
on his chair.
Tarnished suddenly flashed
The Smile, the same one that
ingratiated alumni pocketbooks
from coast to coast during the
PACE (Please Airmail Checks
Expeditiously) program.
"I know how to find the an
swer to this problem, Fred,"
Tarnished smiled again. He
reached over and pressed a small
button marked "Emergency."
"There's only one person on
campus who would know the
answer, Fred."
"You mean Herbert Stuffer,
head of the Study of Anything
at Stanford (SAS)?"
A small door opened from
what had moments before just
been a wall. It revealed a little
man standing with a book un
der his arm labeled "Answers."
Question-Answer
"At your service, sir," Stuffer
said. "Just give me an answer
and I'll give you the question."
"No, you got it backwards,
Herb. I give you the questions,
you give me the answers," Tar
nished said. "And my question
is what makes freshman so
fresh?"
"It's simply a matter of ex
perience, sir," Stuffer answered.
"Our research shows that once
they are here for a few years
they won't give a damn any
more."
"Thanks, Stuffer," Tarnished
said. "Back in the box."
Stuffer executed a smart
about-face and walked through
the door again, which slammed
after him.
"I'll have to ask him ques
tions more often," Tarnished
mused.
