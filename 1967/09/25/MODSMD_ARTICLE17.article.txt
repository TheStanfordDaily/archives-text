# Kappa Sigs Reinstated By National
## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of Kap
pa Sigma fraternity, suspended
by its national last spring for
bad faith and non-compliance
with national regulations, has
been reinstated with full privi
leges.
Dan Kirby, Kappa Sigma pres
ident at Stanford, said the house
was technically still on proba
tion.
He explained the national
would not interfere in local chap
ter matters, but an alumni steer
ing committee had been set
up to help the house with any
problems.
He added that the house now
would have to enforce national
rules to keep its standing.
The suspension came last May
after the Kappa Sigs had elected
Rafe Palacio rush chairman.
Palacio, a Negro, had been de
pledged in January, but still
lived in the house.
Kirby explained, "I can under
stand why they thought we
weren't acting in good faith. It
was really a misunderstanding.
I don't think the national was
trying to persecute us."
The house has no plans to
disaffiliate with the national at
present.
