## San Jose State Racial Flare-up Cools 
### CHARLES KITE 
A tense calm has settled over
the San Jose State campus to
day after a week of racial dis
turbances.
Since last Sunday, when a
Negro group demanded sizable
changes in the college's racial
policies, there have already been
charges, countercharges, and
confrontations resulting in
change.
Many of the group's demands
have been met —without vio
lence—including:
• The probation of all 28 fra
ternities and sororities at SJS
for racial bias, pending an in
vestigation of the charges and
development of procedures to
eliminate future discrimination.
None of the 28 have Negro mem
bers.
• The historic appointment of
the nation's first college "om
budsman" position to conduct a
continuous and "aggressive cam
paign against racial discrimina
tion."

• Cancellation of last Satur
day's football game against the
University of Texas at El Paso
because of a threatened sit-in
demonstration during the game.
• The establishment of a four
point program to eliminate bias
in SJS athletics, principally in
team housing and social events.
The crisis began last Monday
when a group of Negroes led by
Associate Sociology Professor,
and former SJS basketball and
track star, Harry Edwards,
handed the college an edict
calling for elimination of bias
in fraternities and sororities,
housing and athletics.
The group, estimated at 75 to
110 Negroes, gave the SJS ad
ministration five days to take
appropriate steps. It was at this
point that the Negro group
threatened to disrupt the foot
ball game.
SJS President Robert D. Clark
moved immediately to answer
the charges. Clark called for a
full-scale public hearing last

Wednesday, and SJS's athletics
director and coaching staff were
ordered to attend. President
Clark also moved at that time
to cancel the game to forestall
any violence.
Reverberations from the
group's edict were swift and
varied. Professor Edwards re
ported 12 threats on his life.
Another Negro graduate stu
dent, Robert Kelly, reported to
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies that he had been threat
ened with being "wiped out" if
he didn't join the ranks of the
United Black Students Associa
tion.
By mid-week, tension had built
to the point that most of the
eleven sororities on campus
were vacant, reportedly because
the girls feared trouble from
"outside agitators." One coed
stated that San Jose police sug
gested the move, but the police
changed their mind after Presi
dent Clark's speech Friday.
Plainclothes police patrolled

the campus Friday, and the San
Jose police reported they had
available 500 officers if needed.
President Clark was criticised
by State Senator Clark L. Brad
ley (R-San Jose) for calling off
the football game, claiming
"they (the Negroes) bluffed and
we fell for it." Bradley also de
manded an investigation of the
threats of campus violence by
the San Jose District Attorney.
Tension began to ease when
the Negro group voted 56-3 Fri
day to accept and support
Clark's new program. Professor
Edwards made the announce
ment at a rally. One of the rea
sons for the support was Presi
dent Clark's promise to use the
college's power to eliminate ra
cial discrimination in off-cam
that the SJS administration is
limited in what it can do with
housing units not under its con
trol.
Clark termed the past week
at SJS "extraordinary and his
toric." He blasted the iong stand
ing abuses at the college: "Prej
udice, bigotry, discrimination on
the basis of race or creed are
insidious, subtle, and pervasive.
Customs, conventions, and hid
den assumptions so determine
our behavior that we are often
unaware of our discriminatory
action. . . . This week should
have pricked our consciences."

Pointing out the effect the is
sue had on the surrounding com
munity, Clark commented, "If it
has evoked our anger, got our
white backs up, I understand
that. The blacks have been an
gry, sometimes intemperate, not
very charitable toward honest
efforts of whites to treat them
as individuals.
Clark continued, "Anger
evokes anger and lack of charity
calls forth hostility. I know
that."
The specific probationary de
tails for SJS fraternities and
sororities was not released. In
the past, just as with Stanford
fraternities, SJS groups have
taken non - discrimination
pledges. When the demonstra
tions pointed out the complete
absence of Negroes in the
houses, Clark gave the system
until Wednesday, November 1,
"to present a plan of action to
implement their declaration that
they do not discriminate."
Repeatedly stating that he was
not "unfriendly toward the fra
ternity and sorority system,"
President Clark pointed out the
proposals must be approved be
fore chapters may prepare for
spring semester rush. "Aboli
tion of the system at SJS would
not be warranted," surmized
Clark.
