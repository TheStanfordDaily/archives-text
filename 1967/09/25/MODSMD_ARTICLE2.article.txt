Stanford's traditional autumn
housing shortage is worse than
ever this year.
Dormitories and fraternities
are completely full, and apart
ments and furnished houses are
unavailable in the Stanford area.
As registration begins some
students have no place to live.
Motels house some; others stay
in camper trucks or sleep out
on lawns. One student, Joel Mc-
Donough, has pitched a tent for
the duration on the Kappa Sig
ma house lawn.
Stanford's 300 new transfer
students and foreign students
are in particularly desperate
straits. They arrived only re
cently and had no opportunity
to make housing arrangements
last spring.
The Stanford Community
Committee for International
Students issued a radio appeal
on radio last week for 100
places for foreign students in
private homes within walking
distance of campus.
Mrs. Lee Elwood of the Stan
ford housing office said transfer
students also needed rooms near
campus since "the majority
have no transportation. "We've
had a terrific number of listings
—25 new ones a day—but stu
dents keep coming in earlier
and earlier to get them."
The housing office has some
listings of rooms in private
homes miles away from campus.
Apartments are readily avail
able no closer to campus than
Cupertino to the south and San
Carlos to the north.
Mike Wyman, a first year
Stanford medical student,

searched without success two
days last week for an apart
ment. "On the first day I
couldn't even find an apartment
to look at. I went through the
Redwood City and Palo Alto pa
pers and found nothing. Every
thing was rented," he said.
Finds Distant Room
Finally Wyman found a one
bedroom apartment seven miles
from campus at $125 a month.
He can't move in until October
1. "I'll live in a hotel until then,"
he said.
A focal point of the housing
search has been the classified ad
pages of the Palo Alto Times.
Lines of up to 100 persons
formed last week as the after
noon paper came off the press
es. A fight broke out during a
struggle to get the first copy,
and the next day papers were
handed out one at a time while
a guard watched.
Some homeless Stanford stu
dents drove to the Times office
each day in a car filled with
their luggage and furniture.
Bill Stone, a first year busi
ness student, finally rented a
four bedroom furnished house
in Mountain View for $350 by
beating the system. In three
days he answered "40 or 50"
apartment ads without success.
Arriving an hour before press
time, one of his friends was first
in line for the day's copy of the
Times. Another friend double
parked a car with engine run
ning outside the Times office. A
third waited in a phone booth
nearby. When the Times was
distributed, Stone's group
