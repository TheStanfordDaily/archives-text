# Durand Girls Out, Displaced Men In
## 
### 
Thirty-one sophomore men
have moved into Durand House,
until this year one of the eight
Row Houses for women.
"We anticipate that Durand
will be returned to women at
the end of this school year,"
said Sally Mahoney, assistant
dean of students for residences.
Fourteen women originally drew
for Durand for this year. Of
them, the six juniors and seniors
have joined Roth House and the
eight sophomores have been as
signed to their second choice
residence.
Pete Hansen, a graduate
business student, will be resi
dent assistant for the new
Durand House.
The decision to convert Du
rand to a men's i-esidence was

made in August when over 50
incoming sophomores were
denied space in Stern Hall. The
shortage of space in Stern re
sulted from the organization of
coeducational living groups in
Stern, Wilbur and Branner halls.
This reduced the spaces avail
able for men in Stern and forced
many more incoming freshmen
to be housed in Stern. Only 12
sophomores were able to move
from Wilbur to Stem.
Durand was picked to make
room for the other sophomore
men, said Miss Mahoney, partly
because it had only 14 girls sign
ed up as residents this fall.
Durand will continue under
the supervision of Miss Cora
Mack, Row House director, and
will continue as a part of the
Row food service.
