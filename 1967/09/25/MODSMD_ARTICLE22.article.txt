# Jayhawks Very Jittery
## Tribe Captures Battle Of Errors 
### NICK SELBY 
"l've never seen a team so ner
vous," said University of Kan
sas football coach Pepper Rod
gers after his Jayhawk squad
had lost to Stanford 21-20 Satur
day in the Stanford Stadium.
That the Jayhawks didn't have
all the poise in the world be
came clearly evident at the start
ing kickoff when Junior Riggins
fumbled to give Stanford the
ball on the Kansas 24.
After that, the Jayhawks lost
the ball twice more on fumbles,
three times on interceptions, and
lost 64 yards on seven penalties,
including an illegal procedure
call which nullified a touchdown
at the end of the first half.
Indian* Cut Mistakes
The Indians weren't complete
ly perfect — four fumbles, live
penalties for 25 yards, and two
interceptions — but they showed
considerable improvement over
their Oregon State performance,
when mistakes resulted in a
13-7 loss.
The outcome of the game be
came clear only after Jayhawk
sophomore Bill Bell missed a
32 yard field goal attempt with
2:09 remaining in the fourth
quarter.
Pressure Forces Miss
Bell's inexperience under pres
sure resulted in his attempt go
ing wide. Both Kansas coach
Rodgers and the officials stated
that the ball was untouched by
Stanford's Don Parish, who ap
peared to have deflected the
ball.
After the missed field goal,
Stanford ran out the clock for
the win in the first grid meeting
of the two schools.
Jayhawk Gift
It appeared that Stanford
might fail to take advantage of
the scoring opportunity at the
start of the game. But the Jay
hawks rushed offside trying to

block Bill Shoemaker's field goal
attempt and the Indians got a
first down on the four.
From there it was all Jack
Root, one of the Tribe's tri-cap
tains, who banged to the one.
He then leaped high over strong
wedge blocking by center Tom
Giallonardo and guards George
Crooks and Phil Messer into the
end zone.
Shoemaker converted for the
extra point and Stanford led 7-0
after 3:28 of play.
Marquess Moves Team
Bob Rinker, a sophomore safe
ty subbing for injured Dave Nel-

son, recovered a fumble on the
Kansas 31 to set up the next
Tribe score.
Card quarterback Mark Mar
quess, named back of the game
for his constant second efforts,
completed two passes to split
end Jim Cross to move the Cards
to the Kansas eight.
Jack Root again banged out
the final yards with plunges
through the center of the line.
Shoemaker's conversion attempt

was good, giving Stanford a 14
point lead.
Riggins Makes Up
Junior Riggins received Shoe
maker's second kickoff after the

first went out of bounds. The
Stanford bomb squad apparently
lost a step after the first kick
and the determined Riggins sail
ed 87 yards for a touchdown.
Bell's PAT was good.
Kansas acquired the ball with
1:41 left in the first half and
Donny Shanklin, a 5'9" flanker,
sprinted G2 yards to the one be
fore John Haygood, a defensive
end, raced back to make a key
tackle.
Penalty Kills Score
Bobby Douglass, the Jayhawk
quarterback, then sneaked the
ball over the goal. However, the
score was nullified by a back il
legally in motion and the Kan
sans had to settle for Bell's 27
yard field goal with five seconds
left.
Donn Renwick, a defensive
halfback, and defensive tackles
Andy Carrigan and Blaine Nye
made key stops to stop Douglass
sweeps during the goal line
stand.
The Cards' defensive spirit
was hailed by coach John Ral
ston, who noted that the Tribe
didn't allow a score from scrim
mage.
Jayhawks Go Ahead
Kansas started the third quar
ter hotter than the prairie sun
to move ahead of the Tribe 17-14.
Bill Shoemaker received Bell's
kickoff after many bounces and
was stopped on the Stanford
two. The Cards couldn't move
and sophomore Bob Reinhard
had to punt.
Don Shanklin, who appears
ready to step into the shoes of
the last "Kansas Comet," Gale
Sayers, started to his left, then
made a swift cutback to the right
sideline for a 47 yard scoring
jaunt.
Bell's conversion was good
with 13:27 remaining in the
third quarter.

But Stanford exploded in turn
to change a usually anemic of
fense into a powerhouse unit.
The publicists' dreams of a "Big
Red Machine" came to life as
the Cards marched 80 yards in
seven plays for the score and
the lead.
Marquess raced for gains of
16 and 15 yards, while Nate Kirt
man burst off left tackle Bob
Shore's block for 30 yards.
Halfback Greg Boughton used
Malcolm Snider and 250 pound
tight end George Beuhler to
great advantage as he broke to
the one. Again Jack Root liter
ally flew into paydirt as Stan
ford led once more.
Deciding Point
Shoemaker converted for his
third PAT and what turned out
to be the deciding point.
Kansas came back with a
drive of its own, but had to
settle for a 28 yard field goal by
Bell after Riggins dropped a
pass while wide open in the end
zone.
Both teams were unable to
move well for the remainder of
the game. Barty Brill intercepted
a Douglass pass after defensive
end Phil Schneider hit the Jay
hawk quarterback to end one
drive.
Needed: Better Tackling
Stanford coach Ralston had
high praise for the Jayhawk
passing threat, terming it far
more dangerous than Oregon
State's.
The Jayhawks gained 130
yards more in the air than Stan
ford, but the Card ground game
moved according to game plan
for a 180 yard advantage.
Ralston was critical of his
team's tackling and also cited a
need for more variation on of
fense.
