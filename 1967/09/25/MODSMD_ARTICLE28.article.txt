# Frosh Swimmers To Awe Foes

### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's freshman swim
ming team plans to make the
Indian varsity earn the respect
commonly deferred to one's
elders, even when the elders hap
pen to be the NCAA champions.
Stanford freshmen-to-be left
searing marks on world swim
ming last season, and don't have
any immediate notions of cool
ing off.
John Ferris cracked Mark
Spitz's world record for 200
meters butterfly with a brilliant
2:06.0 in the World Student
Games in Tokyo last month.
Fruitful Nationals
Ferris' record breaking per
formance in Tokyo followed the
national AAU Outdoor Champ
ionships in which he took sec
ond in the 400 individual medley,
third in the 200 fly, and sixth in
the 200 IM.
Mitch Ivey earned a trip to
Tokyo with seventh place
finishes in both 100 and 200
backstrokes at the Outdoor
AAU's. In Tokyo, Ivey led off
a United States 400 medley re
lay that cracked the 1964 U.S.
Oympic team's world record.
Ivey churned through the 200
back in 2:13.0 at the Student
Games, a time that would have
earned him a bronze medal at
the AAU's. Ivey is also a first

team high school All-American
water poloist.
Haywood AAU Chxunpion
Fred Haywood, a Santa Clara
High School teammate of Ivey's,
surprised the swimming world
last spring when he swam away
with the Indoor AAU Champion
ship in the 100 backstroke.
Haywood's 52.6 has been sur
passed by only one man. Both
Haywood and Ivey chopped
nearly a second off the old high
school record for 100 backstroke.
Brent Berk, a native of Hawaii,
blossomed into a world class
swimmer last summer with the
Santa Clara Swim Club. Berk
is currently on a tour of Eu
rope with a U.S. national team.
Berk barged into the elite
circle of American distance free
stylers at the Outdoor AAU's
charging to a 4:14.9 fourth place
in the 400 meters freestyle and
copping sixth in the 200 in 2:00.0.
Two Best Sprinters
Bob Jamison and Rick Aagle
ston both undercut the national
high school record for 100 free
style (47.7). Jamison, hitting
46.7 for 100 yards, took sixth in
the Indoor AAU's.
Santa Clara High School free
style relay of Jamison, Eagle
ston, Haywood, and Spitz, fired
to a 3:06.8 last spring. The
American record in the event

was 3:07.2 before Stanford shat
tered it with a blistering 3:04.9
NCAA performance.
Jamison led off the Santa
Clara relay in 46.6, Eagleston
was 46.9, Haywood 47.4, and
Spitz 45.7.
Jamie Knorr took giant strides
amonfe the sprinters' ranks last
summer, and Kim Lintner also
looms as a big threat on the
sprint blocks. John Glaser and
Ray Collins have shown great
potential as sprinters.
Anyone for Relays?
The Papooses can field a
couple medley relays that would
make any college coach jittery.
Either Ivey or Haywood lead
off backstroke, and breaststrok
ers Ken Terry or Bob Brower
navigate their course on a par
with the best. Ferris or Palo
Alto's Joe Welsh aren't going to
give anyone a break in the but
terfly leg, and a fleet host of
sprinters waits for an anchor
position.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
plans to enter the freshman
team in the Indoor AAU's next
spring, provided funds for trans
portation can be raised. The 1966
freshman team, with world
record holders Dick Roth and
Luis Nicolao and then-unhealded
Pete Siebert at the throttle, took
third in the AAU's.
