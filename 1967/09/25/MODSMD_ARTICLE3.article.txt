# $1920 Next Year
## Tuition To Be Raised Again 
### PAT McMAHON 
Tuition will be raised again
next year to $1920, and will con
tinue to go up "for two or three
more years," according to Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson.
Cuthbertson cited the "inten
sity of competition for general
labor in the Bay Area," rising
academic salary costs, and "a
job of catching up" in library
improvements as the mapor rea
sons for the increase.
"Tuition covers about 42 per
cent of the total educational
costs of the University. Endow
ment and land development con
tribute 18 percent and gifts
bring in 30 per cent," Cuthbert
son explained.
He explained that the total

educational cost, estimated at
$45 million, does not include fed
eral research grants and con
tracts or auxiliary facilities
such as the University Press,
the athletic programs, dormi
tories, which are essentially self
supporting.
Cuthbertson explained that
the factors determining future
tuition hikes include Stanford's
cost relative to those of other
"comparable private institu
tions," and the availability of
funds for student aid.
He went on to say that Stan
ford "doesn't want to get ahead
(and charge higher tuition than
most), but at the same time, we
can't justify lower tuition in re
lationship to our programs."
The increase, the second in
two years and the eighth since

World War 11, reflects a new
University policy to review tui
tion each year rather than every
two years.
Cuthbertson said that Univer
sity room and board charges

would probably remain the same
($1140) next year.
Cuthbertson first announced
the tuition hike in an August 30
letter to entering freshmen and
their parents.
