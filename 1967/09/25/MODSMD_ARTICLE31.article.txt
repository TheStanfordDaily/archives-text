Stanford's Athletic Depart
ment has designed a new club
sports program to help students
gain the advantages of univer
sity affiliation without surrend
ering control and direction of
the club team to university offi
cials.
The Athletic Department has
created a division of Club teams
under the direction of former
baseball coach Dutch Fehring
to aid organizations with finan
ces, scheduling and transporta
tion, awards, intercollegiate sta
tus, and health insurance pro
tection for the individual.
No Demands
"Under no circumstances will
(the University) tell a club team
that it can't compete or practice
if it hasn't met certain affilia
tion recommendations," says
Fehring.
"For example, if a club team
doesn't have complete insurance
coverage for all contestants, we
will not insist that the team get
it but will help it get coverage
if it wants it,"he concludes.
Tap Experienced Schools
The new program is the result
of a summer o.' vork by Chuck
Taylor, Director of the Athletic
Department, Fehring, and Dr.
Wesley Ruff, Director of Physi
cal Education.
Correspondence with eastern
schools such as Harvard, Prince
ton, and Yale, where club sports
are well established, led to the
composition of a manual which
will be distributed at the club
sports meeting at 7:15, October
3, in the Athletic Departmental
conference room.
The provisions of the manual
call for a faculty advisor, a
coach or coach-manager, and a
secretary-treasurer for each
club. The coach-manager will be
responsible for working with
the athletic department regard
ing financial needs and sche
duling.
The most pressing question
facing club teams every year
is that of financial aid. The De
partment has a limited amount
of funds available, but has sev
eral ideas as to how clubs can
raise money.

Membership dues and on-cam
pus solicitation have been used
in the past, but the department
adds that with permission from
the General-Secretary's office,
off-campus solicitation is pos
sible.

The big aid from the depart
ment will come in the form of
facilities for fund raising af
fairs (i.e. the stadium or the
pavillion for concerts) and sug
gestions toward improving the
financial structure of the club.

By NICK SELBY
Stanford's Athletic Depart
ment has designed a new club
sports program to help students
gain the advantages of univer
sity affiliation without surrend
ering control and direction of
the club team to university offi
cials.
The Athletic Department has
created a division of Club teams
under the direction of former
baseball coach Dutch Fehring
to aid organizations with finan
ces, scheduling and transporta
tion, awards, intercollegiate sta
tus, and health insurance pro
tection for the individual.
No Demands
"Under no circumstances will
(the University) tell a club team
that it can't compete or practice
if it hasn't met certain affilia
tion recommendations," says
Fehring.
"For example, if a club team
doesn't have complete insurance
coverage for all contestants, we
will not insist that the team get
it but will help it get coverage
if it wants it,"he concludes.
