# Stable 4-Year Tuition Rejected As Impractical
## 
### 
The stable cost tuition plan
proposed last year to guarantee
a specific tuition amount for
four years was considered "in
applicable" to Stanford, by the
student - administration Student
Finance Study Group.
The Study group first "fo

cused on the burden of fee in
creases felt by the students and
the difficulty of planning when
unanticipated increases come
along."
It followed with a review of
the financial requirements of
the University and the "guaran
teed" plans used by some liberal
arts colleges. They found that
many "guaranteed" plans were
designed to discourage students
from transferring by charging
them decreasing amounts each
year with the largest sum being
paid during the first year.
The group decided that Uni
versity planning must stay flex
ible within a four year period,
but recommended small annual
increases rather than larger
two year hikes.
In a report prepared by Ken
neth Cuthbertson, vice-president
of finance, the Study Group
came to several other conclu
sions:
• "University information bul
letins should be more explicit
about the likelihood of regular
increases in tuition and in room
and board fees.
• "Students recipients of fi
nancial aid should be directly re
assured that they will be further
assisted to the extent of fee in
creases, adjusted to any changes
in their financial need situation.
• "Procedures for deferring
fee payments should be im
proved to allow a spreading of
these payments so as to ease the
burden of large outlays.
• "The policy of limiting fee

increases to those which can be
accompanied by equivalent in
creases to maintain or improve
the existing student aid pro
gram is desirable.
The University has acted on
the proposals and has revised
University publications, estab
lished a deferred tuition plan,
and decided to review tuition an
nually.
The Study Group grew out of
an ASSU Legislature resolution
to consider a stable cost plan.
Cuthbertson commented, "The
initiative and advice of the stu
dents in this Study . . . has in
creased our sensitivity to the fi
nancial problems felt by stu
dents and their families."
Students involved in the Study
Group were Byron Wood, Chris
Harte, Gail Anderson, and Craig
Venator. Administrators in
