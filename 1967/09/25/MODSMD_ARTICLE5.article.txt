# Hitch Named
## UC Gets New President 
### 
After eight months of indeci
sion and speculation the Univer
sity of California has a presi
dent at last. Charles J. Hitch,
a 57 year old economist brought
to UC by former president Clark
Kerr 2% years ago, was named
the university's 13th president
Friday at a meeting in Los
Angeles.
Hitch's appointment came as
a surprise for he had not been
one of those who had drawn (na
tional attention as a contender
for president of the 9-campus
university system. Current spec
ulation is that his appointment
marks a new era of careful
economy for the university.
As number two man in the
university administration under
Kerr, Hitch had charge of co
ordinating its vast administra
tive network. He had chaired

several important committees,
including one dealing with bud
gets.
Further Decentralization
Following his appointment,
Hitch declared his belief in in
dividual campus autonomy and
decentralization. He promised to
follow the course along such
lines previously laid down by
Kerr. Hitch, however, said some
matters require "firm guidance
and control to carry on an eco
nomic administration." Hitch in
dicated that one area of economy
might be a changeover from
individual campus purchasing
agency.
Acting President Harry R.
Wellman, who had been sche
duled to retire this summer,
announced his retirement effec
tive December 31. Hitch will take
over on January 1.

Student reaction at the Uni
versity of California, Berkeley,
was that of surprise. Daily Cali
fornian Editor Karlyn Barker
said that "Kerr and Brown ap
parently approve of his appoint
ment, but I know so little about
him that I must view it with
reservations."
"It's nice to have a president
to start off the centennial year,
but we hadn't expected to have
an appointment until January.
... We had expected somebody
more nationally known — some
one "off-campus" so to speak,"
she concluded.
Reagan Approves
Governor Ronald Reagan ap
parently had no knowledge of
the selection of Hitch until his
appointment was announced.
He added later, however, that
