# Lyman's Letter To Freshmen Barred From Pre-Reg Packet
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
University officials refused to
include a letter from Associated
Students President Peter Lyman
in a mailing of pre-registration
information to freshmen in July.
Eventually the letter was
mailed separately from the Pre-
Reg "packet" on Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University
(ASSU) stationery.
The three-page letter was writ
ten at the request of Pre-Reg
Co-chairman Peter Haas, who
asked Lyman to introduce fresh
men to "some of the ideas on
educational experience" ex
pressed in his campaign for pres
ident.
In the letter Lyman criticized
conformity, the older generation,
American society and Stanford
in discussing his theme, "each
individual must educate him
self."
The letter has reportedly at
tracted irate telephone calls and
letters from parents of freshmen
who objected to its contents or
mistakenly thought it was from
the University itself.

At first the University would
not permit his letter to be mailed
at all, according to Lyman, but
after heated arguments and a
show-down meeting of adminis
trators and students officials, the
University agreed to to release
the addresses of freshmen so the
letter could be sent in a separate
ASSU mailing.
'Context' Worries Smith
Joel Smith, dean of students,
told The Daily that the letter was
excluded from the pre-reg packet
because "there was a question
whether this was appropriate in
the context of a pre-registration
mailing, which is an informative
and official mailing as far as the
recipients are concerned. We had
a serious doubt as to whether it
was appropriate in that context."
Smith added that the Univers
ity objected not to the contents
of the letter but only to the cir
cumstances under which it
would be sent.
The pre-reg packet contained
the Freshman Handbook, wel
coming letters from Pre-Reg
Chairmen Haas and Sandy Shap

iro, transportation information,
a program, a book list and bag
gage suggestions.
Lyman said he learned of
Smith's decision in July not to
mail the letter in a telephone
call from Haas. "I was not in
formed directly by the adminis
tration," he added.
University officials did not ask
him to delete parts of the letter,
said Lyman, but refused to allow
it to be sent to freshmen at all.
"No member of the University
administration was ever able to
give me a justification for this
censorship," he said, adding that
they did tell him the letter was
"too strong to go into freshman
homes."
Eventually, at a meeting of Ly
man, Tom Forstenzer, summer
session ASSU President, Smith,
Provost .Richard W. Lyman, and
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer, it
was agreed that the University
would allow the Pre-Reg com
mission to use the addressograph
machine in the dean of student's
office to send the letter on ASSU
stationery.
Invites Co-letter
Lyman said he invited any
member of the administration
to send a letter along with his
to present another view of edu
cation. The invitation was con
sidered but finally declined, ac
cording to Lyman.
Lyman said the incident raises
"two issues."
The first is "academic free
dom in a university," he said. "I
was very surprised that a so
callod new liberal administra
tion should engage in direct cen
sorship."
The second issue, according to
Lyman, is "ASSU financing and
independence from the dean's
office." He points out that the
pre-reg mailing was an ASSU
project financed by ASSU funds,
yet the dean's office "intervened
directly."
Lyman, 26, is a graduate stu
dent in political science who
won the ASSU presidential elec
tion in May on a platform of
radical educational change.
His letter, addressed "Dear
friend," started by asking the

freshmen to "question every
thing, regardless of the conse
quences of that questioning."
He said that students must over
come the barriers that society
and universities put in the way
of free inquiry.
The letter concluded with the
lyrics of Beatle George Harri
son's song, "Within You and
Without You," and a suggested
reading list on "contemporary
student issues," which included
books on education, Vietnam,
civil rights and the draft.

The letter included these state
ments :
"... Stanford, and most Uni
versities, serves the vested in
terests of our society before it
serves the needs of education."
'*... It is the fate and tragedy
of such conformity which leads
our parent's generation, and our
culture, not to know the mean
ing of their own lives. ..."
Lyman said the incident will
cause no difficulties in his per
sonal dealings with University
officials.

The second issue, according to
Lyman, is "ASSU financing and
independence from the dean's
office." He points out that the
pre-reg mailing was an ASSU
project financed by ASSU funds,
yet the dean's office "intervened
directly."
Lyman, 26, is a graduate stu
dent in political science who
won the ASSU presidential elec
tion in May on a platform of
radical educational change.
His letter, addressed "Dear
friend," started by asking the

freshmen to "question every
thing, regardless of the conse
quences of that questioning."
He said that students must over
come the barriers that society
and universities put in the way
of free inquiry.
The letter concluded with the
lyrics of Beatle George Harri
son's song, "Within You and
Without You," and a suggested
reading list on "contemporary
student issues," which included
books on education, Vietnam,
civil rights and the draft.

The letter included these state
ments :
"... Stanford, and most Uni
versities, serves the vested in
terests of our society before it
serves the needs of education."
'*... It is the fate and tragedy
of such conformity which leads
our parent's generation, and our
culture, not to know the mean
ing of their own lives. ..."
Lyman said the incident will
cause no difficulties in his per
sonal dealings with University
officials.
University officials refused to
include a letter from Associated
Students President Peter Lyman
in a mailing of pre-registration
information to freshmen in July.
Eventually the letter was
mailed separately from the Pre-
Reg "packet" on Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University
(ASSU) stationery.
The three-page letter was writ
ten at the request of Pre-Reg
Co-chairman Peter Haas, who
asked Lyman to introduce fresh
men to "some of the ideas on
educational experience" ex
pressed in his campaign for pres
ident.
In the letter Lyman criticized
conformity, the older generation,
American society and Stanford
in discussing his theme, "each
individual must educate him
self."
The letter has reportedly at
tracted irate telephone calls and
letters from parents of freshmen
who objected to its contents or
mistakenly thought it was from
the University itself.

At first the University would
not permit his letter to be mailed
at all, according to Lyman, but
after heated arguments and a
show-down meeting of adminis
trators and students officials, the
University agreed to to release
the addresses of freshmen so the
letter could be sent in a separate
ASSU mailing.
'Context' Worries Smith
Joel Smith, dean of students,
told The Daily that the letter was
excluded from the pre-reg packet
because "there was a question
whether this was appropriate in
the context of a pre-registration
mailing, which is an informative
and official mailing as far as the
recipients are concerned. We had
a serious doubt as to whether it
was appropriate in that context."
Smith added that the Univers
ity objected not to the contents
of the letter but only to the cir
cumstances under which it
would be sent.
The pre-reg packet contained
the Freshman Handbook, wel
coming letters from Pre-Reg
Chairmen Haas and Sandy Shap

iro, transportation information,
a program, a book list and bag
gage suggestions.
Lyman said he learned of
Smith's decision in July not to
mail the letter in a telephone
call from Haas. "I was not in
formed directly by the adminis
tration," he added.
University officials did not ask
him to delete parts of the letter,
said Lyman, but refused to allow
it to be sent to freshmen at all.
"No member of the University
administration was ever able to
give me a justification for this
censorship," he said, adding that
they did tell him the letter was
"too strong to go into freshman
homes."
Eventually, at a meeting of Ly
man, Tom Forstenzer, summer
session ASSU President, Smith,
Provost .Richard W. Lyman, and
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer, it
was agreed that the University
would allow the Pre-Reg com
mission to use the addressograph
machine in the dean of student's
office to send the letter on ASSU
stationery.
Invites Co-letter
Lyman said he invited any
member of the administration
to send a letter along with his
to present another view of edu
cation. The invitation was con
sidered but finally declined, ac
cording to Lyman.
Lyman said the incident raises
"two issues."
The first is "academic free
dom in a university," he said. "I
was very surprised that a so
callod new liberal administra
tion should engage in direct cen
sorship."

mail the letter in a telephone
call from Haas. "I was not in
formed directly by the adminis
tration," he added.
University officials did not ask
him to delete parts of the letter,
said Lyman, but refused to allow
it to be sent to freshmen at all.
"No member of the University
administration was ever able to
give me a justification for this
censorship," he said, adding that
they did tell him the letter was
"too strong to go into freshman
homes."
Eventually, at a meeting of Ly
man, Tom Forstenzer, summer
session ASSU President, Smith,
Provost .Richard W. Lyman, and
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer, it
was agreed that the University
would allow the Pre-Reg com
mission to use the addressograph
machine in the dean of student's
office to send the letter on ASSU
stationery.
Invites Co-letter
Lyman said he invited any
member of the administration
to send a letter along with his
to present another view of edu
cation. The invitation was con
sidered but finally declined, ac
cording to Lyman.
Lyman said the incident raises
"two issues."
The first is "academic free
dom in a university," he said. "I
was very surprised that a so
callod new liberal administra
tion should engage in direct cen
sorship."
The second issue, according to
Lyman, is "ASSU financing and
independence from the dean's
office." He points out that the
pre-reg mailing was an ASSU
project financed by ASSU funds,
yet the dean's office "intervened
directly."
Lyman, 26, is a graduate stu
dent in political science who
won the ASSU presidential elec
tion in May on a platform of
radical educational change.
His letter, addressed "Dear
friend," started by asking the

freshmen to "question every
thing, regardless of the conse
quences of that questioning."
He said that students must over
come the barriers that society
and universities put in the way
of free inquiry.
The letter concluded with the
lyrics of Beatle George Harri
son's song, "Within You and
Without You," and a suggested
reading list on "contemporary
student issues," which included
books on education, Vietnam,
civil rights and the draft.

The letter included these state
ments :
"... Stanford, and most Uni
versities, serves the vested in
terests of our society before it
serves the needs of education."
'*... It is the fate and tragedy
of such conformity which leads
our parent's generation, and our
culture, not to know the mean
ing of their own lives. ..."
Lyman said the incident will
cause no difficulties in his per
sonal dealings with University
officials.
