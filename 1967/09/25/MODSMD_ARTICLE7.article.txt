# Breakers To Pay Old Debt To ICC
## 
### 
Breakers Eating Club will
start paying off $2,600 in debts
accumulated last year when the
club almost went bankrupt.
Under a May 10 agreement be
tween Breakers and the Inter
club Council (ICC), which is
Breakers' creditor, the club will
reduce its debt by $150 this quar
ter, by $225 winter quarter, and
by $300 in every succeeding
quarter until the debt is paid.
Breakers also agreed to end
its casual policy on board bills,
which officials of Breakers and
the ICC agreed was the cause
of the club's financial straits.
Members who eat only a few
meals a week must now pay a
minimum of $45 per quarter in
dues. Last year members were
permitted to buy as few as two
meals a week and pay $30 or
less in dues.
In autumn quarter of 1968,
Breakers members will have to
pay at least $90 in dues.
"To assure continuing support
of their deficit position," in the
words of the agreement with the
ICC, Breakers must also make
new members "aware of their
liability for an assessment nec
essary to assure no further loss
es." Also, Breakers must estab
lish deadlines for payment of
members dues.
Technically, the club is under
the controllership of ICC Gen

eral Manager Edward E. Shaw
until the debt is paid.
Jim Mcßae, Breakers presi
dent, claimed the club has
enough members this quarter to
meet its obligations with reason
able full-board dues while serv
ing "top quality food." He said
the club will continue to offer
partial board plans, including a
five lunches per week plan. The
club has no social dues. It abol
ished selective rush in 1966, and
membership is open to all fac
ulty, staff and students.
Breakers sank into debt —
once it owed the ICC nearly
$5,000 — because of lax finan
cial management that reflects
the "hang-loose" reputation of
the club.
Breakers was one of the first
men's groups to admit women
members. Last spring it invited
staff members to join. Accord
ing to the 1967 Rush Book en
try, the club's average is "Un
known, since members are free
to join or leave at any time."
"Nobody pays much attention
to money," said a former mem
ber, who told of how another
member ran up $500 in unpaid
board bills last year and then
quit the club.
"Our financial problems are
the result of not requiring mem
bers to eat all their meals at the
club," said Carl Treseder, for
mer Breakers president. "We
had as few as 15 or 20 full
board people. Last fall our busi
ness manager was ill and we
didn't realize we were getting
in debt." The club had a high
turnover of its membership au
tumn quarter of 1966.
About forty full-board mem
bers are necessary for an eat
ing club to break even. In the
past Breakers usually had few
er than 40 full-board members
but a large number of members
with partial board plans.
Breakers Owed $4,951
By December 31, 1966, Break
ers owed the ICC $4,951. The
club had accumulated about
$4,000 in unpaid board bills,
some a year old. Breakers lost
$920 more during winter quar
ter, 1967, out of a total budget
of $8,645.
Then the ICC cracked down.
A special assessment was made
on all Breakers members in or
der to repay the $920 deficit of
winter quarter. Breakers agreed
to cover any future deficits by
special assessments, and made
assessments to cover another de
ficit spring quarter. ICC Gen
eral Manager Shaw says a

"hold" was issued August 31 on
the grades of all returning
Breakers members who have
not paid back assessments.
To help pay its debts, Break
ers undertook a membership
drive, including the invitation to
staff members, and sponsored a
dance and art show. The club
agreed to reduce its food spend
ing to a spartan $350 a week in
spring quarter.
Breakers President Mcßae
said all limitations on food
spending have been removed.
"Breakers offers the best food
on campus," he asserted. No
special assessments will be nec
essary in the future, he said.
Breakers financial problems
are not unique. Two of the oth
er six eating clubs also owe the
ICC money.
The seven eating clubs pay
fixed expenses such as rent and
cooks' salaries collectively
through the ICC business man
ager's office. Each club pays the
same amount for these fixed ex
penses .about $3,000 per quar
ter. The rest of the clubs' budg
ets go for food, social expenses,
and miscellaneous expenses.
Last year the clubs each charged
from $210 to $235 for board,
about the same as board in Uni
versity residences.
