# New Street Closings Force Traffic To Take Wider Circle

Barricades have gone up
across Lomita Dr. and Galvez
St., as the campus's academic
areas come a step closer to being
a "gigantic pedestrian preserve"
— the words of University Plan
ner Oscar Nelson.
Both street closures were
made early in September. Ac
cording to the Planning Office,
the Galvez St. closure was made
to improve pedestrian safety
for students passing between
their dormitories and the Quad.
Reflective posts set between
Crothers Hall and the main li
brary parking lot have provided
a pedestrian crosswalk.
Lomita Dr., now closed be
tween Serra and Panama Sts.
is being converted to Lomita
Mall, a pedestrian and bicycle
area similar to White Plaza.

Decorative lawns, lights and a
tentatively planned water fea

between the western end of the
Outer Quad and the Physics Lec
ture Hall.
A similar area to be called
Escondido Mall, is under con

of Outer Quad and the Engineer
ing Buildings.
New Roads Eventually
Immediate student concern
focuses on the extra distance
and inconvenience the street
closures have added to a trip
between Stanford and Palo Alto.
Under the University's long
range traffic plan, however, those
distances will be even greater,
although faster and less incon
venient.
Eventually a four-lane Cam

pus Dr. will form a ring road
about the campus, passing be
hind Lake Lagunita and further
west of campus than at present.
The new Campus Dr. sections
east of Branner and Wilbur
Halls and between Toyon Hall
and the gymnasium construc
tion site are part of this plan
ned ring road.
Planner Nelson describes the
current conditions as "living in
a house that is being remodeled.
You must put up with the dust,
dirt and inconvenience in hopes
that the final product will be
an improvement."
According to Nelson, Stan
ford's problem is that of re
modeling an old house instead
of building a new one. The Uni
versity, he says, has decided
that the automobile is a less
