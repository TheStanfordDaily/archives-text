# New Street Closings Force Traffic To Take Wider Circle
## 
### HERBERT TERRY 
Barricades have gone up
across Lomita Dr. and Galvez
St., as the campus's academic
areas come a step closer to being
a "gigantic pedestrian preserve"
â€” the words of University Plan
ner Oscar Nelson.
Both street closures were
made early in September. Ac
cording to the Planning Office,
the Galvez St. closure was made
to improve pedestrian safety
for students passing between
their dormitories and the Quad.
Reflective posts set between
Crothers Hall and the main li
brary parking lot have provided
a pedestrian crosswalk.
Lomita Dr., now closed be
tween Serra and Panama Sts.
is being converted to Lomita
Mall, a pedestrian and bicycle
area similar to White Plaza.

Decorative lawns, lights and a
tentatively planned water fea
ture will complement the area
between the western end of the
Outer Quad and the Physics Lec
ture Hall.
A similar area to be called
Escondido Mall, is under con
struction between the south side
of Outer Quad and the Engineer
ing Buildings.
New Roads Eventually
Immediate student concern
focuses on the extra distance
and inconvenience the street
closures have added to a trip
between Stanford and Palo Alto.
Under the University's long
range traffic plan, however, those
distances will be even greater,
although faster and less incon
venient.
Eventually a four-lane Cam

pus Dr. will form a ring road
about the campus, passing be
hind Lake Lagunita and further
west of campus than at present.
The new Campus Dr. sections
east of Branner and Wilbur
Halls and between Toyon Hall
and the gymnasium construc
tion site are part of this plan
ned ring road.
Planner Nelson describes the
current conditions as "living in
a house that is being remodeled.
You must put up with the dust,
dirt and inconvenience in hopes
that the final product will be
an improvement."
According to Nelson, Stan
ford's problem is that of re
modeling an old house instead
of building a new one. The Uni
versity, he says, has decided
that the automobile is a less
efficient means of student trans
portation than bicycling or walk
ing.
"We have to run roads around
existing buildings and continue
to provide vehicular access for
services and emergencies. Our
job is more difficult and, because
it changes the status quo, more
likely to produce bad feelings,"
he continued.
The Lomita Mall project has
eliminated about 150 off-campus
and faculty parking places.

Three new parking lots are be
ing built and another lot ex
panded in an effort to make up
for these losses.
A lot for 150 cars is now under
construction between the Or
ganic Chemistry Building and
the Medical School. North of
there a 250 car lot is also being
added. South of the Medical
School a third lot with a 300 car
capacity is nearing completion.
The lot south of the Medical
School is being expanded by 175
parking places.

All of these lots, however, are
in the northwest corner of the
campus. Additional parking is
being temporarily provided on
a vacant Salvatierra St. lot be
tween Campus Dr. and the Post
Office. The expansion of existing
lots near the Pavilion and Wom
en's Gym is under study. With
the December completion of
lots now under construction
there will be a net gain of 750
parking places.

Barricades like this one have added many precious minutes to the time it takes to drive from one
side of the campus to the other. Thus, more people must resort to walking and riding bicycles. This
is called progress.
