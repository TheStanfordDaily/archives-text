I JESUS CHRIST IS LORD I
"Jesus Christ is Lord." This is the earliest and simplest formula
tion of the message of Christianity. We members of Stanford
Christian Fellowship are students who have committed ourselves
to Jesus Christ and are actively seeking to understand and follow
As a group we are working out the implications of Jesus's life,
death and resurrection for our lives. We are convinced that anyone
who opens his eyes and looks at the world will see that it is full of
poverty, injustive, anxiety and apathy: Jesus Christ taught that
these conditions exist because men are alienated from God. We
believe that the essential message of Jesus was not that there is
a heaven after death, but that "The Kingdom of God is at hand."
By placing our faith in Jesus Christ we have begun to take part in
a revolutionary spiritual relationship with God.
We hold that God has expressed His love for mankind in the
life of Jesus and that we, His followers, should both explain and
demonstrate this love to those around us. This means going beyond
an impartial consideration of the issues of religion and becoming
involved in direct action to meet the needs of a world which is in
physical and spiritual anguish. Stanford Christian Fellowship is led
by students and recognizes no denominational distinctions between
Christians.
In the course of their university experience many students aban
don the traditional Christian concept of faith in God. We have, by
contrast, found our deepest intellectual and spiritual aspirations
fulfilled in the teachings of Jesus Christ. We cordially invite all
interested students to join us as we meet this quarter to gain a
clearer understanding of Christ as he is described in the New Testa-
