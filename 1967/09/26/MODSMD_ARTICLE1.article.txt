# Board Lifts Late Leave Restriction
## 
### 
All quotas on women's late
leaves except for those for first
quarter freshmen have been re
moved, according to the latest
statement of women's sign-out
procedures issued by the Dean
of Students' Office.
Freshman women are limited
to twenty-five 2:30 a.m. late
leaves during their first quarter
of residence. The reason for this
restriction on a first quarter
freshman is that "she lacks ex
perience with the academic de
mands of the University, with
dormitory living conditions, and
with the social patterns of Stan
ford," says the statement.
No Limit
After first quarter, freshman
and sophomore women have no
limits on late leaves. Juniors and
seniors may take 6:00 a.m. late
leaves.
The information requested on
the sign-out list will only be the
expected time of return. Addi
tional information may be given,
but will not be required. On an
overnight, women must leave
enough information so she may
be reached by phone.
"The mechanics of sign-out
should fit the needs of the resi
dence area," according to the
statement. "Any other workable
system, which takes into account
the requirements of the policy,
may be substituted after discus
sion with the Dean of Students'
office."
These new procedures were
discussed at the Board of Trus
tees' meeting last week. Full in
formation on exactly how sign
out procedures will work will be
announced today.
