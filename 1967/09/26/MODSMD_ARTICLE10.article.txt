## A 						Joke On Frosh? 
### 
Editor, The Daily;
The joke is on us.
Last Thursday we were seated
in Memorial Auditorium. After a
brief delay, the speakers were
introduced. We listened atten
tively as they told us the impor
tance of the critical thought
process in education. We were
told to think for ourselves, to
question every statement and to
finally establish our own view
point on the basis of fact and
logic.
The speeches concluded with
several value judgments and an
occasional generality regarding
controversial issues. Our ap
plause was heart-felt and gen
erous, a profound demcyistration
of our newfound capacity to
think critically.

• Escondido Parking
Editor, The Daily:
On Tuesday, September 19, we
distributed a statement to all
residents of Escondido Village.
We hoped to enlist support for
a protest against the ludicrous
policy of charging Escondido
Village residents $10 per year
for a parking sticker. In reality,
the parking sticker only enables
us to park in the numbered stalls
in front of our homes — it pro
vides no special parking privi
leges in the central campus
area.
Moreover, the money collected
from the parking fees does not
directly benefit Escondido Vil
lage residents. According to the
Comptroller's Office, all this
money goes solely for campus
road maintenance. Thus we, who
are requested to leave our cars
at home and not drive to the
central campus area, are paying
for the maintenance of roads we
rarely use. Ironically, major
users of these roads — the Ad
ministration, the Faculty, and
the Staff — pay nothing for the
privilege of parking in the cen
tral campus area.
We feel that intelligent uni
versity planning would discour
age use of automobiles in the
central campus area. As Police
Chief Davis admits, rush hour
congestion is already a major
problem. Therefore we agree
that those who drive their cars
to classes and offices should pay
for this privilege. Since, how
ever, the parking areas in Es
condido Village are fringe areas,
isolated from the central cam
pus, and unaffected by conges
tion, they cannot be included in
the same category as the central
campus parking areas. Indeed,
there is a vital distinction to be
made here. We drive a block or
two off the public roads to our
homes — others drive from their
homes to classes or offices in
the congested area. The point is
that while we do not mind walk
ing or cycling to class, we do
object to paying for the right to
park in front of our homes. In
deed, we are already paying for
that privilege in our rent.
Apparently some University
Administrator realized there was
a potential $10,000 laying fallow
in Escondido Village and the
high -rise apartments. Conse
quently, those who use the roads I

the least, and are the least able
to pay for them, are required
under penalty of fine to subsi
dize their maintenance.

Editor, The Daily;
Yesterday The Daily printed
an article on Breakers Eating
Club. Unfortunately it was neith
er accurate nor current. The in
formation used was obtained
last Spring from Winter Quar
ter figures and The Daily made
no effort to contact the current
leadership. In fact the two mem
bers quoted were never inter
viewed. Had we been extended
the usual editorial courtesy of
reviewing an article about our
selves we would have been able
to correct at least the following
inaccuracies:
1. Several incidents occurring
in the past several years were
indiscriminately attributed to
last year.
2. We are members of the ICC
as are all eating clubs, no more
under its controllership than the
other six.
3. We have no "dues" as im
plied in The Daily. Members are
charged for meals only.
4. Partial board plans are still
available to fit the particular
needs of the individual — not

just the "5 lunches a week" plan,
whatever that is.
5. We were the first club to
admit women and graduate stu
dents — about Va of our mem
bers are graduates, % are wom
en.
6. It is unlikely the future was
revealed to Jim Mcßea, regard
ing our standing this quarter, as
early as last Spring — especially
since it must have passed
through his person without his
knowledge.
7. Jim was incorrectly titled
President of Breakers — an of
fice which does not currently
exist. By the clubs decision we
have two co-presidents, one of
each sex, more commonly known
as King and Queen.
We hope that The Daily's in
accuracies have not misled any
one concerning Breaker's opera
tion. We would like to invite any
one interested in good food on
campus to drop by.

NOTE —We apologize for call
ing Mcßae 'President' and not
'King.' Otherwise, The Daily
maintains that the quotations
and information on Breaker's
indebtedness were accurate.
Nevertheless we defend to the
death the right of the above
signed persons to accuse us of
misinformation and question
our integrity.—M.S.
