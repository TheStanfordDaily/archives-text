# The 						Capitol Scene
## Kicking The Petting Habit 
### Art Buchwald 
Washington—One of the most
interesting decisions in Ameri
can jurisprudence is now being
tossed around in the U.S. Court
of Appeals in Washington. The
outcome could directly affect
every GI now in his country's
service. The question involved
is whether an ex-GI who had
become used to necking and
petting while he was in the mili
tary service had the legal right
to continue this activity in civi
lian life without getting fired
from the FBI.
The veteran involved was a
26-year-old clerk named Thomas
Carter, who kept a girl over
night in his apartment. Carter,
in sworn testimony, said he did
nothing but "neck" and "spoon,"
but J. Edgar Hoover said his
conduct was unbecoming an em
ployee of the FBI.
While taking testimony the
other day, Judge Harold Leven
thal seemed to be on the side
of a veteran's "right to neck"
law. He pointed out that under
a uniform military training act,
a returning serviceman must be
given a chance to adjust to civil
ian life and that necking and
spooning is just something an
ex-GI cannot forget overnight.
He felt the FBI had not given
Carter, who had just been dis
charged from the Air Force,
enough time to get over his pre
dilection for girls.
But the government's attorney
argued that by having a girl
stay overnight Carter compro
prised the reputation of the
FBI.
The decision in the case hasn't
been rendered as yet and of
course there is much to be said
for both sides.
To me the fault lies neither
with Carter nor the FBI. The
blame should be placed on the
military who allow our Ameri
can boys to go around necking,
spooning and smooching, know
ing full well that once a GI goes
down that path it is almost im
possible for him to return to
live a clean, healthy, normal life
in the Federal Bureau of Inves
tigation.
Our Gls receive absolutely no
instruction on the evils of pet
ting. Most of them are led to be
lieve that premartial necking is
a good thing, and I'm ashamed
to say that in some extreme
cases soldiers and sailors have
been known to stay up all night

with a girl. Is it no wonder that
with this type of training the
discharged GI is unable to adjust
to the civilian life where the code
of behavior of American men
and women is so different?
The mistake, it seems to me,
is that our military services are
discharging our men without
thought to the way they're go
ing to behave when they get out.
There should be some sort of
course given to every GI before
he is discharged. He must be in

structed on how to kick his pet
ting habits. He should be put in
a decompression tank for two
weeks so the shock of giving up
necking would not be too tough
on his nervous system. Eventual
ly the GI would realize that what
is socially acceptable in the ser
vice does not necessarily carry
over to civilian life.
I sincerely believe that had
the Air Force provided such a
course for Carter he would never
have had to tangle with J. Ed

gar Hoover in the Court of Ap
peals today.
I speak with personal knowl
edge and great sympathy for
Carter's cause. The only reason
that I'm not an FBI agent my
self is that I could never stop
smooching once I got my dis
charge from the U.S. Marine
Corps at the end of World War
11.

of behavior of American men
and women is so different?
The mistake, it seems to me,
is that our military services are
discharging our men without
thought to the way they're go
ing to behave when they get out.
There should be some sort of
course given to every GI before
he is discharged. He must be in

structed on how to kick his pet
ting habits. He should be put in
a decompression tank for two
weeks so the shock of giving up
necking would not be too tough
on his nervous system. Eventual
ly the GI would realize that what
is socially acceptable in the ser
vice does not necessarily carry
over to civilian life.
I sincerely believe that had
the Air Force provided such a
course for Carter he would never
have had to tangle with J. Ed

gar Hoover in the Court of Ap
peals today.
I speak with personal knowl
edge and great sympathy for
Carter's cause. The only reason
that I'm not an FBI agent my
self is that I could never stop
smooching once I got my dis
charge from the U.S. Marine
Corps at the end of World War
11.

Washington—One of the most
interesting decisions in Ameri
can jurisprudence is now being
tossed around in the U.S. Court
of Appeals in Washington. The
outcome could directly affect
every GI now in his country's
service. The question involved
is whether an ex-GI who had
become used to necking and
petting while he was in the mili
tary service had the legal right
to continue this activity in civi
lian life without getting fired
from the FBI.
The veteran involved was a
26-year-old clerk named Thomas
Carter, who kept a girl over
night in his apartment. Carter,
in sworn testimony, said he did
nothing but "neck" and "spoon,"
but J. Edgar Hoover said his
conduct was unbecoming an em
ployee of the FBI.
While taking testimony the
other day, Judge Harold Leven
thal seemed to be on the side
of a veteran's "right to neck"
law. He pointed out that under
a uniform military training act,
a returning serviceman must be
given a chance to adjust to civil
ian life and that necking and
spooning is just something an
ex-GI cannot forget overnight.
He felt the FBI had not given
Carter, who had just been dis
charged from the Air Force,
enough time to get over his pre
dilection for girls.
But the government's attorney
argued that by having a girl
stay overnight Carter compro
prised the reputation of the
FBI.
The decision in the case hasn't
been rendered as yet and of
course there is much to be said
for both sides.
To me the fault lies neither
with Carter nor the FBI. The
blame should be placed on the
military who allow our Ameri
can boys to go around necking,
spooning and smooching, know
ing full well that once a GI goes
down that path it is almost im
possible for him to return to
live a clean, healthy, normal life
in the Federal Bureau of Inves
tigation.
Our Gls receive absolutely no
instruction on the evils of pet
ting. Most of them are led to be
lieve that premartial necking is
a good thing, and I'm ashamed
to say that in some extreme
cases soldiers and sailors have
been known to stay up all night

with a girl. Is it no wonder that
with this type of training the
discharged GI is unable to adjust
to the civilian life where the code
of behavior of American men
and women is so different?
