## Uniquack Speaks Out 
### Robert E. Stone 
A year had passed since this
erstwhile columnist journeyed
to Washington to consult Uni
quack and many people sug
gested that a return trip was in
order. With their urgings ring
ing in our ears, we traipsed
off to the Capital City, and
through the courtesy of James
Reston of the New York Times,
Uniquack's manager, we were
once again allowed to question
the huge machine.
We found Uniquack just as
we had a year before, strug
gling valiantly to find the key
to DeGaulle's political actions.
(Can no one figure that man
out?)
Interrupting the machine as it
was about to try and digest the
reports of DeGaulle's recent trip
to Canada, we asked it several
questions which had been pre
pared in advance.
Q: Hello, machine.
A: Hello, columnist.
Q: We'd like to ask you some
questions about Stanford.
A. Sure thing.
Q: What has been the biggest
change at Stanford in the past
year?
A: The politics of the Univers
ity. It appears that the students
have come full circle from activ
ism to conservatism.
Q: But there are still plenty
of activists.
A: Yes, but their numbers are
dwindling. Look at the Vietniks.
Everyone is tired of hearing
them. It has become obvious
that all the demonstrations in
the world aren't going to change
Johnson's mind. Also the stu
dent activists. Last year they
were screaming for academic re
form, off-campus living for wo
men, and co-ed dormitories.
They now have the second and
third, and the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford is coming to
grips with the first. Since it
won't be for another two years
before SES makes its recom
mendations, critics of academic
life will have to keep quiet. If
they say anything, the adminis
tration can say, "SES is study
ing it."
Q: You have a point, but how
can you say that the politics
have become conservative?
A: Let's take, for example,
the new head yell leader. At
Saturday's game against Kan
sas his cheers were hardly in
spiring, let alone active. I've
heard better at local highschool
games. This is typical of the
new Stanford attitude which
paraphrased might say, "If you
want to cheer, go ahead, but
don't expect me to lead you."
Q: Could you give us another
example of this conservatism?
A: How about the Editor of
the Daily, Kirk Hanson?
Q: What about him?
A: For years the standing
joke in the Daily office has been
President Sterling's edge of
greatness. Now, not only is the
Editor a close friend of Sterling,
but he believes that the adminis
tration has the best interests of
the students in mind at all
times. I'm not saying that he's
wrong, I'm just saying that's
quite a switch from the old
days.
Q: How about student poli
tics?

A: It's a bit too early to pro
ject results, but I think the new
ASSU President is in for a lot
of hard knocks.
Q: Why do you think so?
A: As I said it's still too early
to tell for sure, but what figures
I do have indicate that more and
more the President's job is be
ing handled by the Vice-Presi
dent.
Q: So?
A: It's not necessarily bad;
most people, however, like to
feel that they're dealing with
the boss. Being shunted off,
even to the number-two man,
might annoy them. Then, too,
most of the organizations that
have dealings with the Presi
dent's office like immediate ans
wers to their questions. The
number-two man can't provide
those.
Q: What do you project as the
ultimate result of this political
shift?
A: I get the impression that
Stanford is beginning to stag
nate. By and large, all major
demands of the past few years
have been satisfied. Towards
the end of the current academic
year, I foresee"a major reaction
to all that has been accom

plished from as far back as the
changing of liquor regs.
Q: Are you suggesting that
some or all of these changes
might be rescinded?
A: No, definitely not. The re
action will not come from with
in, but from without. One too
many girls will get pregnant in
a coed dorm, or one too many
students will be hurt in an on
campus party. Then the reform
ers will move in and begin to
critisize the laxness of the ad
ministration.
Q: Is this a good thing?
A: Individually, no. But in the
overall picture, yes. A reaction
of the type I've described will
give the students and the fac
ulty the chance to defend the
University that they have built.
Nobody is happy just being ac
cepted. People want to convince
other people that their way
is better. If the reaction does
not set in, archeologists in later
years may dig up Stanford and
say, "This was the site of Le
land Stanford Junior University.
It was once truly a great civili
zation. It died for a want of
challenge. It is not that it would
not progress, but that it could
not."
