# Novak: The Revolution Of 1976
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: Michael No
vak, assistant professor of reli
gion, delivered this address to
the graduating seniors and their
parents during the June com
mencement activities.
In his two years of teaching,
he has fast become one of Stan
ford's highly regarded profes
sors. His books include "Belief
and Unbelief" and 'The Open
Church.")
What I would like to talk
about is the difficult period
through which our country is
about to pass. America seems
increasingly torn with dissen
sion. Parents everywhere are
having trouble understanding
their children.
But even young people dis
agree among themselves. Many
ypung men willingly serve their
nation in Vietnam. Yet in un
precedented numbers young
men believe that their govern
ment is involved in a war of
which they cannot morally or
politically approve; some are ap
plying for conscientious objec
tion; others are protesting
against the whole selective ser
vice system by sending back
their draft cards. There are con
flicting sets of values among
Americans — conservatives can
hardly talk to liberals, and vice
versa. If one speaks on public
subjects, the volume of hate
mail that comes to one's door is
truly frightening. But dissen
sion is not only verbal. Nearly
every week, the National Guard
is called out in this state or in
that, to quell a riot of American
citizens who seek justice, human
decency, or simply an outlet for
the quiet, desperate rage that
has been building up within
them. The use of force, hereto
fore covert in daily American
life, is becoming overt.
Just nine years from now, the
year before the tenth annual
alumni reunion at which we will
hope to welcome many of you
back, in 1976, the United States
will celebrate the two-hundreth
anniversary of its Declaration
of Independence. It is likely, I
think, that before 1976 the
United States will have experi
enced another Revolution . . .
a further extension of the Revo
lution of 1776. It seems to me
that the new revolution has al
ready begun, and that is why
we feel so many divisions in
our midst, so much discomfort.
It is as if America was once
sent upon an errand, and that
errand has not been accom
plished. Many are uncertain,
now, who it was that conceived
that errand. Many others won
der whether it has not been
a fool's errand, leading to sub
urban triviality, to urban ugli
ness, to reckless military power,
to boredom, to a meaningless
and unmentionable death.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote once,
in The Great Gatsby, of those
early Dutch sailors who regard
ed the vista of Long Island. The
sight inspired in them, he said,
"The last and greatest of all
human dreams: for a transitory,
enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the pres
ence of this continent, compelled
into an aesthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor de
sired, face to face for the last
time in history with something
commensurate to his capacity
to wonder."
The New Order
To this day, on the American
dollar bill there is inscribed a
touching boast: Novus Ordo Se
clorum — which, now that the
Catholic Church has switched to
English, I suppose we may
translate: "The New Order of
the Ages."
America was to have been"the
new world." Why then, today,
does it look so much like the old
world? British soldiers on the
continent maintained a "benevo
lent empire." Now it is America
whose industries grow rich,
while other nations become poor
er and poorer. "Law and order"

in the world, to a remarkable
extent, means American law and
order. And within America, it
means white law and order.
White American Christians are
quite humble and modest about
this. They consider the rest of
the world lucky to be protected
and maintained by a godly, un
selfish, Christian people. It is
rather comforting to be wealthy
and godly, powerful and good,
present everywhere and territori
ally unselfish. America has
mastered the secret of ruling
the world without appearing to,
of not letting the left hand know
what the right is doing.
Many of the young — a good
number of those hex - e in Stan
ford's graduating class of 1967
— still hold within them, how
ever, that "the last and greatest
of all human dreams" of which
Fitzgerald wrote. They recognize
that in proportion as they are
free and responsible citizens of
this land, they are guilty for all
the things our government does,
or does not do, in their name.
Many of them have an acute so
cial and political consciousness.
They are not satisfied with the
progress of the American revolu
tion. As one of them wrote two
weeks ago in a term paper:
"We are beginning to take ser
iously all those words that we
have heard in sermons and com
mencement addresses all our
lives: love, justice, liberty, equal
ity. But those who spoke those
words seem to be frightened
when we take them seriously."
Best Of Everything'
The Class of 1967, here and
throughout the land, is probably
the wealthiest and the most se
cure in terms of work and op
portunity of any in the history
of the world. Those parents and
educators who thought that they
could be content with "being
given the best of everything,"
however, have miscalculated.
Man does not live by bread alone.
College students do not live by
security. A new revolution, con
sequently, has begun. Many
young dress differently; they
wear their hair differently; they
think differently; they feel dif
ferently. Many of them have
come to realize that despite our
selves, we live in a racist coun
try. They see that, despite our
selves, we are militarists; few
are shocked at spending billions
to bomb an underdeveloped na
tion — an average of $300,000
to kill each of the enemy gueril
las in Vietnam. To many young
er people, the world they have
grown up in, however segregated
and sheltered domestically, like
the world of Kafka or Catch 22,
is quite mad.
One other thing one discovers
if one listens to the songs of the
young is that many are afraid
of death — no, not so much
afraid as certain that it is com
ing. In the year many students
here were born, the United

States dropped an atomic bomb
on two crowded Asiatic cities.
Many have heard the buzzing
of that bomb all their lives.
Sometimes, awakened by a loud
noise in the night, the first thing
they think of is the bomb. They
have never known the meaning
of peace; since their birth they
have been told that their nation
is threatened by enemies — even
though their nation is vastly
superior to every other on the
earth.
Consequently, the young do
not always have the same sense
of values as the old — among
whom, being a little over thirty,
I include myself. For the older
generation, whether conservative
or liberal, the key words which
unlock the meaning of human
life are HOW TO: How to make
money, how to win friends and
influence people, how to win at
bridge, how to master the sec
rets of nature, how to predict
and to control, how to make a
contribution to society, how to
live a productive life. The as
sumption behind the phrase
"how to" is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing out products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively,
flexibly programmed to advance
the aims of society. A successful
human being is one who knows
how to. He mixes well in com
pany and he has good old Amer
ican know-how. (Incidentally,
one of the most important tech
niques for Americans to master
is how to smile. A good Ameri
can is a friendly American, and
a friendly American is a happy
American.)
How To And Who
Many in the younger genera
tion do not, however, think of
Americans as happy but as hol
low — nice people, good people,
but emptied-out people, com
puters. However, the student of
the present generation is rich,
comparatively. His parents have
worked hard so that he could be
where he is. In order to put him
where he is, his parents have
had to learn how to. How to
is an important, even indispens
able, question for students to
master. Many younger people,
nevertheless, now have the op
portunity to ask a further and
also indispensable question.
Their primary question is not
HOW TO, but WHO. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?
Where are we going? What are
we doing here, under those
stars, here in the wind? Who?
Who? Who?

The young American does not
have to take a job. This is not
the Depression. He doesn't see
much point simply in piling up
more power and more money.
Moreover, even if he is a highly
trained scientist or engineer, he
has already come to see that the
fundamental technological ques
tion is no longer: "Can we do
X?" — for given enough time
and money, of course we can.
The fundamental question is:
"Should we do X?" And that
question depends on who we
think we are, what we think it
is to be a human being.
The revolution of 1976, then,
will be a human revolution. The
American errand may be to
cease thinking of nature as
something out there to be mas
tered. The American errand may
now be to stai L thinking of the
world as part of the self. Here
tofore, the chief American verbs
have been "doing" and "having;"
at last, "being" is getting its
chance. The question HOW TO
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion WHO makes a man a self
and the world a thou: it opens a
man to beauty, to wonder, and
to joy. The question HOW TO
leads, inexorably to power, and
finally to military power. The
question WHO leads to flower
power.
Who Are We?
These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not sepa
rate from us, a dumb, hard en
vironment, as if we were (in
Alan Watts' phrase) "an ego in
a bag of skin" surrounded by
foreign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth bids forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calve, —
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious. We are fruit of
the land, the sun, the sky. We
are one with our environment,
organically spring from it. We
are not separate, discrete, in
exile, master, or slave. . . . We
are ocean. We are sky. We are
earth. We are dust, and unto
dust we shall return.
Who? Who? Who? The young
ask the question of identity and
they key word, Honesty, is sec
ond. Social and political con
sciousness is third. The work
ethic, the business ethic, the
ethic of how to, is losing its ap
peal. It is not sufficiently hu
man. This change in funda
mental values is profound and
disruptive. Consequently, there
is grave danger of even a vio
lent revolution. Families will
break up, and universities will
see further troubles. Parents and
administrators know very well
what worked for their genera
tion, and they are loathe to see

young people go in a direction
that seems so little like their
own. I do not want to enter into
family disputes, but if I may, I
would like to enter just one word
of advice of those who are over
thirty — I promise that it will
be good advice, honest advice,
kindly advice, (in a word) Amer
ican advice. If you must aim
artillery at children of yours
who are going hippie, wearing
beards, speaking of I-thou, com
munity, identity and the rest —
if you must aim artillery, don't
fire until you see the whites of
their eyes. For, just perhaps, if
they get that close you will see
— not a product of Stanford,
not a computer, not a son or
daughter "who turned out just
the way you had it programmed"
—but a who, a Thou, a person.
And, just possibly, that person
will know secrets about life to
which you were never intro
duced, even thought a part of
you has been longing to know
them.
We are on the threshold of
a powerful revolution. I hope
that when we meet back here
again, the year after 1976, not
too many of us will have died
in wars, not too many of us will
have died of indifference and
routine, not too many of us will
have given up pursuing the mys
tery opened up by the question
WHO — and that all of us will,
in the words of Camus, have
done some little "to diminish by
at least a few the number of
those who suffer."

tion. As one of them wrote two
weeks ago in a term paper:
"We are beginning to take ser
iously all those words that we
have heard in sermons and com
mencement addresses all our
lives: love, justice, liberty, equal
ity. But those who spoke those
words seem to be frightened
when we take them seriously."
Best Of Everything'
The Class of 1967, here and
throughout the land, is probably
the wealthiest and the most se
cure in terms of work and op
portunity of any in the history
of the world. Those parents and
educators who thought that they
could be content with "being
given the best of everything,"
however, have miscalculated.
Man does not live by bread alone.
College students do not live by
security. A new revolution, con
sequently, has begun. Many
young dress differently; they
wear their hair differently; they
think differently; they feel dif
ferently. Many of them have
come to realize that despite our
selves, we live in a racist coun
try. They see that, despite our
selves, we are militarists; few
are shocked at spending billions
to bomb an underdeveloped na
tion — an average of $300,000
to kill each of the enemy gueril
las in Vietnam. To many young
er people, the world they have
grown up in, however segregated
and sheltered domestically, like
the world of Kafka or Catch 22,
is quite mad.
One other thing one discovers
if one listens to the songs of the
young is that many are afraid
of death — no, not so much
afraid as certain that it is com
ing. In the year many students
here were born, the United

States dropped an atomic bomb
on two crowded Asiatic cities.
Many have heard the buzzing
of that bomb all their lives.
Sometimes, awakened by a loud
noise in the night, the first thing
they think of is the bomb. They
have never known the meaning
of peace; since their birth they
have been told that their nation
is threatened by enemies — even
though their nation is vastly
superior to every other on the
earth.
Consequently, the young do
not always have the same sense
of values as the old — among
whom, being a little over thirty,
I include myself. For the older
generation, whether conservative
or liberal, the key words which
unlock the meaning of human
life are HOW TO: How to make
money, how to win friends and
influence people, how to win at
bridge, how to master the sec
rets of nature, how to predict
and to control, how to make a
contribution to society, how to
live a productive life. The as
sumption behind the phrase
"how to" is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing out products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively,
flexibly programmed to advance
the aims of society. A successful
human being is one who knows
how to. He mixes well in com
pany and he has good old Amer
ican know-how. (Incidentally,
one of the most important tech
niques for Americans to master
is how to smile. A good Ameri
can is a friendly American, and
a friendly American is a happy
American.)
How To And Who
Many in the younger genera
tion do not, however, think of
Americans as happy but as hol
low — nice people, good people,
but emptied-out people, com
puters. However, the student of
the present generation is rich,
comparatively. His parents have
worked hard so that he could be
where he is. In order to put him
where he is, his parents have
had to learn how to. How to
is an important, even indispens
able, question for students to
master. Many younger people,
nevertheless, now have the op
portunity to ask a further and
also indispensable question.
Their primary question is not
HOW TO, but WHO. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?
Where are we going? What are
we doing here, under those
stars, here in the wind? Who?
Who? Who?

The young American does not
have to take a job. This is not
the Depression. He doesn't see
much point simply in piling up
more power and more money.
Moreover, even if he is a highly
trained scientist or engineer, he
has already come to see that the
fundamental technological ques
tion is no longer: "Can we do
X?" — for given enough time
and money, of course we can.
The fundamental question is:
"Should we do X?" And that
question depends on who we
think we are, what we think it
is to be a human being.
The revolution of 1976, then,
will be a human revolution. The
American errand may be to
cease thinking of nature as
something out there to be mas
tered. The American errand may
now be to stai L thinking of the
world as part of the self. Here
tofore, the chief American verbs
have been "doing" and "having;"
at last, "being" is getting its
chance. The question HOW TO
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion WHO makes a man a self
and the world a thou: it opens a
man to beauty, to wonder, and
to joy. The question HOW TO
leads, inexorably to power, and
finally to military power. The
question WHO leads to flower
power.
Who Are We?
These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not sepa
rate from us, a dumb, hard en
vironment, as if we were (in
Alan Watts' phrase) "an ego in
a bag of skin" surrounded by
foreign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth bids forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calve, —
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious. We are fruit of
the land, the sun, the sky. We
are one with our environment,
organically spring from it. We
are not separate, discrete, in
exile, master, or slave. . . . We
are ocean. We are sky. We are
earth. We are dust, and unto
dust we shall return.
Who? Who? Who? The young
ask the question of identity and
they key word, Honesty, is sec
ond. Social and political con
sciousness is third. The work
ethic, the business ethic, the
ethic of how to, is losing its ap
peal. It is not sufficiently hu
man. This change in funda
mental values is profound and
disruptive. Consequently, there
is grave danger of even a vio
lent revolution. Families will
break up, and universities will
see further troubles. Parents and
administrators know very well
what worked for their genera
tion, and they are loathe to see

young people go in a direction
that seems so little like their
own. I do not want to enter into
family disputes, but if I may, I
would like to enter just one word
of advice of those who are over
thirty — I promise that it will
be good advice, honest advice,
kindly advice, (in a word) Amer
ican advice. If you must aim
artillery at children of yours
who are going hippie, wearing
beards, speaking of I-thou, com
munity, identity and the rest —
if you must aim artillery, don't
fire until you see the whites of
their eyes. For, just perhaps, if
they get that close you will see
— not a product of Stanford,
not a computer, not a son or
daughter "who turned out just
the way you had it programmed"
—but a who, a Thou, a person.
And, just possibly, that person
will know secrets about life to
which you were never intro
duced, even thought a part of
you has been longing to know
them.
We are on the threshold of
a powerful revolution. I hope
that when we meet back here
again, the year after 1976, not
too many of us will have died
in wars, not too many of us will
have died of indifference and
routine, not too many of us will
have given up pursuing the mys
tery opened up by the question
WHO — and that all of us will,
in the words of Camus, have
done some little "to diminish by
at least a few the number of
those who suffer."


MICHAEL NOVAK
(Editor's Note: Michael No
vak, assistant professor of reli
gion, delivered this address to
the graduating seniors and their
parents during the June com
mencement activities.
In his two years of teaching,
he has fast become one of Stan
ford's highly regarded profes
sors. His books include "Belief
and Unbelief" and 'The Open
Church.")
What I would like to talk
about is the difficult period
through which our country is
about to pass. America seems
increasingly torn with dissen
sion. Parents everywhere are
having trouble understanding
their children.
But even young people dis
agree among themselves. Many
ypung men willingly serve their
nation in Vietnam. Yet in un
precedented numbers young
men believe that their govern
ment is involved in a war of
which they cannot morally or
politically approve; some are ap
plying for conscientious objec
tion; others are protesting
against the whole selective ser
vice system by sending back
their draft cards. There are con
flicting sets of values among
Americans — conservatives can
hardly talk to liberals, and vice
versa. If one speaks on public
subjects, the volume of hate
mail that comes to one's door is
truly frightening. But dissen
sion is not only verbal. Nearly
every week, the National Guard
is called out in this state or in
that, to quell a riot of American
citizens who seek justice, human
decency, or simply an outlet for
the quiet, desperate rage that
has been building up within
them. The use of force, hereto
fore covert in daily American
life, is becoming overt.
Just nine years from now, the
year before the tenth annual
alumni reunion at which we will
hope to welcome many of you
back, in 1976, the United States
will celebrate the two-hundreth
anniversary of its Declaration
of Independence. It is likely, I
think, that before 1976 the
United States will have experi
enced another Revolution . . .
a further extension of the Revo
lution of 1776. It seems to me
that the new revolution has al
ready begun, and that is why
we feel so many divisions in
our midst, so much discomfort.
It is as if America was once
sent upon an errand, and that
errand has not been accom
plished. Many are uncertain,
now, who it was that conceived
that errand. Many others won
der whether it has not been
a fool's errand, leading to sub
urban triviality, to urban ugli
ness, to reckless military power,
to boredom, to a meaningless
and unmentionable death.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote once,
in The Great Gatsby, of those
early Dutch sailors who regard
ed the vista of Long Island. The
sight inspired in them, he said,
"The last and greatest of all
human dreams: for a transitory,
enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the pres
ence of this continent, compelled
into an aesthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor de
sired, face to face for the last
time in history with something
commensurate to his capacity
to wonder."
The New Order
To this day, on the American
dollar bill there is inscribed a
touching boast: Novus Ordo Se
clorum — which, now that the
Catholic Church has switched to
English, I suppose we may
translate: "The New Order of
the Ages."
America was to have been"the
new world." Why then, today,
does it look so much like the old
world? British soldiers on the
continent maintained a "benevo
lent empire." Now it is America
whose industries grow rich,
while other nations become poor
er and poorer. "Law and order"

in the world, to a remarkable
extent, means American law and
order. And within America, it
means white law and order.
White American Christians are
quite humble and modest about
this. They consider the rest of
the world lucky to be protected
and maintained by a godly, un
selfish, Christian people. It is
rather comforting to be wealthy
and godly, powerful and good,
present everywhere and territori
ally unselfish. America has
mastered the secret of ruling
the world without appearing to,
of not letting the left hand know
what the right is doing.
Many of the young — a good
number of those hex - e in Stan
ford's graduating class of 1967
— still hold within them, how
ever, that "the last and greatest
of all human dreams" of which
Fitzgerald wrote. They recognize
that in proportion as they are
free and responsible citizens of
this land, they are guilty for all
the things our government does,
or does not do, in their name.
Many of them have an acute so
cial and political consciousness.
They are not satisfied with the
progress of the American revolu
tion. As one of them wrote two
weeks ago in a term paper:
"We are beginning to take ser
iously all those words that we
have heard in sermons and com
mencement addresses all our

question depends on who we
think we are, what we think it
is to be a human being.
The revolution of 1976, then,
will be a human revolution. The
American errand may be to
cease thinking of nature as
something out there to be mas
tered. The American errand may
now be to stai L thinking of the
world as part of the self. Here
tofore, the chief American verbs
have been "doing" and "having;"
at last, "being" is getting its
chance. The question HOW TO
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion WHO makes a man a self
and the world a thou: it opens a
man to beauty, to wonder, and
to joy. The question HOW TO
leads, inexorably to power, and
finally to military power. The
question WHO leads to flower
power.
Who Are We?
These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not sepa
rate from us, a dumb, hard en
vironment, as if we were (in
Alan Watts' phrase) "an ego in
a bag of skin" surrounded by
foreign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth bids forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calve, —
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious. We are fruit of
the land, the sun, the sky. We
are one with our environment,
organically spring from it. We
are not separate, discrete, in
exile, master, or slave. . . . We
are ocean. We are sky. We are
earth. We are dust, and unto
dust we shall return.
Who? Who? Who? The young
ask the question of identity and
they key word, Honesty, is sec
ond. Social and political con
sciousness is third. The work
ethic, the business ethic, the
ethic of how to, is losing its ap
peal. It is not sufficiently hu
man. This change in funda
mental values is profound and
disruptive. Consequently, there
is grave danger of even a vio
lent revolution. Families will
break up, and universities will
see further troubles. Parents and
administrators know very well
what worked for their genera
tion, and they are loathe to see

young people go in a direction
that seems so little like their
own. I do not want to enter into
family disputes, but if I may, I
would like to enter just one word
of advice of those who are over
thirty — I promise that it will
be good advice, honest advice,
kindly advice, (in a word) Amer
ican advice. If you must aim
artillery at children of yours
who are going hippie, wearing
beards, speaking of I-thou, com
munity, identity and the rest —
if you must aim artillery, don't
fire until you see the whites of
their eyes. For, just perhaps, if
they get that close you will see
— not a product of Stanford,
not a computer, not a son or
daughter "who turned out just
the way you had it programmed"
—but a who, a Thou, a person.
And, just possibly, that person
will know secrets about life to
which you were never intro
duced, even thought a part of
you has been longing to know
them.
We are on the threshold of
a powerful revolution. I hope
that when we meet back here
again, the year after 1976, not
too many of us will have died
in wars, not too many of us will
have died of indifference and
routine, not too many of us will
have given up pursuing the mys
tery opened up by the question
WHO — and that all of us will,
in the words of Camus, have
done some little "to diminish by
at least a few the number of
those who suffer."


MICHAEL NOVAK
(Editor's Note: Michael No
vak, assistant professor of reli
gion, delivered this address to
the graduating seniors and their
parents during the June com
mencement activities.
In his two years of teaching,
he has fast become one of Stan
ford's highly regarded profes
sors. His books include "Belief
and Unbelief" and 'The Open
Church.")
What I would like to talk
about is the difficult period
through which our country is
about to pass. America seems
increasingly torn with dissen
sion. Parents everywhere are
having trouble understanding
their children.
But even young people dis
agree among themselves. Many
ypung men willingly serve their
nation in Vietnam. Yet in un
precedented numbers young
men believe that their govern
ment is involved in a war of
which they cannot morally or
politically approve; some are ap
plying for conscientious objec
tion; others are protesting
against the whole selective ser
vice system by sending back
their draft cards. There are con
flicting sets of values among
Americans — conservatives can
hardly talk to liberals, and vice
versa. If one speaks on public
subjects, the volume of hate
mail that comes to one's door is
truly frightening. But dissen
sion is not only verbal. Nearly
every week, the National Guard
is called out in this state or in
that, to quell a riot of American
citizens who seek justice, human
decency, or simply an outlet for
the quiet, desperate rage that
has been building up within
them. The use of force, hereto
fore covert in daily American
life, is becoming overt.
Just nine years from now, the
year before the tenth annual
alumni reunion at which we will
hope to welcome many of you
back, in 1976, the United States
will celebrate the two-hundreth
anniversary of its Declaration
of Independence. It is likely, I
think, that before 1976 the
United States will have experi
enced another Revolution . . .
a further extension of the Revo
lution of 1776. It seems to me
that the new revolution has al
ready begun, and that is why
we feel so many divisions in
our midst, so much discomfort.
It is as if America was once
sent upon an errand, and that
errand has not been accom
plished. Many are uncertain,
now, who it was that conceived
that errand. Many others won
der whether it has not been
a fool's errand, leading to sub
urban triviality, to urban ugli
ness, to reckless military power,
to boredom, to a meaningless
and unmentionable death.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote once,
in The Great Gatsby, of those
early Dutch sailors who regard
ed the vista of Long Island. The
sight inspired in them, he said,
"The last and greatest of all
human dreams: for a transitory,
enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the pres
ence of this continent, compelled
into an aesthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor de
sired, face to face for the last
time in history with something
commensurate to his capacity
to wonder."
The New Order
To this day, on the American
dollar bill there is inscribed a
touching boast: Novus Ordo Se
clorum — which, now that the
Catholic Church has switched to
English, I suppose we may
translate: "The New Order of
the Ages."
America was to have been"the
new world." Why then, today,
does it look so much like the old
world? British soldiers on the
continent maintained a "benevo
lent empire." Now it is America
whose industries grow rich,
while other nations become poor
er and poorer. "Law and order"

in the world, to a remarkable
extent, means American law and
order. And within America, it
means white law and order.
White American Christians are
quite humble and modest about
this. They consider the rest of
the world lucky to be protected
and maintained by a godly, un
selfish, Christian people. It is
rather comforting to be wealthy
and godly, powerful and good,
present everywhere and territori
ally unselfish. America has
mastered the secret of ruling
the world without appearing to,
of not letting the left hand know
what the right is doing.
Many of the young — a good
number of those hex - e in Stan
ford's graduating class of 1967
— still hold within them, how
ever, that "the last and greatest
of all human dreams" of which
Fitzgerald wrote. They recognize
that in proportion as they are
free and responsible citizens of
this land, they are guilty for all
the things our government does,
or does not do, in their name.
Many of them have an acute so
cial and political consciousness.
They are not satisfied with the
progress of the American revolu
tion. As one of them wrote two
weeks ago in a term paper:
"We are beginning to take ser
iously all those words that we
have heard in sermons and com
mencement addresses all our
lives: love, justice, liberty, equal
ity. But those who spoke those
words seem to be frightened
when we take them seriously."
Best Of Everything'
The Class of 1967, here and
throughout the land, is probably
the wealthiest and the most se
cure in terms of work and op
portunity of any in the history
of the world. Those parents and
educators who thought that they
could be content with "being
given the best of everything,"
however, have miscalculated.
Man does not live by bread alone.
College students do not live by
security. A new revolution, con
sequently, has begun. Many
young dress differently; they
wear their hair differently; they
think differently; they feel dif
ferently. Many of them have
come to realize that despite our
selves, we live in a racist coun
try. They see that, despite our
selves, we are militarists; few
are shocked at spending billions
to bomb an underdeveloped na
tion — an average of $300,000
to kill each of the enemy gueril
las in Vietnam. To many young
er people, the world they have
grown up in, however segregated
and sheltered domestically, like
the world of Kafka or Catch 22,
is quite mad.
One other thing one discovers
if one listens to the songs of the
young is that many are afraid
of death — no, not so much
afraid as certain that it is com
ing. In the year many students
here were born, the United

States dropped an atomic bomb
on two crowded Asiatic cities.
Many have heard the buzzing
of that bomb all their lives.
Sometimes, awakened by a loud
noise in the night, the first thing
they think of is the bomb. They
have never known the meaning
of peace; since their birth they
have been told that their nation
is threatened by enemies — even
though their nation is vastly
superior to every other on the
earth.
Consequently, the young do
not always have the same sense
of values as the old — among
whom, being a little over thirty,
I include myself. For the older
generation, whether conservative
or liberal, the key words which
unlock the meaning of human
life are HOW TO: How to make
money, how to win friends and
influence people, how to win at
bridge, how to master the sec
rets of nature, how to predict
and to control, how to make a
contribution to society, how to
live a productive life. The as
sumption behind the phrase
"how to" is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing out products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively,
flexibly programmed to advance
the aims of society. A successful
human being is one who knows
how to. He mixes well in com
pany and he has good old Amer
ican know-how. (Incidentally,
one of the most important tech
niques for Americans to master
is how to smile. A good Ameri
can is a friendly American, and
a friendly American is a happy
American.)
How To And Who
Many in the younger genera
tion do not, however, think of
Americans as happy but as hol
low — nice people, good people,
but emptied-out people, com
puters. However, the student of
the present generation is rich,
comparatively. His parents have
worked hard so that he could be
where he is. In order to put him
where he is, his parents have
had to learn how to. How to
is an important, even indispens
able, question for students to
master. Many younger people,
nevertheless, now have the op
portunity to ask a further and
also indispensable question.
Their primary question is not
HOW TO, but WHO. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?
Where are we going? What are
we doing here, under those
stars, here in the wind? Who?
Who? Who?

The young American does not
have to take a job. This is not
the Depression. He doesn't see
much point simply in piling up
more power and more money.
Moreover, even if he is a highly
trained scientist or engineer, he
has already come to see that the
fundamental technological ques
tion is no longer: "Can we do
X?" — for given enough time
and money, of course we can.
The fundamental question is:
"Should we do X?" And that
question depends on who we
think we are, what we think it
is to be a human being.
The revolution of 1976, then,
will be a human revolution. The
American errand may be to
cease thinking of nature as
something out there to be mas
tered. The American errand may
now be to stai L thinking of the
world as part of the self. Here
tofore, the chief American verbs
have been "doing" and "having;"
at last, "being" is getting its

man to beauty, to wonder, and
to joy. The question HOW TO
leads, inexorably to power, and
finally to military power. The
question WHO leads to flower
power.

against the whole selective ser
vice system by sending back
their draft cards. There are con
flicting sets of values among
Americans — conservatives can
hardly talk to liberals, and vice
versa. If one speaks on public
subjects, the volume of hate
mail that comes to one's door is
truly frightening. But dissen
sion is not only verbal. Nearly
every week, the National Guard
is called out in this state or in
that, to quell a riot of American
citizens who seek justice, human
decency, or simply an outlet for
the quiet, desperate rage that
has been building up within
them. The use of force, hereto
fore covert in daily American
life, is becoming overt.
Just nine years from now, the
year before the tenth annual
alumni reunion at which we will
hope to welcome many of you
back, in 1976, the United States
will celebrate the two-hundreth
anniversary of its Declaration
of Independence. It is likely, I
think, that before 1976 the
United States will have experi
enced another Revolution . . .
a further extension of the Revo
lution of 1776. It seems to me
that the new revolution has al
ready begun, and that is why
we feel so many divisions in
our midst, so much discomfort.
It is as if America was once
sent upon an errand, and that
errand has not been accom
plished. Many are uncertain,
now, who it was that conceived
that errand. Many others won
der whether it has not been
a fool's errand, leading to sub
urban triviality, to urban ugli
ness, to reckless military power,
to boredom, to a meaningless
and unmentionable death.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote once,
in The Great Gatsby, of those
early Dutch sailors who regard
ed the vista of Long Island. The
sight inspired in them, he said,
"The last and greatest of all
human dreams: for a transitory,
enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the pres
ence of this continent, compelled
into an aesthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor de
sired, face to face for the last
time in history with something
commensurate to his capacity
to wonder."
The New Order
To this day, on the American
dollar bill there is inscribed a
touching boast: Novus Ordo Se
clorum — which, now that the
Catholic Church has switched to
English, I suppose we may
translate: "The New Order of
the Ages."
America was to have been"the
new world." Why then, today,
does it look so much like the old
world? British soldiers on the
continent maintained a "benevo
lent empire." Now it is America
whose industries grow rich,
while other nations become poor
er and poorer. "Law and order"

in the world, to a remarkable
extent, means American law and
order. And within America, it
means white law and order.
White American Christians are
quite humble and modest about
this. They consider the rest of
the world lucky to be protected
and maintained by a godly, un
selfish, Christian people. It is
rather comforting to be wealthy
and godly, powerful and good,
present everywhere and territori
ally unselfish. America has
mastered the secret of ruling
the world without appearing to,
of not letting the left hand know
what the right is doing.
Many of the young — a good
number of those hex - e in Stan
ford's graduating class of 1967
— still hold within them, how
ever, that "the last and greatest
of all human dreams" of which
Fitzgerald wrote. They recognize
that in proportion as they are
free and responsible citizens of
this land, they are guilty for all
the things our government does,
or does not do, in their name.
Many of them have an acute so
cial and political consciousness.
They are not satisfied with the
progress of the American revolu
tion. As one of them wrote two
weeks ago in a term paper:
"We are beginning to take ser
iously all those words that we
have heard in sermons and com
mencement addresses all our
lives: love, justice, liberty, equal
ity. But those who spoke those
words seem to be frightened
when we take them seriously."
Best Of Everything'
The Class of 1967, here and
throughout the land, is probably
the wealthiest and the most se
cure in terms of work and op
portunity of any in the history
of the world. Those parents and
educators who thought that they
could be content with "being
given the best of everything,"
however, have miscalculated.
Man does not live by bread alone.
College students do not live by
security. A new revolution, con
sequently, has begun. Many
young dress differently; they
wear their hair differently; they
think differently; they feel dif
ferently. Many of them have
come to realize that despite our
selves, we live in a racist coun
try. They see that, despite our
selves, we are militarists; few
are shocked at spending billions
to bomb an underdeveloped na
tion — an average of $300,000
to kill each of the enemy gueril
las in Vietnam. To many young
er people, the world they have
grown up in, however segregated
and sheltered domestically, like
the world of Kafka or Catch 22,
is quite mad.
One other thing one discovers
if one listens to the songs of the
young is that many are afraid
of death — no, not so much
afraid as certain that it is com
ing. In the year many students
here were born, the United

States dropped an atomic bomb
on two crowded Asiatic cities.
Many have heard the buzzing
of that bomb all their lives.
Sometimes, awakened by a loud
noise in the night, the first thing
they think of is the bomb. They
have never known the meaning
of peace; since their birth they
have been told that their nation
is threatened by enemies — even
though their nation is vastly
superior to every other on the
earth.
Consequently, the young do
not always have the same sense
of values as the old — among
whom, being a little over thirty,
I include myself. For the older
generation, whether conservative
or liberal, the key words which
unlock the meaning of human
life are HOW TO: How to make
money, how to win friends and
influence people, how to win at
bridge, how to master the sec
rets of nature, how to predict
and to control, how to make a
contribution to society, how to
live a productive life. The as
sumption behind the phrase
"how to" is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing out products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively,
flexibly programmed to advance
the aims of society. A successful
human being is one who knows
how to. He mixes well in com
pany and he has good old Amer
ican know-how. (Incidentally,
one of the most important tech
niques for Americans to master
is how to smile. A good Ameri
can is a friendly American, and
a friendly American is a happy
American.)
How To And Who
Many in the younger genera
tion do not, however, think of
Americans as happy but as hol
low — nice people, good people,
but emptied-out people, com
puters. However, the student of
the present generation is rich,
comparatively. His parents have
worked hard so that he could be
where he is. In order to put him
where he is, his parents have
had to learn how to. How to
is an important, even indispens
able, question for students to
master. Many younger people,
nevertheless, now have the op
portunity to ask a further and
also indispensable question.
Their primary question is not
HOW TO, but WHO. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?
Where are we going? What are
we doing here, under those
stars, here in the wind? Who?
Who? Who?

The young American does not
have to take a job. This is not
the Depression. He doesn't see
much point simply in piling up
more power and more money.
Moreover, even if he is a highly
trained scientist or engineer, he
has already come to see that the
fundamental technological ques
tion is no longer: "Can we do
X?" — for given enough time
and money, of course we can.
The fundamental question is:
"Should we do X?" And that
question depends on who we
think we are, what we think it
is to be a human being.
The revolution of 1976, then,
will be a human revolution. The
American errand may be to
cease thinking of nature as
something out there to be mas
tered. The American errand may
now be to stai L thinking of the
world as part of the self. Here
tofore, the chief American verbs
have been "doing" and "having;"
at last, "being" is getting its
chance. The question HOW TO
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion WHO makes a man a self
and the world a thou: it opens a
man to beauty, to wonder, and
to joy. The question HOW TO
leads, inexorably to power, and
finally to military power. The
question WHO leads to flower
power.
Who Are We?
These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not sepa
rate from us, a dumb, hard en
vironment, as if we were (in
Alan Watts' phrase) "an ego in
a bag of skin" surrounded by
foreign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth bids forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calve, —
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious. We are fruit of
the land, the sun, the sky. We
are one with our environment,
organically spring from it. We
are not separate, discrete, in
exile, master, or slave. . . . We
are ocean. We are sky. We are
earth. We are dust, and unto
dust we shall return.
Who? Who? Who? The young
ask the question of identity and
they key word, Honesty, is sec
ond. Social and political con
sciousness is third. The work
ethic, the business ethic, the
ethic of how to, is losing its ap
peal. It is not sufficiently hu
man. This change in funda
mental values is profound and
disruptive. Consequently, there
is grave danger of even a vio
lent revolution. Families will
break up, and universities will
see further troubles. Parents and
administrators know very well
what worked for their genera
tion, and they are loathe to see

young people go in a direction
that seems so little like their
own. I do not want to enter into
family disputes, but if I may, I
would like to enter just one word
of advice of those who are over
thirty — I promise that it will
be good advice, honest advice,
kindly advice, (in a word) Amer
ican advice. If you must aim
artillery at children of yours
who are going hippie, wearing
beards, speaking of I-thou, com
munity, identity and the rest —
if you must aim artillery, don't
fire until you see the whites of
their eyes. For, just perhaps, if
they get that close you will see
— not a product of Stanford,
not a computer, not a son or
daughter "who turned out just
the way you had it programmed"
—but a who, a Thou, a person.
And, just possibly, that person
will know secrets about life to
which you were never intro
duced, even thought a part of
you has been longing to know
them.
We are on the threshold of
a powerful revolution. I hope
that when we meet back here
again, the year after 1976, not
too many of us will have died
in wars, not too many of us will
have died of indifference and
routine, not too many of us will
have given up pursuing the mys
tery opened up by the question
WHO — and that all of us will,
in the words of Camus, have
done some little "to diminish by
at least a few the number of
those who suffer."

he has fast become one of Stan

What I would like to talk
about is the difficult period
through which our country is
about to pass. America seems
increasingly torn with dissen
sion. Parents everywhere are
having trouble understanding
their children.
But even young people dis
agree among themselves. Many
ypung men willingly serve their
nation in Vietnam. Yet in un
precedented numbers young
men believe that their govern
ment is involved in a war of
which they cannot morally or
politically approve; some are ap
plying for conscientious objec
tion; others are protesting
against the whole selective ser
vice system by sending back
their draft cards. There are con
flicting sets of values among
Americans — conservatives can
hardly talk to liberals, and vice

ferently. Many of them have
come to realize that despite our
selves, we live in a racist coun
try. They see that, despite our
selves, we are militarists; few
are shocked at spending billions
to bomb an underdeveloped na
tion — an average of $300,000
to kill each of the enemy gueril
las in Vietnam. To many young
er people, the world they have
grown up in, however segregated
and sheltered domestically, like
the world of Kafka or Catch 22,
is quite mad.
One other thing one discovers
if one listens to the songs of the
young is that many are afraid
of death — no, not so much
afraid as certain that it is com
ing. In the year many students
here were born, the United

States dropped an atomic bomb
on two crowded Asiatic cities.
Many have heard the buzzing
of that bomb all their lives.
Sometimes, awakened by a loud
noise in the night, the first thing
they think of is the bomb. They
have never known the meaning
of peace; since their birth they
have been told that their nation
is threatened by enemies — even
though their nation is vastly
superior to every other on the
earth.
Consequently, the young do
not always have the same sense
of values as the old — among
whom, being a little over thirty,
I include myself. For the older
generation, whether conservative
or liberal, the key words which
unlock the meaning of human
life are HOW TO: How to make
money, how to win friends and
influence people, how to win at
bridge, how to master the sec
rets of nature, how to predict
and to control, how to make a
contribution to society, how to
live a productive life. The as
sumption behind the phrase
"how to" is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing out products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively,
flexibly programmed to advance
the aims of society. A successful
human being is one who knows
how to. He mixes well in com
pany and he has good old Amer
ican know-how. (Incidentally,
one of the most important tech
niques for Americans to master
is how to smile. A good Ameri
can is a friendly American, and
a friendly American is a happy
American.)
How To And Who
Many in the younger genera
tion do not, however, think of
Americans as happy but as hol
low — nice people, good people,
but emptied-out people, com
puters. However, the student of
the present generation is rich,
comparatively. His parents have
worked hard so that he could be
where he is. In order to put him
where he is, his parents have
had to learn how to. How to
is an important, even indispens
able, question for students to
master. Many younger people,
nevertheless, now have the op
portunity to ask a further and
also indispensable question.
Their primary question is not
HOW TO, but WHO. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?
Where are we going? What are
we doing here, under those
stars, here in the wind? Who?
Who? Who?

The young American does not
have to take a job. This is not
the Depression. He doesn't see
much point simply in piling up
more power and more money.
Moreover, even if he is a highly
trained scientist or engineer, he
has already come to see that the
fundamental technological ques
tion is no longer: "Can we do
X?" — for given enough time
and money, of course we can.
The fundamental question is:
"Should we do X?" And that
question depends on who we
think we are, what we think it
is to be a human being.
The revolution of 1976, then,
will be a human revolution. The
American errand may be to
cease thinking of nature as
something out there to be mas
tered. The American errand may
now be to stai L thinking of the
world as part of the self. Here
tofore, the chief American verbs
have been "doing" and "having;"
at last, "being" is getting its
chance. The question HOW TO
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion WHO makes a man a self
and the world a thou: it opens a
man to beauty, to wonder, and
to joy. The question HOW TO
leads, inexorably to power, and
finally to military power. The
question WHO leads to flower
power.
Who Are We?
These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not sepa
rate from us, a dumb, hard en
vironment, as if we were (in
Alan Watts' phrase) "an ego in
a bag of skin" surrounded by
foreign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth bids forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calve, —
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious. We are fruit of
the land, the sun, the sky. We
are one with our environment,
organically spring from it. We
are not separate, discrete, in
exile, master, or slave. . . . We
are ocean. We are sky. We are
earth. We are dust, and unto
dust we shall return.
Who? Who? Who? The young
ask the question of identity and
they key word, Honesty, is sec
ond. Social and political con
sciousness is third. The work
ethic, the business ethic, the
ethic of how to, is losing its ap
peal. It is not sufficiently hu
man. This change in funda
mental values is profound and
disruptive. Consequently, there
is grave danger of even a vio
lent revolution. Families will
break up, and universities will
see further troubles. Parents and
administrators know very well
what worked for their genera
tion, and they are loathe to see

young people go in a direction
that seems so little like their
own. I do not want to enter into
family disputes, but if I may, I
would like to enter just one word
of advice of those who are over
thirty — I promise that it will
be good advice, honest advice,
kindly advice, (in a word) Amer
ican advice. If you must aim
artillery at children of yours
who are going hippie, wearing
beards, speaking of I-thou, com
munity, identity and the rest —
if you must aim artillery, don't
fire until you see the whites of
their eyes. For, just perhaps, if
they get that close you will see
— not a product of Stanford,
not a computer, not a son or
daughter "who turned out just
the way you had it programmed"
—but a who, a Thou, a person.
And, just possibly, that person
will know secrets about life to
which you were never intro
duced, even thought a part of
you has been longing to know
them.
We are on the threshold of
a powerful revolution. I hope
that when we meet back here
again, the year after 1976, not
too many of us will have died
in wars, not too many of us will
have died of indifference and
routine, not too many of us will
have given up pursuing the mys
tery opened up by the question
WHO — and that all of us will,
in the words of Camus, have
done some little "to diminish by
at least a few the number of
those who suffer."


MICHAEL NOVAK
(Editor's Note: Michael No
vak, assistant professor of reli
gion, delivered this address to
the graduating seniors and their
parents during the June com
mencement activities.
In his two years of teaching,
he has fast become one of Stan
ford's highly regarded profes
sors. His books include "Belief
and Unbelief" and 'The Open
Church.")
What I would like to talk
about is the difficult period
through which our country is
about to pass. America seems
increasingly torn with dissen
sion. Parents everywhere are
having trouble understanding
their children.
But even young people dis
agree among themselves. Many
ypung men willingly serve their
nation in Vietnam. Yet in un
precedented numbers young
men believe that their govern
ment is involved in a war of
which they cannot morally or
politically approve; some are ap
plying for conscientious objec
tion; others are protesting
against the whole selective ser
vice system by sending back
their draft cards. There are con
flicting sets of values among
Americans — conservatives can
hardly talk to liberals, and vice
versa. If one speaks on public
subjects, the volume of hate
mail that comes to one's door is
truly frightening. But dissen
sion is not only verbal. Nearly
every week, the National Guard
is called out in this state or in
that, to quell a riot of American
citizens who seek justice, human
decency, or simply an outlet for
the quiet, desperate rage that
has been building up within
them. The use of force, hereto
fore covert in daily American
life, is becoming overt.
Just nine years from now, the
year before the tenth annual
alumni reunion at which we will
hope to welcome many of you
back, in 1976, the United States
will celebrate the two-hundreth
anniversary of its Declaration
of Independence. It is likely, I
think, that before 1976 the
United States will have experi
enced another Revolution . . .
a further extension of the Revo
lution of 1776. It seems to me
that the new revolution has al
ready begun, and that is why
we feel so many divisions in
our midst, so much discomfort.
It is as if America was once
sent upon an errand, and that
errand has not been accom
plished. Many are uncertain,
now, who it was that conceived
that errand. Many others won
der whether it has not been
a fool's errand, leading to sub
urban triviality, to urban ugli
ness, to reckless military power,
to boredom, to a meaningless
and unmentionable death.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote once,
in The Great Gatsby, of those
early Dutch sailors who regard
ed the vista of Long Island. The
sight inspired in them, he said,
"The last and greatest of all
human dreams: for a transitory,
enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the pres
ence of this continent, compelled
into an aesthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor de
sired, face to face for the last
time in history with something
commensurate to his capacity
to wonder."
The New Order
To this day, on the American
dollar bill there is inscribed a
touching boast: Novus Ordo Se
clorum — which, now that the
Catholic Church has switched to
English, I suppose we may
translate: "The New Order of
the Ages."
America was to have been"the
new world." Why then, today,
does it look so much like the old
world? British soldiers on the
continent maintained a "benevo
lent empire." Now it is America
whose industries grow rich,
while other nations become poor
er and poorer. "Law and order"

in the world, to a remarkable
extent, means American law and
order. And within America, it
means white law and order.
White American Christians are
quite humble and modest about
this. They consider the rest of
the world lucky to be protected
and maintained by a godly, un
selfish, Christian people. It is
rather comforting to be wealthy
and godly, powerful and good,
present everywhere and territori
ally unselfish. America has
mastered the secret of ruling
the world without appearing to,
of not letting the left hand know
what the right is doing.
Many of the young — a good
number of those hex - e in Stan
ford's graduating class of 1967
— still hold within them, how
ever, that "the last and greatest
of all human dreams" of which
Fitzgerald wrote. They recognize
that in proportion as they are
free and responsible citizens of
this land, they are guilty for all
the things our government does,
or does not do, in their name.
Many of them have an acute so
cial and political consciousness.
They are not satisfied with the
progress of the American revolu
tion. As one of them wrote two
weeks ago in a term paper:
"We are beginning to take ser
iously all those words that we
have heard in sermons and com
mencement addresses all our
lives: love, justice, liberty, equal
ity. But those who spoke those
words seem to be frightened
when we take them seriously."
Best Of Everything'
The Class of 1967, here and
throughout the land, is probably
the wealthiest and the most se
cure in terms of work and op
portunity of any in the history
of the world. Those parents and
educators who thought that they
could be content with "being
given the best of everything,"
however, have miscalculated.
Man does not live by bread alone.
College students do not live by
security. A new revolution, con
sequently, has begun. Many
young dress differently; they
wear their hair differently; they
think differently; they feel dif
ferently. Many of them have
come to realize that despite our
selves, we live in a racist coun
try. They see that, despite our
selves, we are militarists; few
are shocked at spending billions
to bomb an underdeveloped na
tion — an average of $300,000
to kill each of the enemy gueril
las in Vietnam. To many young
er people, the world they have
grown up in, however segregated
and sheltered domestically, like
the world of Kafka or Catch 22,
is quite mad.
One other thing one discovers

of death — no, not so much

this sky, — they are not sepa
rate from us, a dumb, hard en
vironment, as if we were (in
Alan Watts' phrase) "an ego in
a bag of skin" surrounded by
foreign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth bids forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calve, —
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious. We are fruit of
the land, the sun, the sky. We
are one with our environment,
organically spring from it. We
are not separate, discrete, in
exile, master, or slave. . . . We
are ocean. We are sky. We are
earth. We are dust, and unto
dust we shall return.
Who? Who? Who? The young
ask the question of identity and
they key word, Honesty, is sec
ond. Social and political con
sciousness is third. The work
ethic, the business ethic, the
ethic of how to, is losing its ap
peal. It is not sufficiently hu
man. This change in funda
mental values is profound and
disruptive. Consequently, there
is grave danger of even a vio
lent revolution. Families will
break up, and universities will
see further troubles. Parents and
administrators know very well
what worked for their genera
tion, and they are loathe to see

young people go in a direction
that seems so little like their
own. I do not want to enter into
family disputes, but if I may, I
would like to enter just one word
of advice of those who are over
thirty — I promise that it will
be good advice, honest advice,
kindly advice, (in a word) Amer
ican advice. If you must aim
artillery at children of yours
who are going hippie, wearing
beards, speaking of I-thou, com
munity, identity and the rest —
if you must aim artillery, don't
fire until you see the whites of
their eyes. For, just perhaps, if
they get that close you will see
— not a product of Stanford,
not a computer, not a son or
daughter "who turned out just
the way you had it programmed"
—but a who, a Thou, a person.
And, just possibly, that person
will know secrets about life to
which you were never intro
duced, even thought a part of
you has been longing to know
them.
We are on the threshold of
a powerful revolution. I hope
that when we meet back here
again, the year after 1976, not
too many of us will have died
in wars, not too many of us will
have died of indifference and
routine, not too many of us will
have given up pursuing the mys
tery opened up by the question
WHO — and that all of us will,
in the words of Camus, have
done some little "to diminish by
at least a few the number of
those who suffer."


MICHAEL NOVAK
(Editor's Note: Michael No
vak, assistant professor of reli
gion, delivered this address to
the graduating seniors and their
parents during the June com
mencement activities.
In his two years of teaching,
he has fast become one of Stan
ford's highly regarded profes
sors. His books include "Belief
and Unbelief" and 'The Open
Church.")
What I would like to talk
about is the difficult period
through which our country is
about to pass. America seems
increasingly torn with dissen
sion. Parents everywhere are
having trouble understanding
their children.
But even young people dis
agree among themselves. Many
ypung men willingly serve their
nation in Vietnam. Yet in un
precedented numbers young
men believe that their govern
ment is involved in a war of
which they cannot morally or
politically approve; some are ap
plying for conscientious objec
tion; others are protesting
against the whole selective ser
vice system by sending back
their draft cards. There are con
flicting sets of values among
Americans — conservatives can
hardly talk to liberals, and vice
versa. If one speaks on public
subjects, the volume of hate
mail that comes to one's door is
truly frightening. But dissen
sion is not only verbal. Nearly
every week, the National Guard
is called out in this state or in
that, to quell a riot of American
citizens who seek justice, human
decency, or simply an outlet for
the quiet, desperate rage that
has been building up within
them. The use of force, hereto
fore covert in daily American
life, is becoming overt.
Just nine years from now, the
year before the tenth annual
alumni reunion at which we will
hope to welcome many of you
back, in 1976, the United States
will celebrate the two-hundreth
anniversary of its Declaration
of Independence. It is likely, I
think, that before 1976 the
United States will have experi
enced another Revolution . . .
a further extension of the Revo
lution of 1776. It seems to me
that the new revolution has al
ready begun, and that is why
we feel so many divisions in
our midst, so much discomfort.
It is as if America was once
sent upon an errand, and that
errand has not been accom
plished. Many are uncertain,
now, who it was that conceived
that errand. Many others won
der whether it has not been
a fool's errand, leading to sub
urban triviality, to urban ugli
ness, to reckless military power,
to boredom, to a meaningless
and unmentionable death.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote once,
in The Great Gatsby, of those
early Dutch sailors who regard
ed the vista of Long Island. The
sight inspired in them, he said,
"The last and greatest of all
human dreams: for a transitory,
enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the pres
ence of this continent, compelled
into an aesthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor de
sired, face to face for the last
time in history with something
commensurate to his capacity
to wonder."
The New Order
To this day, on the American
dollar bill there is inscribed a
touching boast: Novus Ordo Se
clorum — which, now that the
Catholic Church has switched to
English, I suppose we may
translate: "The New Order of
the Ages."
America was to have been"the
new world." Why then, today,
does it look so much like the old
world? British soldiers on the
continent maintained a "benevo
lent empire." Now it is America
whose industries grow rich,
while other nations become poor
er and poorer. "Law and order"

in the world, to a remarkable
extent, means American law and
order. And within America, it
means white law and order.
White American Christians are
quite humble and modest about
this. They consider the rest of
the world lucky to be protected
and maintained by a godly, un
selfish, Christian people. It is
rather comforting to be wealthy
and godly, powerful and good,
present everywhere and territori
ally unselfish. America has
mastered the secret of ruling
the world without appearing to,
of not letting the left hand know
what the right is doing.
Many of the young — a good
number of those hex - e in Stan
ford's graduating class of 1967
— still hold within them, how
ever, that "the last and greatest
of all human dreams" of which
Fitzgerald wrote. They recognize
that in proportion as they are
free and responsible citizens of
this land, they are guilty for all
the things our government does,
or does not do, in their name.
Many of them have an acute so
cial and political consciousness.
They are not satisfied with the
progress of the American revolu
tion. As one of them wrote two
weeks ago in a term paper:
"We are beginning to take ser
iously all those words that we
have heard in sermons and com
mencement addresses all our
lives: love, justice, liberty, equal
ity. But those who spoke those
words seem to be frightened
when we take them seriously."
Best Of Everything'
The Class of 1967, here and
throughout the land, is probably
the wealthiest and the most se
cure in terms of work and op
portunity of any in the history
of the world. Those parents and
educators who thought that they
could be content with "being
given the best of everything,"
however, have miscalculated.
Man does not live by bread alone.
College students do not live by
security. A new revolution, con
sequently, has begun. Many
young dress differently; they
wear their hair differently; they
think differently; they feel dif
ferently. Many of them have
come to realize that despite our
selves, we live in a racist coun
try. They see that, despite our
selves, we are militarists; few
are shocked at spending billions
to bomb an underdeveloped na
tion — an average of $300,000
to kill each of the enemy gueril
las in Vietnam. To many young
er people, the world they have
grown up in, however segregated
and sheltered domestically, like
the world of Kafka or Catch 22,
is quite mad.
One other thing one discovers
if one listens to the songs of the
young is that many are afraid
of death — no, not so much
afraid as certain that it is com
ing. In the year many students
here were born, the United

States dropped an atomic bomb
on two crowded Asiatic cities.
Many have heard the buzzing
of that bomb all their lives.
Sometimes, awakened by a loud
noise in the night, the first thing
they think of is the bomb. They
have never known the meaning
of peace; since their birth they
have been told that their nation
is threatened by enemies — even
though their nation is vastly
superior to every other on the
earth.
Consequently, the young do
not always have the same sense
of values as the old — among
whom, being a little over thirty,
I include myself. For the older
generation, whether conservative
or liberal, the key words which
unlock the meaning of human
life are HOW TO: How to make
money, how to win friends and
influence people, how to win at
bridge, how to master the sec
rets of nature, how to predict
and to control, how to make a
contribution to society, how to
live a productive life. The as
sumption behind the phrase
"how to" is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing out products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively,
flexibly programmed to advance
the aims of society. A successful
human being is one who knows
how to. He mixes well in com
pany and he has good old Amer
ican know-how. (Incidentally,
one of the most important tech
niques for Americans to master
is how to smile. A good Ameri
can is a friendly American, and
a friendly American is a happy
American.)
How To And Who
Many in the younger genera
tion do not, however, think of
Americans as happy but as hol
low — nice people, good people,
but emptied-out people, com
puters. However, the student of
the present generation is rich,
comparatively. His parents have
worked hard so that he could be
where he is. In order to put him
where he is, his parents have
had to learn how to. How to
is an important, even indispens
able, question for students to
master. Many younger people,
nevertheless, now have the op
portunity to ask a further and
also indispensable question.
Their primary question is not
HOW TO, but WHO. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?
Where are we going? What are
we doing here, under those
stars, here in the wind? Who?
Who? Who?

The young American does not
have to take a job. This is not
the Depression. He doesn't see
much point simply in piling up
more power and more money.
Moreover, even if he is a highly
trained scientist or engineer, he
has already come to see that the
fundamental technological ques
tion is no longer: "Can we do
X?" — for given enough time
and money, of course we can.
The fundamental question is:
"Should we do X?" And that
question depends on who we
think we are, what we think it
is to be a human being.
The revolution of 1976, then,
will be a human revolution. The
American errand may be to
cease thinking of nature as
something out there to be mas
tered. The American errand may
now be to stai L thinking of the
world as part of the self. Here
tofore, the chief American verbs
have been "doing" and "having;"
at last, "being" is getting its
chance. The question HOW TO
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion WHO makes a man a self
and the world a thou: it opens a
man to beauty, to wonder, and
to joy. The question HOW TO
leads, inexorably to power, and
finally to military power. The
question WHO leads to flower
power.
Who Are We?
These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not sepa
rate from us, a dumb, hard en
vironment, as if we were (in
Alan Watts' phrase) "an ego in
a bag of skin" surrounded by
foreign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
