## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the
second of two articles describing
Stanford's new club sports divi
sion of the Athletic Department
The first article concluded with
department plans for financial
aid.)
Dutch Fehring, director of the
Club Teams Division, states,
"We will not provide any organ
ization for a specific fund rais
ing event. This will be left to
the intiative of the students. We
will however, try to provide an
overall framework for fund-rais
ing activities by club teams."
Fehring and the other mem
bers of the Athletic Department
feel that leaving the details up
to students is in accordance with
the division's advisory role.
Can Apply For Awards
The club teams will also be
able to apply for traditional Uni
versity sports awards. However,
criteria will have to be submitted

to the Athletic Department in
detail.
"We won't have any overall
standard that each club team
will have to meet," says Fehring.
"It will depend on the team and
the individual. We don't want to
minimize the value of the award
by giving away too many."
One standard Fehring will
'look for is the number of teams
outside Stanford the club com
petes against. In this area the
athletic department will be able
to help with scheduling arrange
ments.
However, as a bonus, the De
partment will provide at no cost
the club team jacket for team
members who win NCAA, na
tional, or international cham
pionships.
Last year, for 4 example, mem
bers of the sailing club won the
Kennedy Cup at Annapolis, Md.
This was equivalent to a na
tional championship.

Club teams will be able to
apply for intercollegiate sports
status if they are approved by
the Advisory Committee on Ath
letics and have been in opera
tion for at least four years.
Other requirements include
numerous competitors within a
450 mile radius of Stanford and
a recognized conference or or
ganization for scheduling prob
lems.
Fehring sees the club teams
division as a potentially large
organization within the Athletic
Department.
"We will help the students as
much as they desire," Fehring
states. "How large and meaning
ful the clubs become," he adds,
"depends on how much club
members are willing to devote
themselves. As with everything
else here, the student only gets
out what he puts in."

overall framework for fund-rais
ing activities by club teams."
Fehring and the other mem
bers of the Athletic Department
feel that leaving the details up
to students is in accordance with
the division's advisory role.
Can Apply For Awards
The club teams will also be
able to apply for traditional Uni
versity sports awards. However,
criteria will have to be submitted

to the Athletic Department in
detail.
"We won't have any overall
standard that each club team
will have to meet," says Fehring.
"It will depend on the team and
the individual. We don't want to
minimize the value of the award
by giving away too many."
One standard Fehring will
'look for is the number of teams
outside Stanford the club com
petes against. In this area the
athletic department will be able
to help with scheduling arrange
ments.
However, as a bonus, the De
partment will provide at no cost
the club team jacket for team
members who win NCAA, na
tional, or international cham
pionships.
Last year, for 4 example, mem
bers of the sailing club won the
Kennedy Cup at Annapolis, Md.
This was equivalent to a na
tional championship.

Club teams will be able to
apply for intercollegiate sports
status if they are approved by
the Advisory Committee on Ath
letics and have been in opera
tion for at least four years.
Other requirements include
numerous competitors within a
450 mile radius of Stanford and
a recognized conference or or
ganization for scheduling prob
lems.
Fehring sees the club teams
division as a potentially large
organization within the Athletic
Department.
"We will help the students as
much as they desire," Fehring
states. "How large and meaning
ful the clubs become," he adds,
"depends on how much club
members are willing to devote
themselves. As with everything
else here, the student only gets
out what he puts in."
