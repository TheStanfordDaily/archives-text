# Aims For 'Good Theater'
## 'New' SRT To Open This Season 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
The Stanford Repertory The
ater (SRT) opens its third sea
son this fall as a company of
artists in residence combining
a professional theater for Stan
ford and the Bay Area with
training for those interested in
the theater.
Acting Artistic Director Ger
ald Hiken explains that it is
imporant for the resident pro
fessional theater to be first of
all a good theater. "If it is good,
it will be a better place for

training graduate students," he
said.
Reorganization has reduced
the number of senior artists
from nine to three. Stanford
students will therefore have
more opportunities to partici
pate in SRT productions. Addi
tional professional actors will
be brought in only as they are
needed for particular shows.
Reasons For Reduction
Reasons given for the cutback
vary, but contributing causes are
that the larger group proved

unwieldy, that members wish
to experiment with different
uses of the resident company,
and that SRT had some financial
difficulties last year.
According to Hiken, nine reg
ular actors is too many for a
company like SRT. In an aver
age play there are only three
or four major roles, so at any
one time, over half the company
"was not being used productive
ly." He added, "Professionals
were playing roles graduate stu
dents should have been play
ing."
Student Participation
Robert Sears, Dean of the
School of Humanities and Scien
ces, feels that the SRT must be
"a central part of our graduate
program in drama." He believes
the university must experiment
with SRT to find how it can
most effectively provide "a
chance for advanced students to
have occasional participation in
a professional company" and
"add a group of professional
theater people to the environ
ment in which students are
studying."
While there are many advan
tages to a smaller professional
staff, the fact remains that SRT
had little choice but to some
how reduce its expenses. Richard
W. Lyman, provost, called the
last two years of SRT an "agoni
zing experience" in an article by
Howard Taubman, critic-at-large
for the New York Times.
Taubman's article of Septem
ber 15 went on to say that "ex
penses outran income by more
than $100,000 a year, despite an
annual grant of that size from

the Rockefeller Foundation. The
reserves to underwrite the pro
gram were depleted in one-third
the projected time."
Another Change
The reorgnization of SRT also
involves a change in the loca
tion of many SRT productions.
"Only one show will be produced
in Memorial Auditorium this
year. The others will be pro
duced in the Nitery or the Little
Theater," Hiken said.
Memorial Auditorium is too
large for any productions short
of spectaculars, and according

to Hiken the company is looking
forward to the more intimate
actor-audience relationship pos
sible in a smaller theater. An
other possible reason for this
change is that many other
groups objected to the SRT oc
cupying Memorial Auditorium
for such long periods of time.
Dean Sears says the Univer
sity realizes the need for a me
dium-size theater and adds that
"the University staff is current
ly working vigorously on plans
for a new theater to house the
company."

had little choice but to some
how reduce its expenses. Richard
W. Lyman, provost, called the
last two years of SRT an "agoni
zing experience" in an article by
Howard Taubman, critic-at-large
for the New York Times.
Taubman's article of Septem
ber 15 went on to say that "ex
penses outran income by more
than $100,000 a year, despite an
annual grant of that size from

the Rockefeller Foundation. The
reserves to underwrite the pro
gram were depleted in one-third
the projected time."
Another Change
The reorgnization of SRT also
involves a change in the loca
tion of many SRT productions.
"Only one show will be produced
in Memorial Auditorium this
year. The others will be pro
duced in the Nitery or the Little
Theater," Hiken said.
Memorial Auditorium is too
large for any productions short
of spectaculars, and according

to Hiken the company is looking
forward to the more intimate
actor-audience relationship pos
sible in a smaller theater. An
other possible reason for this
change is that many other
groups objected to the SRT oc
cupying Memorial Auditorium
for such long periods of time.
Dean Sears says the Univer
sity realizes the need for a me
dium-size theater and adds that
"the University staff is current
ly working vigorously on plans
for a new theater to house the
company."
The Stanford Repertory The
ater (SRT) opens its third sea
son this fall as a company of
artists in residence combining
a professional theater for Stan
ford and the Bay Area with
training for those interested in
the theater.
Acting Artistic Director Ger
ald Hiken explains that it is
imporant for the resident pro
fessional theater to be first of
all a good theater. "If it is good,
it will be a better place for

training graduate students," he
said.
Reorganization has reduced
the number of senior artists
from nine to three. Stanford
students will therefore have
more opportunities to partici
pate in SRT productions. Addi
tional professional actors will
be brought in only as they are
needed for particular shows.
Reasons For Reduction
Reasons given for the cutback
vary, but contributing causes are
that the larger group proved

unwieldy, that members wish
to experiment with different
uses of the resident company,
and that SRT had some financial
difficulties last year.
According to Hiken, nine reg
ular actors is too many for a
company like SRT. In an aver
age play there are only three
or four major roles, so at any
one time, over half the company
"was not being used productive
ly." He added, "Professionals
were playing roles graduate stu
dents should have been play
ing."
Student Participation
Robert Sears, Dean of the
School of Humanities and Scien
ces, feels that the SRT must be
"a central part of our graduate
program in drama." He believes
the university must experiment
with SRT to find how it can
most effectively provide "a
chance for advanced students to
have occasional participation in
a professional company" and
"add a group of professional
theater people to the environ
ment in which students are
studying."
While there are many advan
tages to a smaller professional
staff, the fact remains that SRT
had little choice but to some
how reduce its expenses. Richard
