# Class Rank Is Abolished
## 
### 
Class ranking for undergrad
uates ends this month at Stan
ford.
The action, recommended last
May by the Academic Council,
was approved June 16 by the
Board of Trusteesâ€”one day
after Congress agreed on a new
draft bill abolishing ranking as
a criterion for student defer
ment.
Graduates and undergradu
ates may still obtain their rank
ings from individual schools and
departments.
Employment Recommendations
Registrar Harvey Hall said,
aside from draft deferments,
rankings had been used mainly
in recommendations for employ
ment and graduate and profes
sional schools.
He doubted the move would
have harmful effects, since stu
dents can still get rankings
from their departments. "We
are not alone," he added. Other
universities, including Columbia
and Chicago, also do not rank
their undergraduates.
Specialty Important
Engineering Dean Joseph M.
Pettit pointed out the main con
cern is a student's work in his
specialty, not his overall aver
age.
The Academic Council's May
recommendation made no spe
cific reference to the draft.
The council's executive com
mittee said "the present system
of class rankings does not serve
the purposes for which it was
designed" and "as a measuring
device is of questionable valid
ity."
