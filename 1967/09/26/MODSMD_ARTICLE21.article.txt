# Positions Open In Gaieties Cast
## 
### 
Tryouts for 1967 Big Game
Gaieties will continue tonight
and tomorrow night from 7:30-
10:00 on the Main Stage of
Memorial Auditorium.
Alan Mokler, director of this
year's production termed the
first night turn out "gratifying,"
but added, "There are still plenty
Df positions which have not
been filled on the technical staff,
and I have absolutely no idea
who will finally be in the cast."
Robert Stone, producer of
Gaieties, commented, "We need
all kinds of people. Positions are
open for actors, dancers, singers,
seamstresses, carpenters, light
ing technicians, and office per
sonnel. Experience is definitely
not a requirement."
