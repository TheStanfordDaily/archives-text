# Paying Plan Is Remodeled
## 
### 
Several major changes have
been made in the student defer
red payment plan this year. Any
one can now defer up to two
thirds of the combined tuition
and room and board bill.
According to the cashier's of
fice, arrangements for deferred
payments must be made in the
Pavilion during registration. At
least one-third of tuition must
be paid by today unless special
arrangements are made with the
office. Students unable to pay at
this time may request a ten-day
postponement of the due date
at a special table in the Pavilion.
Although room and board
bills are not due for ten days
students intending to delay part
of the payment must fill out a
deferment form today.
