Minneapolis, Minn. (CPS)—
The Air Force has cancelled
a research project at the Uni
versity of Minnesota which
was so secret that the Uni
versity's newly selected presi
dent didn't even know what
it was.
When the President, Mal
colm Moos, found out about
the project, he objected
strongly and said he didn't
want the University involved
in secret government re
search.
But the Air Force said it
cancelled renewal of the two
year $200,000 contract be
cause of "lack of funds," not
Moos' objections. The lack of
funds was supposedly caused
by the Viet Nam war.
The Minnesota Daily has

police were involved.
