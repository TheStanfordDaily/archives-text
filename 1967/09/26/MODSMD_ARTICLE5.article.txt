# 'Misunderstanding’
## Provost Comments On Letter 
### 
Yesterday The Daily described
how ASSU President Peter Ly
man's letter to freshmen was
excluded from the Pre-Reg
Packet by University officials. It
was mailed separately.
The letter touched on educa
tion, the University, and confor
mity In society.
Stanford Vice-President and
Provost Richard W. Lyman dis
cussed the letter in an interview
with Michael Sweeney, Daily
News Editor. Excerpts of the
interview follow.
Interviewer: Peter Lyman was
informed of the decision not to in
clude his letter by Peter Haas
of the Pre-Reg commission ...
Provost: ... at Peter Haas' re
quest, that's right. Dean (Joel)
Smith had offered to take the
matter up with Peter Lyman
directly but Haas said, inasmuch
as he was co-chairman of Pre-
Reg, that it was his responsi
bility to take the matter up with
Peter Lyman and that's what he
did. Then Peter went to see
Dean Smith.
Interviewer: Was there any
intention to prevent this letter
from reaching freshmen at all?
Provost: There appears to

have been a misunderstanding
between Peter (Lyman) and us
initially on that score. It was
entirely clear, on the basis of
my discussion with him, that he
had not fully understood that
there was no intention to stop
him from communicating. Why
he had not realized this 1 can
not begin to say.
Not one of us heard exactly
what Peter Haas told him. I
didn't hear the beginnings of his
meeting with Joel Smith. But
certainly Joel's intention from
the outset was to make clear
what we eventually did make
clear, namely, that whereas we
thought it inappropriate to send
it with the information packet,
we were in no way trying to
prevent him from communicat
ing the contents of that or any
other letter to the freshmen
our only concern was that we did
not think it an appropriate ele
ment in an information packet.
Interviewer: You call it a let
ter "full of argument and opin
ion, with no adequate explana
tion of why it (would be) there
(in the Pre-Reg packet)."
Provost: I think an adequate
explanation would have been
very difficult to arrive at. This
contained none at all. I mean
(the letter) didn't say anything
to the effect of "As you know,
there are many controversies
about the nature of higher edu
cation; different people hold dif
ferent views. . . . Partly, I think
the difficulty of this kind of
communication in advance, be
fore the students get here, is
precisely this: It is very hard to

cluc them in as to how the thing
fits into the broader picture.
Interviewer: Perspective?
Provost: That's right. Of what
the problems are and who thinks
what about them. But this really
isn't central. I think Peter's en
titled to have his try at getting
them started thinking about
the meaning of higher education
early on. That's not at issue.
Interviewer: Do you think that
for future freshman classes it
would be a good idea for letters
of this sort — from students,
faculty or administrators — to
be sent to start freshmen think
ing about campus issues before
they get here?
Provost: That's conceivable
but I think the experience of
this year may show that it's
rather difficult to find exactly
the right medium of expression.
In trying to communicate with
people whose knowledge of Stan
ford is bound to be limited —
not at first hand. ... I think
the discussion and study of such
problems after they get here is
probably more useful than that
which goes before.
I certainly think that reading
about the issues of higher edu
cation before a person comes to
college is a good idea. I think it
would be a better way to encour
age that if you were going to
suggest reading lists that pre
sented a broader spectrum of
opinions than the reading list
suggested by Peter Lyman (in
his letter). That was another
contributing factor to my saying
that I considered it an argu
mentative expression of opinion
rather than a survey of a set
of problems — it was very defi
nitely one way of looking at a
set of problems.
Interviewer: And although
you would take issue, of course,
with some of the assertions in
the letter . . .
Provost: With some of them,
not with others.
Interviewer: With some of
them. You still had no objection
to him sending this letter to
freshmen.
Provost: None whatever.
Interviewer: Peter offered to
have another Jetter from you
sent along with his, presenting
different views.
Provost: I don't think that any
other point of view necessarily
has to be expressed every time
his point of view is expressed.
Frankly, it seems to me confus
ing rather than enlightening to
have us send informational ma
terials, along with a letter from
the student body president, and
a letter from the provost or one
of the vice-provosts or somebody
else, apparently taking issue
with the student body president's
letter. Yet there were lots of
things in the student body presi
dent's letter with which we
wouldn't want to take issue any
way.
Everybody's in favor of open
questions, openly arrived at and
so on. It just seemed a lot more
sensible from the point of view
of the receiving end for them to
get whatever the student body
president wanted to send them,
for his own purposes, on his own
imprint rather than mixed up
with official materials about
where you go for this, that, and
the other thing, what your re
quirements are and all the rest
of it.
Interviewer: Peter has said
that this incident raises certain
issues on the relationship of the
ASSU to the Dean's office. The

first, he said, is "academic free
dom in the university."
Provost: I flatly disagree with
that because I think that as long
as he's free to communicate he
can't really complain of abuse of
academic freedom. It seems to
me this was an administrative
question of what the appropriate
channel of communication was,
not an attempt to block any
channel of communication.
In the end, the letter was sent
out with the ASSU paying the
postage without any attempt to
change it or block it. So I don't
really see where the academic
freedom issue comes in. The
other issue is a more debatable
one . . .
Interviewer: As he phrases it,
"ASSU financing and indepen
dence from the Dean's Office,"
and he points out that the Pre-
Reg mailing is an ASSU proj
ect, as is Pre-Reg itself, with
ASSU funds.
Provost: There's more of a
real issue there. I think Pre-Reg
obviously serves University pur
poses and not just ASSU pur
poses. It has been delegated to
the ASSU and they've generally
done a very good job.
But that doesn't really mean
that we in this part of the Uni
versity have no more interest in
it, or no concern over how it's

done. It may that we have to
have more of a meeting of minds
about some of these questions—
I wouldn't deny that . . .
Interviewer: Do you think it
would be useful in future Pre-
Registrations to define exactly
what is the student responsi
bility and what is the Dean's
responsibility in the Pre-Reg
operation?
Provost: Well, I think it would
be useful to have some further
discussion in light of this, and
other problems. I don't know
quite what it might lead to,
whether it would lead to —
what did you say? a clearer de
lineation? or whether it might
lead to a clearer cooperation, it's
hard to say.
Interviewer: Well, Peter said
that he considers this an issue
of ASSU independence ... do
you agree that the ASSU's inde
pendence is in any way involved?
Provost: Well, I suppose it's
pretty hard to deny that, isn't it?
That is, if those representatives
of ASSU who are conducting
Pre-Reg are in any way inter
fered with, then you can say
their independence has been
interfered with. But what I'm
trying to suggest is that if part
of the University undertakes a


PROVOST LYMAN
function that has all-University
consequences, University - wide
implications, then it's going to
be pretty difficult to assert that
all aspects of that function have
been removed from the say-so
of people whose responsibility
for the total welfare of the Uni
versity is very great.
Interviewer: I understand
there was a response to the let
ter from parents of freshmen.
Provost: I have not seen this
at first hand but I have heard
that there were questions raised
by people who misread the en
velope and thought that it came
from the Dean of Students office,
and wanted to know why the Uni
versity was officially sponsor
ing a letter which, among other
things, appeared to question the
University's devotion to free in
quiry. Our answer to that was
that it did not come from the
Dean of Students office. It was a
personal expression of views of
the President of the ASSU. . . .
I personally don't see any cause
for objection to his having ex
pressed himself.
Interviewer: Thank you, Dr.
Lyman.
