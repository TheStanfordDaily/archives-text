Jordan, Branner, Wilbur, Tre
sidder, Sterling, and . . . the
search goes on.
Stanford's hunt for a new
President is now in progress.
With eleven months to go be
fore President Wallace Ster
ling's September 1, 1968, pro
posed retirement date; trustee
and faculty committees have
been meeting jointly each
month.
The committees have drawn
up a list now of acceptable can
didates and has "ordered" them,
revealed Law Professor William
F. Baxter, chairman of the fac
ulty advisory committee, last
Sunday.
John Gardner?
According to the San Jose
Mercury, sources close to the
committees have revealed that
John W. Gardner, Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare
and a Stanford alumnus, is their
first choice.
Other sources have said that
the list of candidates was pre
sented and accepted last Thurs
day by the Board of Trustees.
This was denied by Professor
Baxter.
A source close to Gardner in

Washington said last Saturday
that he has definitely not ac
cepted any Stanford offer.
Events during the past year
have indicated that Stanford
and John Gardner may be inter
ested in one another.
Last fall, he dedicated both
the Graduate School of Business
and the J. Henry Meyer Memor
ial Library. He has since been
on campus at least three times,
including once during the sum
mer for the wedding of Presi
dent Sterling's daughter. He
also spent a recent weekend
near San Jose at the ranch of
Trustee David Packard, a mem
ber of the trustee selection com
mittee.
Carnegie Retirement
The Secretary also recently
retired as Carnegie Foundation
president, a post he had held
in absentia since he became a
Cabinet member.
On the other hand, Gardner
has said in response to reports
that he is being considered for
the presidency of various major
universties, "I am not available.
I am heavily occupied in a job
to which I am very deeply com
mitted."
"There is a whole scries of ob

jectives I have set for myself.
I must carry them out in justice
to the people I have asked to
work with me and in justice
to the President."
A staff member in the Office
of Edrcation pointed out there
is "a great personal loyalty to
Mr. Gardner throughout the De
partment." he added, "It would
be a shame to lose him to Stan
ford."
Sterling Retirement
At that time, Sterling had no
comment on a search for his
successor and pointed out, "The
decision is entirely the Board's
and speculation now is foolish."
The Board of Trustees com
mittee to select a new President
consists of Board President W.
Parmer Fuller and Trustees
Roger Lewis, Chairman, Judge
Ben C. Duniway, Morris M.
Doyle, and David Packard.
The faculty advisory commit
tee, elected at large by the fac
ulty, includes Professors Bax
ter; Leonard I. Schiff, physics;
Robert J. Glaser, medicine; Don
ald Kennedy, biology; Thomas
C. Moser, English; Joseph M.
Pettit, engineering; and David
M. Potter, history.
Speculation
Speculation in the past on pos
sible successors in addition to
Gardner has included Vice Presi
dent and Provost Richard Ly
man, Business School Dean
Ernest Arbuckle, Provost David
B. Truman of Columbia, and
Secretary of Defense Robert
MacNamara.
Sterling, in his nineteenth
year as President, has seen as
President:
• The first comprehensive re
view of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford (in 1955).
• A successful $100 million
PACE (Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era) campaign in
1963 to set a new high for pri
vate support in capital cam
paigns of American academic
institutions.
• An extraordinary increase
in the quality of the faculty.
• The initiation of the first
review of the entire institution,

the Study of Education at Stan
ford.
John Gardner said of Sterling,
in his undergraduate library
dedication speech, "He has con
tributed more than any other
human being to the remarkable
advance that Stanford has made
among the great universities of
this land. We owe him our
thanks."
