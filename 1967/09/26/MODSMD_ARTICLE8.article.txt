# Teenager To Teach Math
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
When classes open tomorrow,
an assistant professor who is
younger than a large majority
of Stanford students will be
among the ranks of the faculty.
Harvey M. Friedman will be
gin teaching two graduate
\courses in mathematics even
though he turned 19 only last
Saturday.
Friedman, who never formally
graduated from high school or
college, received confirmation
from MIT last Thursday of the
award of a Ph.D. degree in
mathematics.
Youngest in History
Needless to say, Friedman is
the youngest professor in Stan
ford's history and the youngest
to receive a doctorate from MIT.
Friedman will teach mathe
matical logic in the Philosophy
Department. His two courses for
this quarter are Philosophy 293 a,
Recursion Theory and Philo
sophy 391 a, Seminar in Foun
dations of Mathematics.
He is basically interested in
pure mathematical research, and
much of his work involves com
puters.
Friedman explains his mathe
matical brilliance by stating that
"I just got curious." He got so
curious by the second and third
grades he was doing sixth
through eighth grade mathe
matics. By the time he was 15,
he had passed all exams for
high school math.
MIT At Sixteen
This exceptional performance,
in addition to counselors' recom
mendations and college board
scores, won him admittance to
MIT shortly before he was 16.
Friedman kept up the same
pace at MIT. After two years of
undergraduate work, the Depart
ment of Mathematics recom
mended that he be admitted di
rectly to graduate work because

of his outstanding research
ability in mathematical logic.
From that point, it took him
only one year to complete doc
torate requirements.
Despite his precocity, Fried
man maintains that he had "a
completely normal boyhood." He
grew up in Highland Park, Illi
nois, and attended Highland
Park High School. His father
runs a photo typesetting plant
in nearby Skokie.
No Problems
Friedman claims that he had
"no special problems because of
my age" in college. He went to
"the usual dates and dances at
MIT . . . but nothing too heavy."
Even though most of his stu
dents will be six or seven years
older than he is, he said that

this "won't make any difference
to me. I think it's going to be
fun." Friedman will earn "some
thing like $10,000 a year" at
Stanford.
Asked for his opinion of Amer
ican education, Friedman com
mented that people are "locked
in by education . . . Everyone
has more creative ability than
he is allowed to express."
Creativity and Luck
"The pressures of American
society are too great to allow
for creativity unless you get
lucky. I was lucky."
To aid creativity, Friedman
would have educational institu
tions loosen some of their re
quirements for any student who
shows exceptional abilities in
any subject.

Friedman believes that "stu
dents should have an increasing
voice in their own social lives.
To a large extent, students
should be able to do what they
want within the law." Univer
sities, he feels, should fail stu
dents only for "academic rea
sons."
On the other hand, Friedman
stated that subject matter and
details of curriculum should be
left to faculty control.
On Demonstrations
On the subject of demonstra
tions, Friedman said, "I don't
see anything wrong with demon
strations." At first, he refused to
discuss the subject of the draft,
but later admitted that, he had
been given an occupational de
ferrment.
He finds it ironic that many
young people — such as himself
and those in the armed forces —
make large contributions to so
ciety but are unable to vote.
It doesn't bother him, however,
that he is unable to drink since
he "doesn't like the taste of the
stuff."
For relaxation, Dr. Friedman
prefers playing the piano (he
has considered a concert career),
playing chess ("I am not a very
good player") and discussing
philosophy. At MIT, he spent a
lot of time with professors. He
admits that he "spends a little
too much time at my job."
While freshmen his age must
live within the confines of Stan
ford dorms, the 5 feet 3 inches
tall professor will live in an
East Palo Alto apartment. His
campus office Is 384-H.
Finally, he was asked about
his relationship with Stanford
coeds, many of them his own
age. He acted slightly surprised.
"I guess this is a problem. I
haven't given it any thought," he
said with a smile.
