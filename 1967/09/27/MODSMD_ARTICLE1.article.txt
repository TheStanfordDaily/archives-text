A court suit filed by Kappa

against rock singer Wilson Pick
ett for failure to show up at a
concert last May.
The fraternity, sponsors of
the concert charged that nearly
2,000 fans turned out for the
performance. The fraternity has
sued Pickett for $11,000 dam
ages.
Pickett's agents, however,
have already returned $1,500, the
amount of the fraternity's de
posit.
Bogged Down
Marvin S. Siegel, Menlo Park
attorney representing the fra
ternity, said that the suit "is
bogged down in the legal settle
ment."
Siegel said there may be a
trial and that "it could be a
while." He is not sure on what
grounds Pickett and his agents
'.nay contest the suit.
He did disclose he thought
Pickett "has a rather weak
case."
Siegel explained that Pickett
had performed in Los Angeles
the Friday before the Monday
■afternoon Stanford concert. He
\simply did not make it in time
for the Stanford show and did
not tell the fraternity he wasn't
going to come.
Damage to Reputation
Besides the already-returned
$1,500 deposit, the Kappa Sigs
suing for $3,500 they claim
\hey spent on preparations and
promotion, $1,000 prospective
profit, and $5,000 for "damage to
their reputation."
Siegel disclosed negotiations
are under way with Pickett's
New York attorneys, but that no
definite settlement is expected
v'or at least 30 days.
A fraternity member said
there is a possibility Pickett may
come to the campus for a con
cert within the next few months
as a form of settlement. There
has been no official confirmation
«112 the plan.
