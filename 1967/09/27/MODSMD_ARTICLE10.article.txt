## Study of Education 
### 
The Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
may stagnate for want of enthusiasm. In the eight
months since the formation of the Steering Com
mittee, interest and excitement over the Study
has fallen drastically. As the new academic year
begins, the Study faces a University which asks:
"Can anything be expected from SES during the
coming year?"
tt is projected that most topic committees will
report next fall or winter and not during the
academic year. This fact does not stimulate en
thusiastic participation in the Study this fall and
winter. It appears that the data-gathering and
planning that Has gone on during the past year
may continue throughout the next. If the Study
is to get anywhere, then this must be a year of
discussion and debate over what a Stanford edu
cation should be.
A year that is anything less will be a disaster
for the reform spirit and interest in education
that has been stimulated among students, fac
ulty and administration during the past year.
Last spring, SES failed to excite the great ma
jority of students, and has alienated many others.
Most of the faculty has remained unconcerned.
The unfortunate conflict over the selection of
the student members of the steering committee
embittered many students and as a reaction some
leaders of the Study. The Study is in many ways
too strictly defined and too closely directed.
Paradoxically, students have never found it so
easy to be involved in an administration-run proj
ect. Almost any student who shows some interest
in the Study is assured of some sort of participa
tion. The question which arises concerns the na
ture and meaning of that involvement. Many stu
dents and faculty have feared their reports would
end up as mere scraps on the growing pile of re
ports SES has collected.
Many questions have been raised concerning
the use of the reports that are submitted. If the
final topic committee reports are to be submitted
over a year from now, the reports done by any
particular person, whether faculty, student or
staff, will be very remote and forgotten when the
committees come to make those recommenda
tions.
If the involvement this year is to be concerned
only with data-gathering, then SES would do
better to expand its paid staff as it did this sum
mer and have it collect data full time.

How, then, will SES stimulate the enthusiasm
so essential to producing results this year?
First, it should encourage each committee to
submit reports during the coming year when
ever the committee feels ready. To project the
work of these committees over the next year and
a half creates a break in continuity next summer.
Perhaps the motivation for the slow progress of
these committees is to await the dictation of the
new President. However, the demands of Stan
ford education can hardly be defined by a single
man.
The second step is to encourage the joint SES
ASSU seminars which are planned for this fall
and winter. Such seminars have a time limit that
will give their deliberations an urgency and in
volvement for all who participate. Their incep
tion is a great boost to SES.
If the purpose of including the "questions for
consideration" outlined on the facing page is to
keep the community abreast of the Study and to
solicit the views on mat f ers of prime concern,
then the methods of communicating with the
University community must be drastically alter
ed from last year. In the first place, there was a
hesitation last year to allow any of the papers
submitted to the SES to fall into the hands of
non-Study personnel.
All papers and discussions of the SES and its
topic committees should be open to the public
and to the press. The Daily sees one of its major
goals this year as stimulating thought about the
educational issues raised by SES. It can do this
effectively by reporting the deliberations of the
many SES committees and by printing outstand
ing reports presented to the Study.
Some feel that administrators' specific views
on educational topics should not be public. If an
educator is hired for his competency in a parti
cular field, his views should be public informa
tion to all.
Involvement is something more than service
on committees and aid given to gather data. In
volvement, particularly for the student and fac
ulty who have other pressing responsibilities, is
essential to changes that are to be made in Stan
ford's educational programs.
Some feel nothing significant will come of the
Study of Education at Stanford — and if this
view is allowed to prevail, then the prime chance
Stanford has to revamp itself will be lost. It will
take too long to recreate the interest in educa
tional reform that exists today at Stanford.

end up as mere scraps on the growing pile of re
ports SES has collected.
Many questions have been raised concerning
the use of the reports that are submitted. If the
final topic committee reports are to be submitted
over a year from now, the reports done by any
particular person, whether faculty, student or
staff, will be very remote and forgotten when the
committees come to make those recommenda
tions.
If the involvement this year is to be concerned
only with data-gathering, then SES would do
better to expand its paid staff as it did this sum
mer and have it collect data full time.

How, then, will SES stimulate the enthusiasm
so essential to producing results this year?
First, it should encourage each committee to
submit reports during the coming year when
ever the committee feels ready. To project the
work of these committees over the next year and
a half creates a break in continuity next summer.
Perhaps the motivation for the slow progress of
these committees is to await the dictation of the
new President. However, the demands of Stan
ford education can hardly be defined by a single
man.
The second step is to encourage the joint SES
ASSU seminars which are planned for this fall
and winter. Such seminars have a time limit that
will give their deliberations an urgency and in
volvement for all who participate. Their incep
tion is a great boost to SES.
If the purpose of including the "questions for
consideration" outlined on the facing page is to
keep the community abreast of the Study and to
solicit the views on mat f ers of prime concern,
then the methods of communicating with the
University community must be drastically alter
ed from last year. In the first place, there was a
hesitation last year to allow any of the papers
submitted to the SES to fall into the hands of
non-Study personnel.
All papers and discussions of the SES and its
topic committees should be open to the public
and to the press. The Daily sees one of its major
goals this year as stimulating thought about the
educational issues raised by SES. It can do this
effectively by reporting the deliberations of the
many SES committees and by printing outstand
ing reports presented to the Study.
Some feel that administrators' specific views
on educational topics should not be public. If an
educator is hired for his competency in a parti
cular field, his views should be public informa
tion to all.
Involvement is something more than service
on committees and aid given to gather data. In
volvement, particularly for the student and fac
ulty who have other pressing responsibilities, is
essential to changes that are to be made in Stan
ford's educational programs.
Some feel nothing significant will come of the
Study of Education at Stanford — and if this
view is allowed to prevail, then the prime chance
Stanford has to revamp itself will be lost. It will
take too long to recreate the interest in educa
tional reform that exists today at Stanford.
The Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
may stagnate for want of enthusiasm. In the eight
months since the formation of the Steering Com
mittee, interest and excitement over the Study
has fallen drastically. As the new academic year
begins, the Study faces a University which asks:
"Can anything be expected from SES during the
coming year?"
tt is projected that most topic committees will
report next fall or winter and not during the
academic year. This fact does not stimulate en
thusiastic participation in the Study this fall and
winter. It appears that the data-gathering and
planning that Has gone on during the past year
may continue throughout the next. If the Study
is to get anywhere, then this must be a year of
discussion and debate over what a Stanford edu
cation should be.
A year that is anything less will be a disaster
for the reform spirit and interest in education
that has been stimulated among students, fac
ulty and administration during the past year.
Last spring, SES failed to excite the great ma
jority of students, and has alienated many others.
Most of the faculty has remained unconcerned.
The unfortunate conflict over the selection of
the student members of the steering committee
embittered many students and as a reaction some
leaders of the Study. The Study is in many ways
too strictly defined and too closely directed.
Paradoxically, students have never found it so
easy to be involved in an administration-run proj
ect. Almost any student who shows some interest
in the Study is assured of some sort of participa
tion. The question which arises concerns the na
ture and meaning of that involvement. Many stu
dents and faculty have feared their reports would
end up as mere scraps on the growing pile of re
ports SES has collected.
Many questions have been raised concerning
the use of the reports that are submitted. If the

committees come to make those recommenda
