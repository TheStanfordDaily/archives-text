# Letters To The Editor
## Join The Army And Play Football 
### 
Editor, The Daily: •
"One of the aims of Freshman
English," said Professor Robert
Polhemus last week to members
of the class of 1971, "is to show
you the power of language". He
then went on to add that people
daily use that power of language
to control the lives of other peo
ple.
In the first issue of The Daily
the Army ROTC placed a one
half page advertisement which
carried the remarks of Army
Chief of Staff, General Harold
K. Johnson. Drawing on the sea
son of the year and his own men
tality, Johnson proceeds to com
pare ROTC cadets and commis
sioned second lieutenants to
quarterbacks. "Capable and cool,
trained and tough", quarterbacks
keep their "opponents off-bal
ance, move the ball, and do their
share of the blocking and tack
ling". The U.S. Army is in much
the same position as a football
coach except its needs are great
er. The army requires 20,000
new "quarterbacks" each year.
Johnson extends the compari
son to suggest that these new
"quarterbacks" must lead a
"team that cannot settle for any
thing less than the conference
title season after season." And
now that the "rule book" has
been changed by virtue of the
ROTC Vitalization Act of 1964,
it is easier than ever to become
a "quarterback". Lastly, the
Army offers you the chance to
"score" twice with a college de
gree and "a position of leader
ship as an officer in the service
of your country."
If you believe this just to be
a chance example of an infre
quent extreme may I ask you to
take another look at your foot
ball program from the Stanford-
Kansas game on Saturday and
turn to the "Where Is He Now?"
page featuring close-ups of past
Stanford gridiron greats. There
you will find a photo of a former
player in full game uniform next
to another photo of him in com
bat fatigues surrounded by
smiling Vietnamese children.
Then the Stanford sports pub
licists take over.
"It may (my emphasis) seem
a long way from the playing
greens of Stanford to the fight
ing ground of South Vietnam,
but former Indian great, Marvin
K. Harris has made the transi
tion with typical coolness and
sense of purpose." "It appears
that Marv Harris draws a crowd
just about everywhere he goes,
judging from this picture taken
during a lull (sort of like half
time) in the Vietnam fighting."
After playing for Stanford Har
ris "later made a mark with the
professional Los Angeles Rams
before suiting up in a still differ
ent uniform." And for a grand
summation, the writer adds,
"Harris will report to Ft. Lewis
Washington, on November 28
where he will put to use his edu
cation and experience to teach
other soldiers the art of con
struction in an environment of
destruction."
Both of these writers have suc
cessfully used language to con
vey an otherwise unpalatable
message. To be a soldier is to
be a quarterback. To be the most
powerful force in the world is
like going to the Rose Bowl. War
is not hell, just an "environment
of destruction". To be a killer
is just a matter of changing
uniforms. Nate Kirkman can
only "score" once when he
crosses the goal line but you can
"score" twice.
It is common knowledge that
we are at war, that the Army
needs soldiers, and that a good
record in the service can lead
to a better job. To convert these
facts into the pleasantries of
Saturday afternoon football
games is, perhaps an example
of the addition of "wisdom" to
"knowledge" that President Ster

ling urged on all of the fresh
men in his convocation speech.

• Lots Of Parking
Editor, The Daily:
University Planner Oscar Nel
son has a difficult job, to be
sure; but it seems to me curious
that Stanford has reached a
state of maximum disrepair at
precisely the moment when the
number of people making de
mands on the facilities is great
est.
It is also doubtful how much
of an improvement some of the
construction under way or con
templated is likely to be. Pro
jected # roads and parking lots
will be* further than ever from
where most of us want to be.
Of course, we might get bikes
or even walk, as Mr. Nelson
urges. But does the gentleman
really intend those of us driving
to campus to park in some Si
berian lot, hop on our bikes for
the last mile or so, and then
later ride our bikes back to the
parking lots and them
when we reach our cars to drive
home? And what happens when
in the middle of the day we need
to go to the Computation Cen
ter with four boxes of IBM
cards? Do we walk or bike then
too?
There is something gro
tesquely odd about some of these
plans. Their effect is likely to be
an increase in inconvenience for
a vast number of people. Has
nobody in the Planning Office
considered erection of one or
more parking buildings closer to
the center of campus, behind the
Union for example? A parking
building would certainly be help
ful to many of us, to say nothing
of preserving additional areas
along the periphery from a fate
of asphalt.

• Shorter Service
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily article, "How to
Avoid the Draft" (September
22), as it pertained to the ser
vice obligation of ROTC gradu
ates, was inaccurate. The period
of active duty required of offi
cers varies among the services,
Army, Navy and Air Force.
Under present regulations Army
ROTC graduates will spend two
years on active duty — not
four years as indicated in your
article.
