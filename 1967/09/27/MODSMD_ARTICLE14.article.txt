# SES Committee Reports Issues Under Study
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Following are
excerpts from the "Interim Re
view and Report to the Faculty"
by Herbert L. Packer, chairman
of the Study of Education at
Stanford steering committee,
and by SES Staff Director Rob
ert It. Hind. The revised report
is dated August 31.)
Resources
Many proposals no doubt will
originate in the membership of
the Study Steering Committee
and of the various topic com
mittees. Even so, the bulk of
the input to the Study must
come from other sources.
Primary among them are the
resources of the Stanford com
munity, the experience of other
institutions, the literature on
higher education, and the "ex
perts," specialists in various
fields and authorities from be
yond our campus.
An earlier section of this re
port dealt with efforts to involve
the members of our own cam
pus community. This is the prin
cipal resource of the Study.
The principal function of the
Study staff is to establish links
between the resources referred
to above and the Study commit
tees. Its further duties include
obtaining information on the
operation of the University and
helping the committees to mea
sure what would be the effects
of proposals under considera
tion.
The process of building a staff
could have led to the recruit
ment" of experienced personnel
from beyond the campus, or the
co-option of present staff, both
relatively expensive processes.
Instead, we are relying heavily
on Stanford graduate students,
with some undergraduates and
recent students, for most of the
staff work.
There are drawbacks, since
most of these people can work
full time only in the summers,
but: these are outweighed by the
benefits of familiarity with the
Stanford situation.
Substantive Progress
Although a good deal of back
ground work is completed or
underway, few recommenda
tions have been presented or
conclusions reached. With the
exception of the proposals re
ported above, which developed
as a result of the work of the
Residence Policies Committee
(and in response to the need
to resolve some immediate prob
lems), no action has yet been
suggested.
This is according to plan. As
noted earlier, final recommenda
tions on most topics are not ex
pected before early in the aca
demic year 1968-69.
On the other hand, recom
mendations will not be held
back until the conclusion of the
Study if they seem worthy of
consideration independent of
other proposals. Many will be
released in the course of the
year in preliminary form in or
der to stimulate discussion and
to ascertain the felt needs of
the campus community.
In the previous section of this
Report we have described the
genesis of the Study and have
sought to bring you up to date
on its activities during what has
been primarily an organizational
phase.
We turn now to some ques
tions of substance which are
under consideration in the Steer
ing Committee and the various

topic committees. We' have two
purposes in raising these ques
tions at this time: first, to keep
the community abreast of some
of the work going on in the
Study; second, to solicit views on
matters on which you would
like to be heard.
Should Stanford Innovate?
1. It has been suggested that
Stanford does not merely have
the capacity to innovate, but it
is necessary that it do so if it
is to survive and prosper as an
excellent private university. Do
you agree with this view? If not,
why not? If so, what kinds of
innovative programs do you
think it would be desirable for
us to pursue?
'2. What are the principal de
ficiencies of graduate education
as seen, from the vantage point
of your particular discipline?
Does it take too long for candi
dates to achieve the degree they
seek? Are there requirements
that might be modified? Should
the dissertation requirement, as
the unitary route to the Ph.D.,
be reevaluated? Should propos
als for less demanding degree
programs (e.g., the Yale M.
Phil.! be pursued?
3. Is adequate attention paid
in your discipline to the prepara
tion of advanced degree candi
dates for careers as teachers? Is
adequate use made of graduate
students as a teaching source?
What, if any, specific improve
ments would you suggest?
Is there an inconsistency, es
pecially in the humanities and
social sciences, between the
speed-up of doctoral programs
and the need for preparation for
careers in academic life? If not,
why not? If so, what measures
might serve to help resolve the
inconsistency?
Professional Sehools
4. The University's profes
sional schools — Business, Earth
Sciences, Education, Engineer
ing, Law and Medicine — ex
hibit an across-the-board
strength unique in American
higher education. With the ex
ception of Engineering and
Earth Sciences, their faculties
have virtually no involvement
with undergraduate education.
To what extent can these re
sources, available only in a com
prehensive university, be mobi
lized to improve undergraduate
education?
5. There seems to be a preva
lent view that the preparation
of students for immediate entry
into a vocation should not be a
dominant goal of undergraduate
education at Stanford. There also
seems to be a view that outside
of mathematics, the natural
sciences, and the technologies
specific preparation for advanced
study in particular disciplines
should not be a dominant goal
of undergraduate education.
Do you share these views? If
not, why not? If so, what do you
see as the dominant goals for
undergraduate education in fields
where neither vocational prep
aration nor laying a foundation
exclusively designed for work
in a given graduate field is
particularly important?
And General Studies?
6. Is the conventional pattern
of undergraduate work — com
posed chiefly of "general studies"
and a departmental major — a
sound one? For all students?
What alternative arrangements
should be available? Formally
structured inter - departmental
majors? SelMesigned majors?

Complete laissez-faire? For
whom and on what terms?
7. The Stanford General
Studies program has come in
for some severe criticism recent
ly on grounds such as that it is
overly rigid, overly prescriptive,
heavily weighted with superfi
cial survey courses, etc. Do you
agree with these criticisms? Do
you have criticisms of your
own?
Should all students be required
to take Western Civ? Freshmen
English? a science sequence? a
foreign language? a senior col
loquium? etc., etc. Why or why
not? If you were called upon
to design a set of general studies
requirements, what would it
contain?
Change Advising System?
8. One thing to be said in
favor of a very detailed set of
educational prescriptions is that
it reduces the need for academic
advising. There seems to be wide
spread agreement that our ad
vising system is not equal to the

demands presently placed on
it, let alone any greatly increas
ed ones. Any relaxation or dimin
ution of general studies require
ments would place new burdens
on the advising system.
Do you think those burdens
can be met? By involving more
faculty members in academic ad
vising? How can that be accom
plished? Is it feasible or de
sirable to count advising as a
part of the teaching load?
Should advising be directly com
pensated as additional service?
Can we blend advising with
teaching, e.g., through a greatly
expanded program of freshman
seminars? Are there ways in
which selected graduate* or un
dergraduate students can be in
volved in the advising process?
9. There has been much talk
but little action about "interdis
ciplinary" work. What does the
term signify? At what levels of
the educational process and in
what form should "it" be intro
duced?

-10. Should the intellectual life
of the University relate more
closely to life in student resi
dences? If so, should the pri
mary emphasis be upon infor
mal, extracurricular devices or
upon formal curricular integra
tion of academic programs into
the residences? What kinds of
residence options, not now avail
able to students, should be made
available?
11. Is the line between under
graduate and graduate or pro
fessional study a durable feature
of higher education? Is it pos
sible to identify students early
in their undergraduate careers
who have the capacity to do sus
tained work of advanced char
acter and give them the oppor
tunity to progress with greater
than normal rapidity toward ad
vanced degrees? Is it desirable
to do so?
Are there other opportunities
not presently exploited to make
higher education more meaning
ful to those students who ap

pear to possess outstanding
promise?
12. What characteristics other
than outstanding intellectual
promise should we be seeking
in our students? Artistic crea
tivity? Diverse social and cul
tural backgrounds? Potential
for "leadership?"
Assuming that we can iden
tify such characteristics and suc
cessfully attract students who
possess them, what special provi
sions, if any, should be made for
them?
13. Do you perceive institu
tional constraints that prevent
you, as a teacher and scholar,
from using your time to best
advantage? If so, what are they
and what, if anything, can be
done about them?
14. What is your view of the
recently circulated proposal for
the creation of an Academic Sen
ate as a device for enhancing
the Faculty's role in deliberative
and decision-making processes?
Is its electoral unit basis satis

factory? Do you agree with the
inclusion of administrative rep
resentatives? Student represen
tatives? Are there other unrep
resented groups that should be
included?
15. What, if any, aspects of
the University's administrative
and committee structure require
improvement?
★ ★ ★
This is a small but significant
sample of the kinds of issues
with which the Study is concern
ed. Specific proposals relating
to these issues will be forth
coming in at least tentative form
during the next academic year
and will be scrutinized by ad
visory groups representing all
identifiable interests. Meanwhile,
we invite your contributions,
suggestions, questions, and criti
cisms.
