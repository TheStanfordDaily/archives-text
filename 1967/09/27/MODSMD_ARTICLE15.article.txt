# Encondido Home To House Branch Of County Library
## 
### HANK LIESE 
A small branch of the Santa
Clara County Library will open
on campus in mid-October.
The new library will be in an
old house at 865 Escondido Road
and will hold between 6,000 and
7,000 volumes.
Most of the books in the li
brary will be popular fiction and
non-fiction, plus juvenile books
for children of married gradu
ate students and faculty mem
bers.
Although intended primarily
for Stanford residents and their
children, the branch library will
be open to all persons served by
the county library system, which
includes persons living in Bar
ron Park, Los Altos, Los Altos
Hills, and Mountain View.
The library will - be situated

across the street from Escondido
Elementary School. Half the
school's students are children of
Stanford graduate students and
a third come from University
faculty families.
Lloyd Cunningham, principal
of Escondido School, said his stu
dents' use of the new library
will depend on its staffing and
the materials available. He hopes
teachers at Escondido will be
able to coordinate their assign
ments with these materials.
Cunningham also feels that
a wider collection of books avail
able after school hours can in
crease young students' library
experience.
Opening of the new library
will not mean a discontinuance
of the bookmobile presently
serving Stanford's residential
areas.
