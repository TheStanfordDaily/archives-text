## Summer Work vs. College 
### NICK SELBY 
Among the several hundred
pieces of paper given to every
one who entered Mem Aud for
registration was a yellow piece
of paper from the Packer Com
mittee asking students what
they did during the summer.
TTie questionnaire probably
wasn't intended to discover any
thing more than if college edu
cation is relevant to getting and
holding a summer job.
Unthinkingly, I answered that
it had helped because it taught
me to write. But I didn't con
sider whether college had helped
me live with a job, and I see
now that it didn't.
I had suffered six weeks of
being a copyboy for a Chicago
newspaper when a disaster in

disguise came my way. I was
asked to work in the sports de
partment typing up the horse
race charts.
Seeing that typing was essen
tially a desk job, and feeling
rather tired after running mes
sages all day, I fell for the trap.
I accepted and began to type out
horses, weights, and jockies
along with the win, place and
show listings.
It turned out that there were
people working in the newspaper
who played the horses. They
weren't at the track, but had
great interest in finding out the
winners of every race at nearly
every track in the country.
"Who won da fifth at arlin'-
ton," they would breathlessly

call as they ran into the commu
nications room where the race
results came over the AP wires
and the teletype machines.
This seemed to be an abnor
mal interest in just the sporting
aspects of horse racing, if not
an illegal one because bookies
are outlawed in Illinois. I de
cided to save them from their
unhealthy hobby.
Carrie Nation Style
I started hiding the results as
they came off the machines. I
would tear them away as quickly
as possible, marking one up for
printing and burying the copies
under piles of old papers. This
may have been sadistic, especial
ly when I saw the bettors begin
ning to tremble.
But they found the results,
and although I considered
smashing the machines, Carrie
Nation style with a hatchet,
there was no alternative but to
watch them bet their lives away.
Typing up the same horses
everyday, seeing the small
purses offered, watching how
the plug nags were handicapped
as if they were in the Derby,
I saw the futility of horse rac
ing. And my paper's use of one
man to write two different rat
ings typified the hypocrisy per
fectly.
But that wasn't the tragedy â€”
it was learning about the compul
sive gamblers who had to know
the results of every race, whose
lives were tied to a futile, hypo
critical, crooked sport.
It was sickening, and my col
lege education hadn't told me
that was the way life can be.
