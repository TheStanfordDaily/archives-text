# Beta Chi 'Eviction'
## 
### 
A call announcing the evic
tion of Gaylord Smith from the
Beta Chi fraternity house last
Thursday night must have
puzzled Stanford police.
Smilh (up until last Thurs
day) was living in at Beta Chi,
which is open during the sum
mer as a boarding house. His
final rent payment due Sept. 20,
Smith had assured his house
manager he would move out by
that time.
\ But three Beta Chi members
returning for the Autumn quar
ter found Smith in their room
after the 20th. And when Smith
(who could not be reached for
comment) returned around 9
p.m. Thursday night, he found
all his belongings packed in
boxes sitting on the house's
iawn.
