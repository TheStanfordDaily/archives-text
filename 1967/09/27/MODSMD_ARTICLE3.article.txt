# Student Services Offices Moved To Renovated Union
## 
### HERBERT TERRY 
After an extensive year-long
rebuilding program the Old Un
ion has reopened to provide the
first centralized student services
center since the early days of
Stanford.
Remodeling of the 46 year-old
building was completed in Aug
ust and the transfer of several
University offices from former
locations on the Quad and in
Encina Hall was completed
three weeks ago.
According to Building Coor
dinator Walter Findeisen, the
Student Services Center will
"provide a central location for
all branches of the University
with which students frequently
must deal." Fineisen said that
no "student-contact" offices now
remain either on Quad or in Fn
cina Hall.
New Office Location
Moving from Quad to the Old
Union complex were: Under
graduate and Graduate Admis
sions (2nd floor), Dean of Stu
dents (3rd floor), Faculty Ath
letic Representative Secretary
(3rd floor), Financial Aids (2nd
floor), Graduate Division (Ist
and 2nd floors), Housing (Ist
floor), National Service (Ist
floor), and the Registrar (Ist
floor).
Moving from old quarters in
Encina to the new facilities near
White Plaza were: Branch Office
of the Cashier (Ist floor), Stu
dent Accounts (Ist floor), Coun
seling and Testing Center (3rd
floor), and the Office of Public
Events (Ist floor).
Year To Complete
The $1,040,000 project began
in September, 1960, with the re
moval of the previous interior
of the building. Findeisen was
"very surprised that it's possible
to have a project of this dimen
sion . . . proceed as smoothly
as it did."
The building, however, is go
ing through it's "shakedown

period," and numerous mechani
cal failures and design prob
lems have been noted. Follow
ing a long-standing Stanford
building pattern the Old Union
project has, in effect, put a new
building inside an old one's
shell. Windows which cannot be
opened without standing on the
open drawer of a file cabinet,
and others which cannot be
locked, are typical of the prob
lems this type of construction
brings. Findeisen promised, how
ever, that such difficulties will
be solved promptly.
Still To Move
The Old Union still is not the
home of all campus student
contact offices. Over the sum
mer the Placement Center
moved from Encina Hall to the
Old Bookstore, which was occu
pied last year by Western Civ.
Reserve and the Experiment.
Findeisen said it is the plan
of the University to eventually
bring all student service offices
into the new complex. H" 1 said
the remaining offices will be
moved into the Men's and Wo
men's Clubhouses as soon as
new homes can be found for the
current occupants of these build
ings.

The Old Union has had a long
and varied history. The Men's
Clubhouse, which now houses
The Nitery and offices for the
Department of Art and Archi
tecture, was the first section of
the building to be erected. It
was completed in 1921.
.. Shortly thereafter the cen
tral part of the Union and the
Women's Clubhouse wing were
added, and the entire complex
converted to a men's residence.
Several years later it was con
verted to a women's dormitory.
The northern part of the
building continued as a women's
residence until 1966. At that
time the 78 residents of the Un
ion were distributed between
then new Hoskins House and
other University residences, but
this was done only after much
protest against alleged Univers
ity "dormicide." At the same
time a public dining room in the
central and southern sections of
the building was closed. Uni
versity officials claimed it was
uneconomical to continue to op
erate the Union as a dining hall
and residence unit because sim
ilar facilities were available in
Escondido Village and Tresidder
Union.
