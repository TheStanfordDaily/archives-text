# New Law Passed
## Draft Shifts Aim 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY (First of two articles) 
When Congress and President
Johnson "reformed" the draft
laws last June, they ignored the
advice of blue-ribbon study com
missions and rewrote the laws
instead, say some critics, to mini
mize the political backlash on
this sensitive issue.
The result was a vague, am

biguous and threatening set of
regulations, with great discre
tion left with the local boards.
Stanford's national service ad
viser Walter Findeisen believes
the new rules strengthen the un
dergraduate's draft deferment
but make all graduate students
"vulnerable."
Draft boards might use cer
tain changes in the law to crack

down on conscientious objectors,
according to Prof. Paul Seaver,
an adviser to Stanford CO's.
The law's vague wording also
poses a dilemma for Stanford
University, giving it much more
discretionary power in determin
ing who is eligible for an under
graduate deferment. A high
level University committee is
considering how Stanford should
make these potentially life or
death decisions, or if it should
make them at all.
This article, the first of two,
will discuss the law as it affects
undergraduates.
Automatic IT-S
The key change, contained in
the Executive Order of June 30,
1967, gives the II-S student de
terment as a "right" to anyone
who (1) requests it in writing
and (2) "is satisfactorily pur
suing a full-time course of in
struction at a college...."
This deferment can be re
newed yearly "until such regi
strant completes the require
ment for his baccalaureate de
gree, fails to pursue satisfactor
ily a full-time course of instruc
tion, or attains the 24th anniver
sary ... of his birth."
But what is "satisfactory" pur
suit? Must an undergraduate get
his B.A. in four years to keep
his deferment?
The draft regulations define
satisfactory progress as the com
pletion each year of enough
units of academic credit to get
a degree in "the normal number
of years established by the
school to obtain such degree."
The onus is clearly on the
school to set a "normal" number
of years.
Findeisen, Stanford's draft ad
viser, expects draft boards to
ask Stanford's opinion as to
whether each student who takes
more than four years is making
satisfactory progress.
How will Stanford reply?
"Any student who takes more
than four years to graduate is
going to have to defend his posi-
