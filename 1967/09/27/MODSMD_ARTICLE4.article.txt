# New Law Passed
## Draft Shifts Aim 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY (First of two articles) 
When Congress and President
Johnson "reformed" the draft
laws last June, they ignored the
advice of blue-ribbon study com
missions and rewrote the laws
instead, say some critics, to mini
mize the political backlash on
this sensitive issue.
The result was a vague, am

biguous and threatening set of
regulations, with great discre
tion left with the local boards.
Stanford's national service ad
viser Walter Findeisen believes
the new rules strengthen the un
dergraduate's draft deferment
but make all graduate students
"vulnerable."
Draft boards might use cer
tain changes in the law to crack

down on conscientious objectors,
according to Prof. Paul Seaver,
an adviser to Stanford CO's.
The law's vague wording also
poses a dilemma for Stanford
University, giving it much more
discretionary power in determin
ing who is eligible for an under
graduate deferment. A high
level University committee is
considering how Stanford should
make these potentially life or
death decisions, or if it should
make them at all.
This article, the first of two,
will discuss the law as it affects
undergraduates.
Automatic IT-S
The key change, contained in
the Executive Order of June 30,
1967, gives the II-S student de
terment as a "right" to anyone
who (1) requests it in writing
and (2) "is satisfactorily pur
suing a full-time course of in
struction at a college...."
This deferment can be re
newed yearly "until such regi
strant completes the require
ment for his baccalaureate de
gree, fails to pursue satisfactor
ily a full-time course of instruc
tion, or attains the 24th anniver
sary ... of his birth."
But what is "satisfactory" pur
suit? Must an undergraduate get
his B.A. in four years to keep
his deferment?
The draft regulations define
satisfactory progress as the com
pletion each year of enough
units of academic credit to get
a degree in "the normal number
of years established by the
school to obtain such degree."
The onus is clearly on the
school to set a "normal" number
of years.
Findeisen, Stanford's draft ad
viser, expects draft boards to
ask Stanford's opinion as to
whether each student who takes
more than four years is making
satisfactory progress.
How will Stanford reply?
"Any student who takes more
than four years to graduate is
going to have to defend his posi-
tion," Findeisen says."It isn't
going to be easy."
Findeisen says "my respon
sibility is one of solely report
ing the facts. My job is support
ing student attempts to be de
ferred. But he must have a
justifiable reason for us to sup
port him."
Findeisen said "justifiable rea
sons" for prolonging undergrad
uate study would include:
• Majoring in engineering. 72
per cent of Stanford engineers
need more than 12 quarters to
complete their requirements.
• Changing majors late in col
lege, and not having time to ful
fill all department requirements.
• Having a grade point defi
ciency. Stanford requires a 2.0
GPA for graduation.
All cases will be considered
individually by the University.
Findeisen ruled out attendance
at an overseas campus as a "jus
tifiable reason" for taking more
than four years to graduate.
Little Can Be Done
Little can be done to defend
a student who has completed all
his requirements for a degree
but simply enrolls for a fifth
year, according to Findeisen.
The University will communi
cate with draft boards only at
the student's request, Findeisen
says emphatically. He points out
that the Selective Service in
formation card distributed at
Registration reads, "Complete
this form if.you wish Stanford
to support your request for a
11-S Student Deferment . . ."
That card merely certifies "full
time" enrollment, as the draft
law requires. It tells the draft
board how many years the stu
dent has been working toward
his degree, and when the degree
is expected.
If a draft board reads this
card and discovers that the stu
dent is taking more than four
years for his 8.A., it will either
(1) classify the student 1-A out
right or (2) ask Stanford for
further information on the stu
dent's progress. Findeisen says
a fifth-year student who is classi
fied 1-A should appeal and re
quest the University to defend
him as "satisfactorily pursuing
a full-time course of instruc
tion." But Stanford will do
nothing without a student's per
mission.
Must Apply
Stanford, in fact, can't get its
undergraduates 11-S deferments
by itself. Under the new law a
student must fill out Selective
Service form 104 or write a
formal letter to his draft board
requesting a 11-S.

And there's a catch. Any stu
dent who requests and receives
a 11-S deferment is ineligible for
the fatherhood deferment later
in life, except in cases of ex
treme hardship. A student can
preserve his right to deferment
as a father by requesting the
I-S classification, good for one
school year. But at the end of
that year the student is draft
eligible. "It's like playing rou
lette," says Findeisen.
Generally the law is "much
better for undergraduates than
the old rules, Findeisen believes.
The infamous deferment cri
teria of class rank and the selec
tive service test are gone. "They
were ridiculous," he comments.
Yet at the same time Fin
deisen does not expect a great
number of Stanford students to
try to prolong their undergrad
uate careers as a form of draft
dodging. Congress put an age
limit of 24 on the undergraduate
deferment just to prevent such
evasion.
The new law leaves most
power in the hands of the local
boards. How they will interpret
the new law, Findeisen believes,
may depend on the stringency
of future draft laws.
"The legislation will be help
ful for boards in being sympa
thetic with undergraduate stu
dent problems," he says. "For
graduate students it is far less
satisfactory."
