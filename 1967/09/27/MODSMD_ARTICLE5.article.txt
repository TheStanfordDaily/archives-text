# Over 150 Register For Free University
## 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
Over 150 Stanford students
have signed up for and paid for
membership in the Midpenin
sula Free University (MPFU),
according to Barry Greenberg,
executive director. The MPFU
was formed over the summer
out of the Free University of
Palo Alto and the "Experiment."
The Free University is offer
ing close to 100 seminars and
projects, ranging from Japanese
pottery making to a seminar on
religion and radical politics.
Membership is open to all, and
anyone can organize or teach a
new seminar.
Registration will continue
Wednesday through Friday in
front of Tresidder Union from
9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tn addition,
Stanford students, faculty, and
staff are invited to meet with
MPFU officers and seminar lead
ers on Thursday and Friday,
10 a.m. to 2 p.m., in room 271
of Tresidder. Activities will cul
minate with a "be-in" at El
Camino Park this Sunday from
noon to evening.
Sembiars Upgraded
The catalog of course offer
ings states that "a revolution in

American education is required
to meet today's needs, and a
new type of education, a free
university, must provide the im
petus for change."
Greenberg contends that edu
cation should not bo a socializa
tion process, a process by which
students are guided so as to fit
into society, but rather should
be part of the total process of
living. Hence, seminars in the
Free University are upgraded
and often deal with very person
al subjects.
Among the many seminars
which could be cited as ex
amples of the orientation of
MPFU toward the individual
and his self-awareness is the
one entitled "If You Want To
Know The Taste of Water," em
phasizing Zen meditation.
A New Community?
The rising popularity of the
Free University has suggested
several questions about the na
ture of this type of education
to Greenberg. He wonders
where the free university move
ment is heading. "Will the
MPFU simply provide interest
ing diversion to somewhat dis
enchanted students? Or will it
result in the creation of a new

community? And what might
be the nature of this commun
ity?"
Greenberg feels that a sub
stantial difference of opinion
exists among MPFU members
as to the goals of their organiza
tion. Some participants believe
strongly that thought must be
closely linked with political ac
tion while others prefer to re
main uninvolved with any so
cial questions broader than in
terpersonal ones.
Opposes Draft and War
The Free University has de
cided by majority decision to
oppose both the draft and the
war in Vietnam, though indivi
dual sentiments on these and
other issues vary widely. Green
berg explained that the Free
University had publicly taken
these positions so as to create
"a sense of identity as a com
munity" among MPFU mem
bers.
As a community the MPFU is
now engaged in setting up a
co-operative store which will be
run by members. Additionally,
the Free University encourages
members to form living groups,
with the eventual goal of be
coming a "residential univer
sity" in mind.
