# SES Presents Report, Predicts New Surveys
## 
### 
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), in its end-of
summer "Interim Review and
Report to the Faculty," reports
its main progress has been in
"organization, planning and data
gathering."
In the eight months since the
study was announced and Vice
Provost Herbert Packer named
chairman of the steering com
mittee, SES has:
Survived a controversy over
appointments to the steering
committee;
Published a full preliminary
agenda including some 250 ques
tions which "made clear that the
Study would engage in a search
ing and fundamental analysis
of educational programs and all
of the matters which impinge on
them;"
Elicited offers of help from
well over 100 faculty members,
both in committee work and the
preparation of discussion pa
pers;
Received offers from hundreds
of students volunteering to help
the committee;
Held public and informal hear
ings at which students and fac
ulty offered their views on what
areas should be studied and what
problems should be considered;
And helped to establish a
series of undergraduate special
seminars on SES study topics.
Topic Committees
The topic committees have
been at work since last year.
The most active during the
spring was the residence com
mittee, which cooperated with
the Administration in working
out details for the "demonstra
tion" houses in Wilbur and Stern
Halls. The plan had come earlier
in a different form from the
ASSU Housing Commission.
The residence committee has
now begun to "turn its attention
to long-range housing solutions
compatible with Stanford's re
sources and aims," the report
says.
The Committee on Admissions
and Financial Aids, formed in
May and chaired by Religion and
Humanities Professor William
A. Clebsch, has worked through
the summer, "meeting with ad
ministrative officers and direct
ing the work of the staff in
gathering data."
The committee has set up its
own subcommittees, to deal with
subjects ranging from graduate

enrollmert to preferential ad
missions to transfers and ratios.
A Committee on International
Education was set up in May,
headed by History Associate Pro
fessor Ivo J. Lederer. This group
will "consider ways in which
the University can respond to
its obligations in the interna
tional sphere."
A committee on Government
of the University, headed by
SES Steering Committee Chair
man Herbert Packer, will "ex
amine structural arrangements
for carrying out the University's
business. ASSU President Peter
Lyman will serve on this com
mittee.
A fifth topic committee, on ad
vising and counseling services,
was named in May. Edwin M.
Good, associate professor of re
ligion and Hebrew, is the chair
man.
Two new committees will
study computer problems and re
search. (See story this page.)
Good Progress
"Good progress has been made
in a number of substantive
areas," the report goes on.
Most of the progress has been
made in the form of papers for
background and discussion. The
subjetcs range from"the history

of the ratio (of men to women)
to a proposed major revision in
the undergraduate curriculum."
During the summer the staff
collected numerous books, ar
ticles and other materials re
lated to education, "to set the
stage for committee delibera
tions in the fall."
Surveys Planned
Last spring SES sent ques
tionnaires to graduates of five
recent classes, asking about pres
ent activities and occupations.
The initial return ran to about
50 per cent. The information,
it is hoped, will give SES "an
understanding of what we are
educating for."
SES also conducted 'nterviews
with graduating seniors last
spring to get their views on ed
ucation at Stanford. The report
said the discussions showed
a much greater diversity among
students than had been previous
ly supposed. They also showed
students were by and large less
dissatisfied with education at
Stanford than had been thought
before.
Other surveys now being plan
ned will take in the views of
current students and faculty.

Most of the progress has been
made in the form of papers for
background and discussion. The
subjetcs range from"the history

of the ratio (of men to women)
to a proposed major revision in
the undergraduate curriculum."
During the summer the staff
collected numerous books, ar

lated to education, "to set the
stage for committee delibera

Surveys Planned
Last spring SES sent ques
tionnaires to graduates of five
recent classes, asking about pres
ent activities and occupations.
The initial return ran to about
50 per cent. The information,
it is hoped, will give SES "an
understanding of what we are
educating for."
SES also conducted 'nterviews
with graduating seniors last
spring to get their views on ed
ucation at Stanford. The report
said the discussions showed
a much greater diversity among
students than had been previous
ly supposed. They also showed
students were by and large less
dissatisfied with education at
Stanford than had been thought
before.
Other surveys now being plan
ned will take in the views of
current students and faculty.

The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), in its end-of
summer "Interim Review and
Report to the Faculty," reports
its main progress has been in
"organization, planning and data
gathering."
In the eight months since the
study was announced and Vice
Provost Herbert Packer named
chairman of the steering com
mittee, SES has:
Survived a controversy over
appointments to the steering
committee;
Published a full preliminary
agenda including some 250 ques
tions which "made clear that the
Study would engage in a search
ing and fundamental analysis
of educational programs and all
of the matters which impinge on
them;"
Elicited offers of help from
well over 100 faculty members,
both in committee work and the
preparation of discussion pa
pers;
Received offers from hundreds
of students volunteering to help
the committee;
Held public and informal hear
ings at which students and fac
ulty offered their views on what
areas should be studied and what
problems should be considered;
And helped to establish a
series of undergraduate special
seminars on SES study topics.
Topic Committees
The topic committees have
been at work since last year.
The most active during the
spring was the residence com
mittee, which cooperated with
the Administration in working
out details for the "demonstra
tion" houses in Wilbur and Stern
Halls. The plan had come earlier
in a different form from the
ASSU Housing Commission.
The residence committee has
now begun to "turn its attention
to long-range housing solutions
compatible with Stanford's re
sources and aims," the report
says.
The Committee on Admissions
and Financial Aids, formed in
May and chaired by Religion and
Humanities Professor William
A. Clebsch, has worked through
the summer, "meeting with ad
ministrative officers and direct
ing the work of the staff in
gathering data."
The committee has set up its
own subcommittees, to deal with
subjects ranging from graduate

enrollmert to preferential ad
missions to transfers and ratios.
A Committee on International
Education was set up in May,
headed by History Associate Pro
fessor Ivo J. Lederer. This group
will "consider ways in which
the University can respond to
its obligations in the interna
tional sphere."
A committee on Government
of the University, headed by
SES Steering Committee Chair
man Herbert Packer, will "ex
amine structural arrangements
for carrying out the University's
business. ASSU President Peter
Lyman will serve on this com
mittee.
A fifth topic committee, on ad
vising and counseling services,
was named in May. Edwin M.
Good, associate professor of re
ligion and Hebrew, is the chair
man.
Two new committees will
study computer problems and re
search. (See story this page.)
