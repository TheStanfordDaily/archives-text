# Graduate Students' Union Forms To Air Grievances
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
A union is being formed at
Stanford for graduate students,
junior faculty members, and un
professional library workers.
According to Andrew Moss,
graduate research assistant and

provisional head of the group,
more than 60 persons have al
ready joined the union since a
preliminary meeting earlier this
year.
"We are concerned," said
Moss, "about law pay scales for
some teaching and research as

sistants, lack of fringe benefits,
and lack of representation in
University affairs."
He claims there is much varia
tion in salaries and fellowships
paid in particular departments,
although pay-scale information
is confidential at Stanford.

"One of the first things we'd
like to do," he commented, "is
to make the amounts of salaries
for all positions in the Univer
sity public information."
Grads Outnumber UndergTads
Western Civ Instructor Bob
Baker, another provisional offi
cer of the local, said that stu
dents and instructors in the
sciences are usually better paid
than those in humanities depart
ments. "Some," said Moss, "are
actually eligible for the poverty
program."
According to Moss, most of
the union members are in En
glish and History. "Out of 1200

graduate engineers/' he said,
there are perhaps two or three
in the union.
"There is a whole new class
of graduate students," he went
on, "and at Stanford there are
now more in hte graduate divi
sion than in the undergraduate
division."
"This," he said, "is brand new,
and in fact it's revolutionary."
But Moss claims that despite
this development the University
still thinks of itself as an under
graduate school.
"Union" Draws Criticism
"Graduate students," said
Baker, "are pushed through the
system like a thing in a ma
chine, and we'd like to slow
down this process to give stu
dents a chance to develop as
they like."
"The immediate reaction of
many faculty members," Moss
commented, "is based on a 1930's
picture of mass strikes."
Both Moss and Baker say low
pay is not the only complaint
the union will try to cope with.
"We think," said Moss, "that
graduate students have a fairly
strong interest in University af
fairs, but up to now they have
been unable to say anything
about the treatment they have
been getting, or research policy,
or the distribution of fellowships,
or the lack of fringe benefits.
"Some departments," he said,
"seem to have the attitude that
graduate students at Stanford
have no hight to complain about
conditions. They say Stanford
is a hot shot place and we should
just be glad to be here.
AFT Affiliation
The Stanford local will be as
sociated with the American Fed
eration of Teachers (AFT), a
member of the AFL-CIO which
has locals in schools all over
the nation, including Berkeley,
UCLA and Fresno State.
Dues are $4 each quarter, and
students can register during
lunchtime at a table outside
Tresidder. The union's first gen
eral meeting will be held at the
end of next week.

ready joined the union since a
preliminary meeting earlier this
year.
"We are concerned," said
Moss, "about law pay scales for
some teaching and research as

sistants, lack of fringe benefits,
and lack of representation in
University affairs."
He claims there is much varia
tion in salaries and fellowships
paid in particular departments,
although pay-scale information
is confidential at Stanford.

"One of the first things we'd
like to do," he commented, "is
to make the amounts of salaries
for all positions in the Univer
sity public information."
Grads Outnumber UndergTads
Western Civ Instructor Bob
Baker, another provisional offi
cer of the local, said that stu
dents and instructors in the
sciences are usually better paid
than those in humanities depart
ments. "Some," said Moss, "are
actually eligible for the poverty
program."
According to Moss, most of
the union members are in En
glish and History. "Out of 1200

graduate engineers/' he said,
there are perhaps two or three
in the union.
"There is a whole new class
of graduate students," he went
on, "and at Stanford there are
now more in hte graduate divi
sion than in the undergraduate
division."
"This," he said, "is brand new,
and in fact it's revolutionary."
But Moss claims that despite
this development the University
still thinks of itself as an under
graduate school.
"Union" Draws Criticism
"Graduate students," said
Baker, "are pushed through the
system like a thing in a ma
chine, and we'd like to slow
down this process to give stu
dents a chance to develop as
they like."
"The immediate reaction of
many faculty members," Moss
commented, "is based on a 1930's
picture of mass strikes."
Both Moss and Baker say low
pay is not the only complaint
the union will try to cope with.
"We think," said Moss, "that
graduate students have a fairly
strong interest in University af
fairs, but up to now they have
been unable to say anything
about the treatment they have
been getting, or research policy,
or the distribution of fellowships,
or the lack of fringe benefits.
"Some departments," he said,
"seem to have the attitude that
graduate students at Stanford
have no hight to complain about
conditions. They say Stanford
is a hot shot place and we should
just be glad to be here.
AFT Affiliation
The Stanford local will be as
sociated with the American Fed
eration of Teachers (AFT), a
member of the AFL-CIO which
has locals in schools all over
the nation, including Berkeley,
UCLA and Fresno State.
Dues are $4 each quarter, and
students can register during
lunchtime at a table outside
Tresidder. The union's first gen
eral meeting will be held at the
end of next week.
A union is being formed at
Stanford for graduate students,
junior faculty members, and un
professional library workers.
According to Andrew Moss,
graduate research assistant and

provisional head of the group,
more than 60 persons have al
ready joined the union since a
preliminary meeting earlier this
year.
