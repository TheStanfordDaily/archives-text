# Detour

### 
We want to take a moment to commend the
Planning Office and the Traffic Committee for
the efficiency with which it has eliminated
vast idle areas of parking space and intrusive
arterial roads just as Stanford again opens its
doors to a record enrollment.
The master plan for a four-lane ring road
around the campus is fine. And we would not
be so presumptuous as to suggest that one might
complete the ring road before the internal ar
teries are severed by barricades. (We are still
wondering where the four lane stretch of Cam
pus Drive in front of Flo Mo is going. It ap
pears to point straight at Lake Lag.)
The Planning Office may not have created the
best of all possible traffic patterns, but it has
thoughtfully placed signs directing us to "Cam
pus Center" (wherever that is) via the Medical
School and Zott's.
In recognition of its fine work, The Daily
hereby awards the Planning Office our Ist An
nual Embarcadero Freeway Award and bronze
plated detour sign.
