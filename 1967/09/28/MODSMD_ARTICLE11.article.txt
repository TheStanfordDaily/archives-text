# The 						Capitol Scenes
## As Long As We're Spending... 
### Art Buchwald 
The beauty of the American
government these days is that
nobody pays any attention to a
program unless it costs a billion
or more.
There was a time when if
somebody in the executive
branch said the word "billion,"
it was muted or even whispered
in some back room of the White
House, since it could only get
the Administration in trouble.
But all this has changed and
now when somebody mentions a
magic number over a billion dol
lars, everyone sits up and starts
applauding.
I hadn't thought about it until
I had lunch with my friend
Oberdorfer the other day.
Beautiful $5 Billion
"Did you see Robert McNa
mara on television the other
day?" he asked.
I said I had.
"Wasn't he beautiful when he
said we were going to build an
antiballistic missile system
which would cost $5 billion?"
"I hadn't thought of it as
beautiful."
"Then you missed it. The $5
billion just rolled off his tongue,
and he said it without so much
as a grimace or a smile. To me
a man who can say something's
going to cost $5 billion with a
straight face has a lot of class."
"There's something to what
you say."
"The trouble with this gov
ernment is there are not enough
people in it who think big,"
Oberdorfer continued. "Ameri
cans are psychologically attuned
to getting their bad news in the
billions, and they resent it when
someone starts talking of pid

dling tens or hundreds of mil
lions.
"Take Postmaster Lawrence
O'Brien for example. He's a nice
enough guy, but how can any
one get excited about his opera
tion when his department is
only losing $589 million a
year?"
"You have a point."
"Do you know why the Presi
dent's domestic programs are in
such serious trouble? It's be
cause he has not asked for too
much money. It's because he
asked for too little. Congress
has some pride, too."
"I don't understand."
Cheap Rats
"Well, let's take the rat con

trol bill. All the President asked
for was $40 million. This ridicu
lously low figure insulted the in
telligence of the House of Rep
resentatives. At first they
wouldn't consider it. Then they
considered it and laughed it off
the floor. Finally they passed
it reluctantly. Why? Because
anything that costs only $40
million couldn't possibly have
any value to the country.
"If the President had asked
for a billion dollars, I assure
you Congress wouldn't have
made any pokes about rat con
trol."
"The Beautification Program
is also bogged down because
everyone is talking nickles and

dimes. If Secreary Stewart Udall
had asked for a couple of bil
lion dollars, Mrs. Lady Bird
Johnson could start planting
trees tomorrow."
"On the basis of what you've
said, whom in the government
do you admire most?" I asked.
"Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Fowler," Ob rdorfer re
plied. "My esteem for him rose
three-fold when I heard him say
on television the other night
that if we don't have a tax in
crease the U.S. budget deficit
could go as high as $29 billion.
A Cabinet officer who can come
up with a figure like that is a
man after my own heart."

"Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Fowler," Ob rdorfer re
plied. "My esteem for him rose
three-fold when I heard him say
on television the other night
that if we don't have a tax in
crease the U.S. budget deficit
could go as high as $29 billion.
A Cabinet officer who can come
up with a figure like that is a
man after my own heart."

The beauty of the American
government these days is that
nobody pays any attention to a
program unless it costs a billion
or more.
There was a time when if
somebody in the executive
branch said the word "billion,"
it was muted or even whispered
in some back room of the White
House, since it could only get
the Administration in trouble.
But all this has changed and
now when somebody mentions a
magic number over a billion dol
lars, everyone sits up and starts
applauding.
I hadn't thought about it until
I had lunch with my friend
Oberdorfer the other day.
Beautiful $5 Billion
"Did you see Robert McNa
mara on television the other
day?" he asked.
I said I had.
"Wasn't he beautiful when he
said we were going to build an
antiballistic missile system
which would cost $5 billion?"
"I hadn't thought of it as
beautiful."
"Then you missed it. The $5
billion just rolled off his tongue,
and he said it without so much
as a grimace or a smile. To me
a man who can say something's
going to cost $5 billion with a
straight face has a lot of class."
"There's something to what
you say."
"The trouble with this gov
ernment is there are not enough
people in it who think big,"
Oberdorfer continued. "Ameri
cans are psychologically attuned
to getting their bad news in the
billions, and they resent it when
someone starts talking of pid

dling tens or hundreds of mil
lions.
"Take Postmaster Lawrence
O'Brien for example. He's a nice
enough guy, but how can any
one get excited about his opera
tion when his department is
only losing $589 million a
year?"
"You have a point."
"Do you know why the Presi
dent's domestic programs are in
such serious trouble? It's be
cause he has not asked for too
much money. It's because he
asked for too little. Congress
has some pride, too."
"I don't understand."
Cheap Rats
"Well, let's take the rat con

trol bill. All the President asked
for was $40 million. This ridicu
lously low figure insulted the in
telligence of the House of Rep
resentatives. At first they
wouldn't consider it. Then they
considered it and laughed it off
the floor. Finally they passed
it reluctantly. Why? Because
anything that costs only $40
million couldn't possibly have
any value to the country.
"If the President had asked
for a billion dollars, I assure
you Congress wouldn't have
made any pokes about rat con
trol."
"The Beautification Program
is also bogged down because
everyone is talking nickles and

dimes. If Secreary Stewart Udall
had asked for a couple of bil
lion dollars, Mrs. Lady Bird
Johnson could start planting
trees tomorrow."
"On the basis of what you've
said, whom in the government
do you admire most?" I asked.
"Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Fowler," Ob rdorfer re
plied. "My esteem for him rose
