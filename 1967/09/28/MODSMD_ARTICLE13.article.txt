# Letters To The Editor
## Is 'Veritas' An Un-Veritas? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I read Donna Middlehurst's
letter (re: Honor and Honesty
at Harvard) in total agreement.
Probably the greatest intellec
tual challenge offered me during
my year in Cambridge was to
try and figure out just what
place the übiquitous VERITAS
(Harvard's equivalent of Die
Luft der Freiheit Weht) has in
that university. The word stares
down at you from above every
gate and gargoyle, but does not
seem to relate in any way to
what goes on within the Yard.
It is difficult to fully appreci
ate the Stanford atmosphere un
til suddenly finding yourself a
graduate student in a school
which assumes you are about as
mature and responsible as the
average ten-year-old.
If a system of rigid proctoring
such as Harvard's is not meant
to replace individual student re
sponsibility and integrity, then
it is superfluous. If it is so de
signed then it would seem the
entire educational enterprise has
failed.
Those who speak of Stanford
with any honest respect or pride
would do well to find another
label to replace "the Harvard of
the West."

• Don't Get Cute!
Editor, The Daily:
The rather snide rejoinder to
the Breakers' letter of Septem
ber 26 raises at least two prob
lems which are trivial in them
selves but which seem to me to
have some importance with re
gard to Daily policy.
First of all, the implication of
the editor's note is that the orig
inal article was correct in all re
spects but Mcßae's title. This is
absurd.
Second, the editor maintains
the accuracy of the quotations
in the article. Neither Mcßae nor
Treseder can remember being
interviewed. The Daily claims
to have interviewed Mcßae last
spring. Treseder is quoted as
having an opinion which he has
in fact never held and which has
never been Breakers' policy as
long as anyone can remember.
Mcßae is indirectly quoted as
claiming that Breakers has
enough members this fall to

meet its obligations. As a matter
of fact, nobody now knows how
many members the club has,
and nobody will know for about
a week. That Mcßae could have
known this last spring boggles
the mind. What, then, can we
say about the accuracy of the
quotations?
In the same issue as the Break
ers letter, there is a long discus
sion by Provost Lyman about
modes of communication. The
Daily is, unfortunately, the only
mode of communication that
most of Stanford has. This would
seem to impose a responsibility
on The Daily to be as accurate
as possible and not to hold posi
tions by cuteness when the facts
cannot support them. It would
not seem too much to expect
that The Daily respond to correc
tions of fact with grace rather
than with the kind of personal
defensiveness which makes com
munication impossible.
