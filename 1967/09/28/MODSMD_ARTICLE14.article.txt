# Poloists Plan Water Mauls For '67
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford water poloists face
tneir toughest schedule in years,
and may be in the best shape to
handle it.
Coach Jim Gaughran's In
dians open the 1967 season
against the alumni Saturday at
10 a.m. at the Encina Pool.
Gary Sheerer, named Out
standing Player of the Pan
American Games, leads the
Cards with a devious and power
ful left arm and an uncanny
playmaking ability.
Sheerer is a two-time All

American, despite early season
injuries in both his sophomore
and junior years.
Parker Rated Fourth
John Parker played with
Sheerer on the Foothill Acquatic
Club team that won the Pan Am
Trials. Parker, a senior, advanc
ed to the number four position
on the U.S. team while touring
Europe last summer, according
to Foothill AC and future Olym
pic coach Art Lambert.
Mark Parmely, who uses both
arms with equal vigor, will be
a big offensive plus in the In

dian lineup. Parmely will work
the hole, either trying to get off
a shot or set up a Stanford
break.
Pete Siebert, a junior with an
immense armspread, will start
with the unenviable assignment
of guarding the opponent's most
dangerous scorer.
Experienced Meyer
Bill Meyer brings two letters
and an array of offensive moves
to the 1967 season. Tom Hill, a
sophomore, will be vying for a
starting spot with quick hands
and a vicious backhand.
Greg Buckingham will add a
solid chunk to the Card lineup
as soon as an eligibility dispute
is cleared up. The four-time NC
AA swimming record holder
made the second All-Conference
team last fall.

JC transfer Ken Hammer
should prove a welcome addition
to the Indian roster. Hard swim
ming clutch performer Luis Ni
colao also returns to action.
Tribe Depth
Two-year lettermen Walt
Poterbin and Doug Mac Lean
give Stanford depth that may
be decisive in a tight game
where foul attrition cuts deeply
into both benches.
Juniors Jeff Hammett and
John Wooley and Dick Roth,
returning after a year's layoff
give Stanford two solid teams.
Stanford's biggest problem is
lack of experience in the goal.
Pan Am breaststroke silver
medalist Bob Momsen is com
peting for the goalie position
with Junior Doug Chapin and
freshman Banks Beasley.

Gaughran expressed pleasant
surprise with the conditioning
of the team at the start of the
season. Gaughran was able to
start right away with the rigor
ous drills normally saved for the
second week.
Stanford's traditional low-foul
ing game should prove doubly
beneficial this year. Not only

will the Cards give away the ball
fewer times than most teams,
but this year the policy will save
goals. A rules change awards a
penalty shot for every 10 fouls
committed against a team.
UCLA Top Dog
Last year's NCAA champ
UCLA returns with virtually its

same team, including three Ali
Americans and a large chunk
of Inland Nu-Pike's Pan An
Trials runner-up squad. Cal will
be no less of an obstacle, with
a tank fuL of Foothill AC vet
erans and the Czechosiovakiar
national goalie.
San Jose State has fielded its
strongest team ever and will bf
no pushover, especially in Sar
Jose's indoor bathtub.
USC doesn't look too formid
able in the pre-season outlook
but nobody is pretending tr
count the Trojans out of title
conten^on

Experienced Meyer
Bill Meyer brings two letters
and an array of offensive moves
to the 1967 season. Tom Hill, a
sophomore, will be vying for a
starting spot with quick hands
and a vicious backhand.
Greg Buckingham will add a
solid chunk to the Card lineup
as soon as an eligibility dispute
is cleared up. The four-time NC
AA swimming record holder
made the second All-Conference
team last fall.

JC transfer Ken Hammer
should prove a welcome addition
to the Indian roster. Hard swim

Tribe Depth
Two-year lettermen Walt
Poterbin and Doug Mac Lean
give Stanford depth that may
be decisive in a tight game
where foul attrition cuts deeply
into both benches.
Juniors Jeff Hammett and
John Wooley and Dick Roth,
returning after a year's layoff
give Stanford two solid teams.
Stanford's biggest problem is
lack of experience in the goal.
Pan Am breaststroke silver
medalist Bob Momsen is com

Gaughran expressed pleasant
surprise with the conditioning
of the team at the start of the
season. Gaughran was able to
start right away with the rigor
ous drills normally saved for the
second week.
Stanford's traditional low-foul
ing game should prove doubly
beneficial this year. Not only

will the Cards give away the ball
fewer times than most teams,
but this year the policy will save
goals. A rules change awards a
penalty shot for every 10 fouls
committed against a team.
UCLA Top Dog
Last year's NCAA champ
UCLA returns with virtually its

Americans and a large chunk
of Inland Nu-Pike's Pan An

be no less of an obstacle, with
a tank fuL of Foothill AC vet

national goalie.
San Jose State has fielded its
strongest team ever and will bf
no pushover, especially in Sar

against the alumni Saturday at

Gary Sheerer, named Out

John Parker played with
Sheerer on the Foothill Acquatic

Europe last summer, according
to Foothill AC and future Olym

the hole, either trying to get off
a shot or set up a Stanford
