# Tabla, Sarod Sounds To Fill Dink Saturday
## 
### 
The seeming contradiction of
Indian music — freedom to im
provise, bounded by strict and
ancient principles — will be
demonstrated at Dinkelspiel Sat
urday, Sept. 30, when the Stan
ford India Association sponsors
a performance by two of India's
best-known young musicians.
Ashish Khan, 28, has perform
ed extensively in India and tour
ed Southeast Asia this year. Be
sides his performing accomplish
ments on the sarod, he has com
posed scores for the films "Ra
jar.Raja" and "Jatu Griha."
Accompanying Khan will be
one of the finest tabla players
in India, Mahapurush Misra, who
bears the title "Pandit."
The tabla, the most popular
drum instrument of North India,
is composed of two drums — a
bass and a treble. The tabla
player keeps time for the soloist,
underlining the melody estab
lishing a framework for him.
Misra, 33, has accompanied
most of the well-known India
musicians in concerts through
out India. Since 1959 he has per
formed in Europe, East Africa,
Southeast Asia, Canada and the
U.S.
During the rummers of 1966-67
he was a tabla instructor at Ber
keley.
The Saturday concert will be
gin at 8 p.m., with admission
$1.50 for students — $2.50 for
the general public.

A talk on the differences be
tween Indian and Western
music will be given at Lagunita
Court at 5:30 p.m. today.


Ashish Kahn, one of two young; Indian musicians to perform here
Saturday, demonstrates 25-stringed teak sarod. Stanford Indian
Association will sponsor concert.
