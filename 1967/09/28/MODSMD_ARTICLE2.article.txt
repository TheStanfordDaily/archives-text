### 
Leßoi Jones will not be speak
ing on campus this afternoon.
A friend of the Black Power
leader informed the Political
Union last night that Jones must
appear in court today on charges
connected with summer racial
riots in Newark, New Jersey.
According to Dave Robertson,
president of Political Union, the
Negro playwright will be asked
to appear at Stanford after legal
proceedings in the case are
finished. He was scheduled to
speak on "Negroes of Violence,
the New Revolution."
Anti-white Plays
Jones is founder of the Black
Arts Repertory Theater in New
York and has written a number
of controversial anti-white plays,
including "The Toilet" and"The
Dutchman." His play "The
Slave" won an award at the first
World Festival of Negro Arts in
Dakar, Senegal, where he was
honored as the world's outstand
ing playwright.
Jones' works deal with what
he calls the "uniqueness and
beauty of the black man and the
rapacity and cruelty of the white
man." He says that any sort of
rapprochment between the
races is impossible.
The miltant writer was arrest
ed during a riot last July in
which five policemen, were in
jured.
The "Beautiful People"
In a well-known statement
quoted in the New York Times,
Jones told American Negroes
"the white man owes you every
thing, even his life. Smash their
silly white faces." He has also
called Jesus "the dead Jew" and
says of Negroes: "We are the
beautiful people with African
imaginations."
