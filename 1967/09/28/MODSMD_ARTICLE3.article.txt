# Draft Law Leaves Students Uncertain
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY (Second of two parts) 
Undergraduates are now
protected from the draft as
long as they are careful to
graduate within four years.
But graduate students, accor
ding to President Johnson,
will lose their deferments —
but not quite yet.
This is a simplified sum
mary of the new draft policy
which has so disturbed Stan
ford that the University is
considering "methods which
might be employed to encour
age amendment of the cur
rent law."
Students with one or more
years of graduate study al
ready behind them will be
deferred until they get their
degrees, provided they don't
dawdle more than two years
in getting a master's or five
years for a doctorate.
But Johnson's Executive
Order of June 30, 1967 states
that beginning October 1, 1967
"hll first-year graduate stu
dents may be given a 11-S de
ferment "for one academic
year only."
ONE YEAR LIMIT
After that one-year mora
torium, they will all be 1-A.
Or will they?
The Executive Order also
says that any graduate stu
dent in a subject designated
"necessary to the mainte
nance of the national health,
safety or interest" will still
be deferred. This includes
medical students, the order
states.
But will the deferment be

extended to philosophy ma
jors, law students or anyone
besides future doctors? That
will be decided at a future
date by the "director of the
Selective Service upon the
advice of the National Se
curity Council." Which is an
other way of saying that
President Johnson hasn't
made up his mind yet. Con
gress has left the matter in
his hands.
The stringency of draft
calls will influence how many
graduate specialists are classi
fied as "necessary," believes

Walter J. Findeisen, Stan
ford's draft adviser.
To complicate matters fur
ther, local draft boards aren't
bound to obey these graduate
deferment criteria, because
the Executive Order uses the
word "may," not "will."
Thus a second year gradu
ate may be deferred until he
gets his Ph.D., and a
ning graduate student may be
granted a 11-S. The freedom
of the local draft boards to
defer and draft whom they
please is not abridged. The
President's now defunct Com
mission on the draft advised
that local boards be required
to follow a uniform national
set of rules, but Congress re
fused to take such a contro
versial action when the en
tire draft system was under
the pressure of the Vietnam
war. So the President has
made uniform although in
complete rules, but he can't
make them binding.
ALL IN DANGER
Findeisen explains that all
graduate students, except
medical students, are there'
fore in danger. In particular,
he says, "Any graduate stu
dent in his first year of study
is vulnerable, and I think
they are all aware of it, and
all worried about it.
"Nobody really understands
the intents or puri»oses of the
new law," Findeisen says. "A
hard-nosed draft board in dire
circumstances could pull any
graduate student out"


PROF. PAUL SEAVER be
lieves the new draft law will
shorten the appeal process,
but not change its effect
Findeisen hopes the National
Security Council never issues its
list of deferrable graduate spe
cialties. "Then they will leave
the most latitude for local boards
to grant deferments."
And ultimately, the pragmatic
driving force behind the welter
of vague regulations is the mili
tary's need for draftees. If the
draft quotas increase drastically,
it will be easy for local boards
to draft any undergraduates who
have somehow forfeited their
right to the 11-S, as well as all
graduate students in their dis
tricts.
"The age group 24-25 is in the
greatest jeopardy," says Findei
sen. They are ineligible by their
age for the undergraduate de
ferment, (which cannot extend
past 24), yet quite near the age
26 cut-off which would put them
in a lower-priority call-up group.
Draft boards are anxious to get
these men before they turn 26.
Graduate students are not the
only group which has been given
an uncertain status by the new
law. Conscientious objectors may
encounter greater difficulty in
securing the 1-A-O and l-O de
ferments.
Congress struck out the pas
sage in the draft law defining
legal conscientious objection as
"an individual's belief in rela
tion to a Supreme Being involv
ing duties superior to those aris
ing from any human relation
ship."
This passage hadn't endanger
ed any non-religious CO's any
way, because the Seeger decision
of the Supreme Court in 1965
forbade the specification of any
formal religious affiliation as a
requirement for CO.
But Congress retained the rule
that quaification for CO "does
not include essentially political,

sociological or philosophical
views of merely personal moral
code."
The most immediate effect of
the new law on students and
others seeking CO will be in the
speed with which their cases
will be dealt with by. the Selec
tive Service.
Now appeals of local boards'
decisions on CO will be deferred
directly to state appeal boards.
The state boards will act on the
appeal with no evidence other
than the file prepared by the
local board which initially denied
the appeal.
Seaver recommends now that
applicants for CO make personal
appearances before their state
appeal boards, as well as local
boards.
Burke Marshall, chairman of
the defunct Presidential Draft
Commission, was quoted by The
New York Times as saying "the
new bill makes the system worse
than it was before."
Marshall evidently won't find
any argument on this score from
Stanford University. A special
committee to advise the Presi
dent on the draft was organized
last summer.
An official statement titled
"Responsibility of the Selective

Service Committee" was released
at the request of Tin- Daily. Its
text reveals the deep dissatisfac
tion of the University with the
draft law's treatment of higher
education:
"1) To study the Military Se
lective Service Aet of 15M>7 and
the Executive Order which sup
plements it in order to identify
the ways in which the new law
would seem to cause problems
for Stanford and other institu
tions of higher education;
"2) To submit to the President
of the University recommenda
tions about how the law might
be modified in order to minimize
or eliminate those problems;
"3) To recommend methods
which might he employed to en
courage amendment of the cur
rent law;
"4) To observe the general
situation regarding Selective Ser
vice, giving especial attention to
changes proposed by educational
and political agencies, and to
evaluate those proposals for the
President."
Thus Stanford contemplates
no less than lobbying for the
amendment of the draft law to
eliminate passages which cause
"problems for Stanford and
other institutions."
