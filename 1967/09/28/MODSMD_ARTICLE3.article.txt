# Draft Law Leaves Students Uncertain
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY (Second of two parts) 
Undergraduates are now
protected from the draft as
long as they are careful to
graduate within four years.
But graduate students, accor
ding to President Johnson,
will lose their deferments —
but not quite yet.
This is a simplified sum
mary of the new draft policy
which has so disturbed Stan
ford that the University is
considering "methods which
might be employed to encour
age amendment of the cur
rent law."
Students with one or more
years of graduate study al
ready behind them will be
deferred until they get their
degrees, provided they don't
dawdle more than two years
in getting a master's or five
years for a doctorate.
But Johnson's Executive
Order of June 30, 1967 states
that beginning October 1, 1967
"hll first-year graduate stu
dents may be given a 11-S de
ferment "for one academic
year only."
ONE YEAR LIMIT
After that one-year mora
torium, they will all be 1-A.
Or will they?
The Executive Order also
says that any graduate stu
dent in a subject designated
"necessary to the mainte
nance of the national health,
safety or interest" will still
be deferred. This includes
medical students, the order
states.
But will the deferment be

extended to philosophy ma
jors, law students or anyone
besides future doctors? That
will be decided at a future
date by the "director of the
Selective Service upon the
advice of the National Se
curity Council." Which is an
other way of saying that
President Johnson hasn't
made up his mind yet. Con
gress has left the matter in
his hands.
The stringency of draft
calls will influence how many
graduate specialists are classi
fied as "necessary," believes

Walter J. Findeisen, Stan
ford's draft adviser.
To complicate matters fur
ther, local draft boards aren't
bound to obey these graduate
deferment criteria, because
the Executive Order uses the
word "may," not "will."
Thus a second year gradu
ate may be deferred until he
gets his Ph.D., and a
ning graduate student may be
granted a 11-S. The freedom
of the local draft boards to
defer and draft whom they
please is not abridged. The
President's now defunct Com
mission on the draft advised
that local boards be required
to follow a uniform national
set of rules, but Congress re
fused to take such a contro
versial action when the en
tire draft system was under
the pressure of the Vietnam
war. So the President has
made uniform although in
complete rules, but he can't
make them binding.
ALL IN DANGER
Findeisen explains that all
graduate students, except
medical students, are there'
fore in danger. In particular,
he says, "Any graduate stu
dent in his first year of study
is vulnerable, and I think
they are all aware of it, and
all worried about it.
"Nobody really understands
the intents or puri»oses of the
new law," Findeisen says. "A
hard-nosed draft board in dire
circumstances could pull any
graduate student out"


PROF. PAUL SEAVER be
lieves the new draft law will
shorten the appeal process,
but not change its effect
