In case you haven't noticed,
Stanford is in the midst of a
building boom.
"We're finally coming out of
the ground," said Royal Tyson,
Senior Planner at Stanford,
speaking of the $3.3 million Ros
coe Maples Pavilion. It was
just part of the over $27,500,000
worth of construction now under
way at Stanford.
Throe Buildings Started
Over the summer, construction
started on three new buildings:
the new Art Building, the Fire
and Police Station, and the Hepl
(High Energy Physics Lab) Tun
nel. Preparations for remodeling
Jordan and Encina Halls to
house Psychology and the Food
Research Institute, respectively,
were completed.
At the same time, the Herrin
Biology buildings were finished,
and the third fraternity cluster
and the Space Engineering Build
ing, the first new building on
Lomita Mall, also "came out of
the ground."
Art Dpt. All In One
Most of the summer construc
tion is service or science orented.
The only humanities building
under construction is the Art
Building, located between the
Art Gallery and the Main Li
brary.
Due to be completed in April,
1969, the $2,425,000 structure in
cludes studios for undergradu
ates, a 350-seat auditorium, slide
projectors, and room for one of
the largest art libraries in the
country. It is partially financed
by a $780,000 Office of Education
grant.
Ground breaking began most
recently for the Hepl Tunnel and
the Fire and Police Station. The
Hepl Tunnel is a two-stage proj
ect for a tunnel to house a super
conducting (extremely low tem
perature) accelerator.
The $1,370,000 first stage of

the project, which is financed
entirely by Navy contract, is con
struction of a tunnel under the
present High Energy Physics
Buildings. When the tunnel is
finished in June, 1968, the sec
ond stage of the project — build
ing of an end station — will be
gin immediately.
A new Fire and Police Station
is being built primarily because
the rerouting of university roads
and traffic patterns is "locking
in" the existing fire and police
offices on Santa Teresa Street.
The new $800,000 office is lo
cated on the corner of Serra
Street and Campus Drive, direct
ly on one of the new main traf
fic routes. It will be ready for
use by August, 1968.
The three projects just "com

ing out of the ground" will be
finished by December, 1968. Dedi
cation of the new Maples pavi
lion is scheduled for the Stan
ford vs. Northwestern game on
November 30, 1968.
The pavilion will hold 8,000
people — seven times the capa
city of Memorial Auditorium —
for basketball, wrestling, and
other special events.
With the larger seating capa
city the university will be able
to attract professional groups
such as the symphony and
concert artists, which it pre
viously could not afford.
"Man In Space" Center
The $4,707,000 Space Engineer
ing building, to be completed in
December of 1968, will coordin-
