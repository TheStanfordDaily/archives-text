# Bulldozers, Barriers Herald Building Boom

In case you haven't noticed,
Stanford is in the midst of a
building boom.
"We're finally coming out of
the ground," said Royal Tyson,
Senior Planner at Stanford,
speaking of the $3.3 million Ros
coe Maples Pavilion. It was
just part of the over $27,500,000
worth of construction now under
way at Stanford.
Throe Buildings Started
Over the summer, construction
started on three new buildings:
the new Art Building, the Fire
and Police Station, and the Hepl
(High Energy Physics Lab) Tun
nel. Preparations for remodeling
Jordan and Encina Halls to
house Psychology and the Food
Research Institute, respectively,
were completed.
At the same time, the Herrin
Biology buildings were finished,
and the third fraternity cluster
and the Space Engineering Build
ing, the first new building on
Lomita Mall, also "came out of
the ground."
Art Dpt. All In One
Most of the summer construc
tion is service or science orented.
The only humanities building
under construction is the Art
Building, located between the
Art Gallery and the Main Li
brary.
Due to be completed in April,
1969, the $2,425,000 structure in
cludes studios for undergradu
ates, a 350-seat auditorium, slide
projectors, and room for one of
the largest art libraries in the
country. It is partially financed
by a $780,000 Office of Education
grant.
Ground breaking began most
recently for the Hepl Tunnel and
the Fire and Police Station. The
Hepl Tunnel is a two-stage proj
ect for a tunnel to house a super
conducting (extremely low tem
perature) accelerator.
The $1,370,000 first stage of

the project, which is financed
entirely by Navy contract, is con
struction of a tunnel under the
present High Energy Physics
Buildings. When the tunnel is
finished in June, 1968, the sec
ond stage of the project — build
ing of an end station — will be
gin immediately.
A new Fire and Police Station
is being built primarily because
the rerouting of university roads
and traffic patterns is "locking
in" the existing fire and police
offices on Santa Teresa Street.
The new $800,000 office is lo
cated on the corner of Serra
Street and Campus Drive, direct
ly on one of the new main traf
fic routes. It will be ready for
use by August, 1968.
The three projects just "com

ing out of the ground" will be
finished by December, 1968. Dedi
cation of the new Maples pavi
lion is scheduled for the Stan
ford vs. Northwestern game on
November 30, 1968.
The pavilion will hold 8,000
people — seven times the capa
city of Memorial Auditorium —
for basketball, wrestling, and
other special events.
With the larger seating capa
city the university will be able
to attract professional groups
such as the symphony and
concert artists, which it pre
viously could not afford.
"Man In Space" Center
The $4,707,000 Space Engineer
ing building, to be completed in
December of 1968, will coordin-
ate all aerospace studies under
way on campus.
The building, three-fourths
financed by ten-year contracts
with the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and
the Air Force, will house facili
ties for research, ranging from
work in microelectronics and
systems theory to mathematical
studies of human performance.
Area is provided for both re
search and teaching, with the re
search facilities divided into per
manent areas for long-term stu
dies and rotational space for
short-term studies. There is also
space for a computer, storage of
tapes, and environment testing
areas.
Third Cluster For Next Year
The new fraternity cluster,
just east of the Cowell Health
Center on Campus Drive, will
house the Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Phi Gamma Delta, Chi Psi, Al
pha Tau Omicron, and Alpha
Sigma Phi fraternities.
It is the third cluster to be
built on campus.
Due to be completed for the
1968-69 school year, the initial
cost of over $2.7 million is being
financed by a $1,050,000 loan
from the U.S. Office of Housing
and pledges of $250,000 from

each fraternity. The loan will be
repaid through monthly rentals.
In July the Biology Depart
ment moved from Jordan Hall
into the just-completed Herrin
Biology buildings. The $5.3 mil
lion buildings contain a new bio
logy library, new lab equipment
such as X-ray machines and
fluoroscopes, a computer, class
rooms, and research facilities.
The larger of the two build
ings, which is half financed by
the National Science Founda
tion, consists chiefly of graduate
research areas, each of which
will be assigned to one special
ist. The smaller building will be
used for undergraduate lec
tures, classes, and labs.
New Home For Psych
Beginning in late November,
vacated Jordan Hall will be
stripped to the walls and entirely
rebuilt for the Psychology De
partment.
The two-year project to house
the Psychology department in
one building will cost approxi
mately $4,750,000. It has been
given grants totaling $1,700,000
by the National Science Founda
tion, the Office of Education, and
the National Institutes of Health.
The west part of Encina Hall,
too, will be remodeled, to pro
vide space for the Food Re-

search Institute. The $1,750,000
project has been given a grant
of $400,000 by the Office of Edu
cation and remodeling will prob
ably begin in November here,
too. The project will be com
pleted in lVz to 1% years.
Office Switching.
Other buildings on campus
are also being remodeled. Build
ing 110 on Quad, formerly the
Admissions office, is being re
modeled for the Anthropology
Department.
The Stanford Museum will
alter its display space slightly
to provide room for the jade
collection given the museum by
Mrs. Frank E. Buck. Some
minor resettling is also being
done in Hoover Tower.
Spending for building in the
past four years nearly triples
construction spending in the
previous four years. The build
ing boom is an effort to raise
the quality of Stanford's physi
cal plant to the high level of
her faculty.
Stanford was forced to con
centrate on improving the qual
ity of her faculty, rather than
on her building needs, from the
late forties until the start of the
PACE program in 1960. As a re
sult, a gap developed which the
"boom" is now trying to fill.
