## Smoking Outlawed In UGLY 
### 
Smoking is no longer allowed
in the Undergraduate Library.
And student negligence is the
reason, according to University
officials.
At the end of summer quar
ter, signs went up throughout
J. Henry Meyer Memorial Li
brary forbidding smoking, ex
cept on the outside terraces,
and in the main floor lobby.
Director of University librar
ies, Rutherford D. Rogers, said
fire danger and student disre
gard for limits on smoking
areas necessitated the change.
Also, Rogers said people stole
any decent ashtrays set out.
And the cheap tinfoil-cardboard
ones to which the University re
sorted easily tipped off chair
arms, knocking ashes into up
holstery.
The problem was "getting
people to respect limitations,"
Rogers explained. The third
floor smoking area boundaries
were clearly marked, but ash
trays and matches were strewn
all over that floor, he said.
Rogers added that people also
stubbed cigarettes on the floor,
badly burning the vinyl tile.
There were also burns in up

holstery, and at least one rug
burn was found on the fourth
floor —where no smoking was
allowed at all.
A fire scare last June 3 en
couraged library officials to
change the smoking regulations.
A pipe smoking student didn't
notice when he accidentally
dropped ashes into a main floor
wastebasket full of paper.
When flames broke out, a
smoke sensor set off the alarm.
A student rushed in to smother
the conflagration with a rug,
but heat melted the wastebasket
before he extinguished the fire.
Rogers noted that the inci
dent caused no major damage,
but made University library
officials acutely aware of what
could happen if fire broke out
upstairs.
Although the building itself
is "basically fireproof," Rogers
said, wood used in paneling,
bookcase ends, and tables, and
especially the books are ready
fuel.
The only way to continue
allowing smoking in the library
would be to hire two or three
full-time persons to clcan up

after smokers, and remind care
less persons, he remarked.
Rogers estimated that their
combined salaries would be
$12.5 thousand to $15 thousand
a year.
The final decision to ban
smoking in Meyer Library came
from the office of University
President Wallace Sterling.
Sterling acted after the Com
mittee on University Libraries
discussed the problem extensiv
ely. Members of the ASSU Li
brary Commission were invited
to sit in on the meetings.
Sterling also considered a
study, run by Seraphim F. Post,
on smoking in University librar
ies. Post is assistant business
manager of the Office for Busi
ness Affairs, which is respons
ible for protecting University
investments — human lives,
buildings, books and art objects
—and handles contracts for the
University's insurance.
Rogers said he hopes the
Meyer Library's main floor, not
yet decorated, can be fixed up
with exhibition murals and com
fortable chairs to allow students
to continue reading while enjoy
ing a smoke.

When flames broke out, a
smoke sensor set off the alarm.
A student rushed in to smother
the conflagration with a rug,
but heat melted the wastebasket
before he extinguished the fire.
Rogers noted that the inci
dent caused no major damage,
but made University library
officials acutely aware of what
could happen if fire broke out
upstairs.
Although the building itself
is "basically fireproof," Rogers
said, wood used in paneling,
bookcase ends, and tables, and
especially the books are ready
fuel.
The only way to continue
allowing smoking in the library
would be to hire two or three
full-time persons to clcan up

after smokers, and remind care
less persons, he remarked.
Rogers estimated that their
combined salaries would be
$12.5 thousand to $15 thousand
a year.
The final decision to ban
smoking in Meyer Library came
from the office of University
President Wallace Sterling.
Sterling acted after the Com
mittee on University Libraries
discussed the problem extensiv
ely. Members of the ASSU Li
brary Commission were invited
to sit in on the meetings.
Sterling also considered a
study, run by Seraphim F. Post,
on smoking in University librar
ies. Post is assistant business
manager of the Office for Busi
ness Affairs, which is respons
ible for protecting University
investments — human lives,
buildings, books and art objects
—and handles contracts for the
University's insurance.
Rogers said he hopes the
Meyer Library's main floor, not
yet decorated, can be fixed up
with exhibition murals and com
fortable chairs to allow students
to continue reading while enjoy
ing a smoke.
Smoking is no longer allowed
in the Undergraduate Library.
And student negligence is the
reason, according to University
officials.
At the end of summer quar
ter, signs went up throughout
J. Henry Meyer Memorial Li
brary forbidding smoking, ex
cept on the outside terraces,
and in the main floor lobby.
Director of University librar
ies, Rutherford D. Rogers, said
fire danger and student disre
gard for limits on smoking
areas necessitated the change.
Also, Rogers said people stole
any decent ashtrays set out.
And the cheap tinfoil-cardboard
ones to which the University re
sorted easily tipped off chair
arms, knocking ashes into up
holstery.
The problem was "getting
people to respect limitations,"
Rogers explained. The third
floor smoking area boundaries
were clearly marked, but ash
trays and matches were strewn
all over that floor, he said.
Rogers added that people also
stubbed cigarettes on the floor,
badly burning the vinyl tile.
There were also burns in up

holstery, and at least one rug
burn was found on the fourth
floor —where no smoking was
allowed at all.
A fire scare last June 3 en
couraged library officials to
change the smoking regulations.
A pipe smoking student didn't
notice when he accidentally
dropped ashes into a main floor
wastebasket full of paper.
