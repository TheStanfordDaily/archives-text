# University Official Advises
## Activity Credits Going, But Not Yet Gone 
### VIC OWEN 
Freshman sponsors were re
cently told by a Stanford ad
ministrator to advise freshmen
to sign up for activity credits
despite the likelihood that these
credits will be abolished by the
time they are seniors.
Peter B. Dahl, Secretary to
the Committee on General Stu
dies, advised that "seniors should
not delay their activity credits
hoping for favorable action by
the General Studies Committee;
but students just entering the
University may want to wait, on
the likelihood that activity cred
its may be abolished. Students
who delay acquiring activity
credits do so at their own risk."
The delay in making a deci
sion on abolishing activity cred

its has been caused by the fact
that the Committee has had
much of its time taken up by
the consideration of other issues,
and by the action of people who
are strongly in favor of having
the activity credit system retain
ed.
As early as February 1966, a
resolution for abolishment of the
requirement was proposed and
discussed. At that time, the Com
mittee was reminded that certain
activities depended on the re
quirement to assure member
ship.
Resolution Passed
No action was recommended
by the Committee at that time
so that all "interested parties"
could be consulted. This was, in

fact, done before the March
meeting. After lengthy discus
sion, a resolution was passed
recommending phasing out the
requirement over a three-year
period.
The three-year plan would
have two units of the require
ment dropped each year. The
physical education requirement
would be dropped in the final
year. The reason for the phase
out, as opposed to an immediate
abolition of the system, would
be to give all groups concerned
time to adjust to the new situa
tion.
This recommendation was for
warded to the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council
for action in June, 1967.
The Departments of Music

and Women's P.E. appealed for
more time for the issue to be
heard fully. The question was
then tabled.
Arguments Presented
In November, 1966, these De
partments came before the Gen
eral Studies Committee to pre
sent arguments for retaining
the activity credits requirement.
Action was delayed because of
other more pressing issues be
fore the Committee.
The Committee then decided,
in February, 1967, to recall the
recommendation and to prepare
a new recommendation for the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) and for the Committee
on Undergraduate Education
(CUE). The idea was that these

two committees were more di
rectly concerned with the over
all undergraduate educational
program.
There seems to be no strong
current of feeling within the
Committee against abolishing
the requirement. In fact, there
is strong feeling that the re
quirement should be abolished.
This fact is evidenced by Com
mittee passage of the resolution
of March, 1966.
The entering Stanford student
was presumably active in ex
tra-curricular activities in high
school and therefore would not
need to demonstrate that he can
be active.
According to the "Summary
General Studies Program," in
addition to the two units of

physical education, "4 remaining
units may be fulfilled either in
physical activity offerings or in
group activities approved by the
General Studies Committee."
Value Judgments
However, the approved activi
ties themselves often constitute
a value judgment. There are no
credits offered in painting, in
arts and crafts, or even in such
activities as auto mechanics. Ac
cording to Franklin, this is a
tacit judgment of class position
in the society.
Finally, there is not one real
shred of evidence that the activ
ity credit makes one into a
basically better or worse person
for the experience.

time to adjust to the new situa
tion.
This recommendation was for
warded to the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council
for action in June, 1967.
The Departments of Music

and Women's P.E. appealed for
more time for the issue to be
heard fully. The question was
then tabled.
Arguments Presented
In November, 1966, these De
partments came before the Gen
eral Studies Committee to pre
sent arguments for retaining
the activity credits requirement.
Action was delayed because of
other more pressing issues be
fore the Committee.
The Committee then decided,
in February, 1967, to recall the
recommendation and to prepare
a new recommendation for the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) and for the Committee
on Undergraduate Education
(CUE). The idea was that these

two committees were more di
rectly concerned with the over
all undergraduate educational
program.
There seems to be no strong
current of feeling within the
Committee against abolishing
the requirement. In fact, there
is strong feeling that the re
quirement should be abolished.
This fact is evidenced by Com
mittee passage of the resolution
of March, 1966.
The entering Stanford student
was presumably active in ex
tra-curricular activities in high
school and therefore would not
need to demonstrate that he can
be active.
According to the "Summary
General Studies Program," in
addition to the two units of

physical education, "4 remaining
units may be fulfilled either in
physical activity offerings or in
group activities approved by the
General Studies Committee."
Value Judgments
However, the approved activi
ties themselves often constitute
a value judgment. There are no
credits offered in painting, in
arts and crafts, or even in such
activities as auto mechanics. Ac
cording to Franklin, this is a
tacit judgment of class position
in the society.
Finally, there is not one real
shred of evidence that the activ
ity credit makes one into a
basically better or worse person
for the experience.
Freshman sponsors were re
cently told by a Stanford ad
ministrator to advise freshmen
to sign up for activity credits
despite the likelihood that these
credits will be abolished by the
time they are seniors.
Peter B. Dahl, Secretary to
the Committee on General Stu
dies, advised that "seniors should
not delay their activity credits
hoping for favorable action by
the General Studies Committee;
but students just entering the
University may want to wait, on
the likelihood that activity cred
its may be abolished. Students
who delay acquiring activity
credits do so at their own risk."
The delay in making a deci
sion on abolishing activity cred

its has been caused by the fact
that the Committee has had
much of its time taken up by
the consideration of other issues,
and by the action of people who
are strongly in favor of having
the activity credit system retain
ed.
As early as February 1966, a
resolution for abolishment of the
requirement was proposed and
discussed. At that time, the Com
mittee was reminded that certain
activities depended on the re
quirement to assure member
ship.
Resolution Passed
No action was recommended
by the Committee at that time
so that all "interested parties"
could be consulted. This was, in

fact, done before the March
meeting. After lengthy discus
sion, a resolution was passed
recommending phasing out the
requirement over a three-year
period.
The three-year plan would
have two units of the require
ment dropped each year. The
physical education requirement
would be dropped in the final
year. The reason for the phase
out, as opposed to an immediate
abolition of the system, would
be to give all groups concerned
time to adjust to the new situa
tion.
