# Pre-Reg Committee
## 
### 
We congratulate the Pre-Registration Com
mittee on the overall program provided for
this year's incoming freshmen. Several signifi
cant innovations gave the neophytes a more
realistic introduction to the Stanford of today.
We say more realistic, because the Pre-Reg
week still remains a superficial and misleading,
but possibly necessary, introduction to life on
the Farm.
The hostel program last Thursday night and
Friday was a monumental achievement in log
istics, but even more important the hostels drew
involvement from hundreds of students, fac
ulty, and staff. The relationships begun and the
atmosphere created with these hostels will bear
fruit throughout the coming four years.
A second innovation was the burial of the
traditional Saturday night Jolly-Up. The arti
ficial social situation that was created in past
years often lasted throughout the freshman
year. The Tresidder Happening which replaced
the Jolly-Up provided a variety of experiences
that we hope are somehow related to the
diversity of a Stanford education. The Quad
unwittingly made its contribution to Pre-Reg
week and the social adjustment of the fresh
men by delaying the distribution of the Frosh
books until nearly November.
Sadly, while the Pre-Reg committee was im
proving its program for freshmen, the transfer
Pre-Reg program deteriorated more than ever.
The treatment that Stanford gives transfers is
nothing short of appalling. Transfers come
autumn, winter and spring quarters, but only in
the fall is there any attempt to provide an orien
tation. Transfers may not want to participate in
an orientation program that reeks of the fresh
man spirit, but they do need serious help in
finding housing and in learning the basic pro
cedures of the University.
What was planned for transfers this year was
minimal, and the execution of those programs

was sloppy at best. The eating clubs aided some
transfers to find housing and get acclimated, but
the committee given the responsibility did little.
Finally, Peter Lyman's letter raised the ques
tion whether the Pre-Reg program is a student
run or administration-run project. The question
is misdirected, for Pre-Reg is obviously an ac
tivity of and by the whole University. Students
will plan and execute many parts of the pro
gram and faculty and administration other
parts. The whole University must ask the ques
tion: "What does a new Stanford student need
to know about the University?" The whole Uni
versity then must act to provide that informa
tion in the most realistic manner possible.
