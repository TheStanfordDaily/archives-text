# LASSU's Weinstein: The Speaker Talks
## 
### BARABARA LEVIN 
"I got involved in LASSU last
year practically by default," ex
plained Mike Weinstein, speaker
of LASSU. "No one in my house
seemed interested last fall so
I volunteered."
This problem, lack of interest
on the part of the student body,
is the primary concern of the
legislature, the new speaker be
lieves. In his platform speech
last spring, Weinstein outlined a
series of changes which could
help alleviate the situation.
Weinstein, who feels that par
liamentary quibbling tragically
wastes LASSU time, wants to
employ the committees to a
greater advantage in accom
plishing the legislature's work.
"Committees are the real
strength of LASSU," he said.
Floor Confusion
As a member of the Finance
Committee last year, Weinstein
became acquainted with the com
mittee system and its benefits.
He hopes that all LASSU mem
bers will serve on a minimum
of one committee and that the
work of these groups will re
place the confusion of normal
floor debate.
"The entire legislature will
probably meet only one every
two weeks this year," Weinstein
added. The committees, how
ever, should meet weekly.
Weinstein expressed his in
terest in retaining the house rep
resentative system. He feels that
there is sufficient work for at
least 100 delegates.
"An elite group in LASSU
comes not through design — as
a manipulative procedure — but
because so few students take an
active role."
Coordinate Relationship
Weinstein sees LASSU's work
this year as a coordinate rela
tionship to SES. His plans in

clude exploratory committees,
composed entirely of students
which will discuss particular
points on the Study's agenda.
While mentioning some of the
project possibilities which face
LASSU this fall, Weinstein al
luded to problems in budgeting.
He is skeptical about some uses
of student funds and also ques
tions the lack of a definite stip
ulation of how LASSU and
ASSU receive funds from the
University.
Weinstein expressed his desire
to reduce the "busy work" of
LASSU and to increase its sup
port in the line of real student
services. One of the plans being
discussed is the formation of a
Bay Area student union which
would negotiate for discounts
and provide special student bene
fits.
Disappointed Freshman
In discussing some of his ac
tivities last year, Weinstein, a
sophomore, commented upon his
disappointment in his freshman
year at Stanford. He said that
he "expected to find a student
body which was actively involv
de in education and not passively
attending classes." He believes
that the trend is toward more
involvement and points to Har
ris as one possible factor in this
upswing.
Weinstein, a pre-med student,
is interested in problems of his
tory, economics, and political
science. Although he did not feel
challenged during his first year,
he did enjoy his freshman semi
nar in molecular biology, which
gave him the opportunity to
participate more actively in re
search work.
Weinstein is now living in
Grove House and is looking for
ward to the experience. His first
year was spent in Lassen House
also in Stern.

After his election last spring,
Mike Weinstein said, "I do not
feel that my class rank, fresh
man, was an issue in this elec
tion." Continuing, he said that
he felt that graduate students
often did not have ample time
for the job.
At the same time Steve Mc-
Millan, a junior, was elected lia
son officer. McMillan had plan
ned to oppose Weinstein but
wtihdrew to run for liason offi
cer. Last spring Weinstein an
nounced his intention of divid
ing his duties with McMillan.

project possibilities which face
LASSU this fall, Weinstein al
luded to problems in budgeting.
He is skeptical about some uses
of student funds and also ques
tions the lack of a definite stip
ulation of how LASSU and
ASSU receive funds from the
University.
Weinstein expressed his desire
to reduce the "busy work" of
LASSU and to increase its sup
port in the line of real student
services. One of the plans being
discussed is the formation of a
Bay Area student union which
would negotiate for discounts
and provide special student bene
fits.
Disappointed Freshman
In discussing some of his ac
tivities last year, Weinstein, a
sophomore, commented upon his
disappointment in his freshman
year at Stanford. He said that
he "expected to find a student
body which was actively involv
de in education and not passively
attending classes." He believes
that the trend is toward more
involvement and points to Har
ris as one possible factor in this
upswing.
Weinstein, a pre-med student,
is interested in problems of his
tory, economics, and political
science. Although he did not feel
challenged during his first year,
he did enjoy his freshman semi
nar in molecular biology, which
gave him the opportunity to
participate more actively in re
search work.
Weinstein is now living in
Grove House and is looking for
ward to the experience. His first
year was spent in Lassen House
also in Stern.

After his election last spring,
Mike Weinstein said, "I do not
feel that my class rank, fresh
man, was an issue in this elec
tion." Continuing, he said that
he felt that graduate students
often did not have ample time
for the job.
At the same time Steve Mc-
Millan, a junior, was elected lia
son officer. McMillan had plan
ned to oppose Weinstein but
wtihdrew to run for liason offi
cer. Last spring Weinstein an
nounced his intention of divid
ing his duties with McMillan.
"I got involved in LASSU last
year practically by default," ex
plained Mike Weinstein, speaker
of LASSU. "No one in my house
seemed interested last fall so
I volunteered."
This problem, lack of interest
on the part of the student body,
is the primary concern of the
legislature, the new speaker be
lieves. In his platform speech
last spring, Weinstein outlined a
series of changes which could
help alleviate the situation.
Weinstein, who feels that par
liamentary quibbling tragically
wastes LASSU time, wants to
employ the committees to a
greater advantage in accom
plishing the legislature's work.
"Committees are the real
strength of LASSU," he said.
Floor Confusion
As a member of the Finance
Committee last year, Weinstein
became acquainted with the com
mittee system and its benefits.
He hopes that all LASSU mem
bers will serve on a minimum
of one committee and that the
work of these groups will re
place the confusion of normal
floor debate.
"The entire legislature will
probably meet only one every
two weeks this year," Weinstein
added. The committees, how
ever, should meet weekly.
Weinstein expressed his in
terest in retaining the house rep
resentative system. He feels that
there is sufficient work for at
least 100 delegates.
"An elite group in LASSU
comes not through design — as
a manipulative procedure — but
because so few students take an
active role."
Coordinate Relationship
Weinstein sees LASSU's work
this year as a coordinate rela
tionship to SES. His plans in

clude exploratory committees,
composed entirely of students
which will discuss particular
points on the Study's agenda.
