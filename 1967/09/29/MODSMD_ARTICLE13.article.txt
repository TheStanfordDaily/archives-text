## The 						Year Ahead 
### 
The last academic year was one of conflict and
questioning, of challenge heard and often sup
pressed, of needs perceived and only sometimes
met. The year ahead will bring new derivatives
of the contemporary questions "What is a uni
versity, what is an education, and what is the
role of students within a University composed
of students, faculty, and administrators."
We feel these will be the nine prime issues
of University concern within the next academic
year:
Presidential Selection: The search for a new
President immediately raises the question: "what
kind of university does Stanford wish to be?"
What will the next President's educational phil
osophy be and what interest groups will he rep
resent? What part will students play in the pro
cess of selection? Are students mere wards of the
University or will they have the opportunity
to participate significantly in the selection?
The Studyof Education: For educational evalu
ation, innovation, and reform to become integral
to the University, they must be part of the struc
ture of Stanford. The Study of Education is the
University's chance not only to create a new edu
cational environment, but to insure that con
tinual innovation will characterize Stanford in
coming years.
Government of the University: With the end of
in loco parentis, a great void is left in the govern
ment and direction of the University. If the ad
ministration is no longer to dictate the actions of
the whole community, then the students and fac
ulty must be ready to accept some of the respon
sibility. Students appear ready, if at times imma
ture, but the administration and trustees seem
reluctant to give up old habits and the faculty
hesitates to undertake its responsibility in the
new University environment.
Financing Education: Stanford like all private

universities, faces an acute crisis in supporting its
educational programs. Without massive federal
aid or other financial support, all private uni
versities will be forced to compromise their edu
cational programs. Stanford must begin its search
for a way to survive.
The Vietnam War: The war and the crises of
conscience it raises for so many Stanford stu
dents and professors will have a profound impact
upon the whole University within the next year.
There will be the demonstrations and protests,
but the greatest effect will be felt in individual
lives and in the concerns and values of the whole
University community.
Residence Policies: The demonstration houses
and residence experiments force a serious con
sideration of how living relates to education at
Stanford. The overall shortage of adequate hous
ing imparts an urgency to this question.
Fraternities: The traditional social fraternity
has no place in the university Stanford is trying
to become. The almost twenty such fraternities
at Stanford are too strong for the University to
overthrow them wholesale, but these houses face
financial hardships and increasing isolation from
the rest of the University.
Religion at Stanford: The new secular religion
being forged here runs headlong into traditional
concepts of the proper realm of religion. The
more campus ministers make their message
relevant to our lives, the more opposition they
encounter.
Rlack Power: The Negro-white conflict is one
rarely considered in a University supposedly en
lightened beyond such emotions. However, the
Black Student Union at Stanford and individual
voices illuminate the vital importance of com
municating to the mass white middle class at
Stanford the understanding their parents so des
perately lack.
