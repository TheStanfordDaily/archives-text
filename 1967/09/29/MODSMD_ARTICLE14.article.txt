# Two Minutes of Haight
## The 						Ties That Bind And An Alternative 
### Tim Haight 
Student: "Master, set me
free!"
Zen master: "Who has tied
you up?"
—reputed to be Zen story
What are the bonds that have
tied you to Stanford? Money?
Status? Staying out of the
army? Getting married to some
one of your, or a better, class?
Finding (choose one) truth,
God, self, an honest man? Pleas
ing Mommy and Daddy? Hoping
to gain the skills to serve your
fellow man?
These are most likely fictions.
Probably, especially if you are a
freshman, you've never really
thought about it. In case you
think you have, however, some
comments on the above alterna
tives follow.
What does it profit a man to
have the whole world and lose
his own soul? For "soul" in this
sticky, anti-religious-word age
reads "consciousness". Get a lot
of money and buy things. Move
them into larger things called
houses, and across the country
in vans. Dust them. Repair
them. Build up mountains of pa
per pulp unwrapping them.
Have a ball.
Pureed Peas Or McLuhan
It sure is nice to know that
when the woman down the
street is discussing how her
baby spit out his pureed peas,
you can sit back and think that
instead of politely nodding, as
you are, you could (thanks to
your Stanford education) be dis
cussing the rise of the German
Reich, Marshall McLuhan, Cam
us, the birth of scientific think
ing in Asia Minor, or Galileo's
discovery of the pendulum.
Your very being here, if you
are male, withdraws you from
the manpower pool of our coun
try's Armed Services. That
means someone not so lucky
has to go. He may be napalmed
to death by a technical error.
Further, your acceptance of the
system through your refuge
here perpetuates the war.
You may find a mate with
similar interests. In a way the
admissions office is a glorified
Operation Match, with the one
miscalculation that about three
male cards come out for each
female. But will you find love?
Not unless you free yourself
from the rituals of social be
havior that this campus foists
upon you. You eat these rituals
up, too. They solve your inse
curity and give you something
appropriate to say to your room
mate.
Will you find truth? You will

find doubt. You will find reser
vation. You will find non-in
volvement. If people thought
they found truth here, why
would they be so anxious to risk
their chromosomes or their ca
reers on other methods?
Will you find God? He's no
more here than anywhere else.
Will you find yourself? First
fill your requirements, make
your grades, eat your meals,
sleep, tell your social lies, and
do whatever's "in". Perhaps in
the five minutes left over you
will find yourself. Will you find
an honest man here? No. The
nearest we come is Dean Na
pier, and he risks too much al
ready.
Not For Mom and Dad
Should you go through this
to please Mommy and Daddy?
Think of your children, not your
parents. Sometime, metaphori
cally or psychologically, you
have to kill your father. At
least, that's how the Greek play
is written. The sociologists say
that most people do it now. If
you must please your parents,
think of all the nice pets they
could buy with the money they'd
save on your tuition.
Will you here learn the skills
to help your fellow man? Per
haps. But in learning those
skills, you may lose the motiva
tion. There is something in the
scientific, functionalist, behavi
oralist, (all of these) mentalities
that gets you away from that
rising sense of need to help.
You can become estranged
from your love of man. If you
need proof, look at the position
of the University on any current
issue, if you can find it. Talk to
your profesors about what can
be done about Vietnam, the ur
ban situation, population, our
country's affluence in a starving
world. You'll see.
So why stay here? Answer
the question. After all, Daily
columnists are Stanford stu
dents, so even this criticism is
sympathetic. Think about it. It
may set you free.

Pureed Peas Or McLuhan
It sure is nice to know that
when the woman down the
street is discussing how her
baby spit out his pureed peas,
you can sit back and think that
instead of politely nodding, as
you are, you could (thanks to
your Stanford education) be dis
cussing the rise of the German
Reich, Marshall McLuhan, Cam
us, the birth of scientific think
ing in Asia Minor, or Galileo's
discovery of the pendulum.
Your very being here, if you
are male, withdraws you from
the manpower pool of our coun
try's Armed Services. That
means someone not so lucky
has to go. He may be napalmed
to death by a technical error.
Further, your acceptance of the
system through your refuge
here perpetuates the war.
You may find a mate with
similar interests. In a way the
admissions office is a glorified
Operation Match, with the one
miscalculation that about three
male cards come out for each
female. But will you find love?
Not unless you free yourself
from the rituals of social be
havior that this campus foists
upon you. You eat these rituals
up, too. They solve your inse
curity and give you something
appropriate to say to your room
mate.
Will you find truth? You will

find doubt. You will find reser
vation. You will find non-in
volvement. If people thought
they found truth here, why
would they be so anxious to risk
their chromosomes or their ca
reers on other methods?
Will you find God? He's no
more here than anywhere else.
Will you find yourself? First
fill your requirements, make
your grades, eat your meals,
sleep, tell your social lies, and
do whatever's "in". Perhaps in
the five minutes left over you
will find yourself. Will you find
an honest man here? No. The
nearest we come is Dean Na
pier, and he risks too much al
ready.
Not For Mom and Dad
Should you go through this
to please Mommy and Daddy?
Think of your children, not your
parents. Sometime, metaphori
cally or psychologically, you
have to kill your father. At
least, that's how the Greek play
is written. The sociologists say
that most people do it now. If
you must please your parents,
think of all the nice pets they
could buy with the money they'd
save on your tuition.
Will you here learn the skills
to help your fellow man? Per
haps. But in learning those
skills, you may lose the motiva
tion. There is something in the
scientific, functionalist, behavi
oralist, (all of these) mentalities
that gets you away from that
rising sense of need to help.
You can become estranged
from your love of man. If you
need proof, look at the position
of the University on any current
issue, if you can find it. Talk to
your profesors about what can
be done about Vietnam, the ur
ban situation, population, our
country's affluence in a starving
world. You'll see.
So why stay here? Answer
the question. After all, Daily
columnists are Stanford stu
dents, so even this criticism is
sympathetic. Think about it. It
may set you free.
Student: "Master, set me
free!"

—reputed to be Zen story
What are the bonds that have
tied you to Stanford? Money?
Status? Staying out of the
army? Getting married to some
one of your, or a better, class?
Finding (choose one) truth,
God, self, an honest man? Pleas
ing Mommy and Daddy? Hoping
to gain the skills to serve your
fellow man?
These are most likely fictions.
Probably, especially if you are a
freshman, you've never really
