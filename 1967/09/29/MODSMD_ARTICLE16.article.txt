# The 						Outpost
## Black America Versus White Suburbia 
### Louis Knowles 
The isolation of the univer
sity community, whatever its
benefits in the past, is becoming
more ridiculous every day.
While Stanford toys with the
world on paper, American socie
ty as it is found within a radius
of 20 miles of the campus is on
trial for its very existence.
In the countries beyond the
Stanford lands the problems of
race and poverty that trouble
the continent are brought into
sharp focus by the close juxta
position of the very rich and
the very poor, the most refined
white institutions and the best
organized black men. The
wealthiest families of California
live in Atherton within two
miles of East Palo Alto that con
tains 600 homes on the welfare
roles.
Ordinarily neither community
knows or cares about what is
occurring in the other, but they
do share in the services of the

Sequoia Union High School Dis
trict which has a reputation sec
ond to none in educational cir
cles. Despite its high standards
the District is bitterly attacked
by outspoken and organized
forces of the black community
that insist the district is de
stroying black children in its
classrooms as fast as they enter
the doors.
Showcase
The wealth and high educa
tional level of the mid-peninsula
white community make it a
showcase for the American way
of life, but for that same reason
it is also the point where the
basic faults of the system are
manifest.
As the voice of the black com
munity has grown in strength
over the past montlis it has
spoken out on the inability of
this respectable, clean white
power structure to understand

and work with the black man.
The serious lack of communi
cation between the white insti
tutions such as the Sequoia Un
ion High School District of
southern San Mateo County and
the ghetto poor was never clear
er than on Sept. 18 when Menlo-
Atherton High School, a pre
dominantly white school located
three miles from Stanford in an
exclusive residential area was
the scene of an outbreak of
demonstrations accompanied by
racial violence.
Rebellion Against Status
The trouble centered around
the 15% of the students who
are black and live across the
Bayshore freeway in East Palo
Alto. They were demanding that
specific grievances be heard and
rectified, but their action was a
rebellion against the whole idea
of their secondary status in
white society.

Administrators understand stu
dents who are discontented and
who complain, but young people
that make demands and back
them up with demonstrations
were unheard of before the
black students organized at
Menlo-Atherton. Consequently
the administration relied on
overwhelming police force to
control the situation and one
sidedly sought to restore its au
thority without direct consulta
tion with the black students.
All this is not to say that the
problem is limited to misunder
standings. There is a reservoir
of racial animosity that is felt
in subtle ways until it rises to
the surface at times of crisis.
"White Power"
A recent testimony to this
was the appearance of groups
of "white power" advocates
among the children of the re
spectable establishment in the

neighborhood of Menlo-Ather
ton. Black students charge that
a group of these young people
carrying pipes, chains, and oth
er weapons entered the black
community of East Palo Alto on
Wednesday Sept. 20 looking for
opportunities to retaliate for the
disturbances at the high school.
The mid-peninsula situation
represents the best that the
moneyed, white technocracy has
produced to date and it has
failed to meet the demands of
the present as they are embod
ied in the Black Power revolu
tion. What is happening here
within 20 miles of Stanford will
repeat itself everywhere if
white America continues to slip
into the fanciful world of lush
suburbia while black America
organizes around its own decla
ration of independence.

Knowles on the Menlo-Atherton
turmoil will appear next week.)

While Stanford toys with the
world on paper, American socie
ty as it is found within a radius
of 20 miles of the campus is on
trial for its very existence.
In the countries beyond the
Stanford lands the problems of
race and poverty that trouble
the continent are brought into
sharp focus by the close juxta
position of the very rich and
the very poor, the most refined
white institutions and the best
organized black men. The
wealthiest families of California
live in Atherton within two
miles of East Palo Alto that con
tains 600 homes on the welfare
roles.
Ordinarily neither community
knows or cares about what is
occurring in the other, but they
do share in the services of the

Sequoia Union High School Dis
trict which has a reputation sec
ond to none in educational cir
cles. Despite its high standards
the District is bitterly attacked
by outspoken and organized
forces of the black community
that insist the district is de
stroying black children in its
classrooms as fast as they enter
the doors.
Showcase
The wealth and high educa
tional level of the mid-peninsula
white community make it a
showcase for the American way
of life, but for that same reason
it is also the point where the
basic faults of the system are
manifest.
As the voice of the black com
munity has grown in strength
over the past montlis it has
spoken out on the inability of
this respectable, clean white
power structure to understand

and work with the black man.
The serious lack of communi
cation between the white insti
tutions such as the Sequoia Un
ion High School District of
southern San Mateo County and
the ghetto poor was never clear
er than on Sept. 18 when Menlo-
Atherton High School, a pre
dominantly white school located
three miles from Stanford in an
exclusive residential area was
the scene of an outbreak of
demonstrations accompanied by
racial violence.
Rebellion Against Status
The trouble centered around
the 15% of the students who
are black and live across the
Bayshore freeway in East Palo
Alto. They were demanding that
specific grievances be heard and
rectified, but their action was a
rebellion against the whole idea
of their secondary status in
white society.

Administrators understand stu
dents who are discontented and
who complain, but young people
that make demands and back
them up with demonstrations
were unheard of before the
black students organized at
Menlo-Atherton. Consequently
the administration relied on
overwhelming police force to
control the situation and one
sidedly sought to restore its au
thority without direct consulta
tion with the black students.
All this is not to say that the
problem is limited to misunder
standings. There is a reservoir
of racial animosity that is felt
in subtle ways until it rises to
the surface at times of crisis.
"White Power"
A recent testimony to this
was the appearance of groups
of "white power" advocates
among the children of the re
spectable establishment in the

neighborhood of Menlo-Ather
ton. Black students charge that
a group of these young people
carrying pipes, chains, and oth
er weapons entered the black
community of East Palo Alto on
Wednesday Sept. 20 looking for
opportunities to retaliate for the
disturbances at the high school.
The mid-peninsula situation
represents the best that the
moneyed, white technocracy has
produced to date and it has
failed to meet the demands of
the present as they are embod
ied in the Black Power revolu
tion. What is happening here
within 20 miles of Stanford will
repeat itself everywhere if
white America continues to slip
into the fanciful world of lush
suburbia while black America
organizes around its own decla
ration of independence.
(Two more articles by Louis
Knowles on the Menlo-Atherton
turmoil will appear next week.)
The isolation of the univer
sity community, whatever its
benefits in the past, is becoming
more ridiculous every day.
