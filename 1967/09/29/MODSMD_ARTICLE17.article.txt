# Looking Backward: Stanford 66-67
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
They called it a "Year of
Change," yet it was more. Dave
Harris was the new student
body president elected on the
promise to work for change.
But what should change? What
was bad and what was worse.
It was a year of change, but
perhaps more, a year of intro
spection.
Hans Kung talked about
Christianity, seniors protested
the War at graduation, someone
found an alligator in Lake Lag,
Dean Lyman became Provost
Lyman, and the Lymans scored
for the year with Peter (no re
lation, of course) winning a ma
jority of votes in the ASSU
Presidential primary.

RELIGION enrolled at Stan
ford. For the first time, sectari
an services were allowed on
campus. A new dean, who really
didn't seem like most other
deans, was running things Sun
day mornings. Sunday mornings
were never like that before. And
the Memorial Church was full—
of students! The enthusiasm for
religion that coincided with sec
tarian worship on campus and
the arrival of DEAN B. DAVIE
NAPIER was unparalleled.
DAVID HARRIS, 1966-67 stu
dent body president, had his
head shaved by members of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity large
ly because of anti-fraternity
stand. He resigned on February
22, 1967, because he felt he had
done all he could do for Stan
ford students in expousing his
views. His replacement couldn't
replace him.
RESIDENCES and Stanford's
concept of a RESIDENCE UNI
VERSITY came under attack,
redefinition, and renovation dur
ing 1967. The ASSU HOUSING
COMMISSION reported out with
recommendations for a massive
reshuffling of University hous
ing to allow frosh to be coedu
cated and integrated with up
perclassmen, provide education
ally-centered houses (such as
International, Creativity, etc.)
and asked for an investigation
of fraternity hell week, a possi
ble faculty review board, and a
draw system. At the same time,
the OFF movement to allow un
dergraduate women to live off
campus was underway with
senior Janet Howell and many
others voting (2448-265), delay
ing their University rent, and
writing trustees for the cause,
and finally 100 senior women
were given the option of living
off campus this year, although
only 75 took up the offer.
JACKS and MOORE Halls
which were planned for con
struction were delayed until the
Study of Education and others
could make recommendations
concerning residences at Stan
ford.
Students moved into a vacant
fraternity house for Winter and
Spring quarters. And it was
called GROVE, and Grove was
coeducation and integrated and
was an experiment in "residen
tial education." Experiments
seemed to have worked last
year.

The GRADUATE SCHOOL OF
BUSINESS opened for business
and the J. HENRY MEYER ME
MORIAL LIBRARY opened for
trouble last year. The Meyer Li
brary was the scene of paper air
planes, superballs, and fireworks
during dead week of Winter
Quarter and closed early several
evenings. Both buildings were
dedicated by Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare JOHN
W. GARDNER.
Grading and credit and units
were not part of another Uni
versity on campus. THE EX
PERIMENT, a free university—
experimental college, run by
students, for students. Under
the directorship of grad student
Barry Greenberg, it flourished
until it was left homeless when
the Placement Center was ready
to move in the building. It pro
duced its own newspaper, Resis
tance, and was involved in cam
pus political activity as well as
education. It is now part of
MIDPENINSULA FREE UNI
VERSITY.
Wendy and Warren WONKA
were dear to Stanford hearts
last year as Wendy won a Home
coming Queen contest, but was
disqualified, and then nearly won
a California COLLEGE QUEEN
Contest. She did make the semi
finals of the Best Foods College
Queen contest however.
Black GRADUATION robes,
black tassels, black mortar
boards. 3850 students graduated
from Stanford University, June
18. Hundreds of white armbands
Contest.
The PALO ALTO-STANFORD
HOSPITAL future looked dim.
With a Stanford desire for more
beds for teaching purposes, of

fers and proposals for building,
buying, and selling filled the air.
No final decision has been
reached on its status, but the
future sees a Palo Alto hospital
and a Stanford hospital.
The SUMMER FESTIVAL
was successful this time. (The
previous summer was a finan
cial disaster.) It featured the
American Conservatory Theater,
The Philadelphia Quartet and
other groups.
The Administration saw its
changes also. RICHARD W. LY
MAN was named University
Vice President and Provost. As
sociate Dean of Students JOEL
SMITH became Dean of Stu
dents, and H. DONALD WIN
BIGLER took on the post of
Academic Secretary. Another
Associate Dean, ROBERT GOR
DON became Vice President at
the University of Tennessee and
ROBERT WERT, professor of
education and former Dean of
Undergraduate Education, be
came president of Mills College,
Oakland.
It was a year of firsts for Stan
ford ATHLETICS. The football
squad became the first team in
the long BIG GAME history to
win six games in a row, defeat
ing the Cal Bears, 13-7. The
SHIM TEAM won its first na
tional championship, the first na
tional championship for any
Stanford sporting team in 15
years. The WRESTLING
SQUAD sent two men to the na
tionals for the first time, and
both won fourth places. The
BASEBALL TEAM also went
national and missed a national
title, but took third. And for the
first time in recent Big Game
history, the AXE trophy was
stolen from Tresidder Union
where it was displayed.
The WAR IN VIETNAM was
the gravest issue at stake for
some/students. Debate, draft
carcy turn-ins, civil disobedience,
white arm band Wednesdays all

marked an era of discontent
with the government's handling
of the South East Asian situa
tion.
Fraternities also were in the
news. BETA CHI abolished se
lective rush. SIGMA CHI went
local and became SIGMA CHI
OMEGA. Pin DELTA THETA
was suspended for a year for
» wild |>arty with Mills College
girls and for stealing 11,000
copies of The Daily. The DELTA
TAU DELTAS were put on pro
bation (about 40 of them) for
shaving the head of Dave Har
ris, student Ixxly president The
BETA house came down with ty
phoid that hospitalized many of
its members. KAPPA SIGMA
was suspended from their na
tional, but was recently rein
stated. And amidst this action
work began on the third frater
nity cluster near the Health Cen
ter on Campus Drive.
OVERSEAS CAMPUSES were
of concern to many students.
The floods in Florence seemed
to worry only the friends back
at Stanford In Stanford, as the
Villa students braved the tides
and helped with restoration.
Stanford In Austria moved to
Vienna after various problems
with the Semmering site.

PASS-FAIL grading l>egan on
an experimental basis. During
its first quarter, over 900 stu
dents took the option. ASSU also
passed a resolution urging the
adoption of a Pass-Fail Fresh
man year. By summer, pass
fail's "experimental" status was
dropped.
SUNNYVALE SAM, the alli
gator which spent Spring Quar
ter in Lake Lag, was rescued
from the rapidly drying out
lake on the 18th of June, by
Thomas Lugone, a thirty-year
old Redwood City shipping
clerk. Seminole Same (his Sun
nyvale nomenclature) was last
seen entering the Santa Clara
Zoo.
Trusty Stanford TRUSTEES
abolished CLASS RANKING
one day before the Congress
passed the draft bill which or
dered draft boards not to use
them for draft deferments.
Stanford's $114 million LIN
EAR ACCELERATOR was offi
cially dedicated in early Sep
tember. Atomic Energy Commis
sion Chairman Glen T. Seaborg
officiated. The accelerator is lo
cated on Sand Hill Road near
the San Andreas Fault.


PRESIDENT J. E. WAL
LACE STERLING an
nounced his retirement
March 24, 1967. He hopes
to be relieved of his duties
by Sept. 1, 1968.


HERBERT PACKER heads
the study of Education at
Stanford, now underway. It is
the most comprehensive review
of the education a student gets
here that has yet been attempt
ed. Encouraging work came
from SES last year and contin
ues.

squad became the first team in
the long BIG GAME history to

title, but took third. And for the
first time in recent Big Game
history, the AXE trophy was
stolen from Tresidder Union

The WAR IN VIETNAM was

HERBERT PACKER heads
the study of Education at
Stanford, now underway. It is
the most comprehensive review
of the education a student gets
here that has yet been attempt

from SES last year and contin

PETER LYMAN swept
the ASSU primaries to be
come the first graduate
student student body pres
ident since 1962, and the
winner in ASSU primaries
since 1956. Peter ran on a
ticket of educational re
form.
They called it a "Year of
Change," yet it was more. Dave
Harris was the new student
body president elected on the
promise to work for change.
But what should change? What
was bad and what was worse.
It was a year of change, but
perhaps more, a year of intro
spection.
Hans Kung talked about
Christianity, seniors protested
the War at graduation, someone
found an alligator in Lake Lag,
Dean Lyman became Provost
Lyman, and the Lymans scored
for the year with Peter (no re
lation, of course) winning a ma
jority of votes in the ASSU
Presidential primary.

RELIGION enrolled at Stan
ford. For the first time, sectari
an services were allowed on
campus. A new dean, who really
didn't seem like most other
deans, was running things Sun
day mornings. Sunday mornings
were never like that before. And
the Memorial Church was full—
of students! The enthusiasm for
religion that coincided with sec
tarian worship on campus and
the arrival of DEAN B. DAVIE
NAPIER was unparalleled.
DAVID HARRIS, 1966-67 stu
dent body president, had his
head shaved by members of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity large
ly because of anti-fraternity
stand. He resigned on February
22, 1967, because he felt he had
done all he could do for Stan
ford students in expousing his
views. His replacement couldn't
replace him.
RESIDENCES and Stanford's
concept of a RESIDENCE UNI
VERSITY came under attack,
redefinition, and renovation dur
ing 1967. The ASSU HOUSING
COMMISSION reported out with
recommendations for a massive
reshuffling of University hous
ing to allow frosh to be coedu
cated and integrated with up
perclassmen, provide education
ally-centered houses (such as
International, Creativity, etc.)
and asked for an investigation
of fraternity hell week, a possi
ble faculty review board, and a
draw system. At the same time,
the OFF movement to allow un
dergraduate women to live off
campus was underway with
senior Janet Howell and many
others voting (2448-265), delay
ing their University rent, and
writing trustees for the cause,
and finally 100 senior women
were given the option of living
off campus this year, although
only 75 took up the offer.
JACKS and MOORE Halls
which were planned for con
struction were delayed until the
Study of Education and others
could make recommendations
concerning residences at Stan
ford.
Students moved into a vacant
fraternity house for Winter and
Spring quarters. And it was
called GROVE, and Grove was
coeducation and integrated and
was an experiment in "residen
tial education." Experiments
seemed to have worked last
year.

The GRADUATE SCHOOL OF
BUSINESS opened for business
and the J. HENRY MEYER ME
MORIAL LIBRARY opened for
trouble last year. The Meyer Li
brary was the scene of paper air
planes, superballs, and fireworks
during dead week of Winter
Quarter and closed early several
evenings. Both buildings were
dedicated by Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare JOHN
W. GARDNER.
Grading and credit and units
were not part of another Uni
versity on campus. THE EX
PERIMENT, a free university—
experimental college, run by
students, for students. Under
the directorship of grad student
Barry Greenberg, it flourished
until it was left homeless when
the Placement Center was ready
to move in the building. It pro
duced its own newspaper, Resis
tance, and was involved in cam
pus political activity as well as
education. It is now part of
MIDPENINSULA FREE UNI
VERSITY.
Wendy and Warren WONKA
were dear to Stanford hearts
last year as Wendy won a Home
coming Queen contest, but was
disqualified, and then nearly won
a California COLLEGE QUEEN
Contest. She did make the semi
finals of the Best Foods College
Queen contest however.
Black GRADUATION robes,

Hans Kung talked about

Dean Lyman became Provost

RELIGION enrolled at Stan
ford. For the first time, sectari

campus. A new dean, who really
didn't seem like most other
deans, was running things Sun

were never like that before. And
the Memorial Church was full—
of students! The enthusiasm for
religion that coincided with sec

the arrival of DEAN B. DAVIE
NAPIER was unparalleled.
DAVID HARRIS, 1966-67 stu
dent body president, had his
head shaved by members of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity large
ly because of anti-fraternity
stand. He resigned on February
22, 1967, because he felt he had
done all he could do for Stan
ford students in expousing his
views. His replacement couldn't
replace him.
RESIDENCES and Stanford's
concept of a RESIDENCE UNI
VERSITY came under attack,
redefinition, and renovation dur
ing 1967. The ASSU HOUSING
COMMISSION reported out with
recommendations for a massive
reshuffling of University hous
ing to allow frosh to be coedu
cated and integrated with up
perclassmen, provide education
ally-centered houses (such as
International, Creativity, etc.)
and asked for an investigation
of fraternity hell week, a possi
ble faculty review board, and a
draw system. At the same time,
the OFF movement to allow un
dergraduate women to live off
campus was underway with
senior Janet Howell and many
others voting (2448-265), delay
ing their University rent, and
writing trustees for the cause,
and finally 100 senior women
were given the option of living
off campus this year, although
only 75 took up the offer.
JACKS and MOORE Halls
which were planned for con
struction were delayed until the
Study of Education and others
could make recommendations
concerning residences at Stan
ford.
Students moved into a vacant
fraternity house for Winter and
Spring quarters. And it was
called GROVE, and Grove was
coeducation and integrated and
was an experiment in "residen
tial education." Experiments
seemed to have worked last
year.

The GRADUATE SCHOOL OF
BUSINESS opened for business
and the J. HENRY MEYER ME
MORIAL LIBRARY opened for
trouble last year. The Meyer Li
brary was the scene of paper air
planes, superballs, and fireworks
during dead week of Winter
Quarter and closed early several
evenings. Both buildings were
dedicated by Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare JOHN
W. GARDNER.
Grading and credit and units

The SUMMER FESTIVAL

The Administration saw its
changes also. RICHARD W. LY

It was a year of firsts for Stan

squad became the first team in
the long BIG GAME history to
win six games in a row, defeat

SHIM TEAM won its first na

tional championship for any
Stanford sporting team in 15
years. The WRESTLING
SQUAD sent two men to the na

both won fourth places. The
BASEBALL TEAM also went
national and missed a national
title, but took third. And for the
first time in recent Big Game
history, the AXE trophy was
stolen from Tresidder Union
where it was displayed.
The WAR IN VIETNAM was
the gravest issue at stake for
some/students. Debate, draft
carcy turn-ins, civil disobedience,
white arm band Wednesdays all

marked an era of discontent
with the government's handling
of the South East Asian situa

Fraternities also were in the
news. BETA CHI abolished se

local and became SIGMA CHI
OMEGA. Pin DELTA THETA
was suspended for a year for

BETA house came down with ty

its members. KAPPA SIGMA
was suspended from their na

work began on the third frater

OVERSEAS CAMPUSES were
of concern to many students.

HERBERT PACKER heads
the study of Education at
Stanford, now underway. It is
the most comprehensive review
of the education a student gets
here that has yet been attempt

from SES last year and contin

PETER LYMAN swept
the ASSU primaries to be
come the first graduate
student student body pres
ident since 1962, and the
winner in ASSU primaries
since 1956. Peter ran on a
ticket of educational re
form.
They called it a "Year of
Change," yet it was more. Dave
Harris was the new student
body president elected on the
promise to work for change.
But what should change? What
was bad and what was worse.
It was a year of change, but
perhaps more, a year of intro
spection.
Hans Kung talked about
Christianity, seniors protested
the War at graduation, someone
found an alligator in Lake Lag,
Dean Lyman became Provost
Lyman, and the Lymans scored
for the year with Peter (no re
lation, of course) winning a ma
jority of votes in the ASSU
Presidential primary.

RELIGION enrolled at Stan
ford. For the first time, sectari
an services were allowed on
campus. A new dean, who really
didn't seem like most other
deans, was running things Sun
day mornings. Sunday mornings
were never like that before. And
the Memorial Church was full—
of students! The enthusiasm for
religion that coincided with sec
tarian worship on campus and
the arrival of DEAN B. DAVIE
NAPIER was unparalleled.
DAVID HARRIS, 1966-67 stu
dent body president, had his
head shaved by members of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity large
ly because of anti-fraternity
stand. He resigned on February
22, 1967, because he felt he had
done all he could do for Stan
ford students in expousing his
views. His replacement couldn't
replace him.
RESIDENCES and Stanford's
concept of a RESIDENCE UNI
VERSITY came under attack,
redefinition, and renovation dur
ing 1967. The ASSU HOUSING
COMMISSION reported out with
recommendations for a massive
reshuffling of University hous
ing to allow frosh to be coedu
cated and integrated with up
perclassmen, provide education
ally-centered houses (such as
International, Creativity, etc.)
and asked for an investigation
of fraternity hell week, a possi
ble faculty review board, and a
draw system. At the same time,
the OFF movement to allow un
dergraduate women to live off
campus was underway with
senior Janet Howell and many
others voting (2448-265), delay
ing their University rent, and
writing trustees for the cause,
and finally 100 senior women
were given the option of living
off campus this year, although
only 75 took up the offer.
JACKS and MOORE Halls
which were planned for con
struction were delayed until the
Study of Education and others
could make recommendations
concerning residences at Stan
ford.
Students moved into a vacant
fraternity house for Winter and
Spring quarters. And it was
called GROVE, and Grove was
coeducation and integrated and
was an experiment in "residen
tial education." Experiments
seemed to have worked last
year.

The GRADUATE SCHOOL OF
BUSINESS opened for business
and the J. HENRY MEYER ME
MORIAL LIBRARY opened for
trouble last year. The Meyer Li
brary was the scene of paper air
planes, superballs, and fireworks
during dead week of Winter
Quarter and closed early several
evenings. Both buildings were
dedicated by Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare JOHN
W. GARDNER.
Grading and credit and units
were not part of another Uni
versity on campus. THE EX
PERIMENT, a free university—
experimental college, run by
students, for students. Under
the directorship of grad student
Barry Greenberg, it flourished
until it was left homeless when
the Placement Center was ready
to move in the building. It pro
duced its own newspaper, Resis
tance, and was involved in cam
pus political activity as well as
education. It is now part of
MIDPENINSULA FREE UNI
VERSITY.
Wendy and Warren WONKA
were dear to Stanford hearts
last year as Wendy won a Home
coming Queen contest, but was
disqualified, and then nearly won
a California COLLEGE QUEEN
Contest. She did make the semi
finals of the Best Foods College
Queen contest however.
Black GRADUATION robes,
