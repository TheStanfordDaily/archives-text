# TAs Attack, Defend Proposed Grad Union
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Immediate reaction to a plan
ned union for collective bargain
ing by graduate students and
junior faculty members has var
ied from department to depart
ment.
Inequalities in salary were the
main concern in some humani
ties and social science depart
ments, while the present lack of
an effective political voice was
most important in others.
Graduate students from sev

eral departments expressed dis
may over the "machine-like"
process involved in getting a de
gree.
Several, on the other hand,
defended present policies and
standards, terming them "satis
factory" and "fair."
Over 60 students and faculty
members have already joined
the union movement. Many of
those interviewed said that they
were planning to investigate the
situation further before deciding
to join or not.
Large Discrepancy
John Ferejohn, a graduate in
the Political Science Depart
ment, explained the inequalities
in his department: "If you're an
RA (Resident Assistant), you
can earn anywhere from $1,600
and tuition for 9 units for one
year up to about $3,500, or three
times the lowest. TAs (Teaching
Assistants) earn typically $2,100
to $2,000 with 9-10 units tuition.
TA's salaries are pretty well
fixed.
"There is actually no differ
ence between the two," he
added. "It just has to do with
how much they want to pay
you. It's pretty much up to the
senior faculty member and it
really doesn't have anything to
do with skill or what you're do
ing. It has to do with how much
your senior faculty member in
charge with the project wants
to pay you."
The same type of problem is
found in the Economics Depart
ment. According to graduate
student Jonathan Pincus, "The
main problem is the distinction
between TAs and RAs. There
are people being paid the same
rate for different amounts of
work. TAs in general do only
a little work each week.
"On the other hand, RAs can

be given up to 17 hours of work
a week. All TAs and RAs here
get the same, pay. The only
thing is that the RAs can be
made to work very hard.'
A Freshman English TA, Ar
turo Islas, feels that TAs are
underpaid. "It seems to me that
TAs don't get enough money
for all the work they have to do.

program: (1) that the student
seriously wants to go to college
and (2) that the student will
work as hard as he can to qual
ify for college.
Program supervisors com
mented that some tutoring tech
niques have failed because they
were designed for ideal situa
tions rather than for the stu
dents' personalities. They be
lieve that drilling is a necessity,
but warn against using it exclu
sively. Games involving compe
tition and rewards have proven
effective; homework assign
ments have not. Self-motivated
students do not need them, un
motivated students ignore them.
One area of criticism has been
the insistence on bringing the
students to the Stanford campus
rather than working with them
in their environment, as the
Stanford Area Tutorial does.
While declining to make an
overall evaluation of the pro
gram, one supervisor notes that,

as of 1964, roughly 20 Negro
students had left Ravenswood
directly for a four-year college,
while as of this past spring over
100 had entered such colleges
with scholarships. As of last
March, all were still in atten
dance and doing well. Increasing
numbers of students in the me
dium achievement bracket of the
Go Go program are planning to
attend four-year colleges away
from home.
Cliff Jenkins, a tutor coordina
tor, however, attributes this less
to Go Go than to the new aware
ness and new, constructive lead
ers in the Negro community.
"We cannot apply a white man's
sense of values to the problems
of the Negro community," he
remarked.
Eating Clubs Involved
This is the first year that Stan
ford's eating clubs have been in
volved in the project. ICC presi
dent Gary Blank has announced
a meeting for all who may be
interested in tutoring this Satur

day morning at 10:30 in the To
yon Hall lounge. Two hours a
week will be required of each
tutor.
Another program, also primar
ily at Ravenswood, deals with
children at the other end of
the potential scale. The Stanford
Area Tutorial program, headed
by Vonda Crouse, not only pro
vides remedial work for students
on a one pupil - one tutor basis,
but also seeks to effect a more
positive attitude in the pupil
toward his school and himself.
Founded in 1963 by Mrs.
Louise Pierce, the Tutorial oper
ates under the auspices of the
Graduate School of Education
and the U.S. National Student
Association with the financial
support of the ASSU.
Today about 200 Stanford stu
dents are serving as tutors. An
integral part of their work in
volves extracurricular outings,
both cultural and social, which
are geared to the students' inter
ests.
One problem which the pro
gram has faced is that of mea
suring the tutor's effectiveness.
To this end, a tutorial appraisal
system will be set up as well as
group discussions concerning
teaching techniques.
Training Session
A tutorial training session for
this program will take place on
Tuesday, October 3, at 8:15 p.m.
in Room 275 at TMU.
Project Help deals with junior
high students. About 40 volun
teers are expected to be working
at Crittendon Junior High in
Mountain View this fall, accor
ding to Rene Remund, who heads
the project.
The program began last year
when several Young Republi
cans in Serra House participated
in a tutoring project run by Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Freelen, faculty
residents.
Now run by the Young Re
publicans in conjunction with
the school board, the program
deals with the academic and
athletic aspects of education. At
times a tutor may take over the
class when he has special knowl
edge to contribute.
This project serves fast learn
ers as well as slow ones during
school hours, but every effort is
made to visit the homes of each
tutee so as to gain an apprecia
tion of his particular situation.
Tutoring is about to begin and
applications are being reviewed
by the school board and the YR's.
Tutors need not be Young Re
publicans. An organizational
meeting will be announced short
ly.

Eating Clubs Involved
This is the first year that Stan
ford's eating clubs have been in
volved in the project. ICC presi
dent Gary Blank has announced
a meeting for all who may be
interested in tutoring this Satur

day morning at 10:30 in the To
yon Hall lounge. Two hours a
week will be required of each
tutor.
Another program, also primar
ily at Ravenswood, deals with
children at the other end of
the potential scale. The Stanford
Area Tutorial program, headed
by Vonda Crouse, not only pro
vides remedial work for students
on a one pupil - one tutor basis,
but also seeks to effect a more
positive attitude in the pupil
toward his school and himself.
Founded in 1963 by Mrs.
Louise Pierce, the Tutorial oper
ates under the auspices of the
Graduate School of Education
and the U.S. National Student
Association with the financial
support of the ASSU.
Today about 200 Stanford stu
dents are serving as tutors. An
integral part of their work in
volves extracurricular outings,
both cultural and social, which
are geared to the students' inter
ests.
One problem which the pro
gram has faced is that of mea
suring the tutor's effectiveness.
To this end, a tutorial appraisal
system will be set up as well as
group discussions concerning
teaching techniques.
Training Session
A tutorial training session for
this program will take place on
Tuesday, October 3, at 8:15 p.m.
in Room 275 at TMU.
Project Help deals with junior
high students. About 40 volun
teers are expected to be working
at Crittendon Junior High in
Mountain View this fall, accor
ding to Rene Remund, who heads
the project.
The program began last year
when several Young Republi
cans in Serra House participated
in a tutoring project run by Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Freelen, faculty
residents.
Now run by the Young Re
publicans in conjunction with
the school board, the program
deals with the academic and
athletic aspects of education. At
times a tutor may take over the
class when he has special knowl
edge to contribute.
This project serves fast learn
ers as well as slow ones during
school hours, but every effort is
made to visit the homes of each
tutee so as to gain an apprecia
tion of his particular situation.
Tutoring is about to begin and
applications are being reviewed
by the school board and the YR's.
Tutors need not be Young Re
publicans. An organizational
meeting will be announced short
ly.
Immediate reaction to a plan
ned union for collective bargain
ing by graduate students and
junior faculty members has var
ied from department to depart
ment.
Inequalities in salary were the
main concern in some humani
ties and social science depart
ments, while the present lack of
an effective political voice was
most important in others.
Graduate students from sev

eral departments expressed dis
may over the "machine-like"
process involved in getting a de
gree.
Several, on the other hand,
defended present policies and
standards, terming them "satis
factory" and "fair."
Over 60 students and faculty
members have already joined
the union movement. Many of
those interviewed said that they
were planning to investigate the
situation further before deciding
to join or not.
Large Discrepancy
John Ferejohn, a graduate in
the Political Science Depart
ment, explained the inequalities
in his department: "If you're an
RA (Resident Assistant), you
can earn anywhere from $1,600
and tuition for 9 units for one
year up to about $3,500, or three
times the lowest. TAs (Teaching
Assistants) earn typically $2,100
to $2,000 with 9-10 units tuition.
TA's salaries are pretty well
fixed.
"There is actually no differ
ence between the two," he
added. "It just has to do with
how much they want to pay
you. It's pretty much up to the
senior faculty member and it
really doesn't have anything to
do with skill or what you're do
ing. It has to do with how much
your senior faculty member in
charge with the project wants
to pay you."
The same type of problem is
found in the Economics Depart
ment. According to graduate
student Jonathan Pincus, "The
main problem is the distinction
between TAs and RAs. There
are people being paid the same
rate for different amounts of
work. TAs in general do only
a little work each week.
"On the other hand, RAs can

be given up to 17 hours of work
a week. All TAs and RAs here
get the same, pay. The only
thing is that the RAs can be
made to work very hard.'
A Freshman English TA, Ar
turo Islas, feels that TAs are
underpaid. "It seems to me that
TAs don't get enough money
for all the work they have to do.

program: (1) that the student
seriously wants to go to college
and (2) that the student will
work as hard as he can to qual
ify for college.
Program supervisors com
mented that some tutoring tech
niques have failed because they
were designed for ideal situa
tions rather than for the stu
dents' personalities. They be
lieve that drilling is a necessity,
but warn against using it exclu
sively. Games involving compe
tition and rewards have proven
effective; homework assign
ments have not. Self-motivated
students do not need them, un
motivated students ignore them.
One area of criticism has been
the insistence on bringing the
students to the Stanford campus
rather than working with them
in their environment, as the
Stanford Area Tutorial does.
While declining to make an
overall evaluation of the pro
gram, one supervisor notes that,

as of 1964, roughly 20 Negro
students had left Ravenswood
directly for a four-year college,
while as of this past spring over
100 had entered such colleges
with scholarships. As of last
March, all were still in atten
dance and doing well. Increasing
numbers of students in the me
dium achievement bracket of the
Go Go program are planning to
attend four-year colleges away
from home.
Cliff Jenkins, a tutor coordina
tor, however, attributes this less
to Go Go than to the new aware
ness and new, constructive lead
ers in the Negro community.
"We cannot apply a white man's
sense of values to the problems
of the Negro community," he
remarked.

your senior faculty member in
charge with the project wants
to pay you."
The same type of problem is
found in the Economics Depart
ment. According to graduate
student Jonathan Pincus, "The
main problem is the distinction
between TAs and RAs. There
are people being paid the same
rate for different amounts of
work. TAs in general do only
a little work each week.
"On the other hand, RAs can

be given up to 17 hours of work
a week. All TAs and RAs here
get the same, pay. The only
thing is that the RAs can be
made to work very hard.'
A Freshman English TA, Ar
turo Islas, feels that TAs are
underpaid. "It seems to me that
TAs don't get enough money
for all the work they have to do.

program: (1) that the student
seriously wants to go to college
and (2) that the student will
work as hard as he can to qual
ify for college.
Program supervisors com
mented that some tutoring tech
niques have failed because they
were designed for ideal situa
tions rather than for the stu
dents' personalities. They be
lieve that drilling is a necessity,
but warn against using it exclu
sively. Games involving compe
tition and rewards have proven
effective; homework assign
ments have not. Self-motivated
students do not need them, un
motivated students ignore them.
One area of criticism has been
the insistence on bringing the
students to the Stanford campus
rather than working with them
in their environment, as the
Stanford Area Tutorial does.
While declining to make an
overall evaluation of the pro
gram, one supervisor notes that,

as of 1964, roughly 20 Negro
students had left Ravenswood
directly for a four-year college,
while as of this past spring over
100 had entered such colleges
with scholarships. As of last
March, all were still in atten
dance and doing well. Increasing
numbers of students in the me
dium achievement bracket of the
Go Go program are planning to
attend four-year colleges away
from home.
Cliff Jenkins, a tutor coordina
tor, however, attributes this less
to Go Go than to the new aware
ness and new, constructive lead
ers in the Negro community.
"We cannot apply a white man's
sense of values to the problems
of the Negro community," he
remarked.
Eating Clubs Involved
This is the first year that Stan
ford's eating clubs have been in
volved in the project. ICC presi
dent Gary Blank has announced
a meeting for all who may be
interested in tutoring this Satur

day morning at 10:30 in the To
yon Hall lounge. Two hours a
week will be required of each
tutor.
Another program, also primar
ily at Ravenswood, deals with
children at the other end of
the potential scale. The Stanford
Area Tutorial program, headed
by Vonda Crouse, not only pro
vides remedial work for students
on a one pupil - one tutor basis,
but also seeks to effect a more
positive attitude in the pupil
toward his school and himself.
Founded in 1963 by Mrs.
Louise Pierce, the Tutorial oper
ates under the auspices of the
Graduate School of Education
and the U.S. National Student
Association with the financial
support of the ASSU.
Today about 200 Stanford stu
dents are serving as tutors. An
integral part of their work in
volves extracurricular outings,
both cultural and social, which
are geared to the students' inter
ests.
One problem which the pro
gram has faced is that of mea
suring the tutor's effectiveness.
To this end, a tutorial appraisal
system will be set up as well as
group discussions concerning
teaching techniques.
Training Session
A tutorial training session for
this program will take place on
Tuesday, October 3, at 8:15 p.m.
in Room 275 at TMU.
Project Help deals with junior
high students. About 40 volun
teers are expected to be working
at Crittendon Junior High in
Mountain View this fall, accor
ding to Rene Remund, who heads
the project.
The program began last year
when several Young Republi
cans in Serra House participated
in a tutoring project run by Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Freelen, faculty
residents.
Now run by the Young Re
publicans in conjunction with
the school board, the program
deals with the academic and
athletic aspects of education. At
times a tutor may take over the
class when he has special knowl
edge to contribute.
This project serves fast learn
ers as well as slow ones during
school hours, but every effort is
made to visit the homes of each
tutee so as to gain an apprecia
tion of his particular situation.
Tutoring is about to begin and
applications are being reviewed
by the school board and the YR's.
Tutors need not be Young Re
publicans. An organizational
meeting will be announced short
ly.
Immediate reaction to a plan
ned union for collective bargain
ing by graduate students and
junior faculty members has var
ied from department to depart
ment.
Inequalities in salary were the
main concern in some humani
ties and social science depart
ments, while the present lack of
an effective political voice was
most important in others.
Graduate students from sev

eral departments expressed dis
may over the "machine-like"
process involved in getting a de
gree.
Several, on the other hand,
defended present policies and
standards, terming them "satis
factory" and "fair."
Over 60 students and faculty
members have already joined
the union movement. Many of
those interviewed said that they
were planning to investigate the
situation further before deciding
to join or not.
Large Discrepancy
John Ferejohn, a graduate in
the Political Science Depart
ment, explained the inequalities
in his department: "If you're an
RA (Resident Assistant), you
can earn anywhere from $1,600
and tuition for 9 units for one
year up to about $3,500, or three
times the lowest. TAs (Teaching
Assistants) earn typically $2,100
to $2,000 with 9-10 units tuition.
TA's salaries are pretty well
fixed.
"There is actually no differ
ence between the two," he
added. "It just has to do with
how much they want to pay
you. It's pretty much up to the
senior faculty member and it
really doesn't have anything to
do with skill or what you're do
ing. It has to do with how much
your senior faculty member in

teers are expected to be working
at Crittendon Junior High in
Mountain View this fall, accor
ding to Rene Remund, who heads
the project.
The program began last year
when several Young Republi
cans in Serra House participated
in a tutoring project run by Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Freelen, faculty
residents.
Now run by the Young Re
publicans in conjunction with
the school board, the program
deals with the academic and
athletic aspects of education. At
times a tutor may take over the
class when he has special knowl
edge to contribute.
This project serves fast learn
ers as well as slow ones during
school hours, but every effort is
made to visit the homes of each
tutee so as to gain an apprecia
tion of his particular situation.
Tutoring is about to begin and
applications are being reviewed
by the school board and the YR's.
Tutors need not be Young Re
publicans. An organizational
meeting will be announced short
ly.
