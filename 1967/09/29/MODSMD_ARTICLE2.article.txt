# TAs Attack, Defend Proposed Grad Union
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Immediate reaction to a plan
ned union for collective bargain
ing by graduate students and
junior faculty members has var
ied from department to depart
ment.
Inequalities in salary were the
main concern in some humani
ties and social science depart
ments, while the present lack of
an effective political voice was
most important in others.
Graduate students from sev

eral departments expressed dis
may over the "machine-like"
process involved in getting a de
gree.
Several, on the other hand,
defended present policies and
standards, terming them "satis
factory" and "fair."
Over 60 students and faculty
members have already joined
the union movement. Many of
those interviewed said that they
were planning to investigate the
situation further before deciding
to join or not.
Large Discrepancy
John Ferejohn, a graduate in
the Political Science Depart
ment, explained the inequalities
in his department: "If you're an
RA (Resident Assistant), you
can earn anywhere from $1,600
and tuition for 9 units for one
year up to about $3,500, or three
times the lowest. TAs (Teaching
Assistants) earn typically $2,100
to $2,000 with 9-10 units tuition.
TA's salaries are pretty well
fixed.
"There is actually no differ
ence between the two," he
added. "It just has to do with
how much they want to pay
you. It's pretty much up to the
senior faculty member and it
really doesn't have anything to
do with skill or what you're do
ing. It has to do with how much
your senior faculty member in
charge with the project wants
to pay you."
The same type of problem is
found in the Economics Depart
ment. According to graduate
student Jonathan Pincus, "The
main problem is the distinction
between TAs and RAs. There
are people being paid the same
rate for different amounts of
work. TAs in general do only
a little work each week.
"On the other hand, RAs can

be given up to 17 hours of work
a week. All TAs and RAs here
get the same, pay. The only
thing is that the RAs can be
made to work very hard.'
A Freshman English TA, Ar
turo Islas, feels that TAs are
underpaid. "It seems to me that
TAs don't get enough money
for all the work they have to do.
They spend three hours in class
