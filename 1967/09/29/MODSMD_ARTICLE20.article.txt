# Resistance Plans Anti-Draft Week
## 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
Peace groups in the Bay Area
and elsewhere in the country
are preparing for a week-long
series of anti-war and anti-draft
activities beginning Monday,
October 16.
Resistance, an organization
which sprung up locally last
February, hopes that close to
one thousand young men will
return their draft cards on Oc
tober 16. Other groups such as
the Civil Action Day Committee
and the Student Non-violent Co
ordinating Committee are pro
moting a national "Stop The
Draft" week, planning sit-ins
at army induction centers and
the Pentagon.
All of these groups are nat
urally opposed to the Vietnam
war and most of these groups
oppose the selective service sys
tem because they feel it sustains
American militarism. Without a
system of compulsory military
service, they argue, the United
States would be incapable of
fighting aggressive foreign
,vars.
Beyond disagreement with the
war and beyond disenchantment
with the draft, many protesters
see their resistance to the war
and the draft as an affirmation
of a different way of life.

David Harris, former Stanford
student body President, writes
that "as long as American
Youth consent to be owned and
directed by American militarism,
America will wage war," and
that "it is in the hands of the
young people to say 'no more
war' to the American nation."
In order to say "no," the Re
sistance movement suggests
that young men of military age
turn in their draft cards, re
gardless of classification. Resis
tance argues that acceptance of
deferments is cooperation with
the selective service system, and
thus an affirmation of that sys
tem.
The act of returning a draft
card or of hindering the induc
tion process of draftees through
sit-ins is an act of civil disobedi
ence calculated to show the gov
ernment and the American peo
ple, especially the young men
of draft age, that resistance in
the form of non-cooperation is
growing.
Dennis Sweeney, a former
Stanford student active in Re
sistance, writes that "the price
America exacts for refusing to
cooperate is a maximum of five
years in federal prison. But the
price America exacts this in
stant in Vietnam from an unco

operative peasant is life itself.
My sacrifice is very small in
comparison."
Resistance organizers will hold
a press conference at Howard
Presbyterian church in San
Francisco at 10:00 on the morn
ing of October 16. At 1:00 that
afternoon, the group will turn
in their draft cards to some gov
ernment official at the Federal
Building on Golden Gate avenue.
In Oakland supporters of the
Civil Action Day Committee
will begin non-violent demon
strations on the 16th and will
attempt to "close-down" the
army induction center there.
Members of the Stanford anti
draft union are participating in
this action.
Three Sit-ins Organized
Since last June, the Civil Ac
tion Day Committee has orga
nized three sit-ins at the Oak
land Induction center resulting
in 39 arrests. Former Stanford
student Jeff Shurtleff estimates
that a much larger number of
people will be arrested on the
16th. A rally is planned for the
evening of the 16th in Oakland's
De Fremery park at 8:00 in the
evening.
According to Harris, the gov
ernment has been reluctant to
prosecute young men who re
fuse to comply with the draft

system. Harris himself has re
turned several deferments, and
the government still has not be
gun proceedings to imprison him
for violation of the Selective
Service Act. Chris Jones, a high
school student, decided not to
register upon reaching 18, but
the federal attorney's office reg
istered Jones with Selective Ser
vice against his will.
Whatever happens to Jones,
he typifies in several ways the

new attitude of some war pro
testors. He writes that "each
day we are aware of what is
happening and are concerned
and shocked but procrastinate
in making our cries at these
horrors heard; more innocent
people die or are tortured and
the snowballing power of de
struction grows. Join me (in re
sistance) if you can ... It is by
far the finest thing we can do
with our lives."

war' to the American nation."
In order to say "no," the Re
sistance movement suggests
that young men of military age
turn in their draft cards, re
gardless of classification. Resis
tance argues that acceptance of
deferments is cooperation with
the selective service system, and
thus an affirmation of that sys
tem.
The act of returning a draft
card or of hindering the induc
tion process of draftees through
sit-ins is an act of civil disobedi
ence calculated to show the gov
ernment and the American peo
ple, especially the young men
of draft age, that resistance in
the form of non-cooperation is
growing.
Dennis Sweeney, a former
Stanford student active in Re
sistance, writes that "the price
America exacts for refusing to
cooperate is a maximum of five
years in federal prison. But the
price America exacts this in
stant in Vietnam from an unco

operative peasant is life itself.
My sacrifice is very small in
comparison."
Resistance organizers will hold
a press conference at Howard
Presbyterian church in San
Francisco at 10:00 on the morn
ing of October 16. At 1:00 that
afternoon, the group will turn
in their draft cards to some gov
ernment official at the Federal
Building on Golden Gate avenue.
In Oakland supporters of the
Civil Action Day Committee
will begin non-violent demon
strations on the 16th and will
attempt to "close-down" the
army induction center there.
Members of the Stanford anti
draft union are participating in
this action.
Three Sit-ins Organized
Since last June, the Civil Ac
tion Day Committee has orga
nized three sit-ins at the Oak
land Induction center resulting
in 39 arrests. Former Stanford
student Jeff Shurtleff estimates
that a much larger number of
people will be arrested on the
16th. A rally is planned for the
evening of the 16th in Oakland's
De Fremery park at 8:00 in the
evening.
According to Harris, the gov
ernment has been reluctant to
prosecute young men who re
fuse to comply with the draft

system. Harris himself has re
turned several deferments, and
the government still has not be
gun proceedings to imprison him
for violation of the Selective
Service Act. Chris Jones, a high
school student, decided not to
register upon reaching 18, but
the federal attorney's office reg
istered Jones with Selective Ser
vice against his will.
Whatever happens to Jones,
he typifies in several ways the

new attitude of some war pro
testors. He writes that "each
day we are aware of what is
happening and are concerned
and shocked but procrastinate
in making our cries at these
horrors heard; more innocent
people die or are tortured and
the snowballing power of de
struction grows. Join me (in re
sistance) if you can ... It is by
far the finest thing we can do
with our lives."
Peace groups in the Bay Area
and elsewhere in the country
are preparing for a week-long
series of anti-war and anti-draft
activities beginning Monday,
October 16.
Resistance, an organization
which sprung up locally last
February, hopes that close to
one thousand young men will
return their draft cards on Oc
tober 16. Other groups such as
the Civil Action Day Committee
and the Student Non-violent Co
ordinating Committee are pro
moting a national "Stop The
Draft" week, planning sit-ins
at army induction centers and
the Pentagon.
All of these groups are nat
urally opposed to the Vietnam
war and most of these groups
oppose the selective service sys
tem because they feel it sustains
American militarism. Without a
system of compulsory military
service, they argue, the United
States would be incapable of
fighting aggressive foreign
,vars.
Beyond disagreement with the
war and beyond disenchantment
with the draft, many protesters
see their resistance to the war
and the draft as an affirmation
of a different way of life.

David Harris, former Stanford
student body President, writes
that "as long as American
Youth consent to be owned and
directed by American militarism,
America will wage war," and
that "it is in the hands of the
young people to say 'no more
war' to the American nation."
