# Freshman Drama Group Will Begin Second Year
## 
### 
Freshman dramatists have the
opportunity of furthering their
theatrical interests by attending
the first meeting of the Fresh
man Drama Group Sunday eve
ning at 8:00 in Room 270 of
Tresidder Memorial Union.
The organization is starting its
second year of providing fresh
men an outlet for their various
degrees of dramatic skills.
During the autumn quarter,
Larry Friedlander, Assistant
Professor of English, will direct
the group, but it will become
autonomous during the second
quarter. This unique structure
allows freshmen to act in, direct,
and choose all their productions.
This quarter's plans include a
Christmas spectacle with light
shows in Memorial Church, rock
bands, dancing, and singing cen
tering around mystery plays
chosen from the York, Wake
field, and Chester cycles. Be
cause of this wide variety of
presentations, freshmen interest
ed in music, dance, and creative
technical work are also urged
to attend the Sunday meeting.
Members of last year's group,
which presented nine successful
plays, will be on hand Sunday
to show pictures of their produc
tions and to help organize the
new group. These past members
hope to contribute a play to the
Christmas pageant but express

their desire to remain separate
from the new group, giving it a
chance to develop and to create
independently of outside forces.
