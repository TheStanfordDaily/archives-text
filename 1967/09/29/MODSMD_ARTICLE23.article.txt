# KLH launches an inquiry into "Subjective Value."
## (SURVEY) Question #1 How much would you pay to keep your wife one more year? 
### 
DO YOU REMEMBER the game kids used
to play in school where you were asked how
much money it would take to get you to sell
your country's secrets? (Assuming no tor
ture.) Or your dog?
It was a way of thinking about the value
you really placed on a thing.
One of the first things you learned was that
"features" had very little to do with it. (For
example, if your country had had 20 more
rivers, or your dog's tail wagged at 86 Per
Minute—six less than an "average" dog's—
the answer would hardly have changed.)
When KLH began making stereo equip
ment ten years ago, our founders (K., L., and
H.) noticed that grownup manufacturers
talked as though features had everything to
do with value. We hated that. We still do.
"Feature": Injecting 380 horsepower into
cars that have no plausible market save those
who commute back and forth over the Bonne
ville Salt Flats.
Or Again: Advertising 300 watts of power
in a high priced stereo console unit to give it
the appearance of value. (Neglecting to men
tion that large numbers of watts have nothing
to do with hearing the music accurately, or
even loudly, both of which depend on what
kind of equipment you've squeezed the watts
into. 35 watts in good equipment will do far
better.)
42-22-36
To define worth solely in terms of features
is like determining the "market value" of a
wife from her height, age, weight, width of
smile, tendency to suntan evenly, and the
number of pounds of food she is capable of
cooking up in an evening.
It's true enough we all like to have some
thing explicit to help our thinking. Even
Consumer Reports will sometimes find itself
detailing competitive features and statistics;
akin to Playboy's 42-22-36 ratings.
But studying the centerfold and accom
panying data simply doesn't give us all the
information we really need. What does? Well,
probably nothing short of a few years in the
same house together.

Packard had it right, way back in the twen
ties, when its advertising rested on the confi
dent slogan "Ask The Man Who Owns One."
(It was a new kind of "testimonial" but it's
been watered down since. How is a man today
to depend on testimonials to choose, say, his
cigarette brand when dozens of equally

beloved baseball players can't get together
about which is best?)
Still, the principle of determining value
through testimonials makes very good sense:
Economists, for instance, say value can be
understood as "some measure of the sense of
loss one experiences after being deprived of
a commodity or service," or, ask the man who
owns one how much he'd dislike losing it.
(The boy contemplating his dog's worth fig
ured it out the same way.)
Any other way of measuring value, like
establishing a ratio between features and
price, is at best only a guess, made before any
one could possibly know.
DEPRIVED OF YOUR WIFE
What we propose, then, is a technique of mea
suring the sense of loss as a way of thinking
about "Subjective Value"; i.e., what a com
modity means to someone who has it.
So. Assume for a moment that you are

about to be deprived of your wife. (Substitute
husband or "good friend" where applicable.)
How much would you pay in dollars to keep
her one more year? When you're through
thinking about that one, fill in No. 1 and have
a look at the rest of the questionnaire.
You see what we're up to here.
We began on this idea because we already
have evidence (based upon a comparison of
the number of hours owners sit listening to
KLH phonographs as opposed to other
brands) that our $300 stereo system is cher
ished somewhat more than at least one $400
system we could name; and perhaps twice as
much as another $300 set.
Doubtless the same situation exists among
magazines—some are surely valued more than
others—or sewing machines, or autos, or
toothpaste. Toothpaste? Well, we'll soon see,
and if you're interested we will be pleased to
let you know what we learn.
