# San Jose's 'Big Game'
## Cards Face Spartan Aerial Attack Daily Sports 
### NICK SELBY 
"Stanford is always the 'Big
Game* for San Jose. They'll be
smelling blood when they come
to play us."
So spoke Stanford football
coach John Ralston yesterday
as his troops (not of the Army
variety) finished up a week of
practices specially tailored to
handling the Spartan passing at
tack.
The Indians will have no rea
son to look forward to USC next
week if they can not handle the
golden arm of Spartan quarter
back Danny Holman.
13 Point Favorites?
Holman's throwing ability is
the reason why the Indians can't
[ignore the Spartans, even

though they have been tabbed
13 point favorites in some quar
ters.
Last year, for example, Hol
man completed 19 of 26 passes
for 208 yards against the Indian
secondary and nearly upset the
Indians. A late Tribe rally pulled
the game out of the fire 25-21.
Pressure on Sophs
Once again the pressure will
be on the sophomore defensive
backs Bob Rinker and Dick
Oliver to contain the opponents
aerial attack.
Last week, against competent
Kansas passer Bobby Douglass
the secondary failed several
times, but only once dangerously.
Spartan Threats
Holman's principal targets will

be returning letterman Mike
Tompkins, who caught five
passes for 52 yards and a TD
in the Spartans opening loss to
Arizona State, and flanker Clar
ence Kelley.
Another threat for the Indian
defense will be running backs
Walt Shockly and Mike Schriv
ner. Shockly was a junior col
lege Ail-American last year and
serves both as a runner and re
ceiver.
Lack Balance
The Spartan offense's main
weakness in the past has been
a lack of balance in the attack.
Against Arizona State, the run
ners lost 22 yards, but Shockly
was hindered by a sore leg.
Because San Jose's last game

against the University of Texas
at El Paso last week was can
celled, Ralsto nexpects Shockly
to be running at full speed.
Limit Strikes
So far the Stanford defense
has been up to the challenge of
limiting opponents scoring
strikes. The Tribe's stinginess
inside the ten has forced five
field goal situations in two
games. Stu Kellner, Doug Mc-
Kenzie, Blaine Nye, and John
delaForest limited the Beavers
and Jayhawks to about 2.5 yards
a carry.
The only change in last week's
defensive line comes at defen
sive end, where Phil Schneider
will fill in for the injured Tom
Hazelrigg. Schneider played the
last half of the Kansas game,
earning coach Ralston's praise
for aggressive play.
Boot to Start
The Stanford offense shows
one major change this week.
Jack Root, one of the tri-cap
tains along with linebacker Mar
ty Brill and center Don Swartz,
seems to have regained his tim
ing and will start at fullback.
Greg Broughton, who started
last week, will back him up.
Bill Shoemaker will continue
as the flanker back as Gene
Washington's ankle trouble
again makes it questionable
whether he'll play. Filling out
the backfield are halfback Nate

Kirtman and last week's back of
the game, Mark Marquess.
Last week the Indians elected
to follow a conservative game
of ball control and a ground at
tack behind the blocking of
guards Phil Messer and George
Crooks. The Indians may be
forced to change this week to
meet Holman's lightning with

their own, but coach Ralston has
divulged no plans.
Satellite 'Axe'
Stanford has tradition on its
side for the game. Only twice
in the last 23 years has San Jose
won the game. This is the sec
ond year that the winner will
earn possession of the Satellite
Trophy, a four-foot high model.
For San Jose, the Satellite
model will have all the signifi
cance of the "Big Game" Axe.

"Stanford is always the 'Big
Game* for San Jose. They'll be
smelling blood when they come
to play us."
So spoke Stanford football
coach John Ralston yesterday
as his troops (not of the Army
variety) finished up a week of
practices specially tailored to
handling the Spartan passing at
tack.
The Indians will have no rea
son to look forward to USC next
week if they can not handle the
golden arm of Spartan quarter
back Danny Holman.
13 Point Favorites?
Holman's throwing ability is
the reason why the Indians can't
[ignore the Spartans, even

though they have been tabbed
13 point favorites in some quar
ters.
Last year, for example, Hol
man completed 19 of 26 passes
for 208 yards against the Indian
secondary and nearly upset the
Indians. A late Tribe rally pulled
the game out of the fire 25-21.
Pressure on Sophs
Once again the pressure will
be on the sophomore defensive
backs Bob Rinker and Dick
Oliver to contain the opponents
aerial attack.
Last week, against competent
Kansas passer Bobby Douglass
the secondary failed several
times, but only once dangerously.
Spartan Threats
Holman's principal targets will

be returning letterman Mike
Tompkins, who caught five
passes for 52 yards and a TD
in the Spartans opening loss to
Arizona State, and flanker Clar
ence Kelley.
Another threat for the Indian
defense will be running backs
Walt Shockly and Mike Schriv
ner. Shockly was a junior col
lege Ail-American last year and
serves both as a runner and re
ceiver.
Lack Balance
The Spartan offense's main
weakness in the past has been
a lack of balance in the attack.
Against Arizona State, the run
ners lost 22 yards, but Shockly
was hindered by a sore leg.
Because San Jose's last game

against the University of Texas
at El Paso last week was can
celled, Ralsto nexpects Shockly
to be running at full speed.
Limit Strikes
So far the Stanford defense
has been up to the challenge of
limiting opponents scoring
strikes. The Tribe's stinginess
inside the ten has forced five
field goal situations in two
games. Stu Kellner, Doug Mc-
Kenzie, Blaine Nye, and John
delaForest limited the Beavers
and Jayhawks to about 2.5 yards
a carry.
The only change in last week's
defensive line comes at defen
sive end, where Phil Schneider
will fill in for the injured Tom
Hazelrigg. Schneider played the
last half of the Kansas game,
earning coach Ralston's praise
for aggressive play.
Boot to Start
The Stanford offense shows
one major change this week.
Jack Root, one of the tri-cap
tains along with linebacker Mar
ty Brill and center Don Swartz,
seems to have regained his tim
ing and will start at fullback.
Greg Broughton, who started
last week, will back him up.
Bill Shoemaker will continue
as the flanker back as Gene
Washington's ankle trouble
again makes it questionable
whether he'll play. Filling out
the backfield are halfback Nate

Kirtman and last week's back of
the game, Mark Marquess.
Last week the Indians elected
to follow a conservative game
of ball control and a ground at
tack behind the blocking of
guards Phil Messer and George
Crooks. The Indians may be
forced to change this week to
meet Holman's lightning with

their own, but coach Ralston has
divulged no plans.
Satellite 'Axe'
Stanford has tradition on its
side for the game. Only twice
in the last 23 years has San Jose
won the game. This is the sec
ond year that the winner will
earn possession of the Satellite
Trophy, a four-foot high model.
For San Jose, the Satellite
model will have all the signifi
cance of the "Big Game" Axe.
