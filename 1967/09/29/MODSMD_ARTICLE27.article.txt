Stanford defensive end Phil Schneider (83) tries
to block a field goal attempt by Kansas kicker
Bobby Bell. Schneider's dive fell just inches short
of the ball. Holding the ball for the Jayhawks is
fleet halfback Donnie Shanklin. Schneider will start
for the Indians this Saturday against San Jose in
place of Tom Hazelrigg, who injured his leg in
the Kansas game.
