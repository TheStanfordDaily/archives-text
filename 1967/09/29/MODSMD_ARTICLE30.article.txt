thing but the best conditions.

CSM, although he says"it may
not be as strong as last year."

and David Pugh at center half.
In the goal for the Tribe will be
Bob Adams, who will alternate
with Dan Clement.
Defensive Specialists
The defensive specialists for
the Cards will be fullbacks Gra

ham Niles and John Taylor. Bill
Palmer brought a gleam of hope
to Coach Priddle when he re
ported back for duty at right
wing to team with left wing Al
lan Houghton.
Pressing the attack for the
varsity will be right inside Russ
Hall, center forward Dan Boyd,
and left inside Bill Hurlburt.
