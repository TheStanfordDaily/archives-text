# Union Reaction

and countless hours reading
everything the students write.
It's really very time consuming,
especially in English. You cant
live on $160 a month and be a
graduate student at the same
time."
Islas added that he "wil cer
tainly consider joining the un
ion, even if I'm not here next
year. I think it important that
next year's TAs are offered a
substantial fee for what they
have to do.'
"The Best Situation"
Graduates from different de
partments presented an opposite
view. According to John Nash,
a Mathematics TA, "Compared
to other colleges that I applied
to, this is the best situation
I've heard of for an equal
salary.
"I will teach three hours a
week for two out of three quar
ters. Almost all the other
schools that I've had contact
with, for a comparable amount
of money, would require six to
nine hours of teaching per week
for two semesters."
Karl Roider of the History De
partment finds a union unneces
sary in his department. "I don't
need to join the
union because of the compact
ness of the department and the
friendliness that's evident be
tween professors and graduate
students."
Laissez-Teach Policy
French and Italian Department
Elie Cohen agrees. "This is my
third year at Stanford and I have
yet to feel reified; I have been
treated like a professional, like
an intellectual, and, best of all,
like a human being. No one tells
me how to teach my students and
they have been the beneficiaries
of this laissez-teach policy."
Several graduate students were
outspoken on the need for educa
tional reform and looked for the
union to work for effecting
change in present policies.
"I was very surprised when I
first got on campus," said David

Wilson, a graduate in History,
"because all the teachers and ad
ministrators I met said that
'We've got to get you through
just as fast as possible.'
Academic Mill
"I didn't think that graduate
education was like that, especial
ly at a place like Stanford. It
definitely seems to be an academ
ic mill to turn out degrees. I
think that a union would be a
good way to get our voices
heard."
Bruce Merry, acting instructor
in the French and Italian Depart
ment, made a similar point.
"When I was at elementary
school in England we had a
phrase that would describe rath
er too many graduate students at
Stanford: 'goodie, goodie.'
"They hovered around the
teachers, swallowed bitter pills
and then got the plums. If the
graduate union could contribute
to reducing this atmosphere,
then I would welcome it."
Gigantic Factory
The Mathematics Department
is quite different from many of
the humanities and sciences de
partments on their TA and RA
policies. Robert Smythe, gradu
ate student and TA, stated that
"conditions are better for TAs
in this department than they are
in others. In the Math Depart
ment, TAs are pretty well off.
They don't get rich, but they're
not in general overworked.
"As far as I'm concerned, one
of the biggest arguments for the
union is political and not purely
economic. I would favor it on
those grounds. It's something
that cuts across disciplines. Grad
uate students and junior faculty
together can generate a lot of
interest and give us sort of a bar
gaining position."
The second is from Smythe of
Mathematics: "I haven't found
that math graduate students are
pushed through the program. In
fact, the department has been
criticized for keeping students
around too long and not en
couraging them to finish their
degrees. There is no pressure."
