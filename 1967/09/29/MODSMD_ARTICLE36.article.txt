# Driving Laws For Minors
## 
### 
California law specifies that an
out-of-state minor wishing to
drive must obtain a California
state license within 10 days of
arrival.
Drivers over 21 need licenses
only if they are state residents.
A Stanford student qualifies as
a resident only if he engages in
such activities as a state elec
tion or has children enrolled in
public school.
Out-of-state minors wishing
to drive should be aware that
home-state licenses are invalid
in California. State law specifies
that minors must obtain a Cali
fornia license within 10 days of
arrival.
To receive a California license,

an out-of-state minor must either
request his home state insurance
company to send an "SR22"
form to the Department of Mo
tor Vehicles in Sacramento or
obtain a legal guardian in Cali
fornia. This step assures the De
partment that an adult has given
approval. Upon completion of
this step, the minor must pass
written, eye, and road tests, and
pay the $3 license fee.
With regard to automobile
registration, the Motor Vehicle
Department states that there is
no standard procedure and that
each individual is more or less
on his own. Stanford students
are referred to the Redwood City
office at 368-2837 for advice on
each particular case.
