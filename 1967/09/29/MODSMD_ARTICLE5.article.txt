BRATISLAVA, CZECHOSLO
VAKIA (CPS) â€” Perhaps the
major event of this meeting be
tween Vietnamese and Ameri
cans was the release of the first
NLF political program since

1960, printed in English and dis
tributed to the American dele
gates.
The document invites all
forces, Communist and non-Com
munist, to join the NLF's na
tionalist revolution; protects
"the right of ownership of the
means of production and other
property of citizens;" encour
ages "the capitalists in industry
and trade to help develop indus
try, small industries, and handi
crafts;" respects "the legitimate
right to ownership of land by
the churches, pagodas, and holy
sees of religious sects;" prom
ises free general elections toward
eventual reunification of both
Vietnams, "in accordance with
the principle of universal, equal,
direct suffrage;" and bars mili
tary alliances with all other na
tions.
Five Point Program
"You will notice that there is
nothing here which mentions so
cialiasm," said Mrs. Nguyen Thi
Binh, the 50-year-old Foreign
Secretary for the NLF, who also
headed the Southern Delegation.
Mrs. Binh added that the NLF's
program insists on five points:
peace, neutrality, democracy, in
dependence, and eventual nation
al reunification.
Most Americans were surpris
ed at the wording of the NLF
program, which seems much too
pro-capitalist in its outlook; how
ever, the program may be a
transitional step toward a so
cialist economy for South Viet
nam, dependent on the outcome
of a democratic election.
Therefore, the NLF is confi
dent of its ability to maintain
the widespread support which
it now enjoys, and seems en
tirely honest in its insistence
that the people of Vietnam be
given the opportunity to decide
for themselves which form of
government they will have. The
current program, with its assur
ances of private property rights,
may be a compromise with the
many non-socialist elements ac
tive in the body and leadership
of the front, but the ultimate
program would be dictated by
the populace as far as possible.
NLF Sympathizers
Even among Thieu and Ky's
top military officers, the NLF
maintains secret sympathizers,
Mrs. Binh claimed. The front
includes at least three major
political parties (Democratic,
Radical Socialist, and Peoples'
Revolutionary), four major re
ligions, and many ethnic groups.
According to southern jour
nalist Huynh Van Ly, the NLF
is now in control of over 80 per
cent of the southern countryside
excluding the major cities of Sai
gon. Danang, and Hue, which

are governed with varying de
grees of stability by the "puppet
government" sanctioned by the
U.S.
Maps and films were present
ed showing life in these lib
erated zones, which Mr. Ly
maintained include 3.5 million
hectares of land, over two mil
lion of it privately owned by
peasants, producing enough rice
for the fighting troops without
the major rice-import problem
of the southern government.
Ex-Greenfields
(Saigon is expected to import
a million tons of rice this year,
and reports from Boston Uni
versity news correspondent Alex
Jack in Saigon said that night
clubs there had taken to a ver
sion of "Greenfields" which
reads, "once there were rice
fields . . . now there are none.")
North Vietnam's four-point
program for peace remains as
before. Tran Con Tuong, a Ha
noi lawyer, reiterated the stand:
(1) The U.S. must put an end
to aggression against the north
(at which point negotiations
could begin immediately.)
(2) Strict attention must be
paid to the Geneva accords.
(3) A solution to the prob
lems of South Vietnam must
come from the South Vietna
mese themselves.
(4) The two Vietnams must
be allowed to achieve peaceful
reunification between them
selves.
"Our people are determined
not to submit to force, not to
talk to the U.S. imperialists un
der the threat of (resumed)
bombing," Tuong emphasized;
Hanoi "has no reason to escalate
the war" (as Washington has
charged); its stand is "in the
interests of the American peo
ple as well, Tuong stated.
The north is now receiving
limited aid in heavy industry
from the Soviet Union, but noth
ing from China, delegates said
in small group sessions. Much
of the DRV's weaponry is small
artillery, and both infantry
weapons and larger arms are
frequently salvaged from cap
tured U.S. supplies or downed
aircraft.
