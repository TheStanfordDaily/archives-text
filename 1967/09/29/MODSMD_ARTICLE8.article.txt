# Pass-Fail Grades Drop 200 From Dean's List
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
More than 200 undergraduates
with high grade point averages
were excluded from the 1966-67
Dean's List because they took
too many courses on an un
graded, pass-fail basis.
The Registrar's office decided
over the summer that at least
39 units had to be taken for let
ter grades to be eligible for the
Dean's List, which consists of all
undergraduates with a grade
point average (CPAO of at least
3.2 out of a possible 4.0

The 200 students had satis
factory GPA's but fewer than
39 units with letter grades. The
"normal' course load for an un
dergraduate at Stanford is 45
units each year, according to Uni
versity officials.
None of these students knew
that they made themselves in
eligible for the Dean's List, since
the decision to require the 39
units was not announced until
yesterday.
The Dean's List as released by
the Registrar's office contains
1194 names, or about 25 per cent
of the freshmen, sophomores
and juniors in 1966-67. Seniors
receive academic honors at grad
uation and are not included in
the yearly Dean's List.
Registrar Harvey Hall told
The Daily yesterday that the
decision to exclude the 200 stu
dents might be reconsidered. He
said he would bring up the prob
lem at a meeting today of the
subcommittee on graduation of
the Registrar's Advisory Com
mittee.
Expresses Concern
Hall expressed concern that
the 200 students did not know
they were making themselves
ineligible for honors. "I don't
know whether they've been
treated fairly or unfairly," he
said, "but their equity has not
been carefully examined."
A secretary in the Registrar's

office said that a few students
were "very angry" when they
found out this week that they
had been excluded from the
Dean's List because they had
not taken at least 39 units for
letter grades. The Dean's List
certificates which normally are
distributed at autumn registra
tion will not be available until
winter quarter, due to a clerical
difficulty unrelated to the pass
fail decision, according to Hall.
Pass-fail grading was new at
Stanford in the last academic
year. The problem of Dean's
List eligibility just didn't occur
to anyone until late in the year,
one employee of the Registrar's
office said.
Under the rules before pass
fail grading was permitted, at
least 39 units had to be taken
to be eligible for the Dean's
List. With pass-fail grading, any
units taken pass-fail "do not
count as units attempted for
GPA calculations."
The minimum units problem
first emerged last spring. One
requirement for honors at grad
uation is that 40 units in "upper
division" courses must have
been taken during the senior's
last six quarters at Stanford.
At first the Registrar's office
proposed that only units taken
for letter grades would count
toward these 40 units, but later
decided the class of 1967 would
be exempt from the new rule.

first emerged last spring. One
requirement for honors at grad
uation is that 40 units in "upper
division" courses must have
been taken during the senior's
last six quarters at Stanford.
At first the Registrar's office
proposed that only units taken
for letter grades would count
toward these 40 units, but later
decided the class of 1967 would
be exempt from the new rule.
More than 200 undergraduates
with high grade point averages
were excluded from the 1966-67
Dean's List because they took
too many courses on an un
graded, pass-fail basis.
The Registrar's office decided
over the summer that at least
39 units had to be taken for let
ter grades to be eligible for the
Dean's List, which consists of all
undergraduates with a grade
point average (CPAO of at least
3.2 out of a possible 4.0

The 200 students had satis
factory GPA's but fewer than
39 units with letter grades. The
"normal' course load for an un
dergraduate at Stanford is 45
units each year, according to Uni
versity officials.
None of these students knew
that they made themselves in
eligible for the Dean's List, since
the decision to require the 39
units was not announced until
yesterday.
The Dean's List as released by
the Registrar's office contains
1194 names, or about 25 per cent
of the freshmen, sophomores
and juniors in 1966-67. Seniors
receive academic honors at grad
uation and are not included in
the yearly Dean's List.
Registrar Harvey Hall told
The Daily yesterday that the
decision to exclude the 200 stu
dents might be reconsidered. He
said he would bring up the prob
lem at a meeting today of the
subcommittee on graduation of
the Registrar's Advisory Com
mittee.
Expresses Concern
Hall expressed concern that
the 200 students did not know
they were making themselves
ineligible for honors. "I don't
know whether they've been
treated fairly or unfairly," he
said, "but their equity has not
been carefully examined."
A secretary in the Registrar's

office said that a few students
were "very angry" when they
found out this week that they
had been excluded from the
Dean's List because they had
not taken at least 39 units for
letter grades. The Dean's List
certificates which normally are
distributed at autumn registra
tion will not be available until
winter quarter, due to a clerical
difficulty unrelated to the pass
fail decision, according to Hall.
Pass-fail grading was new at
Stanford in the last academic
year. The problem of Dean's
List eligibility just didn't occur
to anyone until late in the year,
one employee of the Registrar's
office said.
Under the rules before pass
fail grading was permitted, at
least 39 units had to be taken
to be eligible for the Dean's
List. With pass-fail grading, any
units taken pass-fail "do not
count as units attempted for
GPA calculations."
