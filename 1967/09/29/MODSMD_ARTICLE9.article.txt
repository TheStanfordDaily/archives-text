# Draft's Opponents Discuss Resistance
## 
### MICHAEL MORTON 
"You can't serve two gods,'
said ex-Student Body President
and now Resistance leader Dave
Harris at yesterday's First An
nual Anti-Draft Rally. "Your
lives must be used against the
American state, against those
forces which deprive those lives
of meaning. If you don't serve
the American state, you must
adopt the word Resistance."
The rally, held at noon in
White Plaza, attracted an audi
ence of several hundred to hear
Harris, Peter Ware, Morgan
Spector and Leonard Siegel ex
pound on various aspects of
draft resistance.
Harris stated that the act of
carrying a draft card is a pledge
to the American people "to go
out and do their murder when
and where they choose." He
affirmed that American military
power is not used for humanity
or justice but domination, and
that "you're a soldier when you
carry a draft card; you're a part
of the oppression."
Ware, an ex-graduate busi
ness student and now a member
of the Anti-Draft Union, adopted
a somewhat different tack from
that of Harris. He stated that
any form of draft resistance is
a "privileged bag," because any
one able to express opposition
to the draft is inextricably
bound up in the middle class.
Coercive And Undemocratic
The fundamental issue, as he
sees it, is not simply confined
to the draft or even the Viet
nam war, but encompasses the
whole range of American soci
ety. He said that any opposition
must stem from the realization
that the draft is a "coercive
and undemocratic institution in
the context of a coercive and un
democratic society; the draft is
not an exception."
Spector, a member of the
committee of Stop the Draft

Week, outlined the events of
this week (October 16-21), which
he termed "a massive confronta
tion with the system." The main
event of the week will occur on
Monday, October 16, when Re
sistance members will make a
final gesture of non-cooperation
by turning in their draft cards
at the Federal Building in San
Francisco. This action will be
supported by a march on the
Oakland Induction Center the
next day with, Spector said,
"the sole idea of closing that
place down."
Siegel closed the day's pro
ceedings with a brief summary
of the purposes of the Anti-
Draft Union. He saw the over
riding purpose to be not only
one of stopping the draft, but
of "precipitating radical social
change." He expressed the hope
that someday more can be said
than, "Hell No, We Won't Go,"
but "Hell No, Nobody Goes."

one of stopping the draft, but
of "precipitating radical social
change." He expressed the hope
that someday more can be said
than, "Hell No, We Won't Go,"
but "Hell No, Nobody Goes."
"You can't serve two gods,'
said ex-Student Body President
and now Resistance leader Dave
Harris at yesterday's First An
nual Anti-Draft Rally. "Your
lives must be used against the
American state, against those
forces which deprive those lives
of meaning. If you don't serve
the American state, you must
adopt the word Resistance."
The rally, held at noon in
White Plaza, attracted an audi
ence of several hundred to hear
Harris, Peter Ware, Morgan
Spector and Leonard Siegel ex
pound on various aspects of
draft resistance.
Harris stated that the act of
carrying a draft card is a pledge
to the American people "to go
out and do their murder when
and where they choose." He
affirmed that American military
power is not used for humanity
or justice but domination, and
that "you're a soldier when you
carry a draft card; you're a part
of the oppression."
Ware, an ex-graduate busi
ness student and now a member
of the Anti-Draft Union, adopted
a somewhat different tack from
that of Harris. He stated that
any form of draft resistance is
a "privileged bag," because any
one able to express opposition
to the draft is inextricably
bound up in the middle class.
Coercive And Undemocratic
The fundamental issue, as he
sees it, is not simply confined
to the draft or even the Viet
nam war, but encompasses the
whole range of American soci
ety. He said that any opposition
must stem from the realization
that the draft is a "coercive
and undemocratic institution in
the context of a coercive and un
democratic society; the draft is
not an exception."
Spector, a member of the
committee of Stop the Draft

Week, outlined the events of
this week (October 16-21), which
he termed "a massive confronta
tion with the system." The main
event of the week will occur on
Monday, October 16, when Re
sistance members will make a
final gesture of non-cooperation
by turning in their draft cards
at the Federal Building in San
Francisco. This action will be
supported by a march on the
Oakland Induction Center the
next day with, Spector said,
"the sole idea of closing that
place down."
Siegel closed the day's pro
ceedings with a brief summary
of the purposes of the Anti-
Draft Union. He saw the over
riding purpose to be not only
one of stopping the draft, but
of "precipitating radical social
change." He expressed the hope
that someday more can be said
than, "Hell No, We Won't Go,"
but "Hell No, Nobody Goes."
