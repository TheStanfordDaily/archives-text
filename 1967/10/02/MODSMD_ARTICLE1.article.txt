# Dissent On Housing
## Residents Point Out Stern's Problems 
### 
Two professors will teach
a special seminar this quar
ter, despite University rejec
tion of the course's unit
credit.
Called "Underground" Spe
cial 199, and patterned after
regular Undergraduate Spe
cials, the course will cover
the "Independent and the
University."
The Committee on Under
graduate Education rejected
Prof. Douglas Wilde's appli
cation for the course last
week. No reason was given,
but Wilde told "The Daily"
he hopes to receive a letter
from Dean Robert Hind this
week explaining the rejection.
Another administrator —
and Stern Hall faculty resi
dent — Robert N. Funk will
teach part of the course.
Funk Complains
Funk made his complaints
about housing at Stanford,
particularly as it relates to
independents, public yester
day when he submitted a 27
page article on the problem
to "Daily" editor Kirk Han
son.
The first part of Funk's the
sis appears on page three of
today's "Daily."
Wilde said the first meeting
of the underground seminar
will be held at 7 p.m. Wed
nesday in the basement of
Burbank House of Stern Hall.
Position Papers
No credit will be- given for

the seminar, but Wilde said
he hopes the students in the
class will generate position
papers for the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford (SES).
Fnnk, Asst. Dean of the
School of Education, claims
the influx of demonstration
houses into Stern and Wil
bur has caused the normal
balance of classes from fresh
men to seniors to be upset.
"Nearly 70 per cent of Las
sen House is made up of
freshmen," he said. Last
year's percentage was closer
to 25 per cent. Other Stern

"front houses" are faced with
similar problems: Holiday
House has 60 per cent fresh
men, and hoth Fremont and
have about 40 per cent
freshmen.
"My present complaint."
Funk commented, "is that
four-year houses in Stern
have been drastically changed.
As we make plans for the
future I think it's important
for the people making the
plans to know the values of
these four-year houses."
Funk hopes his report
will cause "more discussion,
particularly at Stern.
"It might bring in new
ideas and insights," he added.
Turkey Roost
In his report for "The
Daily," Funk admits that
"Stern is notorious as a roost
for turkeys," but goes on to
say "the freshman year at
Wilbur represents a long sim
mer in one's own late ado
lescent juices."
Funk also believes the
freshman house system
should be abandoned.
Wilde, who was faculty
rseident in Fremont and Holi
day two years ago, feels there
is "no excuse" for the addi
tional freshmen in the "front
houses."
The increase in male fresh
men in the front houses was
made in order to allow more
women freshmen to live in
Branner, he said.
