## Do Away With Curricular Despotism 
### Christopher Hargrove 
Students who come to Stan
ford are by and large achievers.
They have either achieved very
high grades in high school, or
achieved important places in the
student hierarchy, or achieved
prominence on a playing team
or achieved notoriety for excep
tional work in a special field.
Aptitude is not enough, be
cause aptitude is not a rare
enough commodity. If you want
to get into Stanford, you must
have done something too. And
you must have done it within
the restrictive framework of our
high schools.
Problems arise, however, once
a student arrives at college. He
must rethink his goals, reorient
the direction of his life, recon
sider his premises. For many
of us, the process is painful and
confused.
In the grand scheme of a stu
dent's life, curriculum is only
one of many things to worry
about and make potentially im
portant decisions about. But it
is one of the most important
and, for official purposes at least,
it is the primary reason a stu
dent is in college at all.
And all the time a student is

taking these courses, he is still
being encouraged to achieve â€”
good grades so he can get into
graduate school or get a good
job recommendation.
Two questions are posed. If
achievement in the socially ac
ceptable fashion is not enough
for us, then what goals are we
to set for ourselves? And how
does the curriculum fit into all
this?
The first question should be
easy to answer but it is not. It
should be easy to say that we
should all set our own goals and
take it from there. We should
not need people telling us what
we want from life and what life
can reasonably expect in return.
Strong Inducements
More important, we should not
want people telling us these
things. But we do, and the in
ducements to do so are very
strong indeed. We are promised
jobs, status, money, all kinds of
wonderful things.
We are brought up to believe
these things are good. It is hard
not to when everyone around
you believes it, and rants about
the virtues of being well-rounded
and well-liked. It is a habit so

ingrained in us that we usually
cannot see it as anything but
natural.
From the day we are born,
our parents expect certain things
from us and teach us the Tight
ness of these goals. One hears
of extreme cases every so often,
as when the one-year-old son of
a Yale alumnus is enrolled in
the class of 1985. To lesser de
grees, the same pre-planning is
made for all of us, and always
by other people.
"Seif-De termination"
All of this brings me to my
special concern for today, under
graduate curriculum. If we re
ject the idea that other people
have the right to tell us how to
lead our lives, then more par
ticularly, we must reject the
idea that others can tell us
what courses to take.
The Study of Education at
Stanford is to take up this ques
tion. Staff Director Robert Hind,
in an excellent discussion paper
presented to SES last May, spoke
of undergraduate major require
ments.
He said, "Except for students
going on in the few disciplines
(most notably the sciences) still

calling for extensive preparation
in the undergraduate years,
there is little justification for
majoring except as the intellec
tual exercise of achieving a level
of mastery in a field."
He adds, later, that education
al achievement would be best
served if the University would
"inform students more fully
about the content and methods
of courses, and allow them to
make their own choices."
This would not be an easy
route for the University, as Hind
points out. He emphasizes the
need for careful advance gui
dance in such a plan. And, as
much as this sounds like ration
alization for a different kind of
social coercion, Hind is quite
right.
Most students, I fear, would
be at a loss for direction if they
were allowed to completely
choose their own. But at least
such a plan would be a good
start, and we could hope that
some day the advising would not
have to be so carefully planned.
In the meantime, SES ought to
adopt Hind's proposals as policy
and the University ought to
adopt them as practice.
