# I Won't Go
## Cinderella And The Gold Boot 
### Herbie Hinckes 
President Wallace J. Tarnish
ed was sitting down to his morn
ing glass of tomato juice with his
trusted aide and Provost, Rich
ard Truthman.
"Looks like another morning,
another glass of tomato juice,
Dickie-pooh," Tarnished smiled.
"It sure looks ..."
Truthman was interrupted by
a blinding flash of light.
"I"ve been interrupted by a
blinding flash of light," Truth
man complained.
In the middle of President Tar
nished's office stood a middle
aged woman. Her light brown
hair was piled on top of her
head in a bun. She wore a black
floor-length dress with a "Beat
Cal in '03" button on her skirt.
"It's Jane," Tarnished shouted.
"Hi, Wally, hi, Dick. Just
thought I'd drop in to remind
you the time has come to start
looking for a new president,"
Jane Stanford said.
She handed a golden boot to
Tarnished. It appeared to be a
size twelve, complete with four
inch spike on the toe.
"What I am supposed to do
with this, Jane?"
"It's the Golden Coolie Boot,
Wally, and when you find a
man who can wear it, you will
have found Stanford's next pres
ident. Senator Stanford wore
that same boot when he was
building the railroad," Mrs. Stan
ford added.
Then, as an afterthought,
"The spike on the toe got the
Southern Pacific built about two
years ahead of schedule. Really
made those coolies move," Jane
laughed. "So you take it and
find someone who can wear it."
She disappeared.
Tarnishecl's mouth hung open.
He closed it and swallowed hard.
"Gosharootie, Dick, that sounded
like a mandate. Let's get the
Golden Coolie Boot to Washing
ton immediately."
"You mean to see if John Wel
fare, Secretary of Health, Edu
cation, and Gardening, can wear
it?" Truthman queried.
Tarnished took a box of small
gold stars out of his desk and
pasted one on Truthman's fore
head. "Maybe you're smarter
than I thought. Let's go."
★ ★ ★
Tarnished slumbered as the
huge jet hurtled across the na
tion.
Truthman was awake, think
ing about an article in the Palo
Alto Times which claimed he
was the one who would become
president. '"Ihis may be my
only chance," he told himself.
He reached over and plucked
the Golden Coolie Boot from Tar
nished's lap. Taking off his own
shoe, he slyly started to put on
the boot.
It didn't fit.

"Hello, my name is Wallace
J. Tarnished, may I see John
Welfare?" the president asked
Welfare's secretary.
"Are you part of the hungry
masses?" the secretary asked.
"No, I'm president of Leland
University, the M.I.T. of the
West."
"Just a minute. I'll check to
see if the Secretary has finished
his conference yet." She went
through a door.
"Mr. Welfare, there are two
big guys outside who say they're

from some university. One of
them has a gold star on his
forehead."
"Must be Wally and Dick," Mr.
Welfare laughed. "Send them
in. I could use a few chuckles."
After Tarnished anfl Truth
man had found seats in Wel
fare's spacious office, they
broached the question.
"Would you mind trying on
this boot, John?" Tarnished
asked.
"You people from Leland Uni
versity slay me, Wally," Welfare
said as he nearly rolled on the
floor with laughter. "First you
ask me to be president, then you
try to sell me shoes."
"Don't misunderstand me,
John, we still want you for presi
dent, but before we can officially
ask you, you have to try on the
Golden Coolie Boot."
"The golden what?" Welfare
said, still rolling on the floor.
"I haven't heard anything this
funny since LBJ showed the
world his operating scar."

"Please try it on," Tarnished
asked again.
"Well, if it will make you
happy, Wally."
He took off his wingtips and
started to put on the boot.
It didn't fit.
★ ★ ★
During the next three months
in Washington, the powerful duo
from Leland University went
from office to office, begging
high administration officials to
try the boot on.
Secretary of War, Revolution
and Peace (in that order) Robert
S. McEdsel dicln't even get his
big toe inside the boot. J. Edgar
G-Man called it a Communist
plot. United Nations diplomat
Arthur Iceberg broke his foot
trying to fit into it.
★ ★ ★
In late 1970, Tarnished and
Truthman were still searching.
"Look, Wally, there was a pos
sibility that we might have
found a president in Washing
ton, in New York, in Boston,

Kansas City, even Reno, but
East Palo Alto? Leland Univer
sity has never had a president
from East Palo Alto," Truthman
said.
"Do you really expect to find
him here?"
"Oh, shut up," Tarnished mut
tered as he rang another door
bell.
A man came out and looked at
the ragged pair. "President Tar
nished," he exclaimed, "what are
you doing here?"
Tarnished and Truthman did
a double take at the tall figure
by the porch light. "It's David
Hairless," they both shouted.
Foam flecked their lips as they
tried to run away. But the best
they could do was to crash into
each other, knocking out both
of them.
Ex-student body president
Hairless walked over their bodies
and picked up the Golden Coolie
Boot. He easily slipped it on his
foot and sat there admiring it.

laughed. "So you take it and
find someone who can wear it."
She disappeared.
Tarnishecl's mouth hung open.
He closed it and swallowed hard.
"Gosharootie, Dick, that sounded
like a mandate. Let's get the
Golden Coolie Boot to Washing

"You mean to see if John Wel
fare, Secretary of Health, Edu
cation, and Gardening, can wear
it?" Truthman queried.
Tarnished took a box of small
gold stars out of his desk and
pasted one on Truthman's fore
head. "Maybe you're smarter
than I thought. Let's go."

Tarnished slumbered as the
huge jet hurtled across the na

Truthman was awake, think
ing about an article in the Palo
Alto Times which claimed he
was the one who would become
president. '"Ihis may be my
only chance," he told himself.
He reached over and plucked
the Golden Coolie Boot from Tar
nished's lap. Taking off his own
shoe, he slyly started to put on
the boot.
It didn't fit.

"Hello, my name is Wallace
J. Tarnished, may I see John
Welfare?" the president asked
Welfare's secretary.
"Are you part of the hungry
masses?" the secretary asked.
"No, I'm president of Leland
University, the M.I.T. of the
West."
"Just a minute. I'll check to
see if the Secretary has finished
his conference yet." She went
through a door.
"Mr. Welfare, there are two
big guys outside who say they're

from some university. One of
them has a gold star on his
forehead."
"Must be Wally and Dick," Mr.
Welfare laughed. "Send them
in. I could use a few chuckles."
After Tarnished anfl Truth
man had found seats in Wel
fare's spacious office, they
broached the question.
"Would you mind trying on
this boot, John?" Tarnished
asked.
"You people from Leland Uni
versity slay me, Wally," Welfare
said as he nearly rolled on the
floor with laughter. "First you
ask me to be president, then you
try to sell me shoes."
"Don't misunderstand me,
John, we still want you for presi
dent, but before we can officially
ask you, you have to try on the
Golden Coolie Boot."
"The golden what?" Welfare
said, still rolling on the floor.
"I haven't heard anything this
funny since LBJ showed the
world his operating scar."

"Please try it on," Tarnished
asked again.
"Well, if it will make you
happy, Wally."
He took off his wingtips and
started to put on the boot.
It didn't fit.

During the next three months
in Washington, the powerful duo
from Leland University went
from office to office, begging
high administration officials to
try the boot on.
Secretary of War, Revolution
and Peace (in that order) Robert
S. McEdsel dicln't even get his
big toe inside the boot. J. Edgar
G-Man called it a Communist
plot. United Nations diplomat
Arthur Iceberg broke his foot
trying to fit into it.
★ ★ ★
In late 1970, Tarnished and
Truthman were still searching.
"Look, Wally, there was a pos
sibility that we might have
found a president in Washing
ton, in New York, in Boston,

Kansas City, even Reno, but
East Palo Alto? Leland Univer
sity has never had a president
from East Palo Alto," Truthman
said.
"Do you really expect to find
him here?"
"Oh, shut up," Tarnished mut
tered as he rang another door
bell.
A man came out and looked at
the ragged pair. "President Tar
nished," he exclaimed, "what are
you doing here?"
Tarnished and Truthman did
a double take at the tall figure
by the porch light. "It's David
Hairless," they both shouted.
Foam flecked their lips as they
tried to run away. But the best
they could do was to crash into
each other, knocking out both
of them.
Ex-student body president
Hairless walked over their bodies
and picked up the Golden Coolie
Boot. He easily slipped it on his
foot and sat there admiring it.
President Wallace J. Tarnish

trusted aide and Provost, Rich

"Looks like another morning,
another glass of tomato juice,
Dickie-pooh," Tarnished smiled.
"It sure looks ..."
Truthman was interrupted by
a blinding flash of light.
"I"ve been interrupted by a
blinding flash of light," Truth
man complained.
In the middle of President Tar
nished's office stood a middle
aged woman. Her light brown
hair was piled on top of her
head in a bun. She wore a black
floor-length dress with a "Beat
Cal in '03" button on her skirt.
"It's Jane," Tarnished shouted.
"Hi, Wally, hi, Dick. Just
thought I'd drop in to remind
you the time has come to start
looking for a new president,"
Jane Stanford said.
She handed a golden boot to
Tarnished. It appeared to be a
size twelve, complete with four

"What I am supposed to do
with this, Jane?"
"It's the Golden Coolie Boot,
Wally, and when you find a

"Just a minute. I'll check to

through a door.
"Mr. Welfare, there are two
big guys outside who say they're

from some university. One of
them has a gold star on his
forehead."
"Must be Wally and Dick," Mr.
Welfare laughed. "Send them
in. I could use a few chuckles."
After Tarnished anfl Truth
man had found seats in Wel
fare's spacious office, they
broached the question.
"Would you mind trying on
this boot, John?" Tarnished
asked.
"You people from Leland Uni
versity slay me, Wally," Welfare
said as he nearly rolled on the
floor with laughter. "First you
ask me to be president, then you
try to sell me shoes."
"Don't misunderstand me,
John, we still want you for presi
dent, but before we can officially
ask you, you have to try on the
Golden Coolie Boot."
"The golden what?" Welfare
said, still rolling on the floor.
"I haven't heard anything this
funny since LBJ showed the
world his operating scar."

"Please try it on," Tarnished
asked again.
"Well, if it will make you
happy, Wally."
He took off his wingtips and
started to put on the boot.
It didn't fit.

During the next three months
in Washington, the powerful duo
from Leland University went
from office to office, begging
high administration officials to
try the boot on.
Secretary of War, Revolution
and Peace (in that order) Robert
S. McEdsel dicln't even get his
big toe inside the boot. J. Edgar
G-Man called it a Communist
plot. United Nations diplomat
Arthur Iceberg broke his foot
trying to fit into it.

In late 1970, Tarnished and
Truthman were still searching.
"Look, Wally, there was a pos
sibility that we might have
found a president in Washing
ton, in New York, in Boston,

Kansas City, even Reno, but
East Palo Alto? Leland Univer
sity has never had a president
from East Palo Alto," Truthman
said.
"Do you really expect to find
him here?"
"Oh, shut up," Tarnished mut
tered as he rang another door
bell.
A man came out and looked at
the ragged pair. "President Tar
nished," he exclaimed, "what are
you doing here?"
Tarnished and Truthman did
a double take at the tall figure
by the porch light. "It's David
Hairless," they both shouted.
Foam flecked their lips as they
tried to run away. But the best
they could do was to crash into
each other, knocking out both
of them.
Ex-student body president
Hairless walked over their bodies
and picked up the Golden Coolie
Boot. He easily slipped it on his
foot and sat there admiring it.
President Wallace J. Tarnish
ed was sitting down to his morn
ing glass of tomato juice with his
trusted aide and Provost, Rich
ard Truthman.
"Looks like another morning,
another glass of tomato juice,
Dickie-pooh," Tarnished smiled.
"It sure looks ..."
Truthman was interrupted by
a blinding flash of light.
"I"ve been interrupted by a
blinding flash of light," Truth
man complained.
In the middle of President Tar
nished's office stood a middle
aged woman. Her light brown
hair was piled on top of her
head in a bun. She wore a black
floor-length dress with a "Beat
Cal in '03" button on her skirt.
"It's Jane," Tarnished shouted.
"Hi, Wally, hi, Dick. Just
thought I'd drop in to remind
you the time has come to start
looking for a new president,"
Jane Stanford said.
She handed a golden boot to
Tarnished. It appeared to be a
size twelve, complete with four
inch spike on the toe.
"What I am supposed to do
with this, Jane?"
"It's the Golden Coolie Boot,
Wally, and when you find a
man who can wear it, you will
have found Stanford's next pres
ident. Senator Stanford wore
that same boot when he was
building the railroad," Mrs. Stan
ford added.
Then, as an afterthought,
"The spike on the toe got the
Southern Pacific built about two
years ahead of schedule. Really
made those coolies move," Jane
laughed. "So you take it and
find someone who can wear it."
She disappeared.
Tarnishecl's mouth hung open.
He closed it and swallowed hard.
"Gosharootie, Dick, that sounded
like a mandate. Let's get the
Golden Coolie Boot to Washing
ton immediately."
"You mean to see if John Wel
fare, Secretary of Health, Edu
cation, and Gardening, can wear
it?" Truthman queried.
Tarnished took a box of small
gold stars out of his desk and
pasted one on Truthman's fore
head. "Maybe you're smarter
than I thought. Let's go."
★ ★ ★
Tarnished slumbered as the
huge jet hurtled across the na
tion.
Truthman was awake, think
ing about an article in the Palo
Alto Times which claimed he
was the one who would become
president. '"Ihis may be my
only chance," he told himself.
He reached over and plucked
the Golden Coolie Boot from Tar
nished's lap. Taking off his own
shoe, he slyly started to put on
the boot.
It didn't fit.

"Hello, my name is Wallace

try the boot on.
Secretary of War, Revolution
and Peace (in that order) Robert
S. McEdsel dicln't even get his
big toe inside the boot. J. Edgar
G-Man called it a Communist
plot. United Nations diplomat
Arthur Iceberg broke his foot
trying to fit into it.

In late 1970, Tarnished and
Truthman were still searching.
"Look, Wally, there was a pos
sibility that we might have
found a president in Washing
ton, in New York, in Boston,

Kansas City, even Reno, but
East Palo Alto? Leland Univer
sity has never had a president
from East Palo Alto," Truthman
said.
"Do you really expect to find
him here?"
"Oh, shut up," Tarnished mut
tered as he rang another door
bell.
A man came out and looked at
the ragged pair. "President Tar
nished," he exclaimed, "what are
you doing here?"
Tarnished and Truthman did
a double take at the tall figure
by the porch light. "It's David
Hairless," they both shouted.
Foam flecked their lips as they
tried to run away. But the best
they could do was to crash into
each other, knocking out both
of them.
Ex-student body president
Hairless walked over their bodies
and picked up the Golden Coolie
Boot. He easily slipped it on his
foot and sat there admiring it.
