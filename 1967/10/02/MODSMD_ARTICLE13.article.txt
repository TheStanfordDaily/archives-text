# The 						Outpost
## Sequoia Union Black Students Demonstrate Their Discontent 
### Louis Knowles 
On Monday, September 18, the
lid blew off Menlo-Atherton High
School, the pride of the Sequoia
Union High School District that
serves southern San Mateo Coun
ty.
The 300 black students of M-A
decided to make themselves
heard after suffering for over
a year in the oppresive atmo
sphere of white-dominated halls
and classrooms. They had been
sent there last year against their
will after a change in zoning
took them out of Ravenswood
High School which is located
within the black community of
East Palo Alto. Forced to sud
denly confront the alien world
of rich whites, they had not be
come an integral part of the
student body, but had remained
outsiders to the vast majority
of white classmates.

The resentment the black
young people felt toward the
car-owning, college-bound whites
remained beneath the surface
last year although stories com
ing from the students indicated
all was not harmonious as the
public statements of Principal
Murray suggested.
This year upon the opening
of school the black students
found themselves deprived of
bus service and hot lunches.
These cutbacks were part of a
district-wide austerity policy
made necessary by the failure
at the polls of recent bond pro
posals.
Many students felt the effects
of the economy measures, but
whereas a white student usually
had access to a car and never
lacked for nourishing food the
average black student was forced

to walk over two miles to school
and back often without adequate
winter clothing, and was depriv
ed of an important supplement
to his home diet. These new
hardships added an • explosive
element to the black students'
discontent.
By Friday, September 15, lead
ers of the new Black Student
Union at Menlo-Atherton had
decided that the best way to ex
press their grievances was to
stop all bus service until theirs
was restored. The demands also
included the return of hot
lunches, more black administra
tors and teachers, and a course
in Black History.
That afternoon they success
fully stopped one bus loaded
with white students from leav
ing the grounds by linking arms
and surrounding it. The faculty
arranged car transportation for
the stranded students, and the
black youths returned to East
Palo Alto but not before a po
lice blockade had treated them
all as criminal suspects by stop
ping them and frisking them
without cause.
The Last Straw
On Monday school administra
tors met with East Palo Alto
citizens at the school to discuss
the lack of transportation. Sev
eral black students were invited
to attend the conference, but
then were not allowed to speak
This was the last • straw for
the frustrated young people.
There followed that morning an
outbreak of violence on the cam
pus that rocked the community
to its foundations. Fist fights
broke out in the halls between
black and white students. The
police were hastily called in by
the administration. Their pres
ence added to the tension. The
police left before lunch and fight
ing broke out anew as the black
students egged, on by the taunts
of whites, walked the halls, strik
ing out at people that got in
their way.
A few students were beaten
badly, over 50, both white and
black, received minor injuries.
But at last the issues were pub
lie, the school administration had
to face the race problem rather
than bury it under stacks of
benificient pronouncements of
peace and good will.
Hostage
The initial reaction of the
authorites was a typical defen
sive display of force. Police
flooded the campus, school was
suspended for two days, and two
black students were arrested on
charges of assault.
Of these, one, Karen Owens,
was singled out and held in cus
tody indefinitely as nothing less
than a political hostage. The
judge who handled her case pub
licly stated that she was being
held until things cooled off.
On the positive side the vio
lence led directly to a restora
tion of bus service and a further
consideration of other black de
mands.
The Black Student Union
found itself with a strong set
of issues around which it united
to form a powerful political fac
tor in all future confrontations.
Its strength was shown by the
school boycott by virtually all
black Menlo-Atherton students
for the remainder of that week.
The display of solidarity in
action gave white student lead
ers much to think about. Their
student government suddenly
looked like useless window dress
ing in comparison to the BSU
and its skill in organizing for
change.
If minority students could
speak out against administration
policies so vigorously, why
couldn't white students untie the
apron strings and start making
decisions for themseV.es? The
seeds of change may have been
sown at Menlo-Atherton High.
