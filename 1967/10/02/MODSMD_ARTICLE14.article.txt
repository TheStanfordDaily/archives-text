# Letters To The Editor
## Bunnies In The Wilburness 
### 
Editor, The Daily;
A new policy has been insti
tuted by the Wilbur Hall food
service which merits the atten
tion of The Daily and of the gen
eral Stanford community.
The management, evidently
feeling that enough hands are
available to exulcerate the food,
has devoted the time of several
female hashers to the serving
of coffee. The attire in which
these young ladies present them
selves has aroused the interest
of many non-coffee-drinkers. The
problem is caused by skirt
length.
Perhaps the assignment of
short-skirted hashers to table
service is a deliberate action by
the food service to distract the
freshmen from the shortcom
ings of the meals. If so, the
strategem is working well. How
ever, the tactic may have delete
rious side effects.
If the distraction of male
freshmen continues at the pres
ent rate, the amount of spillage
in the table areas is bound to
soar. The lost food and bever
ages will certainly not be missed
(one is tempted to mutter, "Good
riddance"), but the clothes and
personal belongings of the diners
may bear the stains for months.
Other harms will also ensue:
enlightening conversation will
degenerate to exchanges more
appropriate to the locker-room.
The increased amount of coffee
consumed will cause widespread
insomnia. The turnover of seat
ing at mealtimes will grind to
a halt, and the crowding will be
aggravated by the throngs of
Branner and Stern men who
have come over to see the show.
Radical action is necessary to
meet this situation. Either
lengthen the hashers' skirts, or
provide them with bunny-rabbit
ears and cottontails. Wilbur Hall
men need either a return to nor
malcy or an end to pretense.

â€¢ Defining Deferment
Editor, The Daily;
Michael Sweeney's two ar
ticles concerning the current
draft laws discuss the criteria
for military deferment. Such ar
ticles avoid the central problem
for students: the meaning of
the draft deferment itself.
The draft is set up to supply
men for use by the military.
Deferments are granted only
when it is in the best interests
of the military to do so.
As an obvious example, engi
neers and chemists are rarely

bothered by local draft boards
since it is clear that technical
degrees are needed by the mili
tary to make bombs, missiles,
and napalm.
A second example is that the
deferment system is a straight
forward way for the military
to "buy off" political opposition
to the draft. Real opposition can
only come from well financed
quarters. Since the children of
middle or upper class families
can usually go to some college
or university where they can
make "satisfactory progress,"
the offering of deferments to
these students is a very effec
tive method of buying off their
parents' support of the draft op
position. If the reader does not
think many such parents are
potential opposition to the draft,
consider what would happen if
all deferments were abolished
and all of Stanford's male stu
dents were drafted and sent to
Vietnam.
By applying for a deferment,
each of us tacitly accepts as
valid the obligation to service in
uniform. On a personal level,
when we ask to be deferred, it
is obvious that we ask others to
be drafted in our place. Since
service in Vietnam, for example,
may result in the loss of one's
own life or the taking of an
other's, it is clear that we ask
an incredible favor of others.
In view of the arguments
above, it appears to us that the
central problem is not the cri
teria for deferment, but is the
meaning of the draft deferment
itself. The only consistent
courses of action seem to be:
(a) Acceptance of the defer
ment, and thus the draft sys
tem. This acceptance implies
tacit support of the military pres
ence in Vietnam, since even if
one says"I don't like the war,
but if drafted, I will serve," it
is evident that the action of go
ing speaks louder than the words
of disapproval.
(b) Rejection of the defer
ment system (each man should
have an equal chance to die),
but accepting the draft and thus
again accepting the military
presence in Vietnam.
(c) Rejection of the entire
draft system including defer
ments and thus rejection of the
concept of obligatory military
service with the possible con
sequence of going to jail for re
fusing to serve when drafted.
The uncomfortable conclusion
is that many of us are In a very
illogical position; the deferment
has "bought" us.
