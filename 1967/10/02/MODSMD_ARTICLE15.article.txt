# The 						Death Of Independent Housing
## 
### ROBERT FUNK 
Stanford University has inaug
urated four demonstration
houses, in which the classroom
lion, a long neglected and rather
dusty beast, will at last lie down
with the frivolous social lamb.
In fact, it is anticipated that the
lion and lamb will become inte
grated (in some pleasant, non
carnivorous way) so that it is no
longer possible to distinguish
one from the other.
These four experiments (they
are not really experiments of the
usual measurable sort, and per
haps that is why they are now
called "demonstrations;" "hap
penings" would have been a good
word, too) should fill the Stan
ford air with the catnip scent of
educational innovation, and bring
us into the field of in-house edu
cation now prominently occupied
by Michigan State University,
the University of the Pacific,
Stephens College, and the Uni
versity of California at Santa
Cruz. It is only too easy to sneer
at educational innovations, as I
may seem to be doing, and I have
an intuitive feeling that the
demonstration houses will per
form some good function at Stan
ford. I am not sure that anyone
has a very precise idea of the na
ture of this good function, how
ever, and it may be that in our
ardor for creating these houses
we have inadvertently done
away with another good demon
stration or experiment—the in
dependent houses at Stern Hall.
I am writing this series of ar
ticles to mark the demise, or at
least the critical illness, of the
house system as it has existed
in Stern until this year. This was
an independent housing system,
of course, but perhaps its most
important and attractive attrib
ute was the mixture of approxi
mately equal numbers of fresh
men, sophomores, juniors, and
seniors in each of the eight
houses. This mixture has been
radically altered this year
through a great increase in fresh
man residents, and the change

has reduced at least four Stern
houses to reluctant imitations of
Wilbur, with a little upper class
gloss added.
The death of the independent
four-class system was not pre
meditated. It resulted instead
from the reshuffling of students
in which Stanford has either
ended or drastically changed the
traditions of eight Stern houses
(and, it seems, Durand) in order
to make way for four demonstra
tion houses.
The establishment of demon
stration houses in Stern and Wil
bur has brought additional stu
dents (including women) into
men's residences, and the num
ber of freshman men going into
Branner does not offset this in
crease. This quarter it has been
necessary to fill nearly every
Stern vacancy with a freshman,
and for the first time a substan
tial number of last year's Wilbur
freshmen who elected to become
this year's Stern sophomores
have been turned away.
'Old Line Houses'
The only sophomores living in
the six remaining "old line" in
dependent houses this fall are
last year's Stern freshmen. Wil
bur freshmen have either
pledged, moved off campus, or
been assigned to the all- sopho
more house at Durand. The al
ternative of living in one of the
four-class independent houses
has been foreclosed.
Small loss, perhaps. Stern is
notorious as a roost for turkeys,
and was ready for some aca
demic form of urban renewal.
And no matter what despised
ruin the University administra
tion proposes to pull down or
improve, a band of hitherto un
declared zealots will emerge to
insist at great length that this
particular condemned property
was the very ethos of the intel
lectual community, and so on.
The history of the Stern houses
is not really a Golden Age of
university residences, but I
think the value and potential
of these houses in a residential

university are great enough to
demand reconsideration of poli
cies which in effect weaken or
destroy the independent houses
in an attempt to launch innova
tions which may not have equal
value.
The "residential" aspect of the
residential college has had many
different values set on it, rang
ing from the rather obvious cir
cumstance that dormitories are
close to classrooms to the more
elevated (and recently repeated
ly disproved) premise that the
college can control the sexual
and drinking behavior of stu
dents who live in dormitories as
effectively as it can prescribe
squash soufflle for lunch on al
ternating Wednesdays.
Something Apart
There is one real and intel
lectually defensible attribute of
campus residences, however.
Whether or not it achieves this
purpose, a college education is
supposed to be something above
and apart from everything that
has gone before. During their
elementary and secondary years
most students have been held in
the thrall of their parents of
their more or less homogeneous
peers, and it is only when they go
to college that they discover for
the first time large slices of hu
manity they had not been ac
quainted with previously.
Not all colleges effect this
break between a student's past
and his present. The urban com
muter colleges certainly do not,
in many cases: students may go
home each evening to the same
parental quizzing they've known
since the first day at kinder
garten. At a university such as
Stanford, however, the son of
the president of the board may
room at Wilbur with a student
whose bank balance is simply a
patchwork of various scholar
ships.
This extending and thinning
of the cord that connects a
freshman with parents, high
school, and established sets for
looking at the world is not an

end in itself. I don't think we
cut people's moorings simply
for the purpose of watching
them toss and perhaps eventual
ly sink; and although the idea
of Wealth and Poverty rooming
together has grand egalitarian
overtones, it may be wasted on
freshmen who are not ac
quainted with Horatio Alger.
But a university opens new
areas of knowledge and new
styles of thinking which can
best be received by a mind
which is open and at some re
move from old habits and preju
dices. Quite probably a student's
mind does not remain open and
receptive long if he immediately
finds himself in the company of
other students whose opinions
and experience closely approxi
mate his own. On superficial
examination the residential cam
pus seems to overcome this
problem and to place a great
diversity of personalities and
abilities in close proximity. Few
colleges actually do this, how
ever, since even within the rela
tively small area of a campus
it is possible to establish non
communicating age groups and
social groups.
Wilbur Hall has been an ex
ample of an isolated age group,
and the arguments for main
taining Wilbur as a ghetto for
freshman men include these:
the freshman year will be less
traumatic if '-veryone in the
house shares the same problems
of adjustment to academic and
social life at the University; it
is important for all of the mem
mers of the class of 1971 to get
to know one another, since this
will engender class spirit; and
if all men live together as fresh
men, first-year friendships will
continue even when the house
is scattered to fraternities, up
porclass dormitories, and var
ious points off campus—thus
providing communication be
tween these occasionally iso
lated segments of the commun
ity.
The anti-ghetto argument is
more persuasive and seems to
have won the day, since we are
beginning to desegregate fresh
men. It takes this line: high
school students come to Stan
ford expecting to meet all sorts
of interesting p> ople—not just
members of last year's senior
class; the gross effect of ninety
houesmates all taking Western
Civilization and Freshman En
glish is numbing and debilitat
ing; finally, the freshman year
at Wilbur represents a long
simmer in one's own late ado
lescent juices, and an unneces
sary quarantine period preced
ing entry into the university.
Restricted Groups
I don't argue that a student
should be heterogenized with
the aid of a computer and kept
from speaking to anyone re
motely like himself during four
years of college. Most people
need someone rather like them
selves with whom to relax and
exchange views about the short
comings of everyone else. But
sizable groups of stud-nts alike
in age, academic programs, and
social interests—whether they
occur in Wilbur, in fraternities,
or off campus—seem inimical
to the openness and inquiry
which supposedly characterize
higher education. Before a stu
dent comes to the university and
again after he leaves he has the

choice of restricting his society
to persons whose backgrounds
and prejudices are similar to his
own. If the university provides
(or indeed requires, as seems to
be the case during the freshman
year) similarly restricted social
and intellectual groups the new
messages of high culture will
fall on unreceptive ears.
It is here that the independ
ent houses in Stern can make
their claim as organizations fur
thering the purposes of the uni
versity. They are open, non-selec
tive, and attract a great variety
of students from all four classes.
The houses are sufficiently co
hesive to permit the formation
of small groups of friends, and
yet every resident is bound to
have daily communications with
students quite unlike himself.
If judgments are to be sus
pended and perspectives
stretched in any campus resi
dence, it is likely to occur here.
'DeWilburized'
No decision has been made to
"deWilburize" Stanford by dis
banding all of the freshman
houses, however, and probably
no decision for or against such
a plan can be made until the
Study of Education at Stanford
has had more time to consider
student residential arrange
ments. Tradition and subjective
evaluations obscure the argu
ment, but it seems to me that
the merits of four-class houses
far outweigh those of segre
gated freshman residences, and
that the freshman house plan
should be abandoned.
Disestablishing freshman
houses will present serious prob
lems, however, if the goal is to
create new houses with mem
bers from all four classes. If
the fraternities and eating clubs
are left out of such an arrange
ment, there are simply not
enough upper class men on cam
pus to provide any more than
a small disgruntled minority in
what will be essentially fresh
man houses. To mix Stern and
Wilbur—a solution that has
been approached this year by
increasing the number of fresh
men in six Stern houses—does
not create new four-class
houses. Without more upper
classmen, such a mixture would
simply extend the old Wilbur
system and at the same time
destroy the Stern houses.
Stanford University has spent
a considerable amount of time,
energy, and money in attempt
ing to develop a house system at
Stern Hall. The system which
has developed has been low-key,
under-publicized, and appropri
ately modest. I doubt that the
University at large has realized
how successful this experiment
has been. Perhaps the absence
of glitter on Stern Hall has led
to the devaluation of the inde
pendent houses and to the dis
ruption of the four-class system
that has provided Stanford's
closest approach to intellectu
ally viable student residences.
