# Letters To The Editor
## ROTC 'Football Scholars' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of Wednesday, Mr.
Grissom rightly publicized the
technique of ROTC advertising
in using the metaphor of the foot
ball player to convey the "un
palatable message" of what it is
to be a soldier.
I would suggest that the meta
phor goes even farther. Reading
on in General Harold K. John
son's advertisement (repeated on
Wednesday) it appears that the
ROTC is to offer a new scholar
ship program in an attempt to
recruit more quarterbacks, i.e..
Second Lieutenant: they will
pay for tuition, books, lab fees
and $50 a month for two or four
years.
Many Universities have ques
tioned the policy of "athletic
scholarships", which support the
true budding quarterback, on the
grounds that such activities arc
neither the concern nor in the
best interests of what they would
like to see as an essentially aca
demic community. It seems
strange that the ROTC is al
lowed, apparently without ques
tion by this academic communi
ty. to offer similar support for
its future quarterbacks.
Often enough one hears of the
disparagement of the underprad
uate athlete who sells his .soul t<>
the squad, but rarely of the mar
who sells his soul to the Army.
What does this academic commu
nity think of the ROTC on its
campus and what of the quarter
backs who sign on while still
Stanford students?
It seems that the ROTC has the
right to recruit for members on
campus just like any other cam
pus organization, though they
seem to have a privileged posi
tion in that they can offer finan
cial inducements to their mem
bers. One would wish, along with
Mr. Grissom. that they used
more honest means.
Is this the aim of Stanford Uni
versity education to produce men
who will seek out a career in
which unhesitatingly and un
questionably they will go against
the most fundamental precepts
of their upbringing? I thought
the University existed for the
education to a proper sensibility
of the human condition, to pro

duce men who do not accept old
ideas without questioning them,
to produce men of character with
the wit to see where they must
disagree with the accepted ideas,
and the guts to try to do some
thing about it.
Clearly the ROTC does not pro
duce such men. Does the Athletic
Community? Is it really "mens
sana in corpore sano'?
I quote from "Old Oregon",
the alumnus magazine of Ore
gon, which interviewed ex-ath
letes on their retrospective feel
ings about their days on the
Team. (I was interested as one
who enjoyed about twenty years
of playing most of the usual
sports, fortunately, without any
one breathing "win, win, win"
down my neck). Most of these
men appeared to have entered
the business world. Most of the
military quarterbacks were un
available for the interview; per
haps some had already been
killed.
All the survivors were enthu
siastic: the love of competition
was almost orgasmic. But the
jewel was the rising executive
who said "it taught me to com
pete, which is the most important
thing in the world so far as I can
see." What saddened me here
was not that he was utterly won

over to competition but that this
was as far as he could see.
Just how far the competitive
feeling goes can be seen from the
performance not only of rising
executives but also the Army. To
have a standing Army is an un
fortunate necessity of modem
life. However, they should be re
quired to fight only when this
country is directly threatened.
The present engagement in Viet
nam is not such a case, as is now
being admitted by Representa
tives, Senators, and Presidential
Committees but not, unfortunate
ly, the President. So what's going
on in Vietnam? Why, it's the "In
ternational Football Match."
(One general complained that the
VC fight a "Dirty" war: what did
they do General; trip you up?)
So it's "come on team we've
got to win" keep your eye on the
score, the deaths, the kill-ratio,
the cost. Keep ahead and wait for
the great International Umpire
to blow the final whistle. It will
be a long wait.
I suggest both the Athletic
Squad and the ROTC be put in
quarantine, until they have
proved their good intentions.

Wednesday) it appears that the
ROTC is to offer a new scholar
ship program in an attempt to
recruit more quarterbacks, i.e..
Second Lieutenant: they will
pay for tuition, books, lab fees
and $50 a month for two or four
years.
Many Universities have ques
tioned the policy of "athletic
scholarships", which support the
true budding quarterback, on the
grounds that such activities arc
neither the concern nor in the
best interests of what they would
like to see as an essentially aca
demic community. It seems
strange that the ROTC is al
lowed, apparently without ques
tion by this academic communi
ty. to offer similar support for
its future quarterbacks.
Often enough one hears of the
disparagement of the underprad
uate athlete who sells his .soul t<>
the squad, but rarely of the mar
who sells his soul to the Army.
What does this academic commu
nity think of the ROTC on its
campus and what of the quarter
backs who sign on while still
Stanford students?
It seems that the ROTC has the
right to recruit for members on
campus just like any other cam
pus organization, though they
seem to have a privileged posi
tion in that they can offer finan
cial inducements to their mem
bers. One would wish, along with
Mr. Grissom. that they used
more honest means.
Is this the aim of Stanford Uni
versity education to produce men
who will seek out a career in
which unhesitatingly and un
questionably they will go against
the most fundamental precepts
of their upbringing? I thought
the University existed for the
education to a proper sensibility
of the human condition, to pro

duce men who do not accept old
ideas without questioning them,
to produce men of character with
the wit to see where they must
disagree with the accepted ideas,
and the guts to try to do some
thing about it.
Clearly the ROTC does not pro
duce such men. Does the Athletic
Community? Is it really "mens
sana in corpore sano'?
I quote from "Old Oregon",
the alumnus magazine of Ore
gon, which interviewed ex-ath
letes on their retrospective feel
ings about their days on the
Team. (I was interested as one
who enjoyed about twenty years
of playing most of the usual
sports, fortunately, without any
one breathing "win, win, win"
down my neck). Most of these
men appeared to have entered
the business world. Most of the
military quarterbacks were un
available for the interview; per
haps some had already been
killed.
All the survivors were enthu
siastic: the love of competition
was almost orgasmic. But the
jewel was the rising executive
who said "it taught me to com
pete, which is the most important
thing in the world so far as I can
see." What saddened me here
was not that he was utterly won

over to competition but that this
was as far as he could see.
Just how far the competitive
feeling goes can be seen from the
performance not only of rising
executives but also the Army. To
have a standing Army is an un
fortunate necessity of modem
life. However, they should be re
quired to fight only when this
country is directly threatened.
The present engagement in Viet
nam is not such a case, as is now
being admitted by Representa
tives, Senators, and Presidential
Committees but not, unfortunate
ly, the President. So what's going
on in Vietnam? Why, it's the "In
ternational Football Match."
(One general complained that the
VC fight a "Dirty" war: what did
they do General; trip you up?)
So it's "come on team we've
got to win" keep your eye on the
score, the deaths, the kill-ratio,
the cost. Keep ahead and wait for
the great International Umpire
to blow the final whistle. It will
be a long wait.
I suggest both the Athletic
Squad and the ROTC be put in
quarantine, until they have
proved their good intentions.

neither the concern nor in the
best interests of what they would
like to see as an essentially aca
demic community. It seems
strange that the ROTC is al
lowed, apparently without ques
tion by this academic communi
ty. to offer similar support for
its future quarterbacks.
Often enough one hears of the
disparagement of the underprad

the squad, but rarely of the mar
who sells his soul to the Army.
What does this academic commu

Stanford students?
It seems that the ROTC has the
right to recruit for members on
campus just like any other cam

seem to have a privileged posi

Mr. Grissom. that they used
more honest means.
Is this the aim of Stanford Uni
versity education to produce men
who will seek out a career in
which unhesitatingly and un

the most fundamental precepts
of their upbringing? I thought
the University existed for the
education to a proper sensibility
of the human condition, to pro

duce men who do not accept old
ideas without questioning them,
to produce men of character with
the wit to see where they must
disagree with the accepted ideas,
and the guts to try to do some
thing about it.
Clearly the ROTC does not pro
duce such men. Does the Athletic
Community? Is it really "mens
sana in corpore sano'?
I quote from "Old Oregon",
the alumnus magazine of Ore
gon, which interviewed ex-ath
letes on their retrospective feel
ings about their days on the
Team. (I was interested as one
who enjoyed about twenty years
of playing most of the usual
sports, fortunately, without any
one breathing "win, win, win"
down my neck). Most of these
men appeared to have entered
the business world. Most of the
military quarterbacks were un
available for the interview; per
haps some had already been
killed.
All the survivors were enthu
siastic: the love of competition
was almost orgasmic. But the
jewel was the rising executive
who said "it taught me to com
pete, which is the most important
thing in the world so far as I can
see." What saddened me here
was not that he was utterly won

over to competition but that this
was as far as he could see.
Just how far the competitive
feeling goes can be seen from the
performance not only of rising
executives but also the Army. To
have a standing Army is an un
fortunate necessity of modem
life. However, they should be re
quired to fight only when this
country is directly threatened.
The present engagement in Viet
nam is not such a case, as is now
being admitted by Representa
tives, Senators, and Presidential
Committees but not, unfortunate
ly, the President. So what's going
on in Vietnam? Why, it's the "In
ternational Football Match."
(One general complained that the
VC fight a "Dirty" war: what did
they do General; trip you up?)
So it's "come on team we've
got to win" keep your eye on the
score, the deaths, the kill-ratio,
the cost. Keep ahead and wait for
the great International Umpire
to blow the final whistle. It will
be a long wait.
I suggest both the Athletic
Squad and the ROTC be put in
quarantine, until they have
proved their good intentions.

Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of Wednesday, Mr.
Grissom rightly publicized the
technique of ROTC advertising
in using the metaphor of the foot
ball player to convey the "un
palatable message" of what it is
to be a soldier.
I would suggest that the meta
phor goes even farther. Reading
on in General Harold K. John
son's advertisement (repeated on
Wednesday) it appears that the
ROTC is to offer a new scholar
ship program in an attempt to
recruit more quarterbacks, i.e..
Second Lieutenant: they will
pay for tuition, books, lab fees
and $50 a month for two or four
years.
Many Universities have ques
tioned the policy of "athletic
scholarships", which support the
true budding quarterback, on the
grounds that such activities arc
neither the concern nor in the
best interests of what they would
like to see as an essentially aca
demic community. It seems
strange that the ROTC is al
lowed, apparently without ques

ty. to offer similar support for
