# New Court Decisions Support Student Right
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” Three recent Federal
court decisions may have far
reaching significance in guaran
teeing due process and academic
freedom for students on college
and university campuses.
In all three cases, the court or
dered students who had been ex
pelled from their schools read
mitted, upholding the rights of
students to freedom of expres
sion and prohibiting administra
tors from expelling students
without specifying charges and
holding a hearing.
The decisions, made in Mont
gomery, Ala., Washington, D.C.,
and Columbia, S.C., are not con
sidered landmark because other
judges have issued similar rul
ings in recent years. However,
the decisions are expected to give
a significant boost to efforts at
colleges and universities across
the country to establish academic
freedom and due process for stu
dents. The number of institutions
of higher learning with liberal
student judicial codes is steadily
increasing though small.
Freedom of Expression
In Montgomery Federal Dis
trict Judge Frank Johnson, Jr.
ruled that "a state cannot force
a college student to forfeit his
constitutionally protected right
of freedom of expression as a
condition to his attending a state
supported institution." He was
upholding the right of the Troy
State College student editor to
express his opinions in an edito
rial supporting academic free
dom.
In Washington, D.C., the U.S.
Court of Appeals ordered four
students ousted by Howard Uni
versity after black power demon
strations on the campus to be re

instated, overturning a decision
by U.S. District Court Judge
Alexander Holtzoff who refused
to order reinstatement of the stu
dents. The students had asked
the court to determine whether
Howard had the right to expel
them without charges and a hear
ing.
The court also recommended
that Howard consider granting
five ousted faculty members a
hearing which resulted in
Howard asking the nine-member
Appeals Court to reconsider the
case "because of the grave and
far-reaching importance involved
in the right of a private univer
sity to manage its internal af
fairs."
At South Carolina State Col
lege in Orangeburg, S.C., Fed
eral District Judge Robert W.
Hemphill ruled that three stu
dents were suspended unlawfully
by the faculty discipline commit
tee after they had led protest
demonstrations on the campus.
The court order said a college
rule restricting demonstrations
places "a prior restraint on the
right to freedom of speech and
the right to assemble."
