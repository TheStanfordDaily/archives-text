### BILL RORABAUGH 
Buckminster Fuller, mathema
tician, writer, and inventor of
the geodesic dome, will give
the keynote address at tomor
row's inauguration of Century
21, a new campus program ex
ploring "the questions facing
mankind in the last third of the
twentieth century."
C. S. Wallia, ser or colloquium
instructor and director of Cen
tury 21, has scheduled a meet
ing today in TMU Room 270 at
4:15 p.m. for students interested
in administering the year-long
program.
The university-financed pro
ject will be built around a series

of weekly lectures, but will also
offer seminars and panel dis
cussions as an integral part of
the program.
Professor Fuller, from the
University of Southern Illinois
will speak on "Human Values
in Technological Society" to be
gin the series.
The Bechtel International Cen
ter and Grove, Otero, and Soto
Houses have made plans for
seminars in conjunction with
Century 21. Wallia urges resi
dence groups to make arrange
ments for housing the speakers
to provide more contact between
letcurer and student.
The program has been divided

into three areas. Autumn quar
ter lecturers will center on in
ternational concerns. Winter
Quarter speakers will discuss
biological and psychological phe
nomena, and spring quarter
guests will talk about technol
ogy in society.
Wallia comments, "Often only
lip service is paid to the inter
disciplinary approach. I bolieve
that Century 21 will encourage
communication among persons
with diverse academic allegi
ances."
Wallia says, "Advance in tech
nology in the last fifty years has
been greater than in the pre
vious five thousand." Fuller, the
first speaker, will accent this
theme by speaking of the "ac
celerating-acceleration of
change."
Century 21 has recieved $18,-
000 from the University to pay
lecturers, and more money is
expected later in the year. Plans
are being made to publish the
proceedings next summer.
In addition to Buckminster
Fuller, the speakers for autumn
quarter will include author
Lancelot L. Whyte discussing
speculation on the future, Har
vard law professor Louis B.
Sohn on international law,
urban specialist W. H. Ferry on
the social impact of urbaniza
tion, Colorado behavioral scien
tist Kenneth Boulding on the
developing nations, and Santa
Barbara biologist Garrett Har
din on man's fate.
Stanford professors will also
participate. Biology professor
Paul R. Ehrlich will discuss
food and population. Political
Science professor Robert C.
North will talk on the interna
tional political system. Com
munication professor William
L. Rivers will speak on the im
pact of mass media on the indi
