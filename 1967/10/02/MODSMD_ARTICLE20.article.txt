For the first time a comprehen
sive look at the science of achiev
ing maximum gain or minimum
loss is available to readers in
Foundations of Optimization, by
Stanford professor of Chemical
Engineering Douglass J. Wilde
and Professor Charles S. Beight
ler of the University of Texas.
Called the "optimization theo
ry," it only recently has been rec
ognized as a field of knowledge
in itself. It is used widely in
many industries and is of great
practical interest to engineers,
economists, administrators and
