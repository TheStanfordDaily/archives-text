# Fee Hike Protest In Montreal
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” The student body
president of the University of
Montreal may have found a way
for students to effectively protest
tuition increases.
John Dore, University of Mon
treal student body president, sent
a letter to the university's 17,000
students asking them to ignore a
$30 increase in fees and send the
university the old tuition "in
trust."
Dore hopes that withholding
the increase may get the univer
sity to reconsider it. He estimates
that 4,000 students must co-oper
ate to make the plan work and
says he has half that now.
University officials say the full
tuition must be paid before stu
dents are allowed to register,
however. Dore responds that stu
dents do not need to fear repri
sals if they present a common
front to the university.
