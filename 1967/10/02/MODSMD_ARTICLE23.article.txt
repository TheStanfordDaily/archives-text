# Foothill Dress Vote Is Test Of Student Power
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Foothill Junior College stu
dents will vote today on whether
they feel the administration or
the student government should
control the college's controvers
ial dress code.
The poll will be part of a stu
dent government election, and
will not be binding, but merely
an expression of opinion. Stu
dent leaders will then be able to
use the results in negotiating
with the administration.

"I'm sure the vote will bring
the code back to the students,"
student body President Jon Buck
ley stated last week, however.
Also part of today's voting will
be a poll on the Vietnam war,
with the students expressing
their opinion on whether there
should be an "immediate cessa
tion of bombing of both North
and South Vietnam, immediate
negotiations with all parties con
cerned, and a phased withdrawal
of all American troops."
At present the code prescribes
"street length dresses or skirts
and sweaters or blouses" for wo
men, with "skating skirts, short
kilts, shorts, slacks, and other
beach or active sports attire"
prohibited.
Rules For Men
For men, "full length trousers
and shirts or sweaters" are re
quired, while the regulations bar
"bermudas, shorts, and other
beach or active sports attire."
Both sexes must wear "regu
lar street shoes ... in all classes
and on campus." Socks are also
de rigeur for men, according to
the code.
The code is strictly enforced.
Yesterday, for example, one
sockless male student was asked
to leave the campus, and was told
not to come back to school unless
he was properly attired, accord
ing to bystanders.
Foothill's student government
had control of the dress code un
til 1964, but relinquished it to
school officials when attempts to
alter it were met by administra
tion opposition.
Dress Code's Purpose
The purpose of the dress code,
according to the "Code of Per
sonal Conduct at Foothill Col
lege", is to "set up an established
pattern which would encourage
all students to dress in a manner
keeping with the serious aca
demic intent of the College and
acceptable to the communities
which the College serves."


PALO ALTO AND nfANFORD each have one wing of the hospital and share a central "core area."
The actual area leased to the city of Palo Alto is shaded. The Medical School is located in the wings
of the building to the right of the entrance.

the student government should
control the college's controvers
ial dress code.
The poll will be part of a stu
dent government election, and
will not be binding, but merely
an expression of opinion. Stu
dent leaders will then be able to
use the results in negotiating
with the administration.

"I'm sure the vote will bring
the code back to the students,"
student body President Jon Buck
ley stated last week, however.
Also part of today's voting will
be a poll on the Vietnam war,
with the students expressing
their opinion on whether there
should be an "immediate cessa
tion of bombing of both North
and South Vietnam, immediate
negotiations with all parties con
cerned, and a phased withdrawal
of all American troops."
At present the code prescribes
"street length dresses or skirts
and sweaters or blouses" for wo
men, with "skating skirts, short
kilts, shorts, slacks, and other
beach or active sports attire"
prohibited.
Rules For Men
For men, "full length trousers
and shirts or sweaters" are re
quired, while the regulations bar
"bermudas, shorts, and other
beach or active sports attire."
Both sexes must wear "regu
lar street shoes ... in all classes
and on campus." Socks are also
de rigeur for men, according to
the code.
The code is strictly enforced.
Yesterday, for example, one
sockless male student was asked
to leave the campus, and was told
not to come back to school unless
he was properly attired, accord
ing to bystanders.
Foothill's student government
had control of the dress code un
til 1964, but relinquished it to
school officials when attempts to
alter it were met by administra
tion opposition.
Dress Code's Purpose
The purpose of the dress code,
according to the "Code of Per
sonal Conduct at Foothill Col
lege", is to "set up an established
pattern which would encourage
all students to dress in a manner
keeping with the serious aca
demic intent of the College and
acceptable to the communities
which the College serves."


PALO ALTO AND nfANFORD each have one wing of the hospital and share a central "core area."
The actual area leased to the city of Palo Alto is shaded. The Medical School is located in the wings
of the building to the right of the entrance.
