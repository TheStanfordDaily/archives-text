# Warning! Don't Forfeit
## Intramurals Meet Strong Revision 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
Stanford's spirited intramural
program gets under way this
week with a new director and a
drastically revised rulebook.
Dutch Fehring, the Indians'
varsity baseball coach for many
years, has taken over this year
as Director of Intramurals and
is responsible for making much
needed changes in the intra
mural program.
Evidence of his efforts appears
today with the release of a
brand-new Intramural Hand
book.
New Handbook
This year's handbook does
not list the names of members
of all championship and run
ner-up teams, but instead goes
in to much more detail about
such problems as the point sys
tem, eligibility, and affiliation.
Organization of the intramu
ral program is given new em
phasis in this year's handbook.
Subordinate to the Intramural
Director are an Intramural Ad
visory Committee and a group
of Intramural Managers Repre
sentatives.
Advisory Council
The former is composed of
Chuck Taylor, Director of Phy
sical Education, and the varsity
coach of whatever sport is the
focus of attention.
The latter will be made up of
five members, representing the
interests of fraternities, dormi
tories, eating clubs, indepen
dents, and graduate students.
Both committees will serve in
an advisory capacity to Director
Fehring.

The intramural point system
has been revised this year. An
equation, based on the number
of participants in a particular
sport and the type of competi
tion involved, has been devised,
based on a maximum of 100
points for touch football, the
most popular intramural sport.
Elimination tournaments will
have a maximum value of 35
points to the champion, and
points for sports such as golf
and cross-country will also be
determined by the number of
individual participants.
New Eligibility
In the area of eligibility, the
handbook states definitely that
any intercollegiate athlete choos
ing to participate in the intra
mural program must have the
approval of his coach, in writing.
Anyone having received a var
sity letter at Stanford or any
other four-year institution will
not be eligible to compete in an
intramural sport related to one
in which he won the award.
Transfers who won letters in
junior college will have to sit
out a year of ineligibility in the
related intramural sport.
Members of the newly defined
club teams will be considered
the same as varsity competitors
if their sport competes on an
intercollegiate level.
Erases Problems
The new handbook also clears
up a few vague problems of the
past. Graduate students must be
formally affiliated or at least
paying social dues and rooming
in or taking meals with an or
ganization.

They may compete with either
their living group or their gradu
ate school affiliation, not both.
All halls or wings in Stanford
Village may field intramural
teams, and students with no
campus unit affiliation may form
teams with the approval of the
Intramural Director.
Warning: Don't Forfeit
Regulations concerning for
feits and protests have been
strengthened. Any team playing
an ineligible man automatically
forfeits all previous games, and
will be withdrawn from further

competition in the sport concern
ed.
The penalty for forfeiting a
first-round match is the loss of
ten intramural points for the
living unit involved.
After playing at least one
match in a given sport, a for
feiting team would lose all in
tramural points gained thus far
in that sport.
Why? Forfeits Hurt
In league play, one forfeit
means a team cannot compete
in the finals for the sport, as well
as losing all intramural points
for that sport.

Two forfeits in the same sport
disqualify a team, while three
forfeits for the same unit, not
necessarily in the same sport,
results in the loss of all intra
mural points for all sports dur
ing the current quarter.
Ungentlemanly?
Protest will have to be given
verbally, to the Intramural Di
rector, within 24 hours of the
start of the protested game.
Gentlemen's agreements be
ween teams will not be support
ed by the Intramural ofhce when
they are at variance with intra
mural rules.

Stanford's spirited intramural
program gets under way this
week with a new director and a
drastically revised rulebook.
Dutch Fehring, the Indians'
varsity baseball coach for many
years, has taken over this year
as Director of Intramurals and
is responsible for making much
needed changes in the intra
mural program.
Evidence of his efforts appears
today with the release of a
brand-new Intramural Hand

New Handbook
This year's handbook does
not list the names of members
of all championship and run
ner-up teams, but instead goes
in to much more detail about
such problems as the point sys

Organization of the intramu
ral program is given new em

Subordinate to the Intramural
Director are an Intramural Ad

Advisory Council
The former is composed of
Chuck Taylor, Director of Phy

coach of whatever sport is the
focus of attention.
The latter will be made up of
five members, representing the
interests of fraternities, dormi
tories, eating clubs, indepen
dents, and graduate students.
Both committees will serve in
an advisory capacity to Director
Fehring.

The intramural point system
has been revised this year. An
equation, based on the number
of participants in a particular
sport and the type of competi
tion involved, has been devised,
based on a maximum of 100
points for touch football, the
most popular intramural sport.
Elimination tournaments will
have a maximum value of 35
points to the champion, and
points for sports such as golf
and cross-country will also be
determined by the number of
individual participants.

Stanford's spirited intramural
program gets under way this
week with a new director and a
drastically revised rulebook.
Dutch Fehring, the Indians'
varsity baseball coach for many
years, has taken over this year
as Director of Intramurals and
is responsible for making much
needed changes in the intra
mural program.
Evidence of his efforts appears
today with the release of a
brand-new Intramural Hand
book.
New Handbook
This year's handbook does
not list the names of members
of all championship and run
ner-up teams, but instead goes
in to much more detail about
such problems as the point sys
tem, eligibility, and affiliation.
Organization of the intramu
ral program is given new em
phasis in this year's handbook.
Subordinate to the Intramural
Director are an Intramural Ad
visory Committee and a group
of Intramural Managers Repre
sentatives.
Advisory Council
The former is composed of
Chuck Taylor, Director of Phy
sical Education, and the varsity
coach of whatever sport is the
focus of attention.
The latter will be made up of
five members, representing the
interests of fraternities, dormi
tories, eating clubs, indepen
dents, and graduate students.
Both committees will serve in
an advisory capacity to Director
Fehring.

The intramural point system
has been revised this year. An
equation, based on the number
of participants in a particular
sport and the type of competi
tion involved, has been devised,
based on a maximum of 100
points for touch football, the
most popular intramural sport.
Elimination tournaments will
have a maximum value of 35
points to the champion, and
points for sports such as golf
and cross-country will also be
determined by the number of
individual participants.
New Eligibility
In the area of eligibility, the
handbook states definitely that
any intercollegiate athlete choos
ing to participate in the intra
mural program must have the
approval of his coach, in writing.
Anyone having received a var
sity letter at Stanford or any
other four-year institution will
not be eligible to compete in an
intramural sport related to one
in which he won the award.
Transfers who won letters in
junior college will have to sit
out a year of ineligibility in the
related intramural sport.
Members of the newly defined
club teams will be considered
the same as varsity competitors
if their sport competes on an
intercollegiate level.
Erases Problems
The new handbook also clears
up a few vague problems of the
past. Graduate students must be
formally affiliated or at least
paying social dues and rooming
in or taking meals with an or
ganization.

They may compete with either
their living group or their gradu
ate school affiliation, not both.
All halls or wings in Stanford
Village may field intramural
teams, and students with no
campus unit affiliation may form
teams with the approval of the
Intramural Director.
Warning: Don't Forfeit
Regulations concerning for
feits and protests have been
strengthened. Any team playing
an ineligible man automatically
forfeits all previous games, and
will be withdrawn from further

competition in the sport concern
ed.
The penalty for forfeiting a
first-round match is the loss of
ten intramural points for the
living unit involved.
After playing at least one
match in a given sport, a for
feiting team would lose all in
tramural points gained thus far
in that sport.
Why? Forfeits Hurt
In league play, one forfeit
means a team cannot compete
in the finals for the sport, as well
as losing all intramural points
for that sport.

Two forfeits in the same sport
disqualify a team, while three
forfeits for the same unit, not
necessarily in the same sport,
results in the loss of all intra
mural points for all sports dur
ing the current quarter.
Ungentlemanly?
Protest will have to be given
verbally, to the Intramural Di
rector, within 24 hours of the
start of the protested game.
Gentlemen's agreements be
ween teams will not be support
ed by the Intramural ofhce when
they are at variance with intra
mural rules.
