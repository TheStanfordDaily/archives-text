# Still No Decision On Hospital Plans

### PAT McMAHON 
There is no auction, not even
a "for sale" sign, but make no
mistake — the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital is for sale.
Stanford University needs a
hospital with 450-500 beds and
the City of Palo Alto wants a
community hospital, and wants
Stanford to build it.
The question for each party:
what is the best way to termi
nate the present agreement?
The City would like a new
hospital rather than remaining
in its wing of the present one,
but the $5 million Stanford of
fered for its present facilities is
insufficient for a new hospital,
City Councilmen insist.
So the City has proposed that
Stanford build them a new hos
pital in a "bed for bed" exchange.
The University, meanwhile,
since Palo Alto rejected a $5
million offer to buy out their

wing of the hospital, has gone
ahead with plans to build a new
hospital, has a half million dol
lar grant for planning, and has
hired an architect.
Negotiations are nearing com
pletion between the City rep
resented by George Morgan, City
Canager, and assistants, and the
University, represented by Dr.
Robert J. Glaser, dean of the
medical school and vice president
for medical affairs, and his staff.
The City team will report to
the City Council and the medical
school group to the Board of
Trustees, said Glaser in an in
terview.
The present negotiations rep
resent nearly a three-year effort
on the part of both Palo Alto
and Stanford to sever ties.

asked the University to consider
purchasing the Palo Alto share
of the hospital. The letter was
followed by a long study by the
Medical School staff which de
cided that, indeed, the University
was in need of more beds "for
teaching purposes" and a hos
pital "under their control."
President Sterling, with the
approval of the Trustees, offered
the City of Palo Alto $5 million
for its share. The city council felt
the offer was too low, and the
hospital is "a distinct advantage
to the Palo Alto resident."
After the City's rejection, Stan
ford set about making plans to
build a new hospital and basic
sciences buildings. By June of
this year, they obtained a $500,-
000 grant from the Common
wealth Fund of New York.
And with announcement of
these funds, renewed bargaining
the "bed for bed" exchange, and
the present negotiations began.
Among the features of Stan
ford's proposed new hospital are
an ambulatory care center which
would provide lower cost medical
care for patients needing mini
mal attention, and other "funda

mental reforms" to cut patient
medical costs.
Giaser has said, "The operating
patterns of the nation's large
hospitals, with multi-million-dol
lar budgets, have not been sub
jected to the kind of scrutiny that
is employed in industry."
The Stanford Medical Center
is a complex of eight intercon
nected buildings of which the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Cen
ter occupies three buildings at
the north end. Of these three,

Stanford and Palo Alto each have
one building or "pavilion," and
they share the third "core" build
ing of which Stanford owns 65
percent to Palo Alto's 35 per cent.
The Center cost more than $27
million to build and equip. The
architect. was Edward Durell
Stone, who also designed the U.S.
Embassy in New Delhi and the
U.S. Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels
World's Fair.

The City would like a new
hospital rather than remaining
in its wing of the present one,

fered for its present facilities is
insufficient for a new hospital,
City Councilmen insist.
So the City has proposed that
Stanford build them a new hos

The University, meanwhile,
since Palo Alto rejected a $5
million offer to buy out their

wing of the hospital, has gone
ahead with plans to build a new
hospital, has a half million dol

hired an architect.
Negotiations are nearing com

The City team will report to
