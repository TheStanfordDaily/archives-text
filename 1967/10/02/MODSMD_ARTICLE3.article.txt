# Still No Decision On Hospital Plans
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
There is no auction, not even
a "for sale" sign, but make no
mistake — the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital is for sale.
Stanford University needs a
hospital with 450-500 beds and
the City of Palo Alto wants a
community hospital, and wants
Stanford to build it.
The question for each party:
what is the best way to termi
nate the present agreement?
The City would like a new
hospital rather than remaining
in its wing of the present one,
but the $5 million Stanford of
fered for its present facilities is
insufficient for a new hospital,
City Councilmen insist.
So the City has proposed that
Stanford build them a new hos
pital in a "bed for bed" exchange.
The University, meanwhile,
since Palo Alto rejected a $5
million offer to buy out their

wing of the hospital, has gone
ahead with plans to build a new
hospital, has a half million dol
lar grant for planning, and has
hired an architect.
Negotiations are nearing com
pletion between the City rep
resented by George Morgan, City
Canager, and assistants, and the
University, represented by Dr.
Robert J. Glaser, dean of the
medical school and vice president
for medical affairs, and his staff.
The City team will report to
the City Council and the medical
school group to the Board of
Trustees, said Glaser in an in
terview.
The present negotiations rep
resent nearly a three-year effort
on the part of both Palo Alto
and Stanford to sever ties.

DIVIDED HOW MUCH LONGER? The Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital will be under one ownership
soon. Divided since its opening in 1 Stanford's desire for a larger teaching hospital and Palo
Alto's desire for assured patient space have resulted in a mutual desire for separate hospitals.
