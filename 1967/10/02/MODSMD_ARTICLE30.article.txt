# Card Rushers Spoil Spartan Aerials
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
"We're starting to put things
together, and of course, we'll
have no trouble getting the team
up for USC next week," stated
Stanford Coach John Ralston
following Stanford's 28-14 vic
tory over the San Jose Spartans
Saturday.
Stanford hit the San Jose de
fense to net 304 yards, with Nate
Kirtman collecting 166 yards on
17 carries.
Holrnan Pitches 42
Danny Holman of the Spar
tans filled the air with a record
breaking number of passes, hit
ting on 25 of 42 attempts.
Holman threw short and long,
several times throwing the Stan
ford defense off by looking one
way and then lofting one to the
other side of the field.
Stanford secondary defenders
Dick Oliver, Bob Rinker, and
Donn Renwick turned in a
creditable performance that can
not be measured by Holman's
compl :tion percentage, nor the
294 yards in passing yardage.
Three of the Holman aerials

were intercepted, and numerous
perfect strikes were batted down.
Holman received the Back of
the Game award, but two of the
interceptions were decisive.
One, by linebacker Marty Brill,
was turned into a 48 yard touch
down run for Brill, named Line
man of the Game for this TD
and his eight tackles.
Bob Rinker took a Holman
pass in the Stanford end zone,
turning back the last Spartan
rally late in the fourth quarter.
Fumbles Slow Tribe
Spartan Clarence Kelley open
ed the game scoring with an
11-yard run early in the first
quarter. San Jose had gotten
the ball on the Stanford 22 after
a fumble.
Three fumbles stymied the In
dian offense in the first quarter,
but Stanford turned in one of
its most powerful drives this
season, going 90 yards in 12
plays, with Mark Marquess scor
ing on a keeper off left tackle
early in the second quarter.
Bill Shoemaker turned a bad
center snap into a two point con

version, hitting Kirtman with a
short lob, giving Stanford an
8-7 lead at the halftime.
Kirtman Runs to Daylight
Kirtman gained 105 yards in
the second half and was the
spark that moved the Indians to
three more touchdowns.
For the first time this season,
Kirtman was able to get loose
outside, running off tackle when
the San Jose end would drop
back to double cover Indian re
ceivers in a third down situation.
This opened the middle for the
Stanford inside game. When the
Spartan secondary moved up to
stop the runners, left end Jim
Cross broke open in the San
Jose end zone.
Chuck Williams hit him on a
play-action pass for the score.
Shoemaker missed the conver
sion attempt, but had a quick
chance to try again as 18 sec
onds later Brill faked out last
Spartan defender Holman on
his interception run for six
points.
Watch The All-American Work
This gave Stanford a 21-7 lead
and the 37,000 spectators sat
back to see just how good the
highly touted Holman was.
As the fourth quarter opened
Holman engineered a drive from
his own 20, throwing nine passes
in 11 plays.
Holman eluded rushers to
throw a 26-yard strike to Frank
Slayton in the end zone that
capped the drive and put the
score at 21-14 after Russ Mun
son converted.
Holman threatened to do the
same thing the next time the
Spartans got the ball, and quick
ly brought San Jose from their

own 21 to a first and goal situa
tion.
Rinker Sews It Up
But Rinker ended that one
with his key snatch, after which
Stanford drove 93 yards in 10
plays.
Kirtman raced almost untouch
ed up the middle for 33 yards
and the final Stanford score,
and Shoemaker made the kick.
As Stanford dropped back into
a victory defense, Holman threw
in desperation, but the Stanford
defense really closed him up

this time. Holman did complete
a 32 yard pass as the game
ended.
The Red Machine
After the jittery first quarter
and the sadly reminiscent fumb
ling, the Stanford offense pulled
together for the best offensive
show of the year.
The question next week
against USC will be whether the
Stanford defense, tested this
week by passing accuracy, will
withstand the sheer speed a foot
it will see in the L.A. Colliseum.

together for the best offensive
show of the year.
The question next week
against USC will be whether the
Stanford defense, tested this
week by passing accuracy, will
withstand the sheer speed a foot
it will see in the L.A. Colliseum.
"We're starting to put things
together, and of course, we'll
have no trouble getting the team
up for USC next week," stated
Stanford Coach John Ralston
following Stanford's 28-14 vic
tory over the San Jose Spartans
Saturday.
Stanford hit the San Jose de
fense to net 304 yards, with Nate
Kirtman collecting 166 yards on
17 carries.
Holrnan Pitches 42
Danny Holman of the Spar
tans filled the air with a record
breaking number of passes, hit
ting on 25 of 42 attempts.
Holman threw short and long,
several times throwing the Stan
ford defense off by looking one
way and then lofting one to the
other side of the field.
Stanford secondary defenders
Dick Oliver, Bob Rinker, and
Donn Renwick turned in a
creditable performance that can
not be measured by Holman's
compl :tion percentage, nor the
294 yards in passing yardage.
Three of the Holman aerials

were intercepted, and numerous
perfect strikes were batted down.
Holman received the Back of
the Game award, but two of the
interceptions were decisive.
One, by linebacker Marty Brill,
was turned into a 48 yard touch
down run for Brill, named Line
man of the Game for this TD
and his eight tackles.
Bob Rinker took a Holman
pass in the Stanford end zone,
turning back the last Spartan
rally late in the fourth quarter.
Fumbles Slow Tribe
Spartan Clarence Kelley open
ed the game scoring with an
11-yard run early in the first
quarter. San Jose had gotten
the ball on the Stanford 22 after
a fumble.
Three fumbles stymied the In
dian offense in the first quarter,
but Stanford turned in one of
its most powerful drives this
season, going 90 yards in 12
plays, with Mark Marquess scor
ing on a keeper off left tackle
early in the second quarter.
Bill Shoemaker turned a bad
center snap into a two point con

version, hitting Kirtman with a
short lob, giving Stanford an
8-7 lead at the halftime.
Kirtman Runs to Daylight
Kirtman gained 105 yards in
the second half and was the
spark that moved the Indians to
three more touchdowns.
For the first time this season,
Kirtman was able to get loose
outside, running off tackle when
the San Jose end would drop
back to double cover Indian re
ceivers in a third down situation.
This opened the middle for the
Stanford inside game. When the
Spartan secondary moved up to
stop the runners, left end Jim
Cross broke open in the San
Jose end zone.
Chuck Williams hit him on a
play-action pass for the score.
Shoemaker missed the conver
sion attempt, but had a quick
chance to try again as 18 sec
onds later Brill faked out last
Spartan defender Holman on
his interception run for six
points.
Watch The All-American Work
This gave Stanford a 21-7 lead
and the 37,000 spectators sat
back to see just how good the
highly touted Holman was.
As the fourth quarter opened
Holman engineered a drive from
his own 20, throwing nine passes
in 11 plays.
Holman eluded rushers to
throw a 26-yard strike to Frank
Slayton in the end zone that
capped the drive and put the
score at 21-14 after Russ Mun
son converted.
Holman threatened to do the
same thing the next time the
Spartans got the ball, and quick
ly brought San Jose from their

own 21 to a first and goal situa
tion.
Rinker Sews It Up
But Rinker ended that one
with his key snatch, after which
Stanford drove 93 yards in 10
plays.
Kirtman raced almost untouch
ed up the middle for 33 yards
and the final Stanford score,
and Shoemaker made the kick.
As Stanford dropped back into
a victory defense, Holman threw
in desperation, but the Stanford
defense really closed him up

this time. Holman did complete
a 32 yard pass as the game
ended.

defense really closed him up

this time. Holman did complete
a 32 yard pass as the game
ended.
The Red Machine
After the jittery first quarter
and the sadly reminiscent fumb
ling, the Stanford offense pulled
together for the best offensive
show of the year.
The question next week
against USC will be whether the
Stanford defense, tested this
week by passing accuracy, will
withstand the sheer speed a foot
it will see in the L.A. Colliseum.
"We're starting to put things
together, and of course, we'll
have no trouble getting the team
up for USC next week," stated
Stanford Coach John Ralston
following Stanford's 28-14 vic
tory over the San Jose Spartans
Saturday.
Stanford hit the San Jose de
fense to net 304 yards, with Nate
Kirtman collecting 166 yards on
17 carries.
Holrnan Pitches 42
Danny Holman of the Spar
tans filled the air with a record
breaking number of passes, hit
ting on 25 of 42 attempts.
Holman threw short and long,
several times throwing the Stan
ford defense off by looking one
way and then lofting one to the
other side of the field.
Stanford secondary defenders
Dick Oliver, Bob Rinker, and
Donn Renwick turned in a
creditable performance that can
not be measured by Holman's
compl :tion percentage, nor the
294 yards in passing yardage.
Three of the Holman aerials

were intercepted, and numerous
perfect strikes were batted down.
Holman received the Back of
the Game award, but two of the
interceptions were decisive.
One, by linebacker Marty Brill,
was turned into a 48 yard touch
down run for Brill, named Line
man of the Game for this TD
and his eight tackles.
Bob Rinker took a Holman
pass in the Stanford end zone,
turning back the last Spartan
rally late in the fourth quarter.
Fumbles Slow Tribe
Spartan Clarence Kelley open
ed the game scoring with an
11-yard run early in the first
quarter. San Jose had gotten
the ball on the Stanford 22 after
a fumble.
Three fumbles stymied the In
dian offense in the first quarter,
but Stanford turned in one of
its most powerful drives this
season, going 90 yards in 12
plays, with Mark Marquess scor
ing on a keeper off left tackle
early in the second quarter.
Bill Shoemaker turned a bad
center snap into a two point con

version, hitting Kirtman with a
short lob, giving Stanford an
8-7 lead at the halftime.
Kirtman Runs to Daylight
Kirtman gained 105 yards in
the second half and was the
spark that moved the Indians to
three more touchdowns.
For the first time this season,
Kirtman was able to get loose
outside, running off tackle when
the San Jose end would drop
back to double cover Indian re
ceivers in a third down situation.
This opened the middle for the
Stanford inside game. When the
Spartan secondary moved up to
stop the runners, left end Jim
Cross broke open in the San
Jose end zone.
Chuck Williams hit him on a
play-action pass for the score.
Shoemaker missed the conver
sion attempt, but had a quick
chance to try again as 18 sec
onds later Brill faked out last
Spartan defender Holman on
his interception run for six
points.
Watch The All-American Work
This gave Stanford a 21-7 lead
and the 37,000 spectators sat
back to see just how good the
highly touted Holman was.
As the fourth quarter opened
Holman engineered a drive from
his own 20, throwing nine passes
in 11 plays.
Holman eluded rushers to
throw a 26-yard strike to Frank
Slayton in the end zone that
capped the drive and put the
score at 21-14 after Russ Mun
son converted.
Holman threatened to do the
same thing the next time the
Spartans got the ball, and quick
ly brought San Jose from their

own 21 to a first and goal situa
tion.
Rinker Sews It Up
But Rinker ended that one
with his key snatch, after which
Stanford drove 93 yards in 10
plays.
Kirtman raced almost untouch
ed up the middle for 33 yards
and the final Stanford score,
and Shoemaker made the kick.
As Stanford dropped back into
a victory defense, Holman threw
in desperation, but the Stanford
defense really closed him up

this time. Holman did complete
