# School Spirit Lives In San Jose Flask

### NICK SELBY 
"Party School?" asked the
flashing cards of the Stanford
cheering section during Satur
day's football game.
The answer was a definite "yes"
from the cheering San Jose root
ers section beneath the press box.
Next the cards showed a mug
of beer, which quickly drained as
the cards went down and up. The
response from the San Jose fans
again was an overwhelming
shout.
Perceptive Stunt
The card stunt was especially
perceptive of the San Jose School
spirit. San Jose seems to have
stopped the clock and preserves
the old spirit of fraternities, so
rorities, football games, and
booze.
The cheers from the Spartan
rooters never stopped all after
noon, an energy which finally
brought the Stanford fans to
life. Card rooters usually are
relatively slient during games,
as if in contemplation of every
play.
Essential Element
A cheering section seems to be
an essential element to the suc
cess of any football team. Any
one watching the reruns of the
Purdue-Notre Dame game had to
notice the way the fans exploded
whenever the Boilermakers
scored.
Their cheering was a large
factor in Purdue's win.
San Jose's yell leader realized
this when he saw the Spartans

trailing 21-7. He told his fans that
there was time left for them to
win. Then he added:
Go Psycho
"I want you guys to go psycho,
really go nuts."
Judging from the fans perform
ance up to then, it didn't seem
too much of a wish. During the
first half, the police were called
over to stop a fight in the middle
of the Spartan rooters.
It seems that a few fans had
had a little to much to drink, and
the yell leader called to several
people personally to keep cool
and calm down.
Carnage Seeker
But how could they stay calm
with the cheers he was leading
them in? Everytime he called for
a yell, it mentioned blood or mur
der.
"Kill, kill, kill. We want blood!"
was repeated over and over.
Finally Stanford responded.
"SJS JC (San Jose State Junior
College), it's all over."
San Jose could not accept de
feat and yelled, "Palo Alto City
College, BFD." Yelling BFD was
surely the sign of a poor loser.
Sadly the Spartan fans left the
stadium at the end of the game.
One rooter, walking with head
down and disconsolately kicking
a stone in the dust, bumped
into this reporter.
With the alcohol still heavy on
his breath, as if in apology for
the yell leader's want of carnage,
he muttered, "excuse me" and
walked on.

a yell, it mentioned blood or mur
der.
"Kill, kill, kill. We want blood!"
was repeated over and over.
Finally Stanford responded.
"SJS JC (San Jose State Junior
College), it's all over."
San Jose could not accept de
feat and yelled, "Palo Alto City
College, BFD." Yelling BFD was
surely the sign of a poor loser.
Sadly the Spartan fans left the
stadium at the end of the game.
One rooter, walking with head
down and disconsolately kicking
a stone in the dust, bumped
into this reporter.
With the alcohol still heavy on
his breath, as if in apology for
the yell leader's want of carnage,
he muttered, "excuse me" and
walked on.
"Party School?" asked the
flashing cards of the Stanford
cheering section during Satur
day's football game.
The answer was a definite "yes"
from the cheering San Jose root
ers section beneath the press box.
Next the cards showed a mug
of beer, which quickly drained as
the cards went down and up. The
response from the San Jose fans
again was an overwhelming
shout.
Perceptive Stunt
The card stunt was especially
perceptive of the San Jose School
spirit. San Jose seems to have
stopped the clock and preserves
the old spirit of fraternities, so
rorities, football games, and
booze.
The cheers from the Spartan
rooters never stopped all after
noon, an energy which finally
brought the Stanford fans to
life. Card rooters usually are
relatively slient during games,
as if in contemplation of every
play.
Essential Element
A cheering section seems to be
an essential element to the suc
cess of any football team. Any
one watching the reruns of the
Purdue-Notre Dame game had to
notice the way the fans exploded
whenever the Boilermakers
scored.
Their cheering was a large
factor in Purdue's win.
San Jose's yell leader realized
this when he saw the Spartans

trailing 21-7. He told his fans that
there was time left for them to
win. Then he added:
Go Psycho
"I want you guys to go psycho,
really go nuts."
Judging from the fans perform
ance up to then, it didn't seem
too much of a wish. During the
first half, the police were called
over to stop a fight in the middle
of the Spartan rooters.
It seems that a few fans had
had a little to much to drink, and
the yell leader called to several
people personally to keep cool
and calm down.
Carnage Seeker
But how could they stay calm
with the cheers he was leading
them in? Everytime he called for
a yell, it mentioned blood or mur
der.
"Kill, kill, kill. We want blood!"
was repeated over and over.

"SJS JC (San Jose State Junior
College), it's all over."
