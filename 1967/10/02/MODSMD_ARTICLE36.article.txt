Stanford halfback Nate Kirtman (48) moves to
ward a machine-like blocking wall of Red jerseys.
Kirtman rushed for 166 yards in 17 carries, but
gave the credit to the blocking efforts of center
Don Swartz, guards Phil Messer and George
Crooks, and tackles Malcolm Snider and Bob
Shore. "The holes were open all day/' he said.
Figure at edge of picture is flanker Bill Shoemaker.
