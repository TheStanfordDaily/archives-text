# Tribe Locker Report
## Indians Fired Up For Trojans 
### NICK SELBY 
The winning team's locker
room is always the happiest spot
on campus immediately after
any football game.
Stanford's locker room after
the Card's 28-14 win over San
Jose Saturday afternoon was not
merely happy, it was overflow
ing with spirit.
Paradoxically, the joy came
not so much from the day's win
but from anticipation of next
Saturday's game with USC.
Marty Brill, one of Stanford's
tri-captains, put it best: "SC will
be number one next week. We'll
be the ones to knock 'em right
out."

Brill, lineman of the game,
was referring to the following
situation —
1) Notre Dame, which had
been number one in the national
polls, lost Saturday to Purdue,
28-21.
2) USC, which had earlier de
feated Texas, conquered the
vaunted Spartans of Michigan
State, 21-17, to move into the
gridiron spotlight.
Amazing Performance
Brill's performance was amaz
ing when one considers that
during Thursday night's prac
tice he could barely run.
But when he picked off the
pass, he ran as a halfback, fak
ing San Jose quarterback Dan

ny Holman right out of Palo
Alto to move into the end zone.
Brill played with a heavily
bandaged knee that had lost sev
eral ounces of fluid when the
trainers drained it Friday night.
He laughingly poked that the
hardest thing to the run was
"getting out of the end zone."
His jubillant teammates nearly
crushed him in congratulating
him.
Rlnker's Key Play
The key play of the game came
from an unlikely source, sopho
more Bob Rinker, who had had
only 1% games of experience
before the Spartan encounter.
Rinker said he was in the cor
ner of the end zone covering the
flanker when he saw Holman
look back toward the middle.
He took off toward the center
when Holman pumped his arm
and the timing was perfect.
Disappointed Hero?
He leaped to grab the ball in
tended for tight end Randy
Leuhs, landed two yards deep
in the end zone, and ran it out
for ten yards. "I'd been waiting
for the play all day,"he said.
Rinker earned coach John Dal
ston's praise for the second week
in a row, but was somewhat dis
appointed with himself; "I miss
ed a lot of tackles," he admitted.
Stanford went out at the half
with an 8-7 lead that came from
a fluke play. Mark Marquess had
trouble with the PAT snap from
Don Swartz and kicker Bill Shoe
maker had to pick it up. Un
able to run for the points, he
threw over to Nate Kirtman
who ran it in.
Shoemaker said he realized he
couldn't run and then saw Mar
quess waving his arms at him.

"I just threw the ball over there
and hoped," he said.
Jim Cross, Tribe split end who
caught one pass for a 22 yard
touchdown play, credited quar
terback Chuck Williams for the
score. "He made a real good fake
into the line and then gave me
a perfect pass. I just made a
move to the outside, broke in
side and got a couple of steps."
Backs Praise Line
Stanford's offensive line was
highly praised by the Card run
ning backs. Nate Kirtman said
the holes were open all day,
including the play when he burst
through the middl* for a 33
yard TD with 47 seconds left.
Coach Ralston said that he
thought Kirtman had the poten
tial to be "the greatest running
back I've ever coached."
Spartan Aerials!!
San Jose netted only 82 yards
on the ground, but back of the
game Holman fired 42 passes,
completed 25 for 294 yards and
one touchdown.
Ralston commended the sec
ondary for its coverage against
Holman's aerials, but said he had
hoped for a greater rush from
linemen Doug McKenzie, Blaine
Nye, and John de la Forest.
The trio attacked Holman well
during the first half, dropping
him several times. But in the
fourth quarter, the Cards could
n't break anyone through and
Holman had ages to pass.
McKenzie admitted that he
was "very nervous" during the
last Spartan drive. But he show
ed pure determination when he
mentioned USC.
"Every team can be beaten on
a certain day,"he said. "I believe
we can beat SC next week."

Nye, and John de la Forest.
The trio attacked Holman well
during the first half, dropping
him several times. But in the
fourth quarter, the Cards could
n't break anyone through and
Holman had ages to pass.
McKenzie admitted that he
was "very nervous" during the
last Spartan drive. But he show
ed pure determination when he
mentioned USC.
"Every team can be beaten on
a certain day,"he said. "I believe
we can beat SC next week."
The winning team's locker
room is always the happiest spot
on campus immediately after
any football game.
Stanford's locker room after
the Card's 28-14 win over San
Jose Saturday afternoon was not
merely happy, it was overflow
ing with spirit.
Paradoxically, the joy came
not so much from the day's win
but from anticipation of next
Saturday's game with USC.
Marty Brill, one of Stanford's
tri-captains, put it best: "SC will
be number one next week. We'll
be the ones to knock 'em right
out."

Brill, lineman of the game,
was referring to the following
situation —
1) Notre Dame, which had
been number one in the national
polls, lost Saturday to Purdue,
28-21.
2) USC, which had earlier de
feated Texas, conquered the
vaunted Spartans of Michigan
State, 21-17, to move into the
gridiron spotlight.
Amazing Performance
Brill's performance was amaz
ing when one considers that
during Thursday night's prac
tice he could barely run.
But when he picked off the
pass, he ran as a halfback, fak
ing San Jose quarterback Dan

ny Holman right out of Palo
Alto to move into the end zone.
Brill played with a heavily
bandaged knee that had lost sev
eral ounces of fluid when the
trainers drained it Friday night.
He laughingly poked that the
hardest thing to the run was
"getting out of the end zone."
His jubillant teammates nearly
crushed him in congratulating
him.
Rlnker's Key Play
The key play of the game came
from an unlikely source, sopho
more Bob Rinker, who had had
only 1% games of experience
before the Spartan encounter.
Rinker said he was in the cor
ner of the end zone covering the
flanker when he saw Holman
look back toward the middle.
He took off toward the center
when Holman pumped his arm
and the timing was perfect.
Disappointed Hero?
He leaped to grab the ball in
tended for tight end Randy
Leuhs, landed two yards deep
in the end zone, and ran it out
for ten yards. "I'd been waiting
for the play all day,"he said.
Rinker earned coach John Dal
ston's praise for the second week
in a row, but was somewhat dis
appointed with himself; "I miss
ed a lot of tackles," he admitted.
Stanford went out at the half
with an 8-7 lead that came from
a fluke play. Mark Marquess had
trouble with the PAT snap from
Don Swartz and kicker Bill Shoe
maker had to pick it up. Un
able to run for the points, he
threw over to Nate Kirtman
who ran it in.
Shoemaker said he realized he
couldn't run and then saw Mar
quess waving his arms at him.

"I just threw the ball over there
and hoped," he said.
Jim Cross, Tribe split end who
caught one pass for a 22 yard
touchdown play, credited quar
terback Chuck Williams for the
score. "He made a real good fake
into the line and then gave me
a perfect pass. I just made a
move to the outside, broke in
side and got a couple of steps."
Backs Praise Line
Stanford's offensive line was
highly praised by the Card run
ning backs. Nate Kirtman said
the holes were open all day,
including the play when he burst
through the middl* for a 33
yard TD with 47 seconds left.
Coach Ralston said that he
thought Kirtman had the poten
tial to be "the greatest running
back I've ever coached."
Spartan Aerials!!
San Jose netted only 82 yards
on the ground, but back of the
game Holman fired 42 passes,
completed 25 for 294 yards and
one touchdown.
Ralston commended the sec
ondary for its coverage against
Holman's aerials, but said he had
hoped for a greater rush from

tial to be "the greatest running
back I've ever coached."
Spartan Aerials!!
San Jose netted only 82 yards
on the ground, but back of the
game Holman fired 42 passes,
completed 25 for 294 yards and
one touchdown.
Ralston commended the sec
ondary for its coverage against
Holman's aerials, but said he had
hoped for a greater rush from
linemen Doug McKenzie, Blaine
Nye, and John de la Forest.
The trio attacked Holman well
during the first half, dropping
him several times. But in the
fourth quarter, the Cards could
n't break anyone through and
Holman had ages to pass.
McKenzie admitted that he
was "very nervous" during the
last Spartan drive. But he show
ed pure determination when he
mentioned USC.
"Every team can be beaten on
a certain day,"he said. "I believe
we can beat SC next week."
The winning team's locker
room is always the happiest spot
on campus immediately after
any football game.
Stanford's locker room after
the Card's 28-14 win over San
Jose Saturday afternoon was not
merely happy, it was overflow
ing with spirit.
Paradoxically, the joy came
not so much from the day's win
but from anticipation of next
Saturday's game with USC.
Marty Brill, one of Stanford's
tri-captains, put it best: "SC will
be number one next week. We'll
be the ones to knock 'em right
out."

Brill, lineman of the game,
was referring to the following
situation —
1) Notre Dame, which had
been number one in the national
polls, lost Saturday to Purdue,
28-21.
2) USC, which had earlier de
feated Texas, conquered the
vaunted Spartans of Michigan
State, 21-17, to move into the
gridiron spotlight.
Amazing Performance
Brill's performance was amaz
ing when one considers that
during Thursday night's prac
tice he could barely run.
But when he picked off the
pass, he ran as a halfback, fak
ing San Jose quarterback Dan

ny Holman right out of Palo
Alto to move into the end zone.
Brill played with a heavily
bandaged knee that had lost sev
eral ounces of fluid when the
trainers drained it Friday night.
He laughingly poked that the
hardest thing to the run was
"getting out of the end zone."
His jubillant teammates nearly
crushed him in congratulating
him.
Rlnker's Key Play
The key play of the game came
from an unlikely source, sopho
more Bob Rinker, who had had
only 1% games of experience
before the Spartan encounter.
Rinker said he was in the cor
ner of the end zone covering the
flanker when he saw Holman
look back toward the middle.
He took off toward the center
when Holman pumped his arm
and the timing was perfect.
Disappointed Hero?
He leaped to grab the ball in
tended for tight end Randy
Leuhs, landed two yards deep
in the end zone, and ran it out
for ten yards. "I'd been waiting
for the play all day,"he said.
Rinker earned coach John Dal
ston's praise for the second week
in a row, but was somewhat dis
appointed with himself; "I miss
ed a lot of tackles," he admitted.
Stanford went out at the half
with an 8-7 lead that came from
a fluke play. Mark Marquess had
trouble with the PAT snap from
Don Swartz and kicker Bill Shoe
maker had to pick it up. Un
able to run for the points, he
threw over to Nate Kirtman
who ran it in.
Shoemaker said he realized he
couldn't run and then saw Mar
quess waving his arms at him.

"I just threw the ball over there
and hoped," he said.
Jim Cross, Tribe split end who
caught one pass for a 22 yard
touchdown play, credited quar
terback Chuck Williams for the
score. "He made a real good fake
into the line and then gave me
a perfect pass. I just made a
move to the outside, broke in
side and got a couple of steps."
Backs Praise Line
Stanford's offensive line was
highly praised by the Card run
ning backs. Nate Kirtman said
the holes were open all day,
including the play when he burst
through the middl* for a 33
yard TD with 47 seconds left.
Coach Ralston said that he
thought Kirtman had the poten
tial to be "the greatest running
back I've ever coached."
