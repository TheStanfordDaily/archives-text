## 
### 
BOSTON, (AP) — The Boston
Red Sox, sparked by Carl Yas
trzemski's four hits, defeated
Minnesota 5-3 Sunday and won
the American League Baseball
championship in the tightest
race in the league's history.
Jim Lonborg, a former Stan
ford pitcher, hurled the Bean
town sluggers to the victory. His
nine inning performance so over
whelmed the fans that they
surged onto the field, surrounded
him, and refused to let him into
the dugout.
No Playoff Necessary
The Red Sox had to wait two
hours after their regular season
was over to find out they were
champs. The California Angels
defeated Detroit 8-5 in the sec
ond game of a doubleheader to
eliminate any chance of a tie.
Detroit won the first game 6-4.
Had the Tigers won the second,

a playoff would have been neces
sary.
As it turned out, however,
Boston won the pennant out
right, with Detroit and Minne
sota only one game behind and
Chicago three games out.
Yaa, Takes Triple Crown
Yastrzemski's four hits raised
his batting average to a league
leading .326. He therefore be
came the eleventh man in base
ball history to sweep the triple
crown of batting average, runs
batted in (121), and home runs
(44).
Boston now goes into the
world series with the St. Louis
Cardinals, the National League
Champions. The Red Sox were
last in a World Series in 1946,
when they faced the Cardinals
and lost four games to three.
The Series starts Wednesday
