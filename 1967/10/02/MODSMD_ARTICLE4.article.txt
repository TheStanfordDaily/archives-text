# Council Voices Support For New Senate Proposal
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In a straw vote Friday, the
Academic Council unanimously
agreed to continue consideration
of a proposed Academic Senate
that would include student and
administration representation.
If adopted, the Senate would
become the primary deliberative
and decision-making body of the
faculty. The proposal was pre
sented to the council in extended
form last June. It was originated
last fall by Herbert L. Packer,
Professor of Law, who has since
been named Vice-provost.
As suggested in the June mem
orandum, five students, including
the ASSU President and the
Speaker of LASSU, and five ad
ministrators, including the Pres
ident and Provost, would be ex
officio members of the Senate.
Two hundred of the Council's
900 members attended the meet
ing.
Though the vote sterns to indi
cate general acceptance of the
senate concept, there is debate
among Council members on spe
cific issues.
Roadblocks Exist
The maior roadblocks to final
passage seem to be the system of
facultv representation and inclu
sion of students and administra
tors.
The system of faculty repre
sentation is a modified one-vote,
one-department plan. The modifi
cation is due to variation in de
pa rtmont size and lack of depart
ment structure in some schools.
In the memorandum, th° num
ber of representatives per depart
ment is based on the number of
faculty members in the depart
ment. Some facultv members
now suggest that the criterion of
teacher-student ratio should be
central.
A maior point of contention
rests with the number of medical
school representatives. As pre
sented, the medical school is
broken down into 13 depart
ments, resulting in 14 represent
atives.
The law school, however, would
have one and the Business School
would have two. Humanities and
Sciences would have 26.
Open Meeting Planned
To help solve such problems,
the Council will hold an open
meeting (for Council members
only) on Oct. 18 at 4 p.m. in the
Meyer Library. A list of criti
cisms and questions will be cir
culated in advance.
Revisions are continually be

ing made in the proposal and a
final vote will probably come in
late fall or early winter.
The detailed proposal was pre
pared by the subcommittee on
faculty decision-making. This
group, part of the executive com
mittee of the Council, has four
members. Kenneth J. Arrow, pro
fessor of Economics and Statis
tics, is Chairman. The other
members are: Philip Dawson,
History, Marc Franklin, Law,
and William van B. Robertson,
Medicine.
Motive For Change
Their memorandum explains
the motive for the proposed
change. "The Executive Commit

tee is too small, the Academic
Council too large, to carry on ef
fectively the functions of faculty
deliberation and decision-mak
ing."
Problems with the Executive
Committee include its inability to
give attention to many diverse
issues simultaneously, and its
lack of power to make final deci
sions.
Three specific shortcomings of
the Council are outlined. There is
a lack of regularity in meetings
which doesn't permit develop
ment of continuous interchanges.
There is a lack of effective
communication in the Council,
with some members unknown to
others. Communication between

the Executive Committee and
Council members is also weak.
Interests Unbalanced
Finally, an unbalanced repre
sentation of interests exists.
Many times, only members with
a vested interest appear at meet
ings.
Included with the June memo
randum were extensive explana
tions of the methods of election
and the relations between the
Senate and the Council.
The Senate elections will be de
cided by preferential ballot.
The section on relations de
scribes Council powers on Senate
actions. The general format will
have the Senate working within
the Council framework, allowing
the Council to have fmal say on
recommendations.

faculty. The proposal was pre
sented to the council in extended
form last June. It was originated
last fall by Herbert L. Packer,
Professor of Law, who has since
been named Vice-provost.
As suggested in the June mem
orandum, five students, including
the ASSU President and the
Speaker of LASSU, and five ad
ministrators, including the Pres
ident and Provost, would be ex
officio members of the Senate.
Two hundred of the Council's
900 members attended the meet
ing.
Though the vote sterns to indi
cate general acceptance of the
senate concept, there is debate
among Council members on spe
cific issues.
Roadblocks Exist
The maior roadblocks to final
passage seem to be the system of
facultv representation and inclu
sion of students and administra
tors.
The system of faculty repre
sentation is a modified one-vote,
one-department plan. The modifi
cation is due to variation in de
pa rtmont size and lack of depart
ment structure in some schools.
In the memorandum, th° num
ber of representatives per depart
ment is based on the number of
faculty members in the depart
ment. Some facultv members
now suggest that the criterion of
teacher-student ratio should be
central.
A maior point of contention
rests with the number of medical
school representatives. As pre
sented, the medical school is
broken down into 13 depart
ments, resulting in 14 represent
atives.
The law school, however, would
have one and the Business School
would have two. Humanities and
Sciences would have 26.
Open Meeting Planned
To help solve such problems,
the Council will hold an open
meeting (for Council members
only) on Oct. 18 at 4 p.m. in the
Meyer Library. A list of criti
cisms and questions will be cir
culated in advance.
Revisions are continually be

ing made in the proposal and a
final vote will probably come in
late fall or early winter.
The detailed proposal was pre
pared by the subcommittee on
faculty decision-making. This
group, part of the executive com
mittee of the Council, has four
members. Kenneth J. Arrow, pro
fessor of Economics and Statis
tics, is Chairman. The other
members are: Philip Dawson,
History, Marc Franklin, Law,
and William van B. Robertson,
Medicine.
Motive For Change
Their memorandum explains
the motive for the proposed
change. "The Executive Commit

tee is too small, the Academic
Council too large, to carry on ef
fectively the functions of faculty
deliberation and decision-mak
ing."
Problems with the Executive
Committee include its inability to
give attention to many diverse
issues simultaneously, and its
lack of power to make final deci
sions.
Three specific shortcomings of
the Council are outlined. There is
a lack of regularity in meetings
which doesn't permit develop
ment of continuous interchanges.
There is a lack of effective
communication in the Council,
with some members unknown to
others. Communication between

the Executive Committee and
Council members is also weak.
Interests Unbalanced
Finally, an unbalanced repre
sentation of interests exists.
Many times, only members with
a vested interest appear at meet
ings.
Included with the June memo
randum were extensive explana
tions of the methods of election
and the relations between the
Senate and the Council.
The Senate elections will be de
cided by preferential ballot.
The section on relations de
scribes Council powers on Senate
actions. The general format will
have the Senate working within
the Council framework, allowing
the Council to have fmal say on
recommendations.
In a straw vote Friday, the
Academic Council unanimously
agreed to continue consideration
of a proposed Academic Senate
that would include student and
administration representation.
If adopted, the Senate would
become the primary deliberative

faculty. The proposal was pre
