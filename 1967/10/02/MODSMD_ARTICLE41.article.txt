# False Alarm Signals Chief's Anniversary
## 
### 
Fire Chief John Marston near
ly went to the blazes Friday but
found a surprise anniversary
party instead of smokes and
flames.
It was his 25th year on the
Stanford force.
He was hastily summoned to
the fire station by six long blasts
on the department fire horn at
3 p.m. only to find a number of
his firemen just sitting in the
trucks grinning at him.
Confusion must have reigned
in his mind for a minute — Mar
ston thought he passed his an
niversary "sometime in August"
—but University officials soon let
him in on the secret and hustled
him across the street to Bow
man Alumni House where he
found 75 of his close friends
waiting.
Force Expands
Marston and the Fire Dept.
have grown together since that
day in October, 1942, when he
took over as chief. Only four
full-time fire eaters were on his
forcc then, but yesterday 35 full
timers and 14 student firemen
helped him celebrate his anni
versary.
And the 1942 single station fire
dept. has expanded to two now
— the second is located near the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter on Sand Hill Rd.
Met with applause as he walk
ed through the door of Bowman
Alumni House, Marston had
more surprises in store for him.
Rev. Robert M. Minto, Univer
sity Chaplain, had made a quick
trip over from Memorial Church
to tell the crowd, "the Chief and
I are mutually interested in sav
ing people from fire."
University President Wallace
Sterling couldn't make it — he
had an academic council meet
ing keeping him busy — but he
didn't forget the occasion either.
Sterling sent a note via admini
strative secretary Frederick O.
Glover congratulating Marston
for his 25 years of "fine service."
Anecdotes Too
A former student fireman who
stayed in the business and is
now Santa Clara County Fire
Marshall had a few anecdotes
for the crowd of well-wishers.
The Marshal, Bruce L. Wiggins,
recalled that he had nearly been
kicked off the force in 1944 for
crashing a fire truck in Mar
ston's official Chief's car.
Concluding the formal cere
monies was the presentation of
an engraved old-time fife bugle
to Marston. He put it to his lips
and blew a few sick notes, caus
ing photographers to back away.
Marston, 613 Salvatierra, is
married and has one son. The
57-year-old Chief hopes to stay
with Stanford's fire dept. for
three to five more years before
retirement.
