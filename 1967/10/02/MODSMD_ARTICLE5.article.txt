# Dean's List Enlarged In Policy Reversal
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Registrar Harvey Hall re
scinded Friday a University pol
icy which had excluded about
200 undergraduates from the
1966-67 Dean's List of honor
students.
The students were excluded
from the list as it was an
nounced Thursday because they
had completed fewer than 39
quarter units last year for let
ter grades, taking the rest of
their units for the year on a
pass-fail basis.
Hall estimated Friday that
about 180 students had the mini
mum 3.2 grade point average
(GPA) but had taken too many
units pass-fail to meet the re
quirement. More than 20 other
students with 3.2 GPA failed to
make the Dean's List because
of incomplete grades or insuf
ficient units, even counting pass
fail courses.
Hall's "exemption" of stu
dents from the 39-unit limit for
the 1966-67 Dean's List is similar
to the action taken by the Uni
versity prior to graduation in
June, 1967. At that time units
taken pass-fail were counted to
ward a 40-unit upper division
course requirement for honors
for graduating seniors. It was
announced that in the future
pass-fail units could not be
counted toward the require
ment.
The future of the Dean's List

itself is uncertain, Hall said, be
cause of difficulties like this in
volving pass-fail grading.
The Dean's list will now have
nearly 1400 names, or about 30
per cent of the eligible fresh
men, sophomores and juniors of
1966-67.
When the time came last sum
mer to prepare the Dean's List,
the old rule was followed that
a minimum of 39 units had to
bp taken during the year to be
eligible for honors. But pass-fail
units were not counted, because
no grade on the one-through
four point system existed for
calculation of GPA. About 180
students who had completed
more than 39 units total but
fewer than 39 for letter grades
were automatically stricken
from the list.
Hall admitted the excluded
stu dents had not been treated
"equitably" when their plight
was brought to his attention
Thursday. He said the incident
raises questions about the fu
ture of the Dean's list itself.
Four possible policif s for
Dean's List selection are now
being considered, Hall said.
They are:
(1) Eliminate the Dean's List.
(2) Continue indefinitely the
"exemption" given on the 1966-
67 List, that, is, allow both
graded and pass-fail units to be
taken to meet the 39-unit mini
mum.

(3) Require 39 units of graded
work for Dean's List.
(4) Require some number of
graded units less than 39 for
Dean's List. (The "normal load'
during one year at Stanford is 45
units.)
"I think the Dean's List just
makes people feel good," Hall
said. "It motivates some, but not
many."
