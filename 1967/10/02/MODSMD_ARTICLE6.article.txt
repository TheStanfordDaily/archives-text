Registration this fall is up
466 students from last year,
according to Dr. Harvey Hall,
University Registrar.
As of last Thursday 11,257
had registered, compared to
10,791 at the same time one
year ago.
Hall believes that both the
proposed increase in tuition
for next fall and the new
draft deferments may be
partly responsible for the in
crease.
Of the 8,729 men, 366 more
than last year, 4,088 are un
dergraduates and 4,341 are
graduates. The women's en
rollment of 2,528 is larger by
100, with 1,776 undergradu
ates and 752 graduates.
