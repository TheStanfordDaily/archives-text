# Musical Fairy Tale
## Gaieties Goes 'Creative' 
### BARBARA EHRLICH 
Ram's Head's Gaieties — the
traditional Big Game musical
spoofing the Stanford scene and
Cal rivalry — is going "creative"
this year.
The story which resulted is
"Wumberlogue," a musical fairy
tale. It will be presented Friday
and Saturday, November 10 and
11, and Thursday, November 16
at 8:30 p.m., and Friday, Nov
ember 17, at 9:00 p.m. following
the Bonfire. All performances
are in Memorial Auditorium. The
32-member cast for Gaieties was
announced today.
"We decided last Christmas
to do something different this
year," said Alan Mokler, enth
siastic director and co author of
the music and lyrics.
"We wanted to do something
very original and very creative.
We put only two limitations on
the script: it had to be a musical
and it had to be relevant to the
kids here at Stanford."
"Another change," said Mok
ler, "is the performance sche
dule. The show has traditionally
been presented Wednesday
through Friday before Big
Game. "This way we have two
weekends, and the show can be
more of a show rather than just
Big Game."
Author of the book is Bob
Sevra, one of last year s leads
and now at the University of
Michigan. Mokler and Gary Lev
inson, a music major, collabor
ated on the music and lyrics.
"Wumberlogue" is about the
Prince of Stanford who is

given an impossible quest by the
evil Duke of Berkeley in order
to win the hand of the Duke's
niece.
The Prince must go to Stan
ford and return with three Stan
ford women for the duke. But to
do this he must fight the Trusty
bordal, who will not let any
woman leave since the "lost 75"
were allowed to and never heard
from again.
The show is being produced by
Bob Stone, and directed and
staged by Mokler. Gary Levin
son is choral director.
Feinstein As Duke
Chuck Feinstein, a graduate
student, will play the evil Duke.
The Prince of Stanford, "a
young man looking for worlds
to conquer," will be played by
Bob Matson.
Stan Rutherford, a senior En
glish major, is cast in the title
role of the Wumberlogue, an
absent-minded magician who
forgets his spells halfway
through.
The only holdover from last
year's leads is sophomore Becky
Whitehouse, who will play the
Princess, the Duke's niece.
Dan Erickson, another gradu
ate student, will be the narrator
Belch; and Heather Ferguson, a
freshman, will play Tweeney,
whose I.Q. is "about equal to
her height in inches."
Previous to Gaieties tryouts,
Ram's Head displayed its talents
in a short skit at the Friday
evening concert during Pre-Reg
week. About 75 students tried
out for the 32 roles.
"We were amazed by the tre
mendous response, especially
among freshmen," said Mokler.
"If our creative change works,
there are almost unlimited direc
tions we can take," he said.
Block tickets go on sale today
at the Ram's Head office in Tre
sidder. Tickets are available at
$2.60, $2.10, $1.60, and $1.10. A

given an impossible quest by the
evil Duke of Berkeley in order
to win the hand of the Duke's
niece.
The Prince must go to Stan
ford and return with three Stan
ford women for the duke. But to
do this he must fight the Trusty
bordal, who will not let any
woman leave since the "lost 75"
were allowed to and never heard
from again.
The show is being produced by
Bob Stone, and directed and
staged by Mokler. Gary Levin
son is choral director.
Feinstein As Duke
Chuck Feinstein, a graduate
student, will play the evil Duke.
The Prince of Stanford, "a
young man looking for worlds
to conquer," will be played by
Bob Matson.
Stan Rutherford, a senior En
glish major, is cast in the title
role of the Wumberlogue, an
absent-minded magician who
forgets his spells halfway
through.
The only holdover from last
year's leads is sophomore Becky
Whitehouse, who will play the
Princess, the Duke's niece.
Dan Erickson, another gradu
ate student, will be the narrator
Belch; and Heather Ferguson, a
freshman, will play Tweeney,
whose I.Q. is "about equal to
her height in inches."
Previous to Gaieties tryouts,
Ram's Head displayed its talents
in a short skit at the Friday
evening concert during Pre-Reg
week. About 75 students tried
out for the 32 roles.
"We were amazed by the tre
mendous response, especially
among freshmen," said Mokler.
"If our creative change works,
there are almost unlimited direc
tions we can take," he said.

moments for the next five weeks. Gaieties run November 10, 11, 16
and 17.
Ram's Head's Gaieties — the
traditional Big Game musical
spoofing the Stanford scene and
Cal rivalry — is going "creative"
this year.
The story which resulted is
"Wumberlogue," a musical fairy
tale. It will be presented Friday
and Saturday, November 10 and
11, and Thursday, November 16
at 8:30 p.m., and Friday, Nov
ember 17, at 9:00 p.m. following
the Bonfire. All performances
are in Memorial Auditorium. The
32-member cast for Gaieties was
announced today.
"We decided last Christmas
to do something different this
year," said Alan Mokler, enth
siastic director and co author of
the music and lyrics.
"We wanted to do something
very original and very creative.
We put only two limitations on
the script: it had to be a musical
and it had to be relevant to the
kids here at Stanford."
"Another change," said Mok
ler, "is the performance sche
dule. The show has traditionally
been presented Wednesday
through Friday before Big
Game. "This way we have two
weekends, and the show can be
more of a show rather than just
Big Game."
Author of the book is Bob
Sevra, one of last year s leads
and now at the University of
Michigan. Mokler and Gary Lev
inson, a music major, collabor
ated on the music and lyrics.
"Wumberlogue" is about the
Prince of Stanford who is

given an impossible quest by the
evil Duke of Berkeley in order
to win the hand of the Duke's
niece.
The Prince must go to Stan
ford and return with three Stan
ford women for the duke. But to
do this he must fight the Trusty
bordal, who will not let any
woman leave since the "lost 75"
were allowed to and never heard
from again.
The show is being produced by
Bob Stone, and directed and
staged by Mokler. Gary Levin
son is choral director.
Feinstein As Duke
Chuck Feinstein, a graduate
student, will play the evil Duke.
The Prince of Stanford, "a
young man looking for worlds
to conquer," will be played by
Bob Matson.
Stan Rutherford, a senior En
glish major, is cast in the title
role of the Wumberlogue, an
absent-minded magician who
forgets his spells halfway
through.
The only holdover from last
year's leads is sophomore Becky
Whitehouse, who will play the
Princess, the Duke's niece.
Dan Erickson, another gradu
ate student, will be the narrator
Belch; and Heather Ferguson, a
freshman, will play Tweeney,
whose I.Q. is "about equal to
her height in inches."
