# Musical Fairy Tale
## Gaieties Goes 'Creative' 
### BARBARA EHRLICH 
Ram's Head's Gaieties — the
traditional Big Game musical
spoofing the Stanford scene and
Cal rivalry — is going "creative"
this year.
The story which resulted is
"Wumberlogue," a musical fairy
tale. It will be presented Friday
and Saturday, November 10 and
11, and Thursday, November 16
at 8:30 p.m., and Friday, Nov
ember 17, at 9:00 p.m. following
the Bonfire. All performances
are in Memorial Auditorium. The
32-member cast for Gaieties was
announced today.
"We decided last Christmas
to do something different this
year," said Alan Mokler, enth
siastic director and co author of
the music and lyrics.
"We wanted to do something
very original and very creative.
We put only two limitations on
the script: it had to be a musical
and it had to be relevant to the
kids here at Stanford."
"Another change," said Mok
ler, "is the performance sche
dule. The show has traditionally
been presented Wednesday
through Friday before Big
Game. "This way we have two
weekends, and the show can be
more of a show rather than just
Big Game."
Author of the book is Bob
Sevra, one of last year s leads
and now at the University of
Michigan. Mokler and Gary Lev
inson, a music major, collabor
ated on the music and lyrics.
"Wumberlogue" is about the
