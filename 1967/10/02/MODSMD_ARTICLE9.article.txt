## Teacher's Union 
### 
The problems and resulting doubts, suspicions,
and misunderstandings brought to light by the
recently announced formation of a union for
graduate students and junior faculty members
can now be discussed openly.
Those who have called for the organization of
the union cite inequalities in salaries for gradu
ates working in departments, the present lack of
a graduate political voice, and the machine
like" grind involved in getting a graduate degree
as the main reasons for the union s formation.
There is no doubt that there are inequities
from department to department in the pay scales
and work requirements for graduate Teaching
Assistants (TAs) and Research Assistants
(R As). Within some humanities and sciences de
partments, TAs are required to work only three
or four hours a week, while RAs are expected to
work up to 15 or 20 hours. All receive the same
salary.
In several other departments, all TAs and RAs
work approximately the same number of hours.
In at least one department, however, salaries
vary for RAs from $1,600 to $3,500 while all TAs
are paid about $2,100.
Further, from the low of about $1,500 per year
salaries for TAs in several social science depart
ments, salaries range up to and even beyond
$5,000 for graduate research students in the sci
ences and engineering.
From the few examples above, it is apparent
that inequalities are widespread. Graduates in
the social sciences and other departments like
English and History have a legitimate right to
complain loudly. Inequities exist, both within
and between departments.
We strongly support pay increases for those
TAs and RAs presently at tht bottom of the
pay scale. We agree with the Freshman English
TA who spends three hours in class in addition
to countless hours reading papers four or five
times a quarter: "You can't live on $160 a month
and be a graduate student and teacher at the
same time."
It would be a mistake, however, to look toward
a union to solve this problem; the solution can
only be found within individual departments.
Each department has different work require
ments, and therefore different pay scales — and
rightly so. The engineering RA who spends long
hours day after day in the computation center
working on a project for a professor can hardly
be compared to the Economics TA who spends
only three hours a week in the classroom. It
would be ridiculous to insist that both be paid
the same salary.
A fair wage, therefore, can only be set undei
the circumstances applicable to separate depart
ments. Only those in each department know the
needs, requirements, and funds available for
graduate students.
The calm and reasoned discussion necessary

for an accord between professor and student on
fair minimum wage and equal working require
ments can never be reached with a broad labor
management approach. Rather, an association of
graduate students within each department—simi
lar to one already in operation in the political
science department—could meet with the profes
sors in charge of research and teaching grants to
discuss rationally and knowledgably the difficul
ties and inequities prevalent in their present pro
grams.
The second argument submitted by the union's
organizers is that graduate students at present
have no representation in university affairs. To
be sure, the graduate opinion on matters of uni
versity policy is rarely heard. Faculty member's,
administrators, and undergraduates are often
heard loudly, while the graduate sector—which
is now larger than the undergraduate division—
is silent.
There is no reason for this silence. The same
vehicles of expression effectively used by under
graduates, are rarely explored by graduates.
Heretofore the blame lies only with the gradu
ates themselves. Seats in LASSU for graduates
traditionally are empty for lack of interest.
For quite similar reasons, the ills of graduate
studies at Stanford have gone almost unnoticed.
It may be very true that graduate work is "an
academic mill", "a grind", and "little more than
a machine." But unless these views are expressed
by many disgruntled graduates, their complaints
will go unheard. Once again, an established for
um for expression of this disillusionment exists —
the SES.
A large number of undergraduates have called
the attention of the administration to problems
of residence, general studies, pass-fail options,
and admissions. Their rational expression of the
problems of undergraduate education has
brought tangible results, and will certainly bring
more in the near future.
The same avenues of expression are open to
graduate students. The rigid area requirements
of graduate studies and the compulsion by facul
ty members for graduate students to go too
quickly toward their degrees should be com
pletely evaluated and analyzed with group stu
dent participation. The SES can be much more
effective than a union.
Those graduates who are presently calling
stridently for the formation of a union should be
the ones working the hardest on SES committees
and forming departmental associations to reach
agreements and understandings with faculty
members. They should be the ones presenting
their views and seeking support in the legisla
ture and working with the student body presi
dent and vice president — both graduate stu
dents. All problems and frustrations should be
brought into the open, but in ways promising the
most significant results.

TA who spends three hours in class in addition
to countless hours reading papers four or five
times a quarter: "You can't live on $160 a month
and be a graduate student and teacher at the
same time."
It would be a mistake, however, to look toward
a union to solve this problem; the solution can
only be found within individual departments.
Each department has different work require
ments, and therefore different pay scales — and
rightly so. The engineering RA who spends long
hours day after day in the computation center
working on a project for a professor can hardly
be compared to the Economics TA who spends
only three hours a week in the classroom. It
would be ridiculous to insist that both be paid
the same salary.
A fair wage, therefore, can only be set undei
the circumstances applicable to separate depart
ments. Only those in each department know the
needs, requirements, and funds available for
graduate students.
The calm and reasoned discussion necessary

for an accord between professor and student on
fair minimum wage and equal working require
ments can never be reached with a broad labor
management approach. Rather, an association of
graduate students within each department—simi
lar to one already in operation in the political
science department—could meet with the profes
sors in charge of research and teaching grants to
discuss rationally and knowledgably the difficul
ties and inequities prevalent in their present pro
grams.
The second argument submitted by the union's
organizers is that graduate students at present
have no representation in university affairs. To
be sure, the graduate opinion on matters of uni
versity policy is rarely heard. Faculty member's,
administrators, and undergraduates are often
heard loudly, while the graduate sector—which
is now larger than the undergraduate division—
is silent.
There is no reason for this silence. The same
vehicles of expression effectively used by under
graduates, are rarely explored by graduates.
Heretofore the blame lies only with the gradu
ates themselves. Seats in LASSU for graduates
traditionally are empty for lack of interest.
For quite similar reasons, the ills of graduate
studies at Stanford have gone almost unnoticed.
It may be very true that graduate work is "an
academic mill", "a grind", and "little more than
a machine." But unless these views are expressed
by many disgruntled graduates, their complaints
will go unheard. Once again, an established for
um for expression of this disillusionment exists —
the SES.
A large number of undergraduates have called
the attention of the administration to problems
of residence, general studies, pass-fail options,
and admissions. Their rational expression of the
problems of undergraduate education has
brought tangible results, and will certainly bring
more in the near future.
The same avenues of expression are open to
graduate students. The rigid area requirements
of graduate studies and the compulsion by facul
ty members for graduate students to go too
quickly toward their degrees should be com
pletely evaluated and analyzed with group stu
dent participation. The SES can be much more
effective than a union.
Those graduates who are presently calling
stridently for the formation of a union should be
the ones working the hardest on SES committees
and forming departmental associations to reach
agreements and understandings with faculty
members. They should be the ones presenting
their views and seeking support in the legisla
ture and working with the student body presi
dent and vice president — both graduate stu
dents. All problems and frustrations should be
brought into the open, but in ways promising the
most significant results.

The problems and resulting doubts, suspicions,
and misunderstandings brought to light by the
recently announced formation of a union for
graduate students and junior faculty members
can now be discussed openly.
Those who have called for the organization of
the union cite inequalities in salaries for gradu
ates working in departments, the present lack of
a graduate political voice, and the machine
like" grind involved in getting a graduate degree
as the main reasons for the union s formation.
There is no doubt that there are inequities
from department to department in the pay scales
and work requirements for graduate Teaching
Assistants (TAs) and Research Assistants
(R As). Within some humanities and sciences de
partments, TAs are required to work only three
or four hours a week, while RAs are expected to
work up to 15 or 20 hours. All receive the same
salary.
In several other departments, all TAs and RAs
work approximately the same number of hours.
In at least one department, however, salaries
vary for RAs from $1,600 to $3,500 while all TAs
are paid about $2,100.
Further, from the low of about $1,500 per year
salaries for TAs in several social science depart
ments, salaries range up to and even beyond
$5,000 for graduate research students in the sci
ences and engineering.
From the few examples above, it is apparent
that inequalities are widespread. Graduates in
the social sciences and other departments like
English and History have a legitimate right to
complain loudly. Inequities exist, both within
and between departments.
We strongly support pay increases for those
TAs and RAs presently at tht bottom of the
pay scale. We agree with the Freshman English
TA who spends three hours in class in addition
to countless hours reading papers four or five
times a quarter: "You can't live on $160 a month

is silent.
There is no reason for this silence. The same
vehicles of expression effectively used by under
graduates, are rarely explored by graduates.
Heretofore the blame lies only with the gradu
ates themselves. Seats in LASSU for graduates
traditionally are empty for lack of interest.
For quite similar reasons, the ills of graduate
studies at Stanford have gone almost unnoticed.
It may be very true that graduate work is "an
academic mill", "a grind", and "little more than
a machine." But unless these views are expressed
by many disgruntled graduates, their complaints
will go unheard. Once again, an established for
um for expression of this disillusionment exists —
the SES.
A large number of undergraduates have called
the attention of the administration to problems
of residence, general studies, pass-fail options,
and admissions. Their rational expression of the
problems of undergraduate education has
brought tangible results, and will certainly bring
more in the near future.
The same avenues of expression are open to
graduate students. The rigid area requirements
of graduate studies and the compulsion by facul
ty members for graduate students to go too
quickly toward their degrees should be com
pletely evaluated and analyzed with group stu
dent participation. The SES can be much more
effective than a union.
Those graduates who are presently calling
stridently for the formation of a union should be
the ones working the hardest on SES committees
and forming departmental associations to reach
agreements and understandings with faculty
members. They should be the ones presenting
their views and seeking support in the legisla
ture and working with the student body presi
dent and vice president — both graduate stu
dents. All problems and frustrations should be
brought into the open, but in ways promising the
most significant results.

The problems and resulting doubts, suspicions,
and misunderstandings brought to light by the
recently announced formation of a union for
graduate students and junior faculty members
can now be discussed openly.
Those who have called for the organization of
the union cite inequalities in salaries for gradu
ates working in departments, the present lack of
a graduate political voice, and the machine
like" grind involved in getting a graduate degree
as the main reasons for the union s formation.
There is no doubt that there are inequities
from department to department in the pay scales
and work requirements for graduate Teaching
Assistants (TAs) and Research Assistants
(R As). Within some humanities and sciences de
partments, TAs are required to work only three
or four hours a week, while RAs are expected to
work up to 15 or 20 hours. All receive the same
salary.
In several other departments, all TAs and RAs
work approximately the same number of hours.
In at least one department, however, salaries
vary for RAs from $1,600 to $3,500 while all TAs
are paid about $2,100.
Further, from the low of about $1,500 per year
salaries for TAs in several social science depart
ments, salaries range up to and even beyond
$5,000 for graduate research students in the sci
ences and engineering.
From the few examples above, it is apparent
that inequalities are widespread. Graduates in
the social sciences and other departments like
English and History have a legitimate right to
complain loudly. Inequities exist, both within
and between departments.
We strongly support pay increases for those
TAs and RAs presently at tht bottom of the
pay scale. We agree with the Freshman English
TA who spends three hours in class in addition
to countless hours reading papers four or five
times a quarter: "You can't live on $160 a month
and be a graduate student and teacher at the
same time."
It would be a mistake, however, to look toward
a union to solve this problem; the solution can
only be found within individual departments.
Each department has different work require
ments, and therefore different pay scales — and
rightly so. The engineering RA who spends long
hours day after day in the computation center
working on a project for a professor can hardly
be compared to the Economics TA who spends
only three hours a week in the classroom. It
would be ridiculous to insist that both be paid
the same salary.
A fair wage, therefore, can only be set undei
the circumstances applicable to separate depart
ments. Only those in each department know the
needs, requirements, and funds available for
graduate students.
The calm and reasoned discussion necessary

for an accord between professor and student on
fair minimum wage and equal working require
ments can never be reached with a broad labor
management approach. Rather, an association of
graduate students within each department—simi
lar to one already in operation in the political
science department—could meet with the profes
sors in charge of research and teaching grants to
discuss rationally and knowledgably the difficul
ties and inequities prevalent in their present pro
grams.
The second argument submitted by the union's
organizers is that graduate students at present
have no representation in university affairs. To
be sure, the graduate opinion on matters of uni
versity policy is rarely heard. Faculty member's,
administrators, and undergraduates are often
heard loudly, while the graduate sector—which
is now larger than the undergraduate division—
is silent.
