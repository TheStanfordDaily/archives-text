THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A TYPICAL
STAFF AT KZSU
In the past weeks you've seen pictures of the "typi
cal'' staff. You've seen great come-ons for secretaries
and office boys. If you really want to be a secretary,
we just might be able to find some work for you, but
we think your non-academic involvement ought to be
more exciting that typing someone else's letters or
stories.
That's why KZSU—Stanford's AM-FM radio station
has no "typical" staff member. There are just too many
different things to be done to be typical—or boring!
We don't have the money to buy the space necessary
to list all the positions available. But basically, if you
have an idea, we'll do our best to help you improve
our operations. And if you're interested in just a non
typical activity, you can choose from numerous open
ings.
After all, surely you can think or better ways to fight
injustice than typing letters. We can.
