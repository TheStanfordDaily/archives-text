# San Jose State
## Ombudsman Explores Bias 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
San Jose State College Presi
dent Robert D. Clarke yesterday
appointed Rev. J. Benton White
as ombudsman to handle recent
charges of racial discrimination.
President Clarke charged
White, who is director of the
Wesley Foundation at San Jose,
to "conduct a continuous and
aggressive campaign against ra
cial discrimination practiced
against our students."
The move was prompted by
discrimination charges raised by
the United Black Students for
Action, a group headed by Harry

Edwards, an SJS instructor in
sociology and anthropology.
Criticism
Meanwhile, an off-campus
group, the Committee for Aca
demic Responsibility in Educa
tion, has asked Clarke to resign
because of the way he has handl
ed the racial problem, criticising
especially the cancellation of
San Jose's first home football
game of the year, with El Paso.
The group's head, Dr. M. O.
Moore, a Los Gatos physician,
said in a letter to Clarke, "We
are appalled with the manner
in which you and your admini
strative staff have handled the
entire problem, and under the
circumstances . . . there are
many of us who would encour
age you to yield the reins of
the presidency ... so that a
policy of appeasement can be re
placed by a policy of respectable
judgment — of humane firm
ness."
Four main areas of discrimi
nation were brought out. One
is the lack of any Negroes in the
SJS fraternities and sororities.
Another is the method of assign
ing lockers and roommates for
athletes.
Two Percent
The two percent system is also
under fire. This system allows
two percent of the student body
to be admitted with less than the
required average, the purpose of
this being to allow students from
underprivileged areas to enter
the school.
The USBA charged, however,
that this loophole had been used
mainly to get Negro athletes
into San Jose.
It was also alleged that owners
of near-campus dwellings have
discriminated against Negro
students. Since a shortage of
housing exists in the area, the
owners could do this and still be
able to rent the dwellings, since
enough whites were in the mar
ket for housing, the ÜBSA
charged.
The places involved were all
off-campus, and not college-ap
proved.
The new ombudsman has a
history of activity in racial af
fairs. Shortly after he came to
SJS in 1961, White participated
in a study program to eliminate
discrimination against Negro
students in housing around cam
pus.
He found that, at the time,
there were no problems for Ne
gro men, but Negro women had
great trouble with sororities.
"None of us followed through
adequately at that time," Rev.

White remarked. The study
group issued a report, and talked
with the fraternities and sorori
ties, but evidently with little suc
cess.
"We live in a society where
we tend to be insensitive to what
othr people face," he commented.
"My job will be to help us to un
derstand the nature of preju
dice."
White said his first step will
be to utilize established commit
tees to investigate problem
areas. He will be empowered to
hear people and to attempt to
eliminate discriminatory prac
tices through "negotiation and
persuasion."
The scope of the post is limit
ed. "My job right now is exclu
sively human rights," Rev. White
stated. The job may later develop
into one of a general ombuds
man — considering students'
complaints, rejecting them if

they are without merit, but in
suring action by the proper au
thorities if complaints are justi
fied.
At present, there are 60 or 70
Negroes at San Jose, out of 23,-
000 students. This small per
centage is also one of the com
plaints of the ÜBSA.
Another, unrelated, develop
ment at San Jose today was a
threat to the campus ROTC or
ganization.
The American Liberation
Front, a campus group which be
lieves in the Gandhian philo
sophy of passive resistance, has
threatened to picket today's RO
TC parade if the ROTC fails to
send a professor of military
science to take part in a debate
on the Vietnam War that they
are holding at 1:30 p.m., the
same time as the parade.
The ALF advocates that ROTC
be eliminated from SJS.

San Jose State College Presi
dent Robert D. Clarke yesterday
appointed Rev. J. Benton White
as ombudsman to handle recent
charges of racial discrimination.
President Clarke charged
White, who is director of the
Wesley Foundation at San Jose,
to "conduct a continuous and
aggressive campaign against ra
cial discrimination practiced
against our students."
The move was prompted by
discrimination charges raised by
the United Black Students for
Action, a group headed by Harry

Edwards, an SJS instructor in
sociology and anthropology.
Criticism
Meanwhile, an off-campus
group, the Committee for Aca
demic Responsibility in Educa
tion, has asked Clarke to resign
because of the way he has handl
ed the racial problem, criticising
especially the cancellation of
San Jose's first home football
game of the year, with El Paso.
The group's head, Dr. M. O.
Moore, a Los Gatos physician,
said in a letter to Clarke, "We
are appalled with the manner
in which you and your admini
strative staff have handled the
entire problem, and under the
circumstances . . . there are
many of us who would encour
age you to yield the reins of
the presidency ... so that a
policy of appeasement can be re
placed by a policy of respectable
judgment — of humane firm
ness."
Four main areas of discrimi
nation were brought out. One
is the lack of any Negroes in the
SJS fraternities and sororities.
Another is the method of assign
ing lockers and roommates for
athletes.
Two Percent
The two percent system is also
under fire. This system allows
two percent of the student body
to be admitted with less than the
required average, the purpose of
this being to allow students from
underprivileged areas to enter
the school.
The USBA charged, however,
that this loophole had been used
mainly to get Negro athletes
into San Jose.
It was also alleged that owners
of near-campus dwellings have
discriminated against Negro
students. Since a shortage of
housing exists in the area, the
owners could do this and still be
able to rent the dwellings, since
enough whites were in the mar
ket for housing, the ÜBSA
charged.
The places involved were all
off-campus, and not college-ap
proved.
The new ombudsman has a
history of activity in racial af
fairs. Shortly after he came to
SJS in 1961, White participated
in a study program to eliminate
discrimination against Negro
students in housing around cam
pus.
He found that, at the time,
there were no problems for Ne
gro men, but Negro women had
great trouble with sororities.
"None of us followed through
adequately at that time," Rev.

White remarked. The study
group issued a report, and talked
with the fraternities and sorori
ties, but evidently with little suc
cess.
"We live in a society where
we tend to be insensitive to what
othr people face," he commented.
"My job will be to help us to un
derstand the nature of preju
dice."
White said his first step will
be to utilize established commit
tees to investigate problem
areas. He will be empowered to
hear people and to attempt to
eliminate discriminatory prac
tices through "negotiation and
persuasion."
The scope of the post is limit
ed. "My job right now is exclu
sively human rights," Rev. White
stated. The job may later develop
into one of a general ombuds
man — considering students'
complaints, rejecting them if

they are without merit, but in
suring action by the proper au
thorities if complaints are justi
fied.
At present, there are 60 or 70
Negroes at San Jose, out of 23,-
000 students. This small per
centage is also one of the com
plaints of the ÜBSA.

The scope of the post is limit

complaints, rejecting them if

they are without merit, but in
suring action by the proper au

At present, there are 60 or 70
Negroes at San Jose, out of 23,-

centage is also one of the com
plaints of the ÜBSA.
Another, unrelated, develop
ment at San Jose today was a
threat to the campus ROTC or
ganization.
The American Liberation
Front, a campus group which be
lieves in the Gandhian philo
sophy of passive resistance, has
threatened to picket today's RO
TC parade if the ROTC fails to
send a professor of military
science to take part in a debate
on the Vietnam War that they
are holding at 1:30 p.m., the
same time as the parade.
The ALF advocates that ROTC
be eliminated from SJS.

San Jose State College Presi
dent Robert D. Clarke yesterday
appointed Rev. J. Benton White
as ombudsman to handle recent
charges of racial discrimination.
President Clarke charged
White, who is director of the
Wesley Foundation at San Jose,
to "conduct a continuous and
aggressive campaign against ra
cial discrimination practiced
against our students."
The move was prompted by
discrimination charges raised by
the United Black Students for
Action, a group headed by Harry

Edwards, an SJS instructor in
sociology and anthropology.
Criticism
Meanwhile, an off-campus
group, the Committee for Aca
demic Responsibility in Educa
tion, has asked Clarke to resign
because of the way he has handl
ed the racial problem, criticising
especially the cancellation of
San Jose's first home football
game of the year, with El Paso.
The group's head, Dr. M. O.
Moore, a Los Gatos physician,
said in a letter to Clarke, "We
are appalled with the manner
in which you and your admini
strative staff have handled the
entire problem, and under the
circumstances . . . there are
many of us who would encour
age you to yield the reins of
the presidency ... so that a
policy of appeasement can be re
placed by a policy of respectable
judgment — of humane firm
ness."
Four main areas of discrimi
nation were brought out. One
is the lack of any Negroes in the
SJS fraternities and sororities.
Another is the method of assign
ing lockers and roommates for
athletes.
Two Percent
The two percent system is also
under fire. This system allows
two percent of the student body
to be admitted with less than the
required average, the purpose of
this being to allow students from
underprivileged areas to enter
the school.
The USBA charged, however,
that this loophole had been used
mainly to get Negro athletes
into San Jose.
It was also alleged that owners
of near-campus dwellings have
discriminated against Negro
students. Since a shortage of
housing exists in the area, the
owners could do this and still be
able to rent the dwellings, since
enough whites were in the mar
ket for housing, the ÜBSA
charged.
The places involved were all
off-campus, and not college-ap
proved.
The new ombudsman has a
history of activity in racial af
fairs. Shortly after he came to
SJS in 1961, White participated
in a study program to eliminate
discrimination against Negro
students in housing around cam
pus.
He found that, at the time,
there were no problems for Ne
gro men, but Negro women had
great trouble with sororities.
"None of us followed through
adequately at that time," Rev.

White remarked. The study
group issued a report, and talked
with the fraternities and sorori
ties, but evidently with little suc
cess.
"We live in a society where
we tend to be insensitive to what
othr people face," he commented.
"My job will be to help us to un
derstand the nature of preju
dice."
White said his first step will
be to utilize established commit
tees to investigate problem
areas. He will be empowered to
hear people and to attempt to
eliminate discriminatory prac
tices through "negotiation and
persuasion."
