# Alternatives Sought
## Frats Or Coed Living 
### ROBERT FUNK 
j The residential arrangements
4t Stanford reflect an American
which became fixed
Garly in this century.
• Colleges and universities of
fered three apparent alternatives
to students: they might live in
town; they might pledge fra
ternities and sororities, which
ranged in their amenities from
ramshackle homes reconverted
to Greek-letter tenements to ele
gant chateaux designed to indi
cate that an eighteen-year-old
man had indeed achieved suc
cess in the world; or, lacking
imagination and other resources,
they might live in the dormi
tories which the college itself
constructed and operated.
The university may have stood
in loco parentis, but no parent
would have comfortably ob
served the sort of Darwinian se
lection that drew muscle, money,
and good teeth into the frater
nities and left the proletariat in
thf dormitories.
Probably there was nothing
'"unusual about this situation dur
ing the administration of War
ren G. Harding. There were dif
ferent kinds of students, and
:the university had in its wisdom
provided different kinds of hous
ing to match.
There are still, thank God, dif
ferent kinds of students, and
they do require different kinds
of living arrangements. But it is
ia peculiar sort of institutional
astigmatism that perceives that
[one kind of student wants the
'truly pleasant sort of house rep
resented by the fraternity clus
•ters, and that another type of
(Student wants to live in a build
ling with the limitations of Toyon
■ Hall. This astigmatism has pro
duced a differential in student
housing at Stanford.
Housing Hypocrisy?
Fifteen years ago, when I was
an undergraduate writing news
paper articles with a fervor that
[precluded an examination of any
• thing so pedestrian as facts, I
J would have called the Univer
sity's maintenance of a differ
ential in housing an example of
• cynicism, hypocrisy, philistinism,
[ and worse, if I could have found
• anything worse in my under-
{ graduate vocabulary. Now it oc
! curs to me, however, that the
contrast between Stern and the
fraternities is not evidence of
: malice but results from a sort
• of short-sightedness and negli
gence that began years ago at
• a time when educational prob
lems seemed much different and
3 the possibilities and purposes of
• residential colleges seemed quite
) a lot narrower.
112 The University has in effect
engendered a system whereby
• certain types of persons tend
to join fraternities (and, with
the advent of the clusters, enjoy
excellent housing), other types
will be drawn to dormitory resi
dences, and still others will,
; either out of choice or because
: (this year) of lack of room on
t campus, end up in Palo Alto's
\Babylonian garden of saunas and
r swimming pools. That the dor
, mitory students (particularly
> those housed in Toyon; Stern
[has some hidden amenities which
112 I'll discuss later) may find them
> selves in surroundings far in
ferior physically to the frater
nity clusters does not concern
us unduly. The dormitory is their
sort of place, after all; they'll
feel more comfortable there,
right where Warren G. Harding
• would have put them.
; The fraternities do not have
i it all their own way, of course.
| They may stage Dionysian revels
112 up on the hill, but down below in
j the Quadrangle the Apollonian
• professors (some of whom may
112 have visited a fraternity house
, at least once) deliver lectures
| against them. The fraternities
• are periodically excoriated for
J their preservation of a social elit
| ism; their indulgence in hazing,
1 unmannerly wenching, and other
| mild forms of rioting; and, gen
| orally, their adherence to an an
\ ti-intellectual culture which is
| contrary to the aims of the Uni
i versity. By reciting all of this
• I don't mean to attest to the
J truth of the accusations; they
j are obviously off the mark in
many cases.
One's own friends are one's
own business, and I'm not much

in favor of abolishing the fra
ternity system as long as there
are people who want to belong
to fraternities. I am in favor,
instead, of establishing resi
dences somewhat more attrac
tive than Stern Hall, so that a
Wilbur freshman can see some
thing out the window besides
Cluster Number Three.
The four new demonstration
houses are, of course, intended to
be those "residences somewhat
more attractive;" two of these
houses are attempting to effect
this transformation in Stern
Hall itself. If I were convinced
that the present system of in
dependent houses should be
abandoned for houses like those
dubbed demonstration houses I
would have stopped this busi
ness several paragraphs back,
but my feelings are emphatically
to the contrary.
Perhaps the independent house
of the future will be a "demon
stration" house; coeducational
living combined with an aca
demic program. This in itself
poses some problems. Conceiv
ably we have some students who
cannot or will not join frater
nities, but who are also reluctant
to live in a house where the very
air of the men's room is sup
posed to vibrate with the process
and substance of an intellectual
house theme. The demonstration
house represents Stanford's at
tempt to fuse students' class
room and social life. This is evi
dently a reaction to the (for
some) disturbing revelation
made about a decade ago by
Paul Jacob and others that a
strong student culture, full of
beer and women and other ir
relevancies, resists the scholar
ly emanations of the classroom.
Compulsory Seminars
The non-fraternity, non-demon
stration student I have just de
scribed may have intellectual in
terests of the highest order, and
yet want to live in an atmos
phere more casual and less struc
tured than that provided by a
demonstration house, with its
house theme, compulsory semi
nar, and rather self-conscious
cultivation of intellectuality.
In the demonstration house
the curriculum moves (in a very
attractive way, I'll admit, but it's
still the curriculum) from the
Quad into the house lounge, and
eventually stalks the student
down the hall to his bedroom.
In a sense we have given up the
hope or pretense that students
will lead intellectually exciting
lives if left to themselves; in
stead, we'll write a program that
will ensure elevated conversation
from breakfast to bedtime.
The aura of excitement about
the Grove and the satisfaction
its residents found in its social
academic program have led us
to believe that similar programs
should be introduced into other
campus residences. The Grove
drew a particular type of stu
dent, however, and although it's
possible that Stanford enrolls
enough of these students to pop
ulate the Grove and the three ad
ditional demonstration houses,
there may be a limit. I believe
that the interests and inclina
tions of most Stanford students
lie somewhere between the en
forced academia of the demon
stration houses and the anti-intel
iectualism which may exist in
the most old-guard of the frater
nities. The Stern houses at their
best, with students drawn from
diverse backgrounds and each
of the four classes participating
in a low-key, voluntary house
cultural and academic program,
may provide the most viable
model for residences at Stanford.
The demonstration houses
seem to have a flaw aside from
their imposed academic regimen.
They have begun an ambitious
program of house seminars
with what is apparently a mini
mum of professorial participa
tion. These seminars are at first
glance sui generis, but they are
in reality a part of a seminar
system that has burgeoned at

Stanford over the past ten years.
In this system "seminar" em
braces everything from senior
colloquia through freshman
seminars, undergraduate spe
cials, and now the in-house semi
nars. This seminar system exists
outside regular departmental of
ferings and constitutes a sort
of minicurriculum that engages
some of our most august pro
fessors but rests heavily on the
talents of untried and in some
cases impromptu instructors.
Minicurriculum
One cannot, or should not, at
least, denigrate the demonstra
tion houses with impertinent epi
thets such as House Theme and
Minicurriculum. Three of the
houses have just begun their
programs, and it would be ridi
culous at this point to adjudge
them as either successes or fail
ures. I think we should keep the
fraternities; continue the demon
strations; but for students who
share my own tastes and preju
duces we should preserve and
improve upon the existing in
dependent houses.
The first Stern houses were
constructed in 1949, and the
house "system (a system which
included at the outset just one
faculty resident, Wilfred Stone
of the English Department, and
some faculty associates) was be
gun in 1958. The Stanford house
plan was apparently designed as
an attempt to fatten the impov
erished dormitories and as an
approach to the house systems
at Harvard and Yale. As a West
Coast approximation of the Ivy
League houses the Stern Hall
enterprises was a fairly pale re
flection.
Professor Stone and the fac
ulty residents who later joined
him labored long and ardently
against impossible odds: the fac
ulty resident was to create an
intellectual Utopia with a maxi
mum of charisma and a mini
mum of money; he was not ex
cused from duties in his own
department, although the job of
faculty resident was a man-eat
er; and the physical arrange
ments at Stern Hall were not
(and are not) always equal to
the demands of student life. Pro
fessor Stone is credited with the
observation that, architecturally,
Stern Hall is suited only to with
stand a siege.
I do not think too much can
be made of the physical differ
ences between Stern Hall and
the fraternity clusters. Although
Stanford University is admir
ably egalitarian in its statements
about students, it perpetuates
the same anomalous distinctions
in students residences which mar
scores of other American col
leges and universities. Freshmen
in Wilbur will soon have vividly
contrasting views of the east
wall of Stern and the north pros
pect of Fraternity Cluster Num
ber Three. Only the aesthetically
purblind will fail to get the mes
sage.

Housing Hypocrisy?
Fifteen years ago, when I was
an undergraduate writing news
paper articles with a fervor that
[precluded an examination of any
• thing so pedestrian as facts, I
J would have called the Univer
sity's maintenance of a differ
ential in housing an example of
• cynicism, hypocrisy, philistinism,
[ and worse, if I could have found
• anything worse in my under-
{ graduate vocabulary. Now it oc
! curs to me, however, that the
contrast between Stern and the
fraternities is not evidence of
: malice but results from a sort
• of short-sightedness and negli
gence that began years ago at
• a time when educational prob
lems seemed much different and
3 the possibilities and purposes of
• residential colleges seemed quite
) a lot narrower.
112 The University has in effect
engendered a system whereby
• certain types of persons tend
to join fraternities (and, with
the advent of the clusters, enjoy
excellent housing), other types
will be drawn to dormitory resi
dences, and still others will,
; either out of choice or because
: (this year) of lack of room on
t campus, end up in Palo Alto's
\Babylonian garden of saunas and
r swimming pools. That the dor
, mitory students (particularly
> those housed in Toyon; Stern
[has some hidden amenities which
112 I'll discuss later) may find them
> selves in surroundings far in
ferior physically to the frater
nity clusters does not concern
us unduly. The dormitory is their
sort of place, after all; they'll
feel more comfortable there,
right where Warren G. Harding
• would have put them.
; The fraternities do not have
i it all their own way, of course.
| They may stage Dionysian revels
112 up on the hill, but down below in
j the Quadrangle the Apollonian
• professors (some of whom may
112 have visited a fraternity house
, at least once) deliver lectures
| against them. The fraternities
• are periodically excoriated for
J their preservation of a social elit
| ism; their indulgence in hazing,
1 unmannerly wenching, and other
| mild forms of rioting; and, gen
| orally, their adherence to an an
\ ti-intellectual culture which is
| contrary to the aims of the Uni
i versity. By reciting all of this
• I don't mean to attest to the
J truth of the accusations; they
j are obviously off the mark in
many cases.
One's own friends are one's
own business, and I'm not much

in favor of abolishing the fra
ternity system as long as there
are people who want to belong
to fraternities. I am in favor,
instead, of establishing resi
dences somewhat more attrac
tive than Stern Hall, so that a
Wilbur freshman can see some
thing out the window besides
Cluster Number Three.
The four new demonstration
houses are, of course, intended to
be those "residences somewhat
more attractive;" two of these
houses are attempting to effect
this transformation in Stern
Hall itself. If I were convinced
that the present system of in
dependent houses should be
abandoned for houses like those
dubbed demonstration houses I
would have stopped this busi
ness several paragraphs back,
but my feelings are emphatically
to the contrary.
Perhaps the independent house
of the future will be a "demon
stration" house; coeducational
living combined with an aca
demic program. This in itself
poses some problems. Conceiv
ably we have some students who
cannot or will not join frater
nities, but who are also reluctant
to live in a house where the very
air of the men's room is sup
posed to vibrate with the process
and substance of an intellectual
house theme. The demonstration
house represents Stanford's at
tempt to fuse students' class
room and social life. This is evi
dently a reaction to the (for
some) disturbing revelation
made about a decade ago by
Paul Jacob and others that a
strong student culture, full of
beer and women and other ir
relevancies, resists the scholar
ly emanations of the classroom.
Compulsory Seminars
The non-fraternity, non-demon
stration student I have just de
scribed may have intellectual in
terests of the highest order, and
yet want to live in an atmos
phere more casual and less struc
tured than that provided by a
demonstration house, with its
house theme, compulsory semi
nar, and rather self-conscious
cultivation of intellectuality.
In the demonstration house
the curriculum moves (in a very
attractive way, I'll admit, but it's
still the curriculum) from the
Quad into the house lounge, and
eventually stalks the student
down the hall to his bedroom.
In a sense we have given up the
hope or pretense that students
will lead intellectually exciting
lives if left to themselves; in
stead, we'll write a program that
will ensure elevated conversation
from breakfast to bedtime.
The aura of excitement about
the Grove and the satisfaction
its residents found in its social
academic program have led us
to believe that similar programs
should be introduced into other
campus residences. The Grove
drew a particular type of stu
dent, however, and although it's
possible that Stanford enrolls
enough of these students to pop
ulate the Grove and the three ad
ditional demonstration houses,
there may be a limit. I believe
that the interests and inclina
tions of most Stanford students
lie somewhere between the en
forced academia of the demon
stration houses and the anti-intel
iectualism which may exist in
the most old-guard of the frater
nities. The Stern houses at their
best, with students drawn from
diverse backgrounds and each
of the four classes participating
in a low-key, voluntary house
cultural and academic program,
may provide the most viable
model for residences at Stanford.
The demonstration houses
seem to have a flaw aside from
their imposed academic regimen.
They have begun an ambitious
program of house seminars
with what is apparently a mini
mum of professorial participa
tion. These seminars are at first
glance sui generis, but they are
in reality a part of a seminar
system that has burgeoned at

Stanford over the past ten years.
In this system "seminar" em
braces everything from senior
colloquia through freshman
seminars, undergraduate spe
cials, and now the in-house semi
nars. This seminar system exists
outside regular departmental of
ferings and constitutes a sort
of minicurriculum that engages
some of our most august pro
fessors but rests heavily on the
talents of untried and in some
cases impromptu instructors.
Minicurriculum
One cannot, or should not, at
least, denigrate the demonstra
tion houses with impertinent epi
thets such as House Theme and
Minicurriculum. Three of the
houses have just begun their
programs, and it would be ridi
culous at this point to adjudge
them as either successes or fail
ures. I think we should keep the
fraternities; continue the demon
strations; but for students who
share my own tastes and preju
duces we should preserve and
improve upon the existing in
dependent houses.
The first Stern houses were
constructed in 1949, and the
house "system (a system which
included at the outset just one
faculty resident, Wilfred Stone
of the English Department, and
some faculty associates) was be
gun in 1958. The Stanford house
plan was apparently designed as
an attempt to fatten the impov
erished dormitories and as an
approach to the house systems
at Harvard and Yale. As a West
Coast approximation of the Ivy
League houses the Stern Hall
enterprises was a fairly pale re
flection.
Professor Stone and the fac
ulty residents who later joined
him labored long and ardently
against impossible odds: the fac
ulty resident was to create an
intellectual Utopia with a maxi
mum of charisma and a mini
mum of money; he was not ex
cused from duties in his own
department, although the job of
faculty resident was a man-eat
er; and the physical arrange
ments at Stern Hall were not
(and are not) always equal to
the demands of student life. Pro
fessor Stone is credited with the
observation that, architecturally,
Stern Hall is suited only to with
stand a siege.

Housing Hypocrisy?
Fifteen years ago, when I was
an undergraduate writing news
paper articles with a fervor that
[precluded an examination of any
• thing so pedestrian as facts, I
J would have called the Univer
sity's maintenance of a differ
ential in housing an example of
• cynicism, hypocrisy, philistinism,
[ and worse, if I could have found
• anything worse in my under-
{ graduate vocabulary. Now it oc
! curs to me, however, that the
contrast between Stern and the
fraternities is not evidence of
: malice but results from a sort
• of short-sightedness and negli
gence that began years ago at
• a time when educational prob
lems seemed much different and
3 the possibilities and purposes of
• residential colleges seemed quite
) a lot narrower.
112 The University has in effect
engendered a system whereby
• certain types of persons tend
to join fraternities (and, with
the advent of the clusters, enjoy
excellent housing), other types
will be drawn to dormitory resi
dences, and still others will,
; either out of choice or because
: (this year) of lack of room on
t campus, end up in Palo Alto's
\Babylonian garden of saunas and
r swimming pools. That the dor
, mitory students (particularly
> those housed in Toyon; Stern
[has some hidden amenities which
112 I'll discuss later) may find them
> selves in surroundings far in
ferior physically to the frater
nity clusters does not concern
us unduly. The dormitory is their
sort of place, after all; they'll
feel more comfortable there,
right where Warren G. Harding
• would have put them.
; The fraternities do not have
i it all their own way, of course.
| They may stage Dionysian revels
112 up on the hill, but down below in
j the Quadrangle the Apollonian
• professors (some of whom may
112 have visited a fraternity house
, at least once) deliver lectures
| against them. The fraternities
• are periodically excoriated for
J their preservation of a social elit
| ism; their indulgence in hazing,
1 unmannerly wenching, and other
| mild forms of rioting; and, gen
| orally, their adherence to an an
\ ti-intellectual culture which is
| contrary to the aims of the Uni
i versity. By reciting all of this
• I don't mean to attest to the
J truth of the accusations; they
j are obviously off the mark in
many cases.
One's own friends are one's
own business, and I'm not much

in favor of abolishing the fra
ternity system as long as there
are people who want to belong
to fraternities. I am in favor,
instead, of establishing resi
dences somewhat more attrac
tive than Stern Hall, so that a
Wilbur freshman can see some
thing out the window besides
Cluster Number Three.
The four new demonstration
houses are, of course, intended to
be those "residences somewhat
more attractive;" two of these
houses are attempting to effect
this transformation in Stern
Hall itself. If I were convinced
that the present system of in
dependent houses should be
abandoned for houses like those
dubbed demonstration houses I
would have stopped this busi
ness several paragraphs back,
but my feelings are emphatically
to the contrary.
Perhaps the independent house
of the future will be a "demon
stration" house; coeducational
living combined with an aca
demic program. This in itself
poses some problems. Conceiv
ably we have some students who
cannot or will not join frater
nities, but who are also reluctant
to live in a house where the very
air of the men's room is sup
posed to vibrate with the process
and substance of an intellectual
house theme. The demonstration
house represents Stanford's at
tempt to fuse students' class
room and social life. This is evi
dently a reaction to the (for
some) disturbing revelation
made about a decade ago by
Paul Jacob and others that a
strong student culture, full of
beer and women and other ir
relevancies, resists the scholar
ly emanations of the classroom.
Compulsory Seminars
The non-fraternity, non-demon
stration student I have just de
scribed may have intellectual in
terests of the highest order, and
yet want to live in an atmos
phere more casual and less struc
tured than that provided by a
demonstration house, with its
house theme, compulsory semi
nar, and rather self-conscious
cultivation of intellectuality.
In the demonstration house
the curriculum moves (in a very
attractive way, I'll admit, but it's
still the curriculum) from the
Quad into the house lounge, and
eventually stalks the student
down the hall to his bedroom.
In a sense we have given up the
hope or pretense that students
will lead intellectually exciting
lives if left to themselves; in
stead, we'll write a program that
will ensure elevated conversation
from breakfast to bedtime.
The aura of excitement about
the Grove and the satisfaction
its residents found in its social
academic program have led us
to believe that similar programs
should be introduced into other
campus residences. The Grove
drew a particular type of stu
dent, however, and although it's
possible that Stanford enrolls
enough of these students to pop
ulate the Grove and the three ad
ditional demonstration houses,
there may be a limit. I believe
that the interests and inclina
tions of most Stanford students
lie somewhere between the en
forced academia of the demon
stration houses and the anti-intel
iectualism which may exist in
the most old-guard of the frater
nities. The Stern houses at their
best, with students drawn from
diverse backgrounds and each
of the four classes participating
in a low-key, voluntary house
cultural and academic program,
may provide the most viable
model for residences at Stanford.
The demonstration houses
seem to have a flaw aside from
their imposed academic regimen.
They have begun an ambitious
program of house seminars
with what is apparently a mini
mum of professorial participa
tion. These seminars are at first
glance sui generis, but they are
in reality a part of a seminar
system that has burgeoned at

Stanford over the past ten years.
In this system "seminar" em
braces everything from senior
colloquia through freshman
seminars, undergraduate spe
cials, and now the in-house semi
nars. This seminar system exists
outside regular departmental of
ferings and constitutes a sort
of minicurriculum that engages
some of our most august pro
fessors but rests heavily on the
talents of untried and in some
cases impromptu instructors.
Minicurriculum
One cannot, or should not, at
least, denigrate the demonstra
tion houses with impertinent epi
thets such as House Theme and
Minicurriculum. Three of the
houses have just begun their
programs, and it would be ridi
culous at this point to adjudge
them as either successes or fail
ures. I think we should keep the
fraternities; continue the demon
strations; but for students who
share my own tastes and preju
duces we should preserve and
improve upon the existing in
dependent houses.
The first Stern houses were
constructed in 1949, and the
house "system (a system which
included at the outset just one
faculty resident, Wilfred Stone
of the English Department, and
some faculty associates) was be
gun in 1958. The Stanford house
plan was apparently designed as
an attempt to fatten the impov
erished dormitories and as an
approach to the house systems
at Harvard and Yale. As a West
Coast approximation of the Ivy
League houses the Stern Hall
enterprises was a fairly pale re

programs, and it would be ridi
culous at this point to adjudge
them as either successes or fail
ures. I think we should keep the
fraternities; continue the demon
strations; but for students who
share my own tastes and preju
duces we should preserve and
improve upon the existing in
dependent houses.
The first Stern houses were
constructed in 1949, and the
house "system (a system which
included at the outset just one
faculty resident, Wilfred Stone
of the English Department, and
some faculty associates) was be
gun in 1958. The Stanford house
plan was apparently designed as
an attempt to fatten the impov
erished dormitories and as an
approach to the house systems
at Harvard and Yale. As a West
Coast approximation of the Ivy
League houses the Stern Hall
enterprises was a fairly pale re
flection.
Professor Stone and the fac
ulty residents who later joined
him labored long and ardently
against impossible odds: the fac
ulty resident was to create an
intellectual Utopia with a maxi
mum of charisma and a mini
mum of money; he was not ex
cused from duties in his own
department, although the job of
faculty resident was a man-eat
er; and the physical arrange
ments at Stern Hall were not
(and are not) always equal to
the demands of student life. Pro
fessor Stone is credited with the
observation that, architecturally,
Stern Hall is suited only to with
stand a siege.
I do not think too much can
be made of the physical differ
ences between Stern Hall and
the fraternity clusters. Although
Stanford University is admir
ably egalitarian in its statements
about students, it perpetuates
the same anomalous distinctions
in students residences which mar
scores of other American col
leges and universities. Freshmen
in Wilbur will soon have vividly
contrasting views of the east

purblind will fail to get the mes

Housing Hypocrisy?
Fifteen years ago, when I was
an undergraduate writing news
paper articles with a fervor that
[precluded an examination of any
• thing so pedestrian as facts, I
J would have called the Univer
sity's maintenance of a differ
ential in housing an example of
• cynicism, hypocrisy, philistinism,
[ and worse, if I could have found
• anything worse in my under-
{ graduate vocabulary. Now it oc
! curs to me, however, that the
contrast between Stern and the
fraternities is not evidence of
: malice but results from a sort
• of short-sightedness and negli
gence that began years ago at
• a time when educational prob
lems seemed much different and
3 the possibilities and purposes of
• residential colleges seemed quite
) a lot narrower.
112 The University has in effect
engendered a system whereby
• certain types of persons tend
to join fraternities (and, with
the advent of the clusters, enjoy
excellent housing), other types
will be drawn to dormitory resi
dences, and still others will,
; either out of choice or because
: (this year) of lack of room on
t campus, end up in Palo Alto's
\Babylonian garden of saunas and
r swimming pools. That the dor
, mitory students (particularly
> those housed in Toyon; Stern
[has some hidden amenities which
112 I'll discuss later) may find them
> selves in surroundings far in
ferior physically to the frater
nity clusters does not concern
us unduly. The dormitory is their
sort of place, after all; they'll
feel more comfortable there,
right where Warren G. Harding
• would have put them.
; The fraternities do not have
i it all their own way, of course.
| They may stage Dionysian revels
112 up on the hill, but down below in
j the Quadrangle the Apollonian
• professors (some of whom may
112 have visited a fraternity house
, at least once) deliver lectures
| against them. The fraternities
• are periodically excoriated for
J their preservation of a social elit
| ism; their indulgence in hazing,
1 unmannerly wenching, and other
| mild forms of rioting; and, gen
| orally, their adherence to an an
\ ti-intellectual culture which is
| contrary to the aims of the Uni
i versity. By reciting all of this
• I don't mean to attest to the
J truth of the accusations; they
j are obviously off the mark in
many cases.
One's own friends are one's
own business, and I'm not much

in favor of abolishing the fra
ternity system as long as there
are people who want to belong
to fraternities. I am in favor,
instead, of establishing resi
dences somewhat more attrac
tive than Stern Hall, so that a
Wilbur freshman can see some
thing out the window besides
Cluster Number Three.
The four new demonstration
houses are, of course, intended to
be those "residences somewhat
more attractive;" two of these
houses are attempting to effect
this transformation in Stern
Hall itself. If I were convinced
that the present system of in
dependent houses should be
abandoned for houses like those
dubbed demonstration houses I
would have stopped this busi
ness several paragraphs back,
but my feelings are emphatically
to the contrary.
Perhaps the independent house
of the future will be a "demon
stration" house; coeducational
living combined with an aca
demic program. This in itself
poses some problems. Conceiv
ably we have some students who
cannot or will not join frater
nities, but who are also reluctant
to live in a house where the very
air of the men's room is sup
posed to vibrate with the process
and substance of an intellectual
house theme. The demonstration
house represents Stanford's at
tempt to fuse students' class
room and social life. This is evi
dently a reaction to the (for
some) disturbing revelation
made about a decade ago by
Paul Jacob and others that a
strong student culture, full of
beer and women and other ir
relevancies, resists the scholar
ly emanations of the classroom.
Compulsory Seminars
The non-fraternity, non-demon
stration student I have just de
scribed may have intellectual in
terests of the highest order, and
yet want to live in an atmos
phere more casual and less struc
tured than that provided by a
demonstration house, with its
house theme, compulsory semi
nar, and rather self-conscious
cultivation of intellectuality.
In the demonstration house
the curriculum moves (in a very
attractive way, I'll admit, but it's
still the curriculum) from the
Quad into the house lounge, and
eventually stalks the student
down the hall to his bedroom.
In a sense we have given up the
hope or pretense that students
will lead intellectually exciting
lives if left to themselves; in
stead, we'll write a program that
will ensure elevated conversation
from breakfast to bedtime.
The aura of excitement about
the Grove and the satisfaction
its residents found in its social
academic program have led us
to believe that similar programs
should be introduced into other
campus residences. The Grove
drew a particular type of stu
dent, however, and although it's
possible that Stanford enrolls
enough of these students to pop
ulate the Grove and the three ad
ditional demonstration houses,
there may be a limit. I believe
that the interests and inclina
tions of most Stanford students
lie somewhere between the en
forced academia of the demon
stration houses and the anti-intel
iectualism which may exist in
the most old-guard of the frater
nities. The Stern houses at their
best, with students drawn from
diverse backgrounds and each
of the four classes participating
in a low-key, voluntary house
cultural and academic program,
may provide the most viable
model for residences at Stanford.
The demonstration houses
seem to have a flaw aside from
their imposed academic regimen.
They have begun an ambitious
program of house seminars
with what is apparently a mini
mum of professorial participa
tion. These seminars are at first
glance sui generis, but they are
in reality a part of a seminar
system that has burgeoned at

Stanford over the past ten years.
In this system "seminar" em
braces everything from senior
colloquia through freshman
seminars, undergraduate spe
cials, and now the in-house semi
nars. This seminar system exists
outside regular departmental of
ferings and constitutes a sort
of minicurriculum that engages
some of our most august pro
fessors but rests heavily on the
talents of untried and in some
cases impromptu instructors.
Minicurriculum
One cannot, or should not, at
least, denigrate the demonstra
tion houses with impertinent epi
thets such as House Theme and
Minicurriculum. Three of the
houses have just begun their
programs, and it would be ridi
culous at this point to adjudge
them as either successes or fail
ures. I think we should keep the
fraternities; continue the demon

in reality a part of a seminar
system that has burgeoned at

Stanford over the past ten years.
In this system "seminar" em
braces everything from senior
colloquia through freshman
seminars, undergraduate spe
cials, and now the in-house semi
nars. This seminar system exists
outside regular departmental of
ferings and constitutes a sort
of minicurriculum that engages
some of our most august pro
fessors but rests heavily on the
talents of untried and in some
cases impromptu instructors.
Minicurriculum
One cannot, or should not, at
least, denigrate the demonstra
tion houses with impertinent epi
thets such as House Theme and
Minicurriculum. Three of the
houses have just begun their
programs, and it would be ridi
culous at this point to adjudge
them as either successes or fail
ures. I think we should keep the
fraternities; continue the demon
strations; but for students who
share my own tastes and preju
duces we should preserve and
improve upon the existing in
dependent houses.
The first Stern houses were
constructed in 1949, and the
house "system (a system which
included at the outset just one
faculty resident, Wilfred Stone
of the English Department, and
some faculty associates) was be
gun in 1958. The Stanford house
plan was apparently designed as
an attempt to fatten the impov
erished dormitories and as an
approach to the house systems
at Harvard and Yale. As a West
Coast approximation of the Ivy
League houses the Stern Hall
enterprises was a fairly pale re
flection.
Professor Stone and the fac
ulty residents who later joined
him labored long and ardently
against impossible odds: the fac
ulty resident was to create an
intellectual Utopia with a maxi
mum of charisma and a mini
mum of money; he was not ex
cused from duties in his own
department, although the job of
faculty resident was a man-eat
er; and the physical arrange
ments at Stern Hall were not
(and are not) always equal to
the demands of student life. Pro
fessor Stone is credited with the
observation that, architecturally,
Stern Hall is suited only to with
stand a siege.
I do not think too much can
be made of the physical differ
ences between Stern Hall and
the fraternity clusters. Although
Stanford University is admir
ably egalitarian in its statements
about students, it perpetuates
the same anomalous distinctions
in students residences which mar
scores of other American col
leges and universities. Freshmen
in Wilbur will soon have vividly
contrasting views of the east
wall of Stern and the north pros
pect of Fraternity Cluster Num
ber Three. Only the aesthetically
purblind will fail to get the mes
sage.

Housing Hypocrisy?
Fifteen years ago, when I was
an undergraduate writing news
paper articles with a fervor that
[precluded an examination of any
• thing so pedestrian as facts, I
J would have called the Univer
sity's maintenance of a differ
ential in housing an example of
• cynicism, hypocrisy, philistinism,
[ and worse, if I could have found
• anything worse in my under-
{ graduate vocabulary. Now it oc
! curs to me, however, that the
contrast between Stern and the
fraternities is not evidence of
: malice but results from a sort
• of short-sightedness and negli
gence that began years ago at
• a time when educational prob
lems seemed much different and
3 the possibilities and purposes of
• residential colleges seemed quite
) a lot narrower.
112 The University has in effect
engendered a system whereby
• certain types of persons tend
to join fraternities (and, with
the advent of the clusters, enjoy
excellent housing), other types
will be drawn to dormitory resi
dences, and still others will,
; either out of choice or because
: (this year) of lack of room on
t campus, end up in Palo Alto's
\Babylonian garden of saunas and
r swimming pools. That the dor
, mitory students (particularly
> those housed in Toyon; Stern
[has some hidden amenities which
112 I'll discuss later) may find them
> selves in surroundings far in
ferior physically to the frater
nity clusters does not concern
us unduly. The dormitory is their
sort of place, after all; they'll
feel more comfortable there,
right where Warren G. Harding
• would have put them.
; The fraternities do not have
i it all their own way, of course.
| They may stage Dionysian revels
112 up on the hill, but down below in
j the Quadrangle the Apollonian
• professors (some of whom may
112 have visited a fraternity house
, at least once) deliver lectures
| against them. The fraternities
• are periodically excoriated for
J their preservation of a social elit
| ism; their indulgence in hazing,
1 unmannerly wenching, and other
| mild forms of rioting; and, gen
| orally, their adherence to an an
\ ti-intellectual culture which is
| contrary to the aims of the Uni
i versity. By reciting all of this
• I don't mean to attest to the
J truth of the accusations; they
j are obviously off the mark in
many cases.
One's own friends are one's
own business, and I'm not much

in favor of abolishing the fra
ternity system as long as there
are people who want to belong
to fraternities. I am in favor,
instead, of establishing resi
dences somewhat more attrac
tive than Stern Hall, so that a
Wilbur freshman can see some
thing out the window besides
Cluster Number Three.
The four new demonstration
houses are, of course, intended to
be those "residences somewhat
more attractive;" two of these
houses are attempting to effect
this transformation in Stern
Hall itself. If I were convinced
that the present system of in
dependent houses should be
abandoned for houses like those
dubbed demonstration houses I
would have stopped this busi
ness several paragraphs back,
but my feelings are emphatically
to the contrary.
Perhaps the independent house
of the future will be a "demon
stration" house; coeducational
living combined with an aca
demic program. This in itself
poses some problems. Conceiv
ably we have some students who
cannot or will not join frater
nities, but who are also reluctant
to live in a house where the very
air of the men's room is sup
posed to vibrate with the process
and substance of an intellectual
house theme. The demonstration
house represents Stanford's at
tempt to fuse students' class
room and social life. This is evi
dently a reaction to the (for
some) disturbing revelation
made about a decade ago by
Paul Jacob and others that a
strong student culture, full of
beer and women and other ir
relevancies, resists the scholar
ly emanations of the classroom.
Compulsory Seminars
The non-fraternity, non-demon
stration student I have just de
scribed may have intellectual in
terests of the highest order, and
yet want to live in an atmos
phere more casual and less struc
tured than that provided by a
demonstration house, with its
house theme, compulsory semi
nar, and rather self-conscious
cultivation of intellectuality.
In the demonstration house
the curriculum moves (in a very
attractive way, I'll admit, but it's
still the curriculum) from the
Quad into the house lounge, and
eventually stalks the student
down the hall to his bedroom.
In a sense we have given up the
hope or pretense that students
will lead intellectually exciting
lives if left to themselves; in
stead, we'll write a program that
will ensure elevated conversation
from breakfast to bedtime.
The aura of excitement about
the Grove and the satisfaction
its residents found in its social
academic program have led us
to believe that similar programs
should be introduced into other
campus residences. The Grove
drew a particular type of stu
dent, however, and although it's
possible that Stanford enrolls
enough of these students to pop
ulate the Grove and the three ad
ditional demonstration houses,
there may be a limit. I believe
that the interests and inclina
tions of most Stanford students
lie somewhere between the en
forced academia of the demon
stration houses and the anti-intel
iectualism which may exist in
the most old-guard of the frater
nities. The Stern houses at their
best, with students drawn from
diverse backgrounds and each
of the four classes participating
in a low-key, voluntary house
cultural and academic program,
may provide the most viable
model for residences at Stanford.
The demonstration houses
seem to have a flaw aside from
their imposed academic regimen.
They have begun an ambitious
program of house seminars
with what is apparently a mini
mum of professorial participa
tion. These seminars are at first
glance sui generis, but they are
in reality a part of a seminar

that the interests and inclina
tions of most Stanford students
lie somewhere between the en
forced academia of the demon
stration houses and the anti-intel
iectualism which may exist in
the most old-guard of the frater
nities. The Stern houses at their
best, with students drawn from
diverse backgrounds and each
of the four classes participating
in a low-key, voluntary house
cultural and academic program,
may provide the most viable
model for residences at Stanford.
The demonstration houses
seem to have a flaw aside from
their imposed academic regimen.
They have begun an ambitious
program of house seminars
with what is apparently a mini
mum of professorial participa
tion. These seminars are at first
glance sui generis, but they are
in reality a part of a seminar
system that has burgeoned at

Stanford over the past ten years.
In this system "seminar" em
braces everything from senior
colloquia through freshman
seminars, undergraduate spe
cials, and now the in-house semi
nars. This seminar system exists
outside regular departmental of
ferings and constitutes a sort
of minicurriculum that engages
some of our most august pro
fessors but rests heavily on the
talents of untried and in some
cases impromptu instructors.
Minicurriculum
One cannot, or should not, at
least, denigrate the demonstra
tion houses with impertinent epi
thets such as House Theme and
Minicurriculum. Three of the
houses have just begun their
programs, and it would be ridi
culous at this point to adjudge
them as either successes or fail
ures. I think we should keep the
fraternities; continue the demon
strations; but for students who
share my own tastes and preju
duces we should preserve and
improve upon the existing in
dependent houses.
The first Stern houses were
constructed in 1949, and the
house "system (a system which
included at the outset just one
faculty resident, Wilfred Stone
of the English Department, and
some faculty associates) was be
gun in 1958. The Stanford house
plan was apparently designed as
an attempt to fatten the impov
erished dormitories and as an
approach to the house systems
at Harvard and Yale. As a West
Coast approximation of the Ivy
League houses the Stern Hall
enterprises was a fairly pale re
flection.
Professor Stone and the fac
ulty residents who later joined
him labored long and ardently
against impossible odds: the fac
ulty resident was to create an
intellectual Utopia with a maxi
mum of charisma and a mini
mum of money; he was not ex
cused from duties in his own
department, although the job of
faculty resident was a man-eat
er; and the physical arrange
ments at Stern Hall were not
(and are not) always equal to
the demands of student life. Pro
fessor Stone is credited with the
observation that, architecturally,
Stern Hall is suited only to with
stand a siege.
I do not think too much can
be made of the physical differ
ences between Stern Hall and
the fraternity clusters. Although
Stanford University is admir
ably egalitarian in its statements
about students, it perpetuates
the same anomalous distinctions
in students residences which mar
scores of other American col
leges and universities. Freshmen
in Wilbur will soon have vividly
contrasting views of the east
wall of Stern and the north pros
pect of Fraternity Cluster Num
ber Three. Only the aesthetically
purblind will fail to get the mes
sage.

j The residential arrangements
4t Stanford reflect an American
which became fixed
Garly in this century.
• Colleges and universities of
fered three apparent alternatives
to students: they might live in
town; they might pledge fra
ternities and sororities, which
ranged in their amenities from
ramshackle homes reconverted
to Greek-letter tenements to ele
gant chateaux designed to indi
cate that an eighteen-year-old
man had indeed achieved suc
cess in the world; or, lacking
imagination and other resources,
they might live in the dormi
tories which the college itself
constructed and operated.
The university may have stood
in loco parentis, but no parent
would have comfortably ob
served the sort of Darwinian se
lection that drew muscle, money,
and good teeth into the frater
nities and left the proletariat in
thf dormitories.
Probably there was nothing
'"unusual about this situation dur
ing the administration of War
ren G. Harding. There were dif
ferent kinds of students, and
:the university had in its wisdom
provided different kinds of hous
ing to match.
There are still, thank God, dif
ferent kinds of students, and
they do require different kinds
of living arrangements. But it is
ia peculiar sort of institutional
astigmatism that perceives that
[one kind of student wants the
'truly pleasant sort of house rep
resented by the fraternity clus
•ters, and that another type of
(Student wants to live in a build
ling with the limitations of Toyon
■ Hall. This astigmatism has pro
duced a differential in student
housing at Stanford.
Housing Hypocrisy?
Fifteen years ago, when I was
an undergraduate writing news
paper articles with a fervor that
[precluded an examination of any
• thing so pedestrian as facts, I
J would have called the Univer
sity's maintenance of a differ
ential in housing an example of
• cynicism, hypocrisy, philistinism,
[ and worse, if I could have found
• anything worse in my under-
{ graduate vocabulary. Now it oc
! curs to me, however, that the
contrast between Stern and the
fraternities is not evidence of
: malice but results from a sort
• of short-sightedness and negli
gence that began years ago at
• a time when educational prob
lems seemed much different and
3 the possibilities and purposes of
• residential colleges seemed quite
) a lot narrower.
112 The University has in effect
engendered a system whereby
• certain types of persons tend
to join fraternities (and, with
the advent of the clusters, enjoy
excellent housing), other types
will be drawn to dormitory resi
dences, and still others will,
; either out of choice or because
: (this year) of lack of room on
t campus, end up in Palo Alto's
\Babylonian garden of saunas and
r swimming pools. That the dor
, mitory students (particularly
> those housed in Toyon; Stern
[has some hidden amenities which
112 I'll discuss later) may find them
> selves in surroundings far in
ferior physically to the frater
nity clusters does not concern
us unduly. The dormitory is their
sort of place, after all; they'll
feel more comfortable there,
right where Warren G. Harding
• would have put them.
; The fraternities do not have
i it all their own way, of course.
| They may stage Dionysian revels
112 up on the hill, but down below in
j the Quadrangle the Apollonian
• professors (some of whom may
112 have visited a fraternity house
, at least once) deliver lectures
| against them. The fraternities
• are periodically excoriated for
J their preservation of a social elit
| ism; their indulgence in hazing,
1 unmannerly wenching, and other
| mild forms of rioting; and, gen
| orally, their adherence to an an
\ ti-intellectual culture which is
| contrary to the aims of the Uni
i versity. By reciting all of this
• I don't mean to attest to the
J truth of the accusations; they
j are obviously off the mark in
many cases.
One's own friends are one's
own business, and I'm not much

in favor of abolishing the fra
ternity system as long as there
are people who want to belong
to fraternities. I am in favor,
instead, of establishing resi
dences somewhat more attrac
tive than Stern Hall, so that a
Wilbur freshman can see some
thing out the window besides
Cluster Number Three.
The four new demonstration
houses are, of course, intended to
be those "residences somewhat
more attractive;" two of these
houses are attempting to effect
this transformation in Stern
Hall itself. If I were convinced
that the present system of in
dependent houses should be
abandoned for houses like those
dubbed demonstration houses I
would have stopped this busi
ness several paragraphs back,
but my feelings are emphatically
to the contrary.
Perhaps the independent house
of the future will be a "demon
stration" house; coeducational
living combined with an aca
demic program. This in itself
poses some problems. Conceiv
ably we have some students who
cannot or will not join frater
nities, but who are also reluctant
to live in a house where the very
air of the men's room is sup
posed to vibrate with the process
and substance of an intellectual
house theme. The demonstration
house represents Stanford's at
tempt to fuse students' class
room and social life. This is evi
dently a reaction to the (for
some) disturbing revelation
made about a decade ago by
Paul Jacob and others that a
strong student culture, full of
beer and women and other ir
relevancies, resists the scholar
ly emanations of the classroom.
Compulsory Seminars
The non-fraternity, non-demon
stration student I have just de
scribed may have intellectual in
terests of the highest order, and
yet want to live in an atmos
phere more casual and less struc
tured than that provided by a
demonstration house, with its
house theme, compulsory semi
nar, and rather self-conscious
cultivation of intellectuality.
In the demonstration house
the curriculum moves (in a very
attractive way, I'll admit, but it's
still the curriculum) from the
Quad into the house lounge, and
eventually stalks the student
down the hall to his bedroom.
In a sense we have given up the
hope or pretense that students
will lead intellectually exciting
lives if left to themselves; in
stead, we'll write a program that
will ensure elevated conversation
from breakfast to bedtime.
The aura of excitement about
the Grove and the satisfaction
its residents found in its social
academic program have led us
to believe that similar programs
should be introduced into other
campus residences. The Grove
drew a particular type of stu
dent, however, and although it's
possible that Stanford enrolls
enough of these students to pop
ulate the Grove and the three ad
ditional demonstration houses,
there may be a limit. I believe
that the interests and inclina
tions of most Stanford students
lie somewhere between the en
forced academia of the demon
stration houses and the anti-intel
iectualism which may exist in
the most old-guard of the frater
nities. The Stern houses at their
best, with students drawn from
diverse backgrounds and each
