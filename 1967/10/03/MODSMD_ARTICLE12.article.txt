# The 						Black Maze-Saddha
## Beautiful America 
### Theodore F. Spearman, Jr 
The summer has ended and
once again the fantasies of the
past few months are bludgeoned
aside by the great and omnipo
tent American Illusion — Amer
ica (sometimes called the pur
suit of autologos through men
tal dialectic). And it is certain
that our hearts should weep
long for our loss.
America the beautiful — yes,
the hills are green and the val
leys bear fruit while in the voids
we find that the designs of men
tal ingenuity are quite breath
taking. Yet, the price of Amer
ica's artifacts has been the nega
tion of reality when concerned
with the art of human respect.
Though America's matter bears
beauty, its mental and manly
by-products show filth, ignor
ance and cowardice (all of which
are usually covered up by an
identity crisis).
For, while exploiting nature
to create objects, America was
unable to distinguish humanity
from matter, a distinction it has
yet to make.
Pimps Of Progress
A poet, Charles Olson, once
described people as "the pimps
of progress," and playwright Le-
Roi Jones has gone on to imply
that these pimps "are not simply
people — but a nation." But
what hot mouths dare mention
this to anyone when not con
cealed behind the veil of Utopian
discourse or the pediment of
human fury and love.
When we look back upon the
past ages of human pain, Amer
icans usually profess an intense
anguish while acknowledging the
barbarian's survival of the fittest
techniques or Rome's gladia
torial spectaculars.
Americans say, "isn't that just
awful" when referring to the
millions of skeletons which lie
under the ancient shipping
routes between Africa's west
coast and America's east coast.
The twain did meet.

While America sees all of the
crucibles of the past and those
of other people, who sees her
own? Who, besides twenty-five
million black crucibles? What is
the basic difference between
America's "rugged individual
ism" and the barbarians' survi
val - of - the • fittest techniques?
None!
What is the difference between
the Roman spectactor who
watched the gladiator's knife
cut the throat of a defenseless
victim and the American spec
tator who watches America's
Neanderthal-type system rape,
murder and plunder mentally
and physically its defenseless
victims? None!
Whatever exists within Amer
ica today exists for one of two
reasons: 1) The majority wantr:
it or 2) the majority doesn't
really care.
Yes, there is a great evil that
haunts our land; and it will
cause many to weep in its re
volting wake. Yet, a few of us
have been weeping for many
centuries, leaving us dry of
tears. For they have been re
placed with blood anger.
America's hallow reed isn'l
hollow.

with the art of human respect.
Though America's matter bears
beauty, its mental and manly
by-products show filth, ignor
ance and cowardice (all of which
are usually covered up by an
identity crisis).
For, while exploiting nature
to create objects, America was
unable to distinguish humanity
from matter, a distinction it has
yet to make.
Pimps Of Progress
A poet, Charles Olson, once
described people as "the pimps
of progress," and playwright Le-
Roi Jones has gone on to imply
that these pimps "are not simply
people — but a nation." But
what hot mouths dare mention
this to anyone when not con
cealed behind the veil of Utopian
discourse or the pediment of
human fury and love.
When we look back upon the
past ages of human pain, Amer
icans usually profess an intense
anguish while acknowledging the
barbarian's survival of the fittest
techniques or Rome's gladia
torial spectaculars.
Americans say, "isn't that just
awful" when referring to the
millions of skeletons which lie
under the ancient shipping
routes between Africa's west
coast and America's east coast.
The twain did meet.

While America sees all of the
crucibles of the past and those
of other people, who sees her
own? Who, besides twenty-five
million black crucibles? What is
the basic difference between
America's "rugged individual
ism" and the barbarians' survi
val - of - the • fittest techniques?
None!
What is the difference between
the Roman spectactor who
watched the gladiator's knife
cut the throat of a defenseless
victim and the American spec
tator who watches America's
Neanderthal-type system rape,
murder and plunder mentally
and physically its defenseless
victims? None!
Whatever exists within Amer
ica today exists for one of two
reasons: 1) The majority wantr:
it or 2) the majority doesn't
really care.
Yes, there is a great evil that
haunts our land; and it will
cause many to weep in its re
volting wake. Yet, a few of us
have been weeping for many
centuries, leaving us dry of
tears. For they have been re
placed with blood anger.
America's hallow reed isn'l
hollow.

The summer has ended and
once again the fantasies of the
past few months are bludgeoned
aside by the great and omnipo
tent American Illusion — Amer
ica (sometimes called the pur
suit of autologos through men
tal dialectic). And it is certain
that our hearts should weep
long for our loss.
America the beautiful — yes,
the hills are green and the val
leys bear fruit while in the voids
we find that the designs of men
tal ingenuity are quite breath
taking. Yet, the price of Amer
ica's artifacts has been the nega
tion of reality when concerned
with the art of human respect.
