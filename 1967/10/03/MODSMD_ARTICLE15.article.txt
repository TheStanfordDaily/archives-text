# Dedication Is Key To Roofs Success
## A 						Daily Sports Profile 
### NICK SELBY 
What does it take to be suc
cessful athlete and a good stu
dent in college? Jack Root, a
Stanford fullback and one of the
tri-captains, seems to have found
the answer: supreme dedication.
"College is dedication on a
higher plane than high school,"
he says."It really tests you.
Many people think they know
what demands there are. But
they're filled with misconcep
tions about athletes from stories
on athletic machines at other
schools."
Root includes the Stanford
campus in this criticism, saying
that he feels many people don't
recognize the achievements of
Stanford athletes. He is certain
ly more subject to respect for
his grid achievements and his
3.5 CPA.
Root doesn't find academics
and athletics working at cross
purposes. "The same drive to

ward a certain goal is necessary
in both areas."
Not Good Enough
Certainly a major paradox for
many Stanford fans this fall was

the fact that in the first two
games Root didn't start. Greg
Broughton, a junior who saw
limited action last year, had re
placed him.
Root explains that when he
came back from the England
campus after missing spring
practice Broughton had become
a better player. "It was my
choice to miss spring ball, and
when I came back I couldn't
beat him out."

"It wasn't so much that my
timing was off or that I was out
of shape. He was simply better,"
he concludes.
"Greg and I have talked about
who will start and we've agreed
that it doesn't matter. We're
both more interested in a win
ning team than in who starts."
Root agrees that having
Broughton around has forced
him to work a lot harder. "When
you have someone pressing you
and don't want to have a bad
game, you can't relax," he says.
Root's principal use on the
gridiron is as a "dive" play run
ner, plunging through the line
and leaping for short yardage.
He says he is happy in that capa
city, that he feels he is most
suited for thai type of play.
British Experience
Although Root's decision to
go overseas cost him his start
ing position, he maintains that
the experience was very benefi
cial. "I didn't come here just to
be a football player. It was a

tremendous amount of fun," he
adds.
Root's experience with British
athletes was limited to basket
ball games with local clubs.
He said that the group's ath
letic chairman arranged a game
with Oxford (and Bill Bradley)
and that they lost the game by
about twenty points. And he
adds, "There were more oppor
tunities to stay in shape than I
took advantage of."
He noticed the characteristic
British emphasis on sportsman
ship and friendship between con
testants. "They don't have the
contestants keeping apart before
a game, meeting on the field,
and then going apart again as
we do here," he said.
But he felt that it was hard to
make a judgment for or against
this model. "I don't feel that
they get the deep satisfaction
that comes from winning be
cause they aren't as serious. It's
too bad we can't have both as
pects."

Root said he was unsure
whether the overseas experience
had changed his viewpoints on
any issues. He felt that it made
him more tolerant of other posi
tions, but was unable to men
tion a specific case. He said it
didn't change his outlook on
Stanford sports or United States
foreign policy.
Friendships
Root, an economics major who
plans to go into either law school
or business school depending on
his draft status at the end of
this year, recently wrote a let
ter to The Daily.

"I get tired seeing the paper
act as a great leader, attacking
athletics, fraternities, 'sopho
moric" school spirit, and the like.
I saw the freshman issue and
realized that it would continue
to be that way," he said about it.
What has playing football at
Stanford meant for Root? "Un
doubtedly, the friendships I've
made have been the most mean
ingful thing. We've all been dedi
cated to getting a winner and
although that hasn't been done
yet, certainly the effort's been
there. I haven't regretted play
ing at all."
