# Crowds, Deficit At Summer Festival
## 
### 
Attendance at Stanford's 1967
Summer Festival totalled 73,530
—the highest figure in the four
year history of the festival.
Some 52,430 persons pur
chased tickets to see the 86
events during the 52-day festi
val. Paid attendance averaged
61.4 per cent of capacity for the
season. More than 21,100 people
attended the 47 free events, in
cluding three exhibitions.
Despite record attendance, the
summer festival lost money.
Festival director Virgil K. Whit
aker explained the problem.
"No important festival breaks
even. This past summer we
attempted to hold our deficit to

the modest sum of $50,000. We
are happy to report that, by
careful management and be
cause of the success of many at
tractions, we were able to stage
the program for somewhat less
than the $50,000 subsidy that
was our target."
Two widely divergent musical
attractions were the attendance
leaders in tfie 1967 season—New
York Pro Muscia and the Pres
ervation Hall Jazz Band. Both
played to capacity audiences for
all their festival concerts.
The four-week return engage
ment of the American Conserva
tory Theatre drew 21,181 people
—largest attendance for any at
traction at the festival.
