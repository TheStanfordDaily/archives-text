# Luce, Former Head Of IVS, Arrives Here, Blasts Viet War
## 
### MICHAEL MORTON 
Donald Luce, who resigned as
director of the International Vol
untary Service (1.V.5.) in Viet
nam two weeks ago in protest
against U.S. policy, begins a na
tionwide speaking tour today at
Stanford.
Tonight at 8:30 p.m. in Tresid
der large lounge he will discuss
the Vietnam war and his refusal
to "become a part of the destruc
tion of a people I love." He will
be Wilbur guest-in-residence.
Luce will leave Stanford after
his address tonight to continue
his three-month speaking tour.
He intends to write on his Viet
nam experiences and eventually
work against the war from some
position in university life.
Luce arrived last night at San
Francisco International Airport
from Vietnam, where he has
spent the last nine years as a
member of 1.V.5., which sent

volunteer workers to aid Viet
namese peasants. Forty-five vol
unteers, including other top offi
cials, joined Luce in his resig
nation and signed a letter harsh
ly criticizing the U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam.
Pressure To Speak Out
At a press conference follow
ing his arrival Luce said that his
resignation was prompted by
"continual pressure from Viet
namese friends to speak out on
problems which they saw, es
pecially measures being taken
against youth," and "attempts
on the part of the U.S. mission
to use I.V.S. politically, particu
larly during the Buddhist up
rising of last April,
"The hope that I have is to
provide a better understanding
in the United States of pressures
on the Vietnamese, of problems
they face ... and to lead to a

ceasefire and a permanent
peace," he said.
Replying to a question as to
what, if any, chance there is for
a way out of the Vietnam mo
rass, Luce said that he sees
"hope for a solution in a cessa
tion of the bombing, a willing
ness to de-escalate and discuss
peace with all concerned par
ties," among whom the National
Liberation Front is "one of the
most important . . . there must
the agreement in the negotia
tions that no. elements will be
discriminated against because of
previous associations."
Luce pointed out that "for
many Vietnamese there lives
have been ruined." When he left
Vietnam, his friends congratu
lated him for his courage in
making public his opposition to
the war, saying, "We'd be put in
jail for saying these things."
Commenting on the recent
elections in South Vietnam,
Luce said that he considers them
a fraud by the very nature of
incomplete voter registration,
stating that the ticket of Thieu
and Ky received "fewer votes
than there are in Viet Cong con
trolled areas."
He believes that in a complete
ly free and open election the
"person speaking loudest for
peace" would probably win, and
that this would be Gen. "Big"
Minh. In a national reunification
election, he is certain that the

winner would be Ho Chi Minh.
Luce sees no simple or imme
diate end to the fighting, saying
that "if we left today, most
everyone in Vietnam would be
out of a job; we must initiate
work for peace, but we can't
hope for a one day withdrawal."
He believes that there exists
the possibility of a complete take
over by the NLF, but says that
such an event would leave the
country no better off than it is
now. He stated that the most
likely end desirable conclusion
would be the establishment of
a coalition government.
In addition to Luce, I.V.S.
members submitting resigna
tions were Don Ronk of Areata,
Calif., the team leader in the
Danang area; Willie Meyes of
Souderton, Pa., leader in the
Mekong Delta area; and Gene
Stoltzfus of Aurora, Ohio, as
sociate chief for community de
velopment, refugee, and youth
work.
In the letter, reported in the
New York Times of September
20, Luce said, "We have seen
enough to know that the only
monuments to this war will be
the dead, the maimed, the des
pairing, and the forlorn. The
trend has been escalation of the
war. We say the trend should
be de-escalation."
U.S. officials in Vietnam ad
mitted hearing rumors of the
resignations several weeks be

fore the fact, but declined com
ment. The Times reported "that
it was not the resignations but
the public protest against the
war that "stunned the United
States mission in Saigon and aid
officials in Washington."
The letter, delivered to U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
on September 20, stated that an
ti-Americanism is growing in
Vietnam, and that Washington
is supporting a "government
which jails pacifists and neutra
lists." Luce insists that the suf
fering of the Vietnamese is
"greatly intensified by today's
American presence."
He has urged President John
son to halt the bombing of North
Vietnam, to recognize the Na
tional Liberation Front (the po
litical arm of the Viet Cong),
and to begin peace talks by turn
ing the question of the war over
"to an international peace com
mission and to be prepared to
accept its recommendation."
Reports Submitted
Luce stated that both he and
his co-workers had repeatedly
submitted recommendations on
all aspects of the war to the U.S.
mission in Saigon with the only
answer an invitation to fill out a
report form. He describes the
situation as a "land of report

writing . . . We're leaving here
because this is the only way to
express our disagreement with
the tragedy going on here."
Sources in both Washington
and Vietnam saw the multiple
resignations as possibly bring
ing to a head a conflict which
has been developing for some
time between several volunteer
relief agencies and the U.S. mis
sion. The dispute centers on the
right of the volunteer workers
to discuss the war with Amer
icans and Vietnamese, and an
ever-increasing pressure on the
part of the U.S. to bring relief

workers more fully into the war
effort.
Luce, who speaks fluent Viet
namese, has traveled through
out the country, is highly re
garded by the Vietnamese peo
ple. Though only 33 years old,
he has headed the I.V.S. in
Vietnam for the past four years.
He left for volunteer work there
immediately after completing a
graduate program in agricul
tural development at Cornell
nine years ago. His ties to that
country are indicated by his oft
repeated plans to spend the rest
of his life there.

"greatly intensified by today's
American presence."
He has urged President John
son to halt the bombing of North
Vietnam, to recognize the Na
tional Liberation Front (the po
litical arm of the Viet Cong),
and to begin peace talks by turn
ing the question of the war over
"to an international peace com
mission and to be prepared to
accept its recommendation."
Reports Submitted
Luce stated that both he and
his co-workers had repeatedly
submitted recommendations on
all aspects of the war to the U.S.
mission in Saigon with the only
answer an invitation to fill out a
report form. He describes the
situation as a "land of report

writing . . . We're leaving here
because this is the only way to
express our disagreement with
the tragedy going on here."
Sources in both Washington
and Vietnam saw the multiple
resignations as possibly bring
ing to a head a conflict which
has been developing for some
time between several volunteer
relief agencies and the U.S. mis
sion. The dispute centers on the
right of the volunteer workers
to discuss the war with Amer
icans and Vietnamese, and an
ever-increasing pressure on the
part of the U.S. to bring relief

workers more fully into the war
effort.
Luce, who speaks fluent Viet
namese, has traveled through
out the country, is highly re
garded by the Vietnamese peo
ple. Though only 33 years old,
he has headed the I.V.S. in
Vietnam for the past four years.
He left for volunteer work there
immediately after completing a
graduate program in agricul
tural development at Cornell
nine years ago. His ties to that
country are indicated by his oft
repeated plans to spend the rest
of his life there.
Donald Luce, who resigned as
director of the International Vol
untary Service (1.V.5.) in Viet
nam two weeks ago in protest
against U.S. policy, begins a na
tionwide speaking tour today at
Stanford.
Tonight at 8:30 p.m. in Tresid
der large lounge he will discuss
the Vietnam war and his refusal
to "become a part of the destruc
tion of a people I love." He will
be Wilbur guest-in-residence.
Luce will leave Stanford after
his address tonight to continue
his three-month speaking tour.
He intends to write on his Viet
nam experiences and eventually
work against the war from some
position in university life.
Luce arrived last night at San
Francisco International Airport
from Vietnam, where he has
spent the last nine years as a
member of 1.V.5., which sent

volunteer workers to aid Viet
namese peasants. Forty-five vol
unteers, including other top offi
cials, joined Luce in his resig
nation and signed a letter harsh
ly criticizing the U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam.
Pressure To Speak Out
At a press conference follow
ing his arrival Luce said that his
resignation was prompted by
"continual pressure from Viet
namese friends to speak out on
problems which they saw, es
pecially measures being taken
against youth," and "attempts
on the part of the U.S. mission
to use I.V.S. politically, particu
larly during the Buddhist up
rising of last April,
"The hope that I have is to
provide a better understanding
in the United States of pressures
on the Vietnamese, of problems
they face ... and to lead to a

ceasefire and a permanent
peace," he said.
Replying to a question as to
what, if any, chance there is for
a way out of the Vietnam mo
rass, Luce said that he sees
"hope for a solution in a cessa
tion of the bombing, a willing
ness to de-escalate and discuss
peace with all concerned par
ties," among whom the National
Liberation Front is "one of the
most important . . . there must
the agreement in the negotia
tions that no. elements will be
discriminated against because of
previous associations."
Luce pointed out that "for
many Vietnamese there lives
have been ruined." When he left
Vietnam, his friends congratu
lated him for his courage in
making public his opposition to
the war, saying, "We'd be put in
jail for saying these things."
Commenting on the recent
elections in South Vietnam,
Luce said that he considers them
a fraud by the very nature of
incomplete voter registration,
stating that the ticket of Thieu
and Ky received "fewer votes
than there are in Viet Cong con
trolled areas."
He believes that in a complete
ly free and open election the
"person speaking loudest for
peace" would probably win, and
that this would be Gen. "Big"
Minh. In a national reunification
election, he is certain that the

winner would be Ho Chi Minh.
Luce sees no simple or imme
diate end to the fighting, saying
that "if we left today, most
everyone in Vietnam would be
out of a job; we must initiate
work for peace, but we can't
hope for a one day withdrawal."
He believes that there exists
the possibility of a complete take
over by the NLF, but says that
such an event would leave the
country no better off than it is
now. He stated that the most
likely end desirable conclusion
would be the establishment of
a coalition government.
In addition to Luce, I.V.S.
members submitting resigna
tions were Don Ronk of Areata,
Calif., the team leader in the
Danang area; Willie Meyes of
Souderton, Pa., leader in the
Mekong Delta area; and Gene
Stoltzfus of Aurora, Ohio, as
sociate chief for community de
velopment, refugee, and youth
work.
In the letter, reported in the
New York Times of September
20, Luce said, "We have seen
enough to know that the only
monuments to this war will be
the dead, the maimed, the des
pairing, and the forlorn. The
trend has been escalation of the
war. We say the trend should
be de-escalation."
U.S. officials in Vietnam ad
mitted hearing rumors of the
resignations several weeks be

fore the fact, but declined com
ment. The Times reported "that
it was not the resignations but
the public protest against the
war that "stunned the United
States mission in Saigon and aid
officials in Washington."
The letter, delivered to U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
on September 20, stated that an
ti-Americanism is growing in
Vietnam, and that Washington
is supporting a "government
which jails pacifists and neutra
lists." Luce insists that the suf
fering of the Vietnamese is
"greatly intensified by today's
American presence."

He believes that there exists
the possibility of a complete take
over by the NLF, but says that
such an event would leave the
country no better off than it is
now. He stated that the most
likely end desirable conclusion
would be the establishment of
a coalition government.
In addition to Luce, I.V.S.
members submitting resigna

Calif., the team leader in the
Danang area; Willie Meyes of
Souderton, Pa., leader in the
Mekong Delta area; and Gene
Stoltzfus of Aurora, Ohio, as
sociate chief for community de

work.
In the letter, reported in the
New York Times of September
20, Luce said, "We have seen
enough to know that the only
monuments to this war will be
the dead, the maimed, the des
pairing, and the forlorn. The
trend has been escalation of the
war. We say the trend should
be de-escalation."
U.S. officials in Vietnam ad
mitted hearing rumors of the
resignations several weeks be

fore the fact, but declined com

it was not the resignations but
the public protest against the
war that "stunned the United

officials in Washington."
The letter, delivered to U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
on September 20, stated that an
ti-Americanism is growing in
Vietnam, and that Washington
is supporting a "government

against U.S. policy, begins a na

Stanford.
Tonight at 8:30 p.m. in Tresid
der large lounge he will discuss
the Vietnam war and his refusal
to "become a part of the destruc
tion of a people I love." He will
be Wilbur guest-in-residence.
Luce will leave Stanford after
his address tonight to continue
his three-month speaking tour.
He intends to write on his Viet
nam experiences and eventually
work against the war from some
position in university life.
Luce arrived last night at San
Francisco International Airport
from Vietnam, where he has
spent the last nine years as a
member of 1.V.5., which sent

volunteer workers to aid Viet
namese peasants. Forty-five vol
unteers, including other top offi
cials, joined Luce in his resig
nation and signed a letter harsh
ly criticizing the U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam.
Pressure To Speak Out
At a press conference follow
ing his arrival Luce said that his
resignation was prompted by
"continual pressure from Viet
namese friends to speak out on
problems which they saw, es
pecially measures being taken
against youth," and "attempts
on the part of the U.S. mission
to use I.V.S. politically, particu
larly during the Buddhist up
rising of last April,
"The hope that I have is to
provide a better understanding
in the United States of pressures
on the Vietnamese, of problems
they face ... and to lead to a

ceasefire and a permanent
peace," he said.
Replying to a question as to
what, if any, chance there is for
a way out of the Vietnam mo
rass, Luce said that he sees
"hope for a solution in a cessa
tion of the bombing, a willing
ness to de-escalate and discuss
peace with all concerned par
ties," among whom the National
Liberation Front is "one of the
most important . . . there must
the agreement in the negotia
tions that no. elements will be
discriminated against because of
previous associations."
Luce pointed out that "for
many Vietnamese there lives
have been ruined." When he left
Vietnam, his friends congratu
lated him for his courage in
making public his opposition to
the war, saying, "We'd be put in
jail for saying these things."
Commenting on the recent
elections in South Vietnam,
Luce said that he considers them
a fraud by the very nature of
incomplete voter registration,
stating that the ticket of Thieu
and Ky received "fewer votes
than there are in Viet Cong con
trolled areas."
He believes that in a complete
ly free and open election the
"person speaking loudest for
peace" would probably win, and
that this would be Gen. "Big"
Minh. In a national reunification
election, he is certain that the

winner would be Ho Chi Minh.
Luce sees no simple or imme
diate end to the fighting, saying
that "if we left today, most
everyone in Vietnam would be
out of a job; we must initiate
work for peace, but we can't
hope for a one day withdrawal."

and to begin peace talks by turn

Luce stated that both he and
his co-workers had repeatedly
submitted recommendations on
all aspects of the war to the U.S.

answer an invitation to fill out a
report form. He describes the
situation as a "land of report

resignations as possibly bring

in the United States of pressures
on the Vietnamese, of problems
they face ... and to lead to a

ceasefire and a permanent
peace," he said.
Replying to a question as to
what, if any, chance there is for
a way out of the Vietnam mo
rass, Luce said that he sees
"hope for a solution in a cessa
tion of the bombing, a willing
ness to de-escalate and discuss
peace with all concerned par
ties," among whom the National
Liberation Front is "one of the
most important . . . there must
the agreement in the negotia
tions that no. elements will be
discriminated against because of
previous associations."
Luce pointed out that "for
many Vietnamese there lives
have been ruined." When he left
Vietnam, his friends congratu
lated him for his courage in
making public his opposition to
the war, saying, "We'd be put in
jail for saying these things."
Commenting on the recent
elections in South Vietnam,
Luce said that he considers them
a fraud by the very nature of
incomplete voter registration,
stating that the ticket of Thieu
and Ky received "fewer votes
than there are in Viet Cong con
trolled areas."
He believes that in a complete
ly free and open election the
"person speaking loudest for
peace" would probably win, and
that this would be Gen. "Big"
Minh. In a national reunification
election, he is certain that the

winner would be Ho Chi Minh.
Luce sees no simple or imme
diate end to the fighting, saying
that "if we left today, most
everyone in Vietnam would be
out of a job; we must initiate
work for peace, but we can't
hope for a one day withdrawal."
He believes that there exists
the possibility of a complete take
over by the NLF, but says that
such an event would leave the
country no better off than it is
now. He stated that the most
likely end desirable conclusion
would be the establishment of
a coalition government.
In addition to Luce, I.V.S.
members submitting resigna
tions were Don Ronk of Areata,
Calif., the team leader in the
Danang area; Willie Meyes of
Souderton, Pa., leader in the
Mekong Delta area; and Gene
Stoltzfus of Aurora, Ohio, as
sociate chief for community de
velopment, refugee, and youth
work.
In the letter, reported in the
New York Times of September
20, Luce said, "We have seen
enough to know that the only
monuments to this war will be
the dead, the maimed, the des
pairing, and the forlorn. The
trend has been escalation of the
war. We say the trend should
be de-escalation."
U.S. officials in Vietnam ad
mitted hearing rumors of the
resignations several weeks be

fore the fact, but declined com
ment. The Times reported "that
it was not the resignations but
the public protest against the
war that "stunned the United
States mission in Saigon and aid
officials in Washington."
The letter, delivered to U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
on September 20, stated that an
ti-Americanism is growing in
Vietnam, and that Washington
is supporting a "government
which jails pacifists and neutra
lists." Luce insists that the suf
fering of the Vietnamese is
"greatly intensified by today's
American presence."
He has urged President John
son to halt the bombing of North
Vietnam, to recognize the Na
tional Liberation Front (the po
litical arm of the Viet Cong),
and to begin peace talks by turn
ing the question of the war over
"to an international peace com
mission and to be prepared to
accept its recommendation."
Reports Submitted
Luce stated that both he and
his co-workers had repeatedly
submitted recommendations on
all aspects of the war to the U.S.
mission in Saigon with the only
answer an invitation to fill out a
report form. He describes the
situation as a "land of report

writing . . . We're leaving here
because this is the only way to
express our disagreement with
the tragedy going on here."
Sources in both Washington
and Vietnam saw the multiple
resignations as possibly bring
ing to a head a conflict which
has been developing for some
time between several volunteer
relief agencies and the U.S. mis
sion. The dispute centers on the
right of the volunteer workers
to discuss the war with Amer
icans and Vietnamese, and an
ever-increasing pressure on the
part of the U.S. to bring relief

workers more fully into the war
effort.
Luce, who speaks fluent Viet
namese, has traveled through
out the country, is highly re
garded by the Vietnamese peo
ple. Though only 33 years old,
he has headed the I.V.S. in
Vietnam for the past four years.
He left for volunteer work there
immediately after completing a
graduate program in agricul
tural development at Cornell
nine years ago. His ties to that
country are indicated by his oft
repeated plans to spend the rest
of his life there.
Donald Luce, who resigned as
director of the International Vol
untary Service (1.V.5.) in Viet
nam two weeks ago in protest
against U.S. policy, begins a na
tionwide speaking tour today at
Stanford.
Tonight at 8:30 p.m. in Tresid
der large lounge he will discuss
the Vietnam war and his refusal
to "become a part of the destruc
tion of a people I love." He will
be Wilbur guest-in-residence.
Luce will leave Stanford after
his address tonight to continue
his three-month speaking tour.
He intends to write on his Viet
nam experiences and eventually
work against the war from some
position in university life.
Luce arrived last night at San
Francisco International Airport
from Vietnam, where he has
spent the last nine years as a
member of 1.V.5., which sent

volunteer workers to aid Viet
namese peasants. Forty-five vol
unteers, including other top offi
cials, joined Luce in his resig
nation and signed a letter harsh
ly criticizing the U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam.
Pressure To Speak Out
At a press conference follow
ing his arrival Luce said that his
resignation was prompted by
"continual pressure from Viet
namese friends to speak out on
problems which they saw, es
pecially measures being taken
against youth," and "attempts
on the part of the U.S. mission
to use I.V.S. politically, particu
larly during the Buddhist up
rising of last April,
"The hope that I have is to
provide a better understanding
in the United States of pressures
on the Vietnamese, of problems
they face ... and to lead to a

ceasefire and a permanent
peace," he said.
