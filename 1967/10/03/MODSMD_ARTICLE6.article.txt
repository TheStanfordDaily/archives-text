# Foothill J.C. Balloting Favors Student Dress Rules Control
## 
### 
Foothill Junior College stu
dents today voted overwhelm
ingly to return control of the
dress code to student govern
ment.
The vote was 827 in favor of
student control of the code, with
103 against. Fewer than 20 per
cent of the student body bal
loted, however.
At present, the dress code pro

hibits such items as shorts,
slacks and pantsuits for women,
and shorts for men. Male stu
dents are also required to wear
socks at all times.
Also on the ballot was a ques
tion asking whether the stu
dents favored an immediate ces
sation of bombing North and
South Vietnam, immediate ne
gotiations and a phased with
drawal of all U.S. troops. The
result of this poll was 560 for
an end to the bombing, 351 op
posed, and 19 with no opinion.
The dress code vote is not bind
ing, but merely an opinion poll
which student leaders can use
in bargaining with the admini
stration.
Student body President Jon
Buckley had hoped for a large
majority in favor of returning
control of the code to students
to strengthen his bargaining po
sition.
But he had also hoped for as
much as a 30 per cent turnout,
which would have been the lar
gest in the school's history. The
smaller vote may cripple the sig
nificance of the poll.
The dress code was originally
formulated by students about
ten year ago. It consisted of
basically the same things as it
does now. A few minor changes
were made, such as allowing
men to wear dungarees. Enforce

ment was in the hands of the
students.
In 1964, however, student offi
cials "got tired of trying to
enforce the code, so they sound
ed out the administration on try
ing to get rid of it," according
to Buckley.
"There was so much opposi
tion and hassle from the ad
ministration," however, that stu
dent government gave control
to the Board of Trustees, who
gave it to the administration to
enforce.
Students want to regain con
trol now because they have been
unable to make changes they
wanted with the administration
controlling the code.
Buckley feels returning the
code to students "would result
in the elimination of some
trouble spots," such as the rules
on bermuda shorts, slacks, and
socks.
One of the adminstration's ar
is based upon possible disap
ise based upon possible disap
proval by local citizens of code
changes.
But Foothill student govern
ment presented its case to the
Los Altos City Council, and the
Council said it would not be op
posed to changes which would
eliminate the "trouble spots" re
ferred to by Buckley.
