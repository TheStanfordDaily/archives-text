# Women's Housing Paradox
## Vacancies But No Openings 
### 
Complications, some expected,
some not, accompanied the as
signment of women's housing
this quarter.
Unusually large numbers of
women failed to return to their
assigned housing, Sally Ma
honey, Associate Dean of Stu
dents reported. She cited mar
riages, and decisions to remain
in Europe to travel as two pos
sible explanations.
However, the number of open
ings now available in university
housing is not significantly
greater than before, officials
say, although the actual number
of women living in dorms is
down from last year.
OFF Not Cause
Miss Mahoney denied that the
shortages were caused by the
OFF movement or the demon
stration houses.
"The openings caused by
senior women moving off cam
pus and by the re-assignment of
women students to houses in
Stern and Wilbur were filled
last spring during the normal
drawing procedure," she
claimed.
Transfer Requests Denied
These openings were approxi
mately calculated then and filled
by transfer women, she said.
Mrs. Virgina Kranak of the
Transfer Admissions Office ex
plained that the number of wo
men transfers this fall has been
increased from 24 to almost 70.
The vacancies made available
this summer by women students
failing to return to their dorms
could not be filled by transfers
because there was not time,
University officials maintained.
Reports of vacancies have
brought requests from some up
perclass women for housing as
signment changes, but Sue
Heinberg, president of the As
sociated Women Students
(AWS), said most were being
denied.
"The purpose of the draw and
assigned priorities would be de
feated if women changed
blithely from house to house
after receiving a rooming as
signment," she claimed, and
added that the majority of wo
men received their first choice
during the AWS draw in the
spring and present reasons for
moving are largely a "matter of
whim."
AWS conducts the women s

housing draw each spring, and
requests for change must be
reviewed by the AWS Housing
Commission.
Many of this year's requests
apparently come from women
students returning from over
seas to their former houses. One
girl explained, "I hope to draw
back into the house to be with
friends. When I returned, I
found they had moved into dem
onstration houses, into Hoskins,
or into other dorms. If I had
known this I would have drawn
differently."
Last spring's drawing pro
cedure raised many questions
and problems, AWS officials
noted, and outlined the proced
ure as follows:
• Women wanting to live in
Hoskins drew first, then fresh
men seeking places in upper
class dorms.
• Applications for off-campus
housing and the draw for the
demonstration houses was han

died separately after the fresh
men draw.
• Last of all, upperclass wo
men wanting to change resi
dences and women returning
from overseas got their chance.
Many of last year's freshmen
tried to have their housing as
signments altered after the
demonstration houses had been
established because they knew
of vacancies left by women ac
cepted into one of the coed
dormitories. The AWS commit
tee ruled uniformly that such
changes were impossible be
cause the percentage of sopho
mores assigned to any one
house was set at 25 per cent by
University policy.
Miss Heinberg said that AWS
planned to review the draw sys
tem this year. The committee
controlling the draw has been
expanded from three to 18 stu
dents and now includes a repre
sentative from each living
group, she noted.

demonstration houses was han

died separately after the fresh
men draw.
• Last of all, upperclass wo
men wanting to change resi
dences and women returning
from overseas got their chance.
Many of last year's freshmen
tried to have their housing as
signments altered after the
demonstration houses had been
established because they knew
of vacancies left by women ac
cepted into one of the coed
dormitories. The AWS commit
tee ruled uniformly that such
changes were impossible be
cause the percentage of sopho
mores assigned to any one
house was set at 25 per cent by
University policy.
Miss Heinberg said that AWS
planned to review the draw sys
tem this year. The committee
controlling the draw has been
expanded from three to 18 stu
dents and now includes a repre
sentative from each living
group, she noted.
Complications, some expected,
some not, accompanied the as
signment of women's housing
this quarter.
Unusually large numbers of
women failed to return to their
assigned housing, Sally Ma
honey, Associate Dean of Stu
dents reported. She cited mar
riages, and decisions to remain
in Europe to travel as two pos
sible explanations.
However, the number of open
ings now available in university
housing is not significantly
greater than before, officials
say, although the actual number
of women living in dorms is
down from last year.
OFF Not Cause
Miss Mahoney denied that the
shortages were caused by the
OFF movement or the demon
stration houses.
"The openings caused by
senior women moving off cam
pus and by the re-assignment of
women students to houses in
Stern and Wilbur were filled
last spring during the normal
drawing procedure," she
claimed.
Transfer Requests Denied
These openings were approxi
mately calculated then and filled
by transfer women, she said.
Mrs. Virgina Kranak of the
Transfer Admissions Office ex
plained that the number of wo
men transfers this fall has been
increased from 24 to almost 70.
The vacancies made available
this summer by women students
failing to return to their dorms
could not be filled by transfers
because there was not time,
University officials maintained.
Reports of vacancies have
brought requests from some up
perclass women for housing as
signment changes, but Sue
Heinberg, president of the As
sociated Women Students
(AWS), said most were being
denied.
"The purpose of the draw and
assigned priorities would be de
feated if women changed
blithely from house to house
after receiving a rooming as
signment," she claimed, and
added that the majority of wo
men received their first choice
during the AWS draw in the
spring and present reasons for
moving are largely a "matter of
whim."
AWS conducts the women s

housing draw each spring, and
requests for change must be
reviewed by the AWS Housing
Commission.
Many of this year's requests
apparently come from women
students returning from over
seas to their former houses. One
girl explained, "I hope to draw
back into the house to be with
friends. When I returned, I
found they had moved into dem
onstration houses, into Hoskins,
or into other dorms. If I had
known this I would have drawn
differently."
Last spring's drawing pro
cedure raised many questions
and problems, AWS officials
noted, and outlined the proced
ure as follows:
• Women wanting to live in
Hoskins drew first, then fresh
men seeking places in upper
class dorms.
• Applications for off-campus
housing and the draw for the
demonstration houses was han

died separately after the fresh
men draw.
