# Sequoia Disappears As Subsidy Ends
## 
### 
Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, is now defunct.
The office of the Dean of Stu
dents decided at the end of last
academic year to end its $1600
subsidy of the magazine. In pre
vious years, according to the
last editor of the publication, it
had lost as much as $1700.
The last editor, senior English
major Keith Howard, told The
Daily he believed the English de
partment had advised the dean
of students to stop subsidizing
Sequoia because the department
felt it was being run by a small
clique of proteges of former Pro
fessor Yvor Winters. Winters is
a noted and controversial poet
and critic.
Professor Thomas Moser, En
glish department chairman, de
nied he knew anything about the
plan to scrap the magazine be
fore the dean of students made
the decision. Moser said that in
fact he had been considering
asking a Winters' adherent in
the department to become Se
quoia's faculty adviser this fall.

Howard admits the Sequoia
staff was small — five or six
people. But he argues this was
necessary since few students
wanted to devote time to the
magazine. He also said, "I hate
committees; I can't see dividing
the responsibility for aesthetic
decisions about what goes into
a magazine."
ASSU Financial Manager Rich
ard Ware said another reason
for Sequoia's demise was the
disinterest of the staff itself.
Howard called this a "true cri
ticism." He said the staff kept
regular office hours at the be
ginning of last year but become
discouraged as the year wore
on. "The magazine was dead al
ready when I became editor last
fall," said Howard.
Howard had once mentioned
to a friend that he would like to
be poetry editor of Sequoia but
had never worked on it. The
friend, who was on the Publi
cations Board, then nominated
Howard for editor when no one
else wanted the job.
Though inexperienced, How
ard assembled a small staff
from among his friends and be
gan work on the project. "We
wanted to resurrect Sequoia, to
put out good issues, and to print
good, solid pieces. Previously
most of the contributors to the
magazine had been graduate stu
dents, and we wanted to make it
almost completely an undergrad
uate publication."
Three issues were planned for
last year but only two were put
out, one in the fall and the
other at the end of spring quar
ter.
Howard commented, "The first
issue had good things in it, but
it was uneven. Some of the
pieces were much worse than
others, but all of it was written
by undergraduates."
The second issue had graduate
contributors, but the editor said
he felt the quality was on the
whole much better. The Sequoia
staff received many contribu
tions, especially poems, but few
of them were of high enough
quality to be printed, Howard
said. Most of what went into the
magazine last year was solicited
by the staff from their acquain
tances.
Not A Clique
"I don't think we can really
be called a clique," Howard said.
"We never printed anything that
people on the staff had written.
We did that to avoid charges
that we were a clique trying to
propagate our own work."
He admits freely, however,
that he has "rather definite op
inions on poetry ... I feel that
poetry should strive for really

accurate perception of the world.
Accurate perception is what be
ing a human being is all about.
And perception cannot really be
accurate unless it is linked to
some idea of form."
"A lot of people think that
spontaneous writing is the thing
to do," he went on.
"They write down whatever
reels out of their heads. But this
stuff doesn't convey their per
ceptions accurately. They don't
understand what they're seeing,
and nobody reading it does
either."
Cost Cutting Fails
The staff tried to cut costs,
took the magazine to the cheap
est printer they could find and
raised the price from 50 cents
to one dollar. "But we didn't
really think we could break
even. No literary publication
really can because of the limited
audience to which it necessarily
appeals. Even the Southern Re
view, one of the biggest such
publications in the country, is
still heavily subsidized.
"But I'm not that sorry that
it disappeared," Howard said.
"It was difficult to sustain a real
commitment to the magazine
when no one cared. It was tire
some work. The painful fact
that we had to face was that it
is exceedingly difficult to arouse
any student interest in this sort
of a publication."
Professor Clifford Weigle of
the Communications Department

told The Daily, "Today a literary
magazine cannot attract a wide
enough following to make a go
of it financially. Now a maga
zine has to be partly oriented
to real life; it must have a mix
of materials."
Sequoia's place may be filled
by The Workshop, a low-budget
magazine developed originally as
a protest to Sequoia, or per
haps Chapparral, the humor
magazine whose editors have
announced they are converting
to a more general format which
may include poetry, short stories
and essays.

Daily he believed the English de
partment had advised the dean
of students to stop subsidizing
Sequoia because the department
felt it was being run by a small
clique of proteges of former Pro
fessor Yvor Winters. Winters is
a noted and controversial poet
and critic.
Professor Thomas Moser, En
glish department chairman, de
nied he knew anything about the
plan to scrap the magazine be
fore the dean of students made
the decision. Moser said that in
fact he had been considering
asking a Winters' adherent in
the department to become Se
quoia's faculty adviser this fall.

Howard admits the Sequoia
staff was small — five or six
people. But he argues this was
necessary since few students
wanted to devote time to the
magazine. He also said, "I hate
committees; I can't see dividing
the responsibility for aesthetic
decisions about what goes into
a magazine."
ASSU Financial Manager Rich
ard Ware said another reason
for Sequoia's demise was the
disinterest of the staff itself.
Howard called this a "true cri
ticism." He said the staff kept
regular office hours at the be
ginning of last year but become
discouraged as the year wore
on. "The magazine was dead al
ready when I became editor last
fall," said Howard.
Howard had once mentioned
to a friend that he would like to
be poetry editor of Sequoia but
had never worked on it. The
friend, who was on the Publi
cations Board, then nominated
Howard for editor when no one
else wanted the job.
Though inexperienced, How
ard assembled a small staff
from among his friends and be
gan work on the project. "We
wanted to resurrect Sequoia, to
put out good issues, and to print
good, solid pieces. Previously
most of the contributors to the
magazine had been graduate stu
dents, and we wanted to make it
almost completely an undergrad
uate publication."
Three issues were planned for
last year but only two were put
out, one in the fall and the
other at the end of spring quar
ter.
Howard commented, "The first
issue had good things in it, but
it was uneven. Some of the
pieces were much worse than
others, but all of it was written
by undergraduates."
The second issue had graduate
contributors, but the editor said
he felt the quality was on the
whole much better. The Sequoia
staff received many contribu
tions, especially poems, but few
of them were of high enough
quality to be printed, Howard
said. Most of what went into the
magazine last year was solicited
by the staff from their acquain
tances.
Not A Clique
"I don't think we can really
be called a clique," Howard said.
"We never printed anything that
people on the staff had written.
We did that to avoid charges
that we were a clique trying to
propagate our own work."
He admits freely, however,
that he has "rather definite op
inions on poetry ... I feel that
poetry should strive for really

accurate perception of the world.
Accurate perception is what be
ing a human being is all about.
And perception cannot really be
accurate unless it is linked to
some idea of form."
"A lot of people think that
spontaneous writing is the thing
to do," he went on.
"They write down whatever
reels out of their heads. But this
stuff doesn't convey their per
ceptions accurately. They don't
understand what they're seeing,
and nobody reading it does
either."
Cost Cutting Fails
The staff tried to cut costs,
took the magazine to the cheap
est printer they could find and
raised the price from 50 cents
to one dollar. "But we didn't
really think we could break
even. No literary publication
really can because of the limited
audience to which it necessarily
appeals. Even the Southern Re
view, one of the biggest such
publications in the country, is
still heavily subsidized.
"But I'm not that sorry that
it disappeared," Howard said.
"It was difficult to sustain a real
commitment to the magazine
when no one cared. It was tire
some work. The painful fact
that we had to face was that it
is exceedingly difficult to arouse
any student interest in this sort
of a publication."
Professor Clifford Weigle of
the Communications Department

told The Daily, "Today a literary
magazine cannot attract a wide
enough following to make a go
of it financially. Now a maga
zine has to be partly oriented
to real life; it must have a mix
of materials."
Sequoia's place may be filled
by The Workshop, a low-budget
magazine developed originally as
a protest to Sequoia, or per
haps Chapparral, the humor
magazine whose editors have
announced they are converting
to a more general format which
may include poetry, short stories
and essays.
Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, is now defunct.
The office of the Dean of Stu

academic year to end its $1600

had lost as much as $1700.

fore the dean of students made
the decision. Moser said that in
fact he had been considering
asking a Winters' adherent in
the department to become Se
quoia's faculty adviser this fall.

Howard admits the Sequoia
staff was small — five or six
people. But he argues this was
necessary since few students
wanted to devote time to the
magazine. He also said, "I hate
committees; I can't see dividing
the responsibility for aesthetic
decisions about what goes into
a magazine."
ASSU Financial Manager Rich
ard Ware said another reason
for Sequoia's demise was the
disinterest of the staff itself.
Howard called this a "true cri
ticism." He said the staff kept
regular office hours at the be
ginning of last year but become
discouraged as the year wore
on. "The magazine was dead al
ready when I became editor last
fall," said Howard.
Howard had once mentioned
to a friend that he would like to
be poetry editor of Sequoia but
had never worked on it. The
friend, who was on the Publi
cations Board, then nominated
Howard for editor when no one
else wanted the job.
Though inexperienced, How
ard assembled a small staff
from among his friends and be
gan work on the project. "We
wanted to resurrect Sequoia, to
put out good issues, and to print
good, solid pieces. Previously
most of the contributors to the
magazine had been graduate stu
dents, and we wanted to make it
almost completely an undergrad
uate publication."
Three issues were planned for
last year but only two were put
out, one in the fall and the
other at the end of spring quar
ter.
Howard commented, "The first
issue had good things in it, but
it was uneven. Some of the
pieces were much worse than
others, but all of it was written
by undergraduates."
The second issue had graduate
contributors, but the editor said
he felt the quality was on the
whole much better. The Sequoia
staff received many contribu
tions, especially poems, but few
of them were of high enough
quality to be printed, Howard
said. Most of what went into the
magazine last year was solicited
by the staff from their acquain
tances.
Not A Clique
"I don't think we can really
be called a clique," Howard said.
"We never printed anything that
people on the staff had written.
We did that to avoid charges
that we were a clique trying to
propagate our own work."
He admits freely, however,
that he has "rather definite op
inions on poetry ... I feel that
poetry should strive for really

accurate perception of the world.
Accurate perception is what be
ing a human being is all about.
And perception cannot really be
accurate unless it is linked to
some idea of form."
"A lot of people think that
spontaneous writing is the thing
to do," he went on.
"They write down whatever
reels out of their heads. But this
stuff doesn't convey their per
ceptions accurately. They don't
understand what they're seeing,
and nobody reading it does
either."
Cost Cutting Fails
The staff tried to cut costs,
took the magazine to the cheap
est printer they could find and
raised the price from 50 cents
to one dollar. "But we didn't
really think we could break
even. No literary publication
really can because of the limited
audience to which it necessarily
appeals. Even the Southern Re
view, one of the biggest such
publications in the country, is
still heavily subsidized.
"But I'm not that sorry that
it disappeared," Howard said.
"It was difficult to sustain a real
commitment to the magazine
when no one cared. It was tire
some work. The painful fact
that we had to face was that it
is exceedingly difficult to arouse
any student interest in this sort
of a publication."
Professor Clifford Weigle of
the Communications Department

told The Daily, "Today a literary
magazine cannot attract a wide
enough following to make a go
of it financially. Now a maga
zine has to be partly oriented
to real life; it must have a mix
of materials."
Sequoia's place may be filled
by The Workshop, a low-budget
magazine developed originally as
a protest to Sequoia, or per
haps Chapparral, the humor
magazine whose editors have
announced they are converting
to a more general format which
may include poetry, short stories
and essays.
Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, is now defunct.
The office of the Dean of Stu
dents decided at the end of last
academic year to end its $1600
subsidy of the magazine. In pre
vious years, according to the
last editor of the publication, it
had lost as much as $1700.
The last editor, senior English
major Keith Howard, told The
Daily he believed the English de
partment had advised the dean
of students to stop subsidizing
Sequoia because the department
felt it was being run by a small
clique of proteges of former Pro
fessor Yvor Winters. Winters is
a noted and controversial poet
and critic.
