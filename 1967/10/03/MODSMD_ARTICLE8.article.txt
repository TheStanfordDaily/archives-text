# Sequoia Disappears As Subsidy Ends

Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, is now defunct.
The office of the Dean of Stu
dents decided at the end of last
academic year to end its $1600
subsidy of the magazine. In pre

last editor of the publication, it

committees; I can't see dividing
the responsibility for aesthetic
decisions about what goes into
a magazine."

disinterest of the staff itself.
Howard called this a "true cri

regular office hours at the be
ginning of last year but become
discouraged as the year wore
on. "The magazine was dead al

fall," said Howard.
Howard had once mentioned
to a friend that he would like to
be poetry editor of Sequoia but
had never worked on it. The
friend, who was on the Publi
