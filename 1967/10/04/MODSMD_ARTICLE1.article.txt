# Police Force Under Study

The Stanford Police depart
ment may take on an extra
sheriff's deputy to write the Uni
versity's moving traffic viola
tion tickets.
The plan is being discussed
now by University officials and
the Santa Clara County sheriff's
office. According to Stanford
Police Chief Gordon R. Davis,
discussions have been going on
for the past several months to
review his department's status
with local government law en
forcement agencies.
The Stanford police are em
ployees of the University and
thus are, in effect, a private
police force.
Recent state legislation re
quires peace officers to be em
ployed and paid by a county or
municipality. Stanford's police
are officially special deputies to
the Santa Clara sheriff.
The plan to hire additional
police service from the county
is not yet in final form, but
would follow the normal pattern
for extended police service in
unincorporated areas.
The area affected would in
clude most of Stanford's land.
Exceptions are the Stanford
shopping center and the indus
trial park, which are located on
land incorporated into Palo Alto
and already served by the Palo
Alto police.
The plan, if adopted, would
have Stanford pay the county
for a deputy to handle traffic
violations. Stanford police would
continue to handle parking vio
lations and normal campus
security.
The proposal would have to
be approved by the Board of
Trustees, who meet Oct. 19, and
the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors, who meet Oct.
23.
Stanford police now have jur
isdiction over all misdemeanors
on campus, under current agree
ments with the county sheriff.
The sheriff handles all felonies,

and the highway patrol handles
traffic accidents involving in
juries.
The new service would cost
Stanford $12 per hour per dep
uty. If the University wanted
a deputy 24 hours a day all
week, it would have to hire five
men. A University official said,
however, that Stanford would
probably hire a single deputy
for "less than 24 hours."
Chief Davis said the working
relations between his depart
ment and the Santa Clara
sheriff were being reevaluated
to "avoid any possibility of
questionable action." He said
there have been differing inter
pretations of the new law on
role of campus police.
It appears doubtful the Stan
ford police will be taken over
by the sheriff's office. Davis
pointed out such a move would
mean heavy extra cost for the
county.
