# Out Of Sight
## Learning Via Carrot And Stick 
### Henry Muller 
Back in 1950, President Ster
ling and the Trustees outlined
a plan of action designed to
"put Stanford back among the
top universities." In the fifties,
the faculty was to be improved;
in the sixties, the facilities; in
the seventies, the endowment.
And in the eighties, presumably,
the University will analyze its
attitudes.
Not so, say the voices from
the Vice Provost's office. The
Study of Education is in full
swing (or is it?) and Professor
Packer and friends will soon be
able to say without a quiver in
their voices that they know
what is needed to make Stan
ford a veritable haven for in
tellectual pursuits. Meanwhile,
it is becoming more apparent
that improvement at Stanfrod
will have to involve more than
just changes in the Time Sched
ule and General Studies require
ment list.
High on the list are certain
attitudes which must be dras
tically altered before this insti
tution can begin to make claims
to greatness.
Outmoded Views
The attitudes in question are
the ones which perpetuate the
gap between the actual and the
ideal Stanford. At the root of
the administration's outmoded

views are its assumptions on the
student's approach to his educa
tion, as was again demonstrated
last week.
The University decided that
students with fewer than 39 let
ter grade units in one year did
not deserve to be on the Dean's
list, no matter what their grade
point average. Inevitably, stu
dents protested and Registrar
Harvey Hall even admitted that
it had perhaps been inequitable
not to warn students in advance.
In keeping with this judg
ment, he announced that the 200
students who had been deprived
of their status with the elite
would, after all, be granted that
honor. Indeed, this was a com
mendable move, but it by no
means relegates the issue to the
filing cabinet, for the problem
of fairness to 200 students really
disguised the basic revelation of
the decision, namely that the
University does not appear to be
updating its parochial attitude
toward grading.
An Alternative
Stanford claims to have taken
great steps forward in approv
ing an experiment in pass-fail
grading, but has failed to allow
that system to prove itself as
a viable alternative to letter
grading and as a possible fore
runner to eventual elimination
of all grading.
Instead, the Registrar's office

continues to assume that stu
dents take courses on a pass
fail basis to avoid work, and
therefore should not bo eligible
for the "rewards" that excell
ence in other areas has made
them eligible for.
That there are students who
do take advantage of pass-fail
in order to breeze through nor
mally difficult courses is no rev
elation. But to have Stanford
assume that everyone has this
in mind is not only condescend
ing to the students but also
starkly reveals the insecurity of
this University and the lack of
confidence it has in its system,
its students, and itself.
Pandora's Box
Allowing students who take
advantage of the pass-fail option
to make the Dean's list will not
close the Pandora's box opened
by the Registrar's office last
week, for there is a basic in
consistency between the theory
of pass-fail grading and a
Dean's list. While freedom in
experimentation is encouraged
by the one, the other is a sharp
reminder of the University's
carrot and stick approach to ed
ucation.
The solution? Elimination of
grades, eventually. But In the
present context, abolition of the
Dean's list would be a damned
good start.
