## Union: The One Viable Solution 
### 
Editor, The Daily;
In your editorial of two days
ago M.W. pointed out some of
the reasons for the founding of
the graduate students union at
Stanford. His examples are well
taken: there are anomalies, and
sometimes evils, in the treatment
of working graduate students
and there exist no mechanisms
for their solution.
But though financial hard
ships of the kind cited in the
editorial were perhaps the most
important single cause of the
feelings that led to the setting
up of the union, they are only
a part of, and a symptom of, a
larger question. This is the need
for representation and the deter
mining of their own working
conditions that many graduate
students feel.
This is a matter that the Uni
versity is not equipped to deal
with at the moment, partly be
cause of its chaotic financial
structure and partly because the
institutions of the University
arise from a concept of the stu
dent that bears no relation to
the life and working conditions
of many graduate students.
For this reason M.W.'s conclu
sions about the misguided na
ture of the union and the pos
sible alternatives to it are less
well taken. I would like to dis
cuss his two main points.
Lack Of Pantry
M.W. suggests organizing in
side departments. Unfortunately
many of the problems of gradu
ate students are directly related
to the lack of parity between de
partments, especially in the
amount of money they get.
It is precisely those students
in the less favored departments
who are least secure in their
jobs and therefore least able to
join the union.
Any idea of a functioning
graduate student organization
must have the support of those
students in the favored and
therefore secure departments.
Moreover, the problem of try
ing to smooth out these inequi
ties is the University's. It is the
University that must push for
funds for certain departments
and for funds earmarked for
paying students and it is the Uni
versity that can set up guide
lines and minimums.
Atomisation
Many of us also feel that the
atomisation of the University
into departments is itself a de
structive thing and that cross
departmental organizations are
necessary for a good life in the
University.
I should like to point out, in
this context, that many of those

students who have been instru
mental in setting up the within
department organizations are in
volved in the formation of the
union.
Finally, M.W. sets up a straw
man to attack when he points
out that a fair wage can only
be set with reference to depart
mental conditions.
Of course this is true, and in
the formation of the union there
has been no suggestion that
any kind of blanket figure should
be used.
But we do think that a grad
uate student should be able to
live on what he is paid and that
that should be related to the
amount of work he does, and not
determined by the amount of
money floating around his de
partment.
ASSU Insufficient
M.W. further suggests that
graduate students should use the
channels that already exist to
air their grievances. Unfortu
nately the structure of the exist
ing organizations does not offer
much to the working student.
There are reasons for non-par
ticipation in ASSU. mainly be
cause of its own inability to
affect the structures of the Uni
versity. It is because of this that
participation in it is low.
Furthermore, the needs of
working graduates are not those
that student governments are
set up to deal with: our needs
are in conditions and terms of
work, not in campus living or
student rights. Nor is it the func
tion of ASSU to push for action
in cases of known hardship,
which is a thing the union could
do.
Working Adult
While the union would be de
lighted to co-operate with ASSU
and negotiations are already go
ing on, the purposes the union
was set up to serve center
around the graduate student as
a working adult, not as a child
in need of parental guidance.
Participation in SES is even
less relevant. SES is a top-down
organization to which indivi
duals give information. While,
again, the union would be happy
to send a representative to SES,
that representative should in
deed represent something more
than his own opinions.
He should have information
about the wider condition of
graduate students and should be
in a position to express needs
that are reasonably understood
and have been discussed and
found general.
It is to set up the conditions
for such discussion, for the col
lection of information and for

the production of proposals and
action that relate to being a
working graduate student, that
the union was set up.

• Grove Hash
Editor, The Daily:
I have the misfortune of hash
ing on the south end at Stern.
Stern used to be a groovy
place all around until it was
singled out to shelter the Grove
House. It seems like guys at
Stern take it in the ear about
most things—either they're tur
keys or ragers. Talk doesn't
hurt much, though, and from
what I've seen no one pays
much attention to insults
thrown at Stern.
But, man, this year someone
really tried to give 'em the
shaft. And it's for real, too.
Slight Disgust
As a hasher it's hard to look
on your eaters without a slight
twinge of disgust. After all,
those decadent slobs have
enough coin so they don't have
to grovel for meals.
On the other hand, eaters
probably look on the idiots in
white as having one of three
qualifications for their positions,
i.e., no brain, a football scholar
ship or an extreme case of ego
tism.
In any resident hall there's a
little resentment between the
hashers and eaters, but it's a
game of give and take and like
the guy said, "Some of my best
friends are eaters." But the
people in Grove—they're too
much.
Poking At Potatoes
What I can't understand is
why the boys and girls of Grove
are still poking at their mashed
potatoes a half hour to 45 min
utes after the rest of Stern has
eaten dessert and left.
The other houses of Stern
have dessert served in their din
ning halls; whereas, Grove takes
its sweets in the lounge to en
courage its resident to get the
hell out.
When tables which have to be
cleared are kept tied up every
one on the hashing crew—from
the hashers to the guys in the
dish room—has too stay longer.
It would seem that the enlight
ened residents of Grove would
have more feeling toward their
fellow men, especially their
hashers. They don't.
Hashing No Lark
I don't think anyone who
hashes thinks it's a hell of a
lark. It's something we have to

do and we try to make the best
of it. We like to leave work as
soon as possible to devote time
to some of our self interests,
whether it be booking, wenching
or tube watching.
And you know, even some of
the jocks and frat men among
us go home and actually talk
meaningfully—like about Viet
nam or civil rights. I mean, they
relate to people and can look at
a woman as either a pair of
thighs or a person.
And they might be sitting
down in the hasher's dining
room and have a meaningful
conversation while they're eat
ing, but they have to break off
sometimes so they can serve
the people in, say, Grove.
Prima Donnas
Okay. So what I want to know
is why a bunch of prima donnas
somehow think they're special.
A comfortable meal doesn't take
an hour and a half.
Conversation is spontaneous
unless you're talking off the top
of your head and isn't set for
a certain time of day. With the
exception of vegetables, getting
up and leaving a room shouldn't
break your train of thought.
And unless you only pay lip
service to fine ideals, a little con
sideration to those around you,
including those who serve you,
doesn't hurt.

• Gutsy ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
I suggest that Peter Bayley
("ROTC 'Football Scholars'")
be put in quarantine until he
has proved his open-mindedness
Has it ever occurred to him
that some people who are in
ROTC, intercollegiate athletics,
competitive business, or military
service (and, sadly, killing) in
Vietnam, may have already
questioned the prevailing ideas
and their own participation, and
have made a rational decision to
accept the prevailing ideas and
to participate?
One may disagree with their
decision (and they may even be
wrong), but because that de
cision is contrary to one's own,
it does not follow that the per
son has not intelligently con
sidered his decision and sub
sequent behavior.
In an atmosphere of anti
establishment, perhaps these
men in ROTC, athletics, busi
ness, and military service are
the ones who have "the guts to
do something about it."
