# For A Positive Look At The Stern Houses
## 
### ROBERT FUNK (Conclusion) 
Stanford University does not
pretend that Stern Hall is a
physical ideal in student resi
dences, and certainly the view
of the outside of Stern Hall is
not particularly prepossessing.
However, Stanford has — I
think unfortunately — allocated
most of its resources and energy
for independent housing to the
new Moore and Jacks houses.
Moore and Jacks were to have
been a close approach to a resi
dential ideal, and student and
faculty committees met for
months to discuss the physical
amenities of the proposed inde
pendent houses.
Moore • Jacks Delay
Two circumstances have de
layed the construction of Moore
and Jacks: first, the temporary
unavailability of federal funds
which were to have completed
the building budget; and second,
a realization that the academic
and social programs for the
houses had not been adequately
thought out, and that construc
tion should follow and imple
ment, not precede and dictate,
the design for student life in
these houses.
Significantly, no such caution
has delayed construction of Fra
ternity Cluster Number Three;
perhaps the fraternity system
lies beyond the bounds of edu
cational planning.
Before irrevocable commit
ments are made to spend mil
lions of dollars on new houses,
however, Stanford should take
a long, calculating look at Stern
Hall. As it is now, Stern will
quickly become a third-class resi
dence when Moore and Jacks
are at last opened; this seems
unconscionable if, as I believe
to be the case, the investment
of reasonable amounts of imagi
nation and money could convert
Stern into the top-rank residence
its donor must have intended it
to be.
Four-Class Houses
In making an appraisal of
Stern the University should con
sider carefully the benefits of

mixing approximately equal
numbers of students from all
four classes. This is an arrange
ment one almost has to live with
to appreciate fully, and the Stern
residents have not been success
ful in convincing Packer sub
committees that an increase
from 25 per cent to 50 per cent
in freshman residents changes

... don't 4 'leave" Stern Hall in a
residential backwater

the atmosphere of a house from
one in which there is a vigorous
(and educative) interchange be
tween classes to one in which
a freshman enclave stands off
a hostile subculture of upper
classmen. The system as it has
existed until this year at Stern
provides a mixture of under
class enthusiasm and upper class
experience that is invigorating,
entertaining, and exciting — all
of the things a University resi
dence should be.
Because of factors including
the reputed (but not always
real) superiority of fraternity
housing and the prevalence of
the "Stern turkey" stereotype,
Stanford fraternities tend to
draw a substantial share of the
University's socially inclined stu
dents. Most Stern students treat
the turkey label with contemp
tuous bemusement, and are very
little concerncd with what the
rest of the campus thinks unless
it impedes relationships with
women — which it occasionally
does.
Oath-less Houses
Usually, however, the oath
less, brotherless Stern houses
maintain community esprit and
intellectual excitement through
a precarious balance between in
dividual independence on one
hand and group interests on the
other.
Not surprisingly, however, the
campus seems to have judged
Stern by its exterior. Although
the official doctrine is that Stern
houses are "just as good as"
other student residences of what

ever type, it is Stern that must
sop up the overflow when Wil
bur runs out of beds for fresh
men, and Stern houses that must
alter traditions and membership
patterns in order to accommo
date neighboring residential ex
periments.
For one thing, "Stern Hall" is
itself a misleading label, and

may impede the University's un
derstanding of life in Stern.
From the outside it is possible
to consider Stern as a huge con
glomerate of 600 men, and to
assume that changing the per
centage of freshmen in Lassen
House will not, after all, affect
the 600 very much.
From the inside, it is apparent
that the eight houses develop
rather different characters, and
that there is relatively little com
munication between the houses.
Ignore Public Relations
Just as Stern men have been
indifferent to the word turkey,
they have until recently more
or less ignored their public rela
tions with the Dean's office and
the campus at large. This differ
ence is probably characteristic
of the independent student, and
I find it particularly attractive.
As long as the independent
houses were permitted to con
tinue their own valued tradi
tions (including the four-class
system) without interference,
the Stern residents were quite
willing to have outsiders enter
tain themselves with the inven
tion of Stern stereotypes and
folklore.
This easy situation changed
spring quarter with the threat
ened dissolution of existing
houses to make way for fresh
men or demonstrations. The
Stern temper was finally x'oused
during the long seriocomedy that
led to the resettling of the Grove
and the establishment of the
demonstration houses.
Summer Non-Controversy
Perhaps the most important
and unfortunate consequence of
the all-campus shuffle is the (at
least temporary) break in the
Wilbur-to-Stern tradition that en
abled students to join the inde
pendent houses during their
sophomore year. The possibility
of this break was not even dis

cussed during spring quarter, to
my knowledge.
Summer is reputed to he the
favorite time for potentially con
troversial administrative action
on colleges and university cam
puses, but I am convinced that
Stanford University does not de
lay difficult announcements un
til the summer. (Proof of this
is the number of embarrassing
things that occur when The
Daily is publishing and ordering
its meat rare.)
The loss of the Stern choice
is, I think, a serious breach of
the independent tradition on
this campus. The great increase
in the number of freshmen also
radically changes the character
of four of the six remaining
"regular" houses (a seventh
house, Serra, became a demon
stration house, and Donner was
of course disbanded to make way
for the Grove). The percentages
of freshmen in the four houses
range from 40 per cent in Fre
mont to 70 per cent in Lassen,
making the houses on the upper
end of this scale new editions
of Wilbur Hall. These may be
temporary inconveniences, of
course, but when everything at
a university is temporary, par
ticularly the students.
Consult The Students
I think one further matter
needs redress. Before the Uni
versity promulgates a policy
which will substantially change
the life in any student house, the
members of that house should
be consulted and given the op
tion of accepting or rejecting it.
The recapitulation of Stan
ford's domestic problems is not
my purpose in writing these ar
ticles, however. And although I
have been critical of fraternities
and the demonstration houses
I don't favor the abolition of
either institution. I would rather
argue for the Pirandellian view
that if they think they are right,
right they are.
My own argument is a posi
tive one for a new look at the
Stern houses. The independent
society in Stern Hall is not simp
ly a colorless gelatin holding
together students who have not
happened to move somewhere
else, a mixture Stanford may
stir and divide each year as the
needs of other residences dic
tate.
The independent system is in
stead a vital and surprisingly
successful one, in which a rath

er ambitious cultural and aca
demic program has survived
without the artifices of required
seminars. This system has drawn
much of its energy from a strong
representation of members from
each of the four classes and in
the annual gain of students
from Wilbur. The disruption of
this pattern threatens to trans
form some of the houses into
freshman dormitories and must
be reconsidered.
Finally, Stanford will soon
begin again to plan for the ex
penditure of millions of dollars
for new dormitories which will
leave Stern Hall in a residential
backwater. Before this commit
ment is made the University

should considor tho possibility—
I should think the necessity—
of investing a lesser, but never
theless substantial sum of money
in the Stern building and pro
gram.
It should be exhilirating for
all concerned to find that this
investment, added to the under
publicized but nonetheless real
vitality of the independent sys
tem, will giv Stanford residences
which excel as experiments, as
demonstrations, as intellectual
milieus, and perhaps even as
places to live.
Unaccustomed as Stern is to
issuing challenges, I venture a
challenge: E. Pluribus Burbank;
Don't Give Up the Stern.
