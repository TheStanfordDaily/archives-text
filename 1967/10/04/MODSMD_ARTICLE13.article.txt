## Ptui-Building 
### Robert E. Stone 
We have to hand it to those
graduate students who decided
to affiliate with the American
Federation of Teachers. These
students, rankled by low pay
scales and little or no power in
establishment of University pol
icies, have finally discovered
what their undergraduate coun
terparts have been complaining
about for years.
A word of caution to these
brave new students is, however,
in order. Stanford does not con
sider itself an undergraduate
University. Stanford does not
consider itself any kind of Uni
versity at allâ€”or if it does, it
shouldn't.
What Stanford is, in reality,
is a money-making machine.
This machine takes in money
and spits out buildings which
require more money to operate
and staff. Since Stanford doesn't
want to use its own money for
these ventures, it only spits out
buildings which will be sup
ported by the Federal Govern
ment.
Occasionally some one, or
some group of ones, will ques
tion the value of spitting out
buildings. When this happens,
and it happens infrequently, the
machine will spit out a new
building, or more likely, a re
modeled old building, for that
one or group of ones. Amazing
ly, spitting out buildings then
becomes amazingly valuable.
Spit The Right One
In fact, spitting out buildings
can be of great value, as long as
the right buildings are spat.
What are these right buildings?
First, dormitories. Second class
rooms. Third, recreation areas,
and not just for use by the De
partment of Athletics.
What are wrong buildings.
First, SLAC, a monumental toy
which may shortly be presented

in full working detail by one
of the larger toy manufacturers.
Put a SLAC in your child's
Christmas stocking. Second, the
Man in Space Center. Third, the
HEPL Tunnel. All of these
buildings rank as toys for a few
important members of the fac
ulty to play with.
But the problem is deeper
than the types of buildings Stan
ford spits out. It is the value
that these buildings have in a
Stanford Education, both under
graduate and graduate that
must be questioned. At the cen
ter of the problem lies the grad
uate student.
These men and women, as
was pointed out by the new
union, are being used. They are
being used to give professors
time to do research and write
applications for new buildings
for Stanford to spit out. They
are being used so that pro
fessors don't have to be. In the
humanities and sciences they
are mostly used as discussion
leaders and readers. In the na
tural sciences, they are used as
teachers.
Hopefully, when the students
realize that their complaints are
falling on deaf ears, they will
strike. The many teachers
strikes that recently occurred
around the country were caused
by situations not at all different
from those that the new union
here hopes to alleviate.
Graduates, your duty is clear.
If you would have Stanford be
come a University, a place
where learning is of primary
importance, you must press the
issue at all costs. Once in every
generation a man is given the
chance to do something con
structive for his society. Now
that chance is given to you, and
we urge you to strike, damn it,
strike.
