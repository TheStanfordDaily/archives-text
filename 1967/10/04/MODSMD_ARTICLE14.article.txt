# Campus Reforms Sweeping Country
## 
### 
The times, they are a-changin',
as the song writer has it. As
colleges across the country try
to keep pace, significant reforms
are in progress.
At CORNELL, a student-fac
ulty committee recommended
that the University stop its prac
tice of stepping between the po
lice and students who get into
trouble.
The committee went further
by suggesting that the Univer
sity give up the whole idea of
acting in loco parentis. Current
practice at Cornell when a stu
dent is in minor trouble with the
police, is for the police to turn
him over to University authori
ties for discipline.
BOWDOIN COLLEGE in
Brunswick, Maine, recently an
nounced formation of a special
committee to study its admis
sions policies. The committee
will develop and supervise a col
lege-wide program to seek and
attract "able students of diver
sified and interesting talents."
Beginning this year, LAFA
YETTE COLLEGE of Easton,
Pa., will allow all seniors in
good academic standing to have
unlimited class cuts.
Lafayette's dean of the col
lege, Charles C. Cole Jr., said,
"Seniors presumably don't need
the prod of required attendance
to do the work the way fresh
men and sophomores do."
In St. Charles, Mo., LINDEN
WOOD COLLEGE for girls has
completely revised its curricu

lum and adopted a unique divi
sion of the school year. The new
"Four - One - Four" calendar
breaks the year into three terms:
14 weeks in the fall, four weeks
in the winter, and 14 again in
the spring.
Lindenwood students will take
four courses in the fall, one in
the winter and four in the
spring. New courses are being
designed to take advantage of
the new arrangement.
Freshmen at Lindenwood will
no longer concentrate on the
usual freshman English and gen
eral education courses but will
branch out immediately into all
areas of the social and natural
sciences and the humanities. Se
niors will have a new "synthe
sis" course which will attempt
to relate each student's college
experience to her life's goals.
WILLIAMS COLLEGE is
halfway through a ten-year ad
missions experiment, and is
finding that students with low
aptitude scores and good high
school records are doing better
than those with high aptitudes
and poor records.
Ten per cent of each class ent
ering Williams has been of stu
dents who would not ordinarily
have been admitted but who
showed some special interests or
qualifications. Early findings
suggest that "College Board
scores are much less important
than high school performance"
in determining an applicant's
probable success in college.
In other developments at COR
NELL, the graduate school re
cently announced a series of
legislative changes designed to
provide more flexibility in its
operation.
The changes were made to pro
vide "a loosening up of cen
tralized procedure to give more
procedural jurisdiction to the
fields," according to Donald
Cooke, dean of the Graduate
School.
Other changes include a drop
in the number of oral examina
tions required for the doctor of
philosophy — three to two with
the possibility of a single minor.
Another rule change to provide
more flexibility for the fields
of study was a loosening of
language requirements. The De
partment of Physics was able to
abolish all language require
ments for their graduate stu
dents.

In St. Charles, Mo., LINDEN
WOOD COLLEGE for girls has
completely revised its curricu

lum and adopted a unique divi
sion of the school year. The new
"Four - One - Four" calendar
breaks the year into three terms:
14 weeks in the fall, four weeks
in the winter, and 14 again in
the spring.
Lindenwood students will take
four courses in the fall, one in
the winter and four in the
spring. New courses are being
designed to take advantage of
the new arrangement.
Freshmen at Lindenwood will
no longer concentrate on the
usual freshman English and gen
eral education courses but will
branch out immediately into all
areas of the social and natural
sciences and the humanities. Se
niors will have a new "synthe
sis" course which will attempt
to relate each student's college
experience to her life's goals.
WILLIAMS COLLEGE is
halfway through a ten-year ad
missions experiment, and is
finding that students with low
aptitude scores and good high
school records are doing better
than those with high aptitudes
and poor records.
Ten per cent of each class ent
ering Williams has been of stu
dents who would not ordinarily
have been admitted but who
showed some special interests or
qualifications. Early findings
suggest that "College Board
scores are much less important
than high school performance"
in determining an applicant's
probable success in college.
In other developments at COR
NELL, the graduate school re
cently announced a series of
legislative changes designed to
provide more flexibility in its
operation.
The changes were made to pro
vide "a loosening up of cen
tralized procedure to give more
procedural jurisdiction to the
fields," according to Donald
Cooke, dean of the Graduate
School.
Other changes include a drop
in the number of oral examina
tions required for the doctor of
philosophy — three to two with
the possibility of a single minor.
Another rule change to provide
more flexibility for the fields
of study was a loosening of
language requirements. The De
partment of Physics was able to
abolish all language require
ments for their graduate stu
dents.
The times, they are a-changin',
as the song writer has it. As
colleges across the country try
to keep pace, significant reforms
are in progress.
At CORNELL, a student-fac
ulty committee recommended
that the University stop its prac
tice of stepping between the po
lice and students who get into
trouble.
The committee went further
by suggesting that the Univer
sity give up the whole idea of
acting in loco parentis. Current
practice at Cornell when a stu
dent is in minor trouble with the
police, is for the police to turn
him over to University authori
ties for discipline.
