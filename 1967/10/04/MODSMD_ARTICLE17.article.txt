### 
DETROIT (AP) â€” President
Johnson easily won a nonpopu
larity ice cream poll at the Uni
versity of Detroit, with students
voting for "the man I'd least
like to see in the White House."
Johnson's 31.9 per cent was
well ahead of the second-place
finisher, former Alabama Gov.
George Wallace, who got 24.3
per cent of the vote. Votes were
tabulated on the basis of ice
cream cones purchased at a
campus booth.
