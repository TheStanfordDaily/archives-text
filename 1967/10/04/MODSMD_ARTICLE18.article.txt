# United Fund Readies Drive
## 
### 
The annual collection drive
among faculty for the Stanford
United Fund will begin Monday,
and continue through October
20. There will be no United Fund
drive among Stanford students.
Faculty members can make ar
rangements for contributions to
be deducted from their payrolls.
Contributions will also be soli
cited from various ASSU funds.
The Stanford United Fund,
whose goal this year is $45,000,
distributes the proceeds of the
campaign to over 50 welfare and
charity organizations through
out Santa Clara County.
The purpose of the United
Fund is to replace the Commu
nity Chest as a support of wel
fare programs. Stanford Fund
Chairman, Robert Strena, calls
the United Fund a "giver orient
ed program." It has been set up
by the contributors themselves
and not by organizations in
volved. Collections are made by
soliciting businesses.
Included in the organizations
which receive funds, are some
Stanford Medical School chari
ties, the Mental Health Associa
tion, the Stanford Council of Boy
Scouts, and the Family Service
Program.
The Stanford United Fund,
says Strena, is one of the "most
significant campaigns in the
area." Last year, the Stanford
goal of $40,000 was exceeded by
several thousand dollars.
