### JOHN WRIGHT 
Touch football kicks off this
year's intramural program with
an eight-game schedule today.
Fourteen six-team leagues will
compete in round robin competi
tion over the next five weeks.
The champion and runner-up
from each of the nine "A" lea
gues will then play an elimina
tion tournament to determine
the University champion.
Can Philpot Do It?
The Phi Kaps have lost quar
terback Don Lytig from last
year's team but are hopeful that
sophomore Ken Philpot will lead
them to another championship
with a strong passing attack.
DU features a trio of ends in
John Kidde, Don Barceloux, and
Tom Pfister who are capable of
playing both ways, while sopho
more Greg Banks starts at quar
terback.
The Theta Delts have a start
ing offensive seven that played
together as sophomores two
years ago and went all the way
to the semis last year only to
be eliminated by the eventual
champion Phi Kaps.

The combination of Moseley,
Riles, Tracey, Butler, Fishback,
Ensz, and Ammons makes up
for its lack of size with speed,
having won several close games
last autumn with excellent ex
ecution.
Jocks Tangle
The Dclts feel they have a
better team than the one elimi
nated last year in the quarter
finals. Sophomore quarterback
Doug Day will be protected by
center Rick Lindsley and block
ing backs Jack Alustiza and
Russ Goodman, all of whom
weigh over 200.
Sigma Chi Omega should have
another powerful team. They
have the size to wear down their
opponents with seven linemen
over 210, and 270-pound block
ing back Bill Ryan will spear
head a strong running attack.
Phi Sigma Kappa, who had the
misfortune of being placed in
the same league as the Phi Kaps
and Sigma Chi last year, lost
only three of their starting four
teen and should field another
strong team.

center Rick Lindsley and block
ing backs Jack Alustiza and
Russ Goodman, all of whom
weigh over 200.
Sigma Chi Omega should have
another powerful team. They
have the size to wear down their
opponents with seven linemen
over 210, and 270-pound block
ing back Bill Ryan will spear
head a strong running attack.
Phi Sigma Kappa, who had the
misfortune of being placed in
the same league as the Phi Kaps
and Sigma Chi last year, lost
only three of their starting four
teen and should field another
strong team.
