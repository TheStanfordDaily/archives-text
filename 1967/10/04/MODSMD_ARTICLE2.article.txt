### 
R. Buckminster Fuller dis
cussed aspects of specialization
in society in his free-wheeling
impromptu address last night as
the keynote speaker in the Cen
tury 21 lecture series.
The noted author and in
ventor will conduct an informal
question and answer session in
Dinkelspiel auditorium tonight
at 7:30. The subject will be his
life and work.
Fuller discussed the concept
of specialization in reference to
the extinction of certain species.
He eventually concluded that the
computer, epitome of specializa
tion, poses the threat of possible
extinction to the human race.

A navigator familiar with
ballistics, Fuller referred to peo
ple as "individual astronauts
who travel on "the spaceship
Earth." Fuller explained his 40-
year-old belief that it is possible
to make long-range predictions
concerning the events which will
take place on earth.
Society, said Fuller, often
tends to categorize ideas as be
ing either natural or artificial.
"What you are permitted to do,"
he explains, "is natural; what
you are not permitted to do is
not natural."
Born in Massachusetts, and
educated at Harvard and the
U.S. Naval Academy, the 72-

year-old speaker holds nine hon
orary degrees and is professor
of generalized design at South
ern Illinois University.
The fall quarter of the Cen
tury 21 program will focus on
international relations; the win
ter quarter will center on the
biological and psychological as
pects of the individual; and th?
spring quarter will deal with
new technology and the struc
ture of society.
