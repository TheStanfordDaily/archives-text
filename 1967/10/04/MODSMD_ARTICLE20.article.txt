# No Passing Test For Marquess
## Ralston Keeps Plays Veiled 
### NICK SELBY 
(An interview with Tribe foot
ball coach John Ralston.)
Q. You said Thursday night
that the team would try to use
a varied attack, which means
about an even use of running
and passing plays. Yet in the
first half, we ran 32 running
plays, and had only six pass at>
tempts. It was nearly the same
in the second half too. Did you
change your game plan or did
Marquess just go to more run
ning plays?
Coach Ralston: No, we didn't
change our game plan. We called
21 passes in the game, but on
eight of those plays wc were
forced to run or else the block
ing broke down and Mark took a
loss. We try to aim at about a
2 to 1 ratio of runs to passes. We
hoped to pass more when we
got that 21-7 lead, but that ended
and after (Bob) Rinker's inter
ception we decided not to throw
at all.
Q. One of the aims of the
varied offense was to give Mar
quess a test at passing. This did
n't seem like a real test to see
if he could throw against USC.
Coach Ralston: No, it wasn't
an ideal test for him. But we can
tell from practice scrimmages
how he's coming along. We're
very pleased with his progress
â€” his timing and throwing get
better every day.

Q. Why did you replace Mar
quess in the third quarter. Was
this to get Williams to throw
the ball?
Coach Ralston: No, it was our
game plan to have him come in
in the third quarter. He's well re
covered and we want to use him
now.

Q. What happened on the
touchdown pass that Williams
threw to Jim Cross, the flanker?
Coach Ralston: Dick Vermeil
and Bob Gambold do a great
job of spotting weaknesses for
us from the press box. They saw
a weakness in San Jose's man
for-man defense and called the
play. We probably could have
used it sooner. Their defensive
backs were playing very close
to the receivers.
Q. What were the new plays
this week? It still seems as
though we have three plays:
Marquess on a run option, Kirt
man around end, and Root up
the middle.
Coach Ralston: This is our

basic offense, and you've got to
have a good base. We try to
improve the execution of these
fundamental plays every week.
Actually, we had a different set
of plays from practice which we
could have used. We didn't need
them and so we decided not to
unveil them.
Q. Why did you have Tom
Massey returning the punts last
week? That was his first action
wasn't it?
Coach Ralston: Tom's been
coming along really well. He
transferred here from Long
Beach City College in the fall
and missed spring practice. It's
taken him some time to get ac
customed.
Q. Why does Illnker play back
so far in Ids safety position? It
seems that he is back about 17
yards from the line of scrim

mage. It's as though there Is a
hole which moves hack as every
one on the defense moves back.
The receiver slips the linebacker
and is free in the middle of the
secondary.
Coach Ralston: We feel he
gets better field coverage from
back there, attacking the ball
instead of going back to meet it.
We may have voided that area
in the center a few times. The
receiver is definitely the rspon
sibility of the linebacker.
(J. How does USC look?
Coach Ralston: USC had a
lot of great athletes and will be
very tough. We have to assume
that we can run against them.
And the way to stop their pass
attack will be to get to their
passer. Don Swartz's knee should
be OK for the game, but Andy
Carrigan's shoulder makes him
doubtful.
