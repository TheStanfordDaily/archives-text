# Keeping In 'Shape' With Male Partners
## 
### BECKY BRINEGAR 
Stanford women — are you
worried about not getting
enough exercise and literally
losing that wonderful shape you
presently have? Stanford men
— do you feel you need more
contact with Stanford women?
The Women's Physical Edu
cation department offers a wide
range of activities designed to
combat both of these problems.
At least half of activities,
which stretch from dancing to
tennis doubles, from swimming
to volleyball, are co-ed This ex
plains why men were at the
women's P.E. table on Reg Day.
Bang, Bang:!
There is intercollegiate com
petition in almost all sports,
with both the all-women and co
educational teams traveling as
far as Michigan for a tennis
tournament and Montana for a
rifle shoot.

However, most students parti
cipate at the class and intramu
ral level (which the Women's
Recreation Association spon
sors).
Fall quarter sees action in
basketball, and in the spring
there are the Stanford mixed
doubles tournament and a co
rec volleyball tournament.
Dolly Escort!
Men are included as much as
possible in the women's pro
gram. Wednesday night badmin
ton is open to all, as is co-rec
tennis on Friday afternoons. And
men may even use the women's
pool during weekend open hours
if escorted by a Stanford Dolly!
Another active co-ed sport is
dance, in modern, folk, and so
cial forms.
For more information on these
sports, contact the Women's P.E.
Department at the Women's
Gym.
