# Librarian To Sing In Benefit
## 
### 
Next Tuesday evening at 8:30
in Memorial Auditorium the
Staff Association of the Stan
ford Library will present a bene
fit recital by Mr. Raymond
Nilsson for the association s
Scholarship Fund. The money
collected at the box office will
help put a member of the li
brary staff through his specialty
school.
What gives this news more
value was the discovery that
the headliner for the coming
performance —and a first rate
opera star— is presently work
ing at the current periodicals
desk in the main library.
Nilsson, a native Australian,
began his career by giving up a
secure but unproductive job as
a school teacher in Sydney in
1948 to enter a conservatory.
After his graduation, the tenor
achieved a rather rapid rise in
his field and soon found himself
leading the hectic life of a opera
singer performing 42 weeks a
year.

Although the majority of
Nilsson's work has been done
in Europe, England and South
Africa, a concert tour several
years ago brought him to the
West Coast.
Realizing that his family saw
far too little of him, he decided
to settle down in the bay area.
He now supplements his selec
tively-chosen foreign appear
ances with a steady job at Stan

ford in the library and on the
athletic field where he helps
coach the Stanford Rugby team.
Back in 1954, on the recom
mendation from the conductor
Sir Eugene Goossens, Nilsson
joined the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, as a principal
tenor. He then starred in such
operas as "La Boheme," "La
Traviata," "Carmen," and "Jen
ufa,' and remained with the
company until 1961 when he
made his American operatic de
but at the San Francisco Opera
House as Lionel in "Martha."
He has since become a regular
principal tenor with the San
Francisco Opera Company.
T.V. Performances
Nilsson has also become well
known for his appearances in
television opera. He gained a
reputation for performing con
temporary works such as Stra
vinsky's "Oedipus Rex," which
he will perform again in Decem
ber with Joseph Krips and the
San Francisco Symphony.
Nilsson will perform a wide
selection of pieces from Roman
tic operas when he appears next
Tuesday in Memorial Auditor
ium.
