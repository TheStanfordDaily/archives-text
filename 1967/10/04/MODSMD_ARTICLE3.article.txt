# Ex-IVS Head Cites Suffering, Waste, Devastation In Vietnam

### DAN SNELL 
Donald Luce, former director
of International Volunteer Ser
vice (IVS) in Vietnam, told a
standing-room-only crowd in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night, "To the Vietnamese the
tally-sheet on the war is one of
suffering."
Luce, who worked as an agri
cultural adviser to Vietnamese
farmers, resigned recently in
protest against U.S. policy there.
He said the plight of farmers
and refugees and the problem
of inflation were the most ob
vious consequences of the war
to the Vietnamese.
Luce arrived back in the U.S.
Monday. Stanford was his first
speaking engagement.
In the nine years Luce spent
In the country, prices for basic
commodities quadrupled and the
salary of a friend of his rose
from 6,000 to 10,000 piasters. The
inflation is brought about by the
loss of productivity caused by
drafting farmers and by the
"large foreign army in Vietnam
with too much money and on the
loose."
Rice Now Imported
The country's once-rich rice
bowl used to export rice to all
of Asia. Now it has to import
It. Luce said, "Agriculture has
been almost completely destroy
ed."

Farmers complain of poor
transportation for their prod
ucts and of the insecurity of
knowing their lands may be
ravaged by troops or planes any
day.
There have been no experi
ments on new rice varieties for
five years in Vietnam. Luce said
it would take six to ten years
after the war is over for Viet
nam to regain its former rice
productivity.
"Defoliants are destroying the
vegetables along roads and
canals," Luce complained. Canals
and ditches cannot be cleaned
because of military operations.
Then they become clogged and
useless for irrigation.
Ditches Flood
According to Luce, one Amer
ican officer refused to let farm
ers clean a ditch used for troops'
drinking water. As a result when
the ditch flooded, as the Viet
namese had predicted, 20,000
families were displaced.
'To the refugees the most im
portant thing is their land," Luce
said. "They lose confidence in
life if they're separated from
their land." Refugees usually
end up in the cities or on the
beaches after five or six moves
from village to village.
"Most American aid to refu
gees and others is judged by
whether it works against the

Communists, whether it
WHAMS â€”'Wins Hearts and
Minds," Luce said.
When Luce and three other
top IVS officials resigned rec
ently, they wrote to President
Johnson and called for de-escala
tion, an end to defoliation and
bombing, recognition of the Na
tional Liberation Front (Viet
Cong) in peace negotiations and
an international peace commis
sion to arrange for conferences.
One of Luce's Vietnamese
friends commented, "Now we
know you're not CIA."
Another Vietnamese said,
"You have said what we'd be
put in prison for saying."
"I felt I had to leave in order
to try to discuss some of the
problems I've seen in Vietnam,"
Luce explained. He said he felt
students should have "a much
quieter manner, and be much
more open to the problem" than
some of them are now.
Asked if American withdraw
al might jeopardize the future
of democracy in Vietnam, Luce
replied, "I think the American
presence in Vietnam has already
prevented the practice of democ
racy."
Vermont-born Luce, now
guest-in-residence at Wilb u r
Hall, will stay at Stanford
through tomorrow, when he will
continue his speaking tour.
