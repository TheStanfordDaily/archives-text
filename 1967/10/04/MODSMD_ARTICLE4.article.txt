# Marijuana Charge
## Narcos Bag Grateful Dead 
### 
The Haight-Ashbury pad of
The Grateful Dead — San Fran
cisco's reigning "acid-rock" band
— was raided yesterday by State
narcotics agents and two mem
bers of the group were booked
on marijuana charges.
They will appear in court this
morning.
The raid on the Dead's 13-room
Victorian house at 710 Ashbury
Street also led to the arrest of
the group's equipment manager,
two business managers and six
girls — ranging in age from 13
to 22. The two recording stars
bagged were Ron "Pig Pen" Mc-
Kernan, the Dead's lead singer,
and Robert Weir, a rhythm gui
tarist.
It was uncertain yesterday
afternoon if charges would be
filed against the three other
members of the group not ac
tually present at the house at
the time of the raid — Jerry
"Captain Trips" Garcia, the lead

guitarist, Phil Lesh, the bass
player and song writer, and Bill
Sommers, the drummer.
Of the eleven taken down to
the station, all were free on $500
bail a few hours after their ar
rests.
More Raids Seen
The bust was pulled by State
agents and San Francisco police
at three in the afternoon and was
described by State Narcotics
Bureau Chief Matthew O'Connor
as the start of a stepped-up at
tack on Haight-Ashbury mari
juana traffic.
O'Connor said the Grateful
Dead raid was made because
other investigation "kept turn
ing up the address 710 Ashbury
as a supply source."
He said the five state agents
and two city inspectors confis
cated over a pound of marijuana
and hashish.
The chief described the scene
as follows: "They were process
ing some marijuana in the kitch

en by running it through a co
lander — to get rid of the stems
and seeds."
By-Standers Abusive
Some hippie acquaintances
who were in the house when
the raid came but who were re
leased, walked across the street
and sat on the sidewalk to watch
the proceedings. When the first
person came out of the house in
handcuffs, one girl yelled a fami
liar 12-letter epithet at the of
ficers.
But it had little effect, and
the eleven hippies were put in
a paddy wagon, taken to city
prison and booked on one charge
each of possession of marijuana.
Most recently, the Grateful
Dead have been playing at the
Straight Theater in the hippie
district. The managers of the
theater have lately delighted
Hashbury by side-tracking a
city ban on further dance halls
in the area. They call them
selves a dancing school.

handcuffs, one girl yelled a fami
liar 12-letter epithet at the of
ficers.
But it had little effect, and
the eleven hippies were put in
a paddy wagon, taken to city
prison and booked on one charge
each of possession of marijuana.
Most recently, the Grateful
Dead have been playing at the
Straight Theater in the hippie
district. The managers of the
theater have lately delighted
Hashbury by side-tracking a
city ban on further dance halls

The Haight-Ashbury pad of
The Grateful Dead — San Fran
cisco's reigning "acid-rock" band
— was raided yesterday by State
narcotics agents and two mem
bers of the group were booked
on marijuana charges.
They will appear in court this
morning.
The raid on the Dead's 13-room
Victorian house at 710 Ashbury
Street also led to the arrest of
the group's equipment manager,
two business managers and six
girls — ranging in age from 13
to 22. The two recording stars
bagged were Ron "Pig Pen" Mc-
Kernan, the Dead's lead singer,
and Robert Weir, a rhythm gui
tarist.
It was uncertain yesterday
afternoon if charges would be
filed against the three other
members of the group not ac
tually present at the house at
the time of the raid — Jerry
"Captain Trips" Garcia, the lead

guitarist, Phil Lesh, the bass
player and song writer, and Bill
Sommers, the drummer.
Of the eleven taken down to
the station, all were free on $500
bail a few hours after their ar
rests.
More Raids Seen
The bust was pulled by State
agents and San Francisco police
at three in the afternoon and was
described by State Narcotics
Bureau Chief Matthew O'Connor
as the start of a stepped-up at
tack on Haight-Ashbury mari
juana traffic.
O'Connor said the Grateful
Dead raid was made because
other investigation "kept turn
ing up the address 710 Ashbury
as a supply source."
He said the five state agents
and two city inspectors confis
cated over a pound of marijuana
and hashish.
The chief described the scene
as follows: "They were process
ing some marijuana in the kitch

en by running it through a co
lander — to get rid of the stems
and seeds."
By-Standers Abusive
Some hippie acquaintances
who were in the house when
the raid came but who were re
leased, walked across the street
and sat on the sidewalk to watch
the proceedings. When the first
person came out of the house in
handcuffs, one girl yelled a fami
liar 12-letter epithet at the of
ficers.
