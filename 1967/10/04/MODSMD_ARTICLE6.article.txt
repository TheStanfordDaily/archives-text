# Lyman Criticizes Senate Proposal
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Controversy boiled up around
the proposed "Academic Senate
yesterday as ASSU President
Peter Lyman called it "piece
meal reform" which could "dis
enfranchise" students.
Lyman said the plan to set up
a 65 member faculty senate with
a token student and administra
tion presence would delay prog
ress toward "community" gov
ernment of the University, with
all three groups fairly repre
sented.
In a letter to be given today
to the executive committee of
the Academic Council, Lyman
questioned "the priority given
the proposal for a Faculty Sen
ate over the more basic and
crucial question of the reorgan
ization of the University gov
ernment as a whole."
Would Replace Council
The Academic Senate, as de
to the Academic Council
Friday, would largely replace
that cumbersome 800-member
body as the faculty's governing
organization. About 55 faculty
representatives would be elect
ed by the various departments.
Five student and five admini
stration representatives would
complete the membership.
The new Senate would let the
faculty "assume a larger role,
both of an initiating and a medi
ating nature, in the affairs of

the University," according to a
June memorandum describing
the plan.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, chair
man of the Academic Council
executive committee and of the
subcommittee which presented
a draft of the plan Friday, said
yesterday he hopes the Aca
demic Senate will "bring the
initiative back to the faculty"
in areas such as admissions and
curriculum."
He said "the intent of the sub
committee is not that this Sen
ate should be the ruling body of
the University," but added that
it may assume powers signifi
cantly greater than those ex
ercised by the Academic Council.
Budget Powers?
Assumption of some power
over University budgets "is not
precluded" in the draft plan,
Arrow said.
Disagreement has arisen over
the method of selection of fac
ulty representatives. Support
has been voiced for both equal
representation of departments
and assigning votes to depart
ments according to the number
of Academic Council members
each contains.
Arrow said the executive com
mittee has received about 15 let
ters so far on this issue. The
committee will hear arguments
on representation at a hearing
October 18.
Faculty members involved in
drawing up the Senate plan said
yesterday that only five student
and five administration member
ships were provided, to aid com
munication between University
groups while not giving them
important voting power.
Prof. Philip Dawson, a mem
ber of the subcommittee, said,
"there wasn't any magic in the
number five. It's just a repre
sentation large enough so that
the thinking of students would
be adequately presented, but suf
ficiently small so it wouldn't
make any practical difference
whether students are allowed
to vote."
"We are not trying to repre
sent students," he added.
ASSU President Lyman, who
would be one of the five student
representatives, told The Daily
he believes "the purpose of this
faculty senate is to consider the
SES (Study of Education at
Stanford) proposals" due next
year on sweeping University re
forms.
"Five students is not real rep
resentation," he said, "and SES
would be reviewed by this body.

The students would be disenfran
chised."
Lyman favors a "community
senate" on the lines of the Com
mittee of 15, with equal repre
sentation of the three "constitu
encies": faculty, students and
administration.
Questions Purpose
The real function of the Aca
demic Senate is not clear, Ly
man said. "It seems to me that
the stated purpose of this pro
posal and its real intention are
quite different.
"The stated purpose seems to
be that since the Academic Coun
cil is unwieldy, it has to be re
organized to get a more co
herent group. But the intention
seems to be for this new body
to absorb a lot of powers that
were previously held by the ad
ministration," Lyman said.
Tom Forstenzer, former speak
er of the student legislature,
said the Academic Senate is
"the visible part of an iceberg."
He believes the token represen
tation of students and admini
strators is an attempt to give
the Senate the appearance of a
community-wide body when it is
actually just a reformed Aca
demic Council.
If the "Faculty Senate," as Ly
man insists on calling the pro
posed body, "is to govern the
University and to consider is
sues which directly affect mem
bers of the University other
than the faculty, then the five
student representatives are a
mockery," Lyman said.
Lyman ends his letter to the
executive committee by asking
for a review, with student par
ticipation, of the "priorities" in
reform of University govern
ments.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer,
who originated the Academic
Senate proposal, said yesterday
the Senate was not intended to
be a community governing body.
"I don't believe in this three-con
stituency idea," he said. "There
is no difference between faculty
and administrators in this re
spect. I don't see the student
body as a separate constituency."
Prof. Dawson anticipated three
possible responses by the stu
dent leaders to the Academic
Senate plan. "First, they can
express satisfaction with the five
representatives. Second, they
can decide they'd rather main
tain complete independence and
have no representatives. And
third, they could try to press
for more representatives through
negotiations."

"The stated purpose seems to
be that since the Academic Coun
cil is unwieldy, it has to be re
organized to get a more co
herent group. But the intention
seems to be for this new body
to absorb a lot of powers that
were previously held by the ad
ministration," Lyman said.
Tom Forstenzer, former speak
er of the student legislature,
said the Academic Senate is
"the visible part of an iceberg."
He believes the token represen
tation of students and admini
strators is an attempt to give
the Senate the appearance of a
community-wide body when it is
actually just a reformed Aca
demic Council.
If the "Faculty Senate," as Ly
man insists on calling the pro
posed body, "is to govern the
University and to consider is
sues which directly affect mem
bers of the University other
than the faculty, then the five
student representatives are a
mockery," Lyman said.
Lyman ends his letter to the
executive committee by asking
for a review, with student par
ticipation, of the "priorities" in
reform of University govern
ments.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer,
who originated the Academic
Senate proposal, said yesterday
the Senate was not intended to
be a community governing body.
"I don't believe in this three-con
stituency idea," he said. "There
is no difference between faculty
and administrators in this re
spect. I don't see the student
body as a separate constituency."
Prof. Dawson anticipated three
possible responses by the stu
dent leaders to the Academic
Senate plan. "First, they can
express satisfaction with the five
representatives. Second, they
can decide they'd rather main
tain complete independence and
have no representatives. And
third, they could try to press
for more representatives through
negotiations."
Controversy boiled up around
the proposed "Academic Senate
yesterday as ASSU President
Peter Lyman called it "piece
meal reform" which could "dis
enfranchise" students.
Lyman said the plan to set up
a 65 member faculty senate with
a token student and administra
tion presence would delay prog
ress toward "community" gov
ernment of the University, with
all three groups fairly repre
sented.
In a letter to be given today
to the executive committee of
the Academic Council, Lyman
questioned "the priority given
the proposal for a Faculty Sen
ate over the more basic and
crucial question of the reorgan
ization of the University gov
ernment as a whole."
Would Replace Council
The Academic Senate, as de
to the Academic Council
Friday, would largely replace
that cumbersome 800-member
body as the faculty's governing
organization. About 55 faculty
representatives would be elect
ed by the various departments.
Five student and five admini
stration representatives would
complete the membership.
The new Senate would let the
faculty "assume a larger role,
both of an initiating and a medi
ating nature, in the affairs of

the University," according to a
June memorandum describing
the plan.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, chair
man of the Academic Council
executive committee and of the
subcommittee which presented
a draft of the plan Friday, said
yesterday he hopes the Aca
demic Senate will "bring the
initiative back to the faculty"
in areas such as admissions and
curriculum."
He said "the intent of the sub
committee is not that this Sen
ate should be the ruling body of
the University," but added that
it may assume powers signifi
cantly greater than those ex
ercised by the Academic Council.
Budget Powers?
Assumption of some power
over University budgets "is not
precluded" in the draft plan,
Arrow said.
Disagreement has arisen over
the method of selection of fac
ulty representatives. Support
has been voiced for both equal
representation of departments
and assigning votes to depart
ments according to the number
of Academic Council members
each contains.
Arrow said the executive com
mittee has received about 15 let
ters so far on this issue. The
committee will hear arguments
on representation at a hearing
October 18.
Faculty members involved in
drawing up the Senate plan said
yesterday that only five student
and five administration member
ships were provided, to aid com
munication between University
groups while not giving them
important voting power.
Prof. Philip Dawson, a mem
ber of the subcommittee, said,
"there wasn't any magic in the
number five. It's just a repre
sentation large enough so that
the thinking of students would
be adequately presented, but suf
ficiently small so it wouldn't
make any practical difference
whether students are allowed
to vote."
"We are not trying to repre
sent students," he added.
ASSU President Lyman, who
would be one of the five student
representatives, told The Daily
he believes "the purpose of this
faculty senate is to consider the
SES (Study of Education at
Stanford) proposals" due next
year on sweeping University re
forms.
"Five students is not real rep
resentation," he said, "and SES
would be reviewed by this body.

The students would be disenfran
chised."
Lyman favors a "community
senate" on the lines of the Com
mittee of 15, with equal repre
sentation of the three "constitu
encies": faculty, students and
administration.

has been voiced for both equal
representation of departments
and assigning votes to depart
ments according to the number
of Academic Council members
each contains.
Arrow said the executive com
mittee has received about 15 let
ters so far on this issue. The
committee will hear arguments
on representation at a hearing
October 18.
Faculty members involved in
drawing up the Senate plan said
yesterday that only five student
and five administration member
ships were provided, to aid com
munication between University
groups while not giving them
important voting power.
Prof. Philip Dawson, a mem
ber of the subcommittee, said,
"there wasn't any magic in the
number five. It's just a repre
sentation large enough so that
the thinking of students would
be adequately presented, but suf
ficiently small so it wouldn't
make any practical difference
whether students are allowed
to vote."
"We are not trying to repre
sent students," he added.
ASSU President Lyman, who
would be one of the five student
representatives, told The Daily
he believes "the purpose of this
faculty senate is to consider the
SES (Study of Education at
Stanford) proposals" due next
year on sweeping University re
forms.
"Five students is not real rep
resentation," he said, "and SES
would be reviewed by this body.

The students would be disenfran
chised."
Lyman favors a "community
senate" on the lines of the Com
mittee of 15, with equal repre
sentation of the three "constitu
encies": faculty, students and
administration.
Questions Purpose
The real function of the Aca
demic Senate is not clear, Ly
man said. "It seems to me that
the stated purpose of this pro
posal and its real intention are
quite different.
"The stated purpose seems to
be that since the Academic Coun
cil is unwieldy, it has to be re
organized to get a more co
herent group. But the intention
seems to be for this new body
to absorb a lot of powers that
were previously held by the ad
ministration," Lyman said.
Tom Forstenzer, former speak
er of the student legislature,
said the Academic Senate is
"the visible part of an iceberg."
He believes the token represen
tation of students and admini
strators is an attempt to give
the Senate the appearance of a
community-wide body when it is
actually just a reformed Aca
demic Council.
If the "Faculty Senate," as Ly
man insists on calling the pro
posed body, "is to govern the
University and to consider is
sues which directly affect mem
bers of the University other
than the faculty, then the five
student representatives are a
mockery," Lyman said.
Lyman ends his letter to the
executive committee by asking
for a review, with student par
ticipation, of the "priorities" in
reform of University govern
ments.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer,
who originated the Academic
Senate proposal, said yesterday
the Senate was not intended to
be a community governing body.
"I don't believe in this three-con
stituency idea," he said. "There
is no difference between faculty
and administrators in this re
spect. I don't see the student
body as a separate constituency."
Prof. Dawson anticipated three
possible responses by the stu
dent leaders to the Academic
Senate plan. "First, they can
express satisfaction with the five
representatives. Second, they
can decide they'd rather main
tain complete independence and
have no representatives. And
third, they could try to press
for more representatives through
negotiations."
Controversy boiled up around
the proposed "Academic Senate
yesterday as ASSU President
Peter Lyman called it "piece
meal reform" which could "dis
enfranchise" students.
Lyman said the plan to set up
a 65 member faculty senate with
a token student and administra
tion presence would delay prog
ress toward "community" gov
ernment of the University, with
all three groups fairly repre
sented.
In a letter to be given today
to the executive committee of
the Academic Council, Lyman
questioned "the priority given
the proposal for a Faculty Sen
ate over the more basic and
crucial question of the reorgan
ization of the University gov
ernment as a whole."
Would Replace Council
The Academic Senate, as de
to the Academic Council
Friday, would largely replace
that cumbersome 800-member
body as the faculty's governing
organization. About 55 faculty
representatives would be elect
ed by the various departments.
Five student and five admini
stration representatives would
complete the membership.
The new Senate would let the
faculty "assume a larger role,
both of an initiating and a medi
ating nature, in the affairs of

the University," according to a
June memorandum describing
the plan.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, chair
man of the Academic Council
executive committee and of the
subcommittee which presented
a draft of the plan Friday, said
yesterday he hopes the Aca
demic Senate will "bring the
initiative back to the faculty"
in areas such as admissions and
curriculum."
He said "the intent of the sub
committee is not that this Sen
ate should be the ruling body of
the University," but added that
it may assume powers signifi
cantly greater than those ex
ercised by the Academic Council.
Budget Powers?
Assumption of some power
over University budgets "is not
precluded" in the draft plan,
Arrow said.
Disagreement has arisen over
the method of selection of fac
ulty representatives. Support
has been voiced for both equal
representation of departments
