# SES Officials Speak
## Students Lack Involvement 
### 
Two Study of Education of
ficials yesterday expressed con
cern over the lack of student in
volvement and student interest
in the two year study.
Robert Hind, Staff Director
of the Study, and Mark Man
call, member of the Steering
Committee, spoke to forty stu
dent leaders at the annual Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow con
ference.
"I feel you are waiting to be
excited," Mancall told the stu
dents, "but it's just as much
a responsibility for the students
to excite and challenge the fac
ulty and administration."
Complacency
Hind told of a series of 35
selected seniors int rviewed at
the end of last year concerning
the Study. "We were amazed
at the complacency of the stu
dents," he said.
"If students are to take a
more active role in the Study,"
said Mancall, "they must start
asking the questions. The Steer
ing Committee must start hear
ing those questions."
Hind defended the selection of
student members of the Steer
ing Committee by stating the
members were not intended to
be in any way representative,
but people "with imagination,
courage, and a willingness to do
Intensive work over a long per
iod of time."
The selection was the center of
a comtroversy last winter when
Study officials chose the students
without direct participation by
elected student officers.
Larger Committees?
Mancall noted it is unclear
how reactions to study recom
mendations will be solicited

from the Stanford community,
but stated much larger and
more representative committees
are presently under considera
tion.
Hind cited student participa
tion in the open hearings held
last spring, the joint ASSU-SES
seminars being held this year,
and the student members of the
Study subcommittees as evi
dences of the extent of student
participation.
Mancall strongly warned
against applying the model of
democracy to the Study or to
the Universitv community.

He implied equality for stu
dents in all University affairs
such as the Study would be un
realistic. "The University may be
a community, but it is not a
community where all opinions
carry equal weight," he said.
Hind concurred that "the Uni
versity is not a democratic in
stitution."
"Decisions cannot be made on
a purely democratic basis,"
Mancall continued. "You cannot
legislate in an institution like
this on the basis of the immed
iate needs of (today's) group
of students." Mancall claimed

the needs of today's students
would be quickly replaced by
those of the near future.
Asked why the Study began
considering substantive issues
before settling on a definition of
the University, Hind replied: "It
is impossible to make one philo
sophical statement and let all
institutions flow from it."
"I'm not sure I would want
to see a hard and fast statement
on the nature and basic pur
poses of the University. This
could easily inhibit the develop
ment of new forms of educa
tion."
