# End The Dean's List
## 
### 
Registrar Harvey Hall hit the nail on the head
Friday when he said one solution to the contro
versy over the Dean's List is to abolish it out
right.
He also showed refreshing frankness when he
commented that the Dean's List doesn't do much
besides "make people feel good."
All 1400 of them.
Since The Daily doesn't have to be quite so
polite and circumspect as a key University ad
ministrator, we can say a bit more:
The Dean's List is a lot of bloody nonsense that
should have been done away with years ago.
It had precious little meaning before pass-fail

grading; and has no meaning now that pass-fail
grading is widespread.
If the University still wants to call attention
to those undergraduates with "grade point aver
ages" exceeding 3.2, it should find a better way
of doing it. The list is now so long that The Daily
doesn't have space to print it. Maybe a gold star
can be pasted on the forehead of each deserving
scholar.
The Dean's List is a dusty relic in the Univer
sity's attic of academic irrelevance. This attic
has gotten some housecleaning recently, such as
sweeping class rank into the trash can last June.
Get out the broom again. â€”M.S.
