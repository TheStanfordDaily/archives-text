# Massarenti Seeks Expanded Cultural Programs
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Cesare Massarenti, the Italian
graduate student who was elect
ed student body vice-president
last May, is busy organizing his
office as a central "clearance

place" for a wide variety of cul
tural and social activities.
Besides starting a program of
jazz and rock concerts last week
with Buddy Guy's Blues Band,
Massarenti has selected the films
for three weekly movie series.
His ambitious plans include elec
tronic music recitals and experi
mental student theatre subsi
dized by the Associated Students
of Stanford University (ASSU).
He invites all students organ
izing cultural events to work
through his office to find space
for performers, get publicity,
and arrange financing. His as
sistant is Bob Stillman.
Plans for finding a place on
campus for informal student the
atre are still young. Massarenti
is also working at finding an

appropriate hall for electronic
music.
"The place is the key," Massa
renti said. "To go into Dinkel
spiel and listen to electronic mu
sic makes no sense. All the seats
are irrelevant."
The 26-year-old doctoral can
didate in sociology explains his
interest in entertainment acti
vities as simply one kind of edu
cation, sometimes neglected in
the University's past cultural
programs. "And what is today
called informal education," he
said, "appears to me as culture."
Is it unusual for a student
politician to be spending most
of his time on cultural events?
Massarenti thinks not. "The cul
tural programs are a political

tool to reach certain goals." Mas
sarenti's goals include an awak
ening of student initiative in
new, unconventional music and
theatre.
"What we do with our free
time is an increasingly important
problem," he explained. "We see
the consequences of having no
cultural education in retirement.
How does one then spend his
time? Golf? I think we can spend
time better than that."
Tonight he will report on his
programs to the legislature of
the Associated Students (LAS
SU).
Buddy Guy's band will return
to Stanford October 15 and play
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. Other
performers Massarenti hopes to

schedule soon are the Grateful
Dead, if they are on parole, Paul
Butterfield, and Country Joe and
the Fish.
Massarenti hopes to make
enough money on these big-name
shows to finance less-known per
formers such as Big Mama May
Thornton, who sings in Tresidder
large lounge tomorrow after
noon. His first attempt, the Bud
dy Guy shows September 28 and
29, was a disappointment. He
also stepped on a few toes at
Lagunita by scheduling Buddy
Guy to perform in the dining
hall without prior consultation
with house presidents. "I'm
sorry that I had to do it, but if
the ASSU series was going to
have anything the first week,

it had to be there," he said, add
ing that in the future "there
will be consrltations."
Performers will live with stu
dents while at Stanford as "art
ists in residen .e," Massarenti
said. Buddy Guy stayed at the
Beta Chi house.
To save precious budget funds,
Massarenti is organizing a "con
sortium" of about 12 Western
colleges, including Reed, San
Jose, Oregon and UCLA, to con
tract for performers to appear
at each college in turn.
In movies, Massarenti has ar
ranged series of films with a
single theme. Tonight at Tresid
der Union the first of several
Pudovkin films, "Mother," will
be shown at 8:15 and followed

by a discussion at Bechtel Inter
national Center.
Other cinema themes are "Ten
dencies of Rationalism and Ir
rationalism in the 50's and 60's."
For films every Friday night
in Tresidder, continuing tomor
row with "Umberto D". Saturday
nights will have films by cer
tain noted directors, including
Visconti and Dreyer. The film
Oct. 7 is "Senso."
Massarenti teaches a fresh
man seminar in cinema criticism.
In fact, he is intimately involv
ed in most of the cultural pro
grams he envisions. He holds a
degree in composition from the
Conservatory of Music in Milan,
and nas staged electronic music
recitals in Italy. "They were dis
asters," he admitted cheerfully.

izing cultural events to work
through his office to find space
for performers, get publicity,
and arrange financing. His as
sistant is Bob Stillman.
Plans for finding a place on
campus for informal student the
atre are still young. Massarenti
is also working at finding an

appropriate hall for electronic
music.
"The place is the key," Massa
renti said. "To go into Dinkel
spiel and listen to electronic mu
sic makes no sense. All the seats
are irrelevant."
The 26-year-old doctoral can
didate in sociology explains his
interest in entertainment acti
vities as simply one kind of edu
cation, sometimes neglected in
the University's past cultural
programs. "And what is today
called informal education," he
said, "appears to me as culture."
Is it unusual for a student
politician to be spending most
of his time on cultural events?
Massarenti thinks not. "The cul
tural programs are a political

tool to reach certain goals." Mas
sarenti's goals include an awak
ening of student initiative in
new, unconventional music and
theatre.
"What we do with our free
time is an increasingly important
problem," he explained. "We see
the consequences of having no
cultural education in retirement.
How does one then spend his
time? Golf? I think we can spend
time better than that."
Tonight he will report on his
programs to the legislature of
the Associated Students (LAS
SU).
Buddy Guy's band will return
to Stanford October 15 and play
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. Other
performers Massarenti hopes to

schedule soon are the Grateful
Dead, if they are on parole, Paul
Butterfield, and Country Joe and
the Fish.
Massarenti hopes to make
enough money on these big-name
shows to finance less-known per
formers such as Big Mama May
Thornton, who sings in Tresidder
large lounge tomorrow after
noon. His first attempt, the Bud
dy Guy shows September 28 and
29, was a disappointment. He
also stepped on a few toes at
Lagunita by scheduling Buddy
Guy to perform in the dining
hall without prior consultation
with house presidents. "I'm
sorry that I had to do it, but if
the ASSU series was going to
have anything the first week,

it had to be there," he said, add
ing that in the future "there
will be consrltations."
Performers will live with stu
dents while at Stanford as "art
ists in residen .e," Massarenti
said. Buddy Guy stayed at the
Beta Chi house.
To save precious budget funds,
Massarenti is organizing a "con
sortium" of about 12 Western
colleges, including Reed, San
Jose, Oregon and UCLA, to con
tract for performers to appear
at each college in turn.
In movies, Massarenti has ar
ranged series of films with a
single theme. Tonight at Tresid
der Union the first of several
Pudovkin films, "Mother," will
be shown at 8:15 and followed

by a discussion at Bechtel Inter
national Center.
Other cinema themes are "Ten
dencies of Rationalism and Ir
rationalism in the 50's and 60's."
For films every Friday night
in Tresidder, continuing tomor
row with "Umberto D". Saturday
nights will have films by cer
tain noted directors, including
Visconti and Dreyer. The film
Oct. 7 is "Senso."
Massarenti teaches a fresh
man seminar in cinema criticism.
In fact, he is intimately involv
ed in most of the cultural pro
grams he envisions. He holds a
degree in composition from the
Conservatory of Music in Milan,
and nas staged electronic music
recitals in Italy. "They were dis
asters," he admitted cheerfully.

vities as simply one kind of edu
cation, sometimes neglected in
the University's past cultural
programs. "And what is today
called informal education," he
said, "appears to me as culture."
Is it unusual for a student
politician to be spending most
of his time on cultural events?
Massarenti thinks not. "The cul

tool to reach certain goals." Mas
sarenti's goals include an awak
ening of student initiative in
new, unconventional music and
theatre.
"What we do with our free
time is an increasingly important
problem," he explained. "We see
the consequences of having no
cultural education in retirement.
How does one then spend his
time? Golf? I think we can spend
time better than that."
Tonight he will report on his
programs to the legislature of
the Associated Students (LAS
SU).
Buddy Guy's band will return
to Stanford October 15 and play
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. Other
performers Massarenti hopes to

schedule soon are the Grateful
Dead, if they are on parole, Paul
Butterfield, and Country Joe and
the Fish.
Massarenti hopes to make
enough money on these big-name
shows to finance less-known per
formers such as Big Mama May
Thornton, who sings in Tresidder
large lounge tomorrow after
noon. His first attempt, the Bud
dy Guy shows September 28 and
29, was a disappointment. He
also stepped on a few toes at
Lagunita by scheduling Buddy
Guy to perform in the dining
hall without prior consultation
with house presidents. "I'm
sorry that I had to do it, but if
the ASSU series was going to
have anything the first week,

it had to be there," he said, add
ing that in the future "there
will be consrltations."
Performers will live with stu
dents while at Stanford as "art
ists in residen .e," Massarenti
said. Buddy Guy stayed at the
Beta Chi house.
To save precious budget funds,
Massarenti is organizing a "con
sortium" of about 12 Western
colleges, including Reed, San
Jose, Oregon and UCLA, to con
tract for performers to appear
at each college in turn.
In movies, Massarenti has ar
ranged series of films with a
single theme. Tonight at Tresid
der Union the first of several
Pudovkin films, "Mother," will
be shown at 8:15 and followed

by a discussion at Bechtel Inter
national Center.
Other cinema themes are "Ten
dencies of Rationalism and Ir
rationalism in the 50's and 60's."
For films every Friday night
in Tresidder, continuing tomor
row with "Umberto D". Saturday
nights will have films by cer
tain noted directors, including
Visconti and Dreyer. The film
Oct. 7 is "Senso."
Massarenti teaches a fresh
man seminar in cinema criticism.
In fact, he is intimately involv
ed in most of the cultural pro
grams he envisions. He holds a
degree in composition from the
Conservatory of Music in Milan,
and nas staged electronic music
recitals in Italy. "They were dis
asters," he admitted cheerfully.


CESARE MASSARENTI
Cesare Massarenti, the Italian
graduate student who was elect
ed student body vice-president
last May, is busy organizing his
office as a central "clearance

place" for a wide variety of cul
tural and social activities.
Besides starting a program of
jazz and rock concerts last week
with Buddy Guy's Blues Band,
Massarenti has selected the films
for three weekly movie series.
His ambitious plans include elec
tronic music recitals and experi
mental student theatre subsi
dized by the Associated Students
of Stanford University (ASSU).
He invites all students organ
izing cultural events to work
through his office to find space
for performers, get publicity,
and arrange financing. His as
sistant is Bob Stillman.
Plans for finding a place on
campus for informal student the
atre are still young. Massarenti
is also working at finding an

appropriate hall for electronic
music.
"The place is the key," Massa
renti said. "To go into Dinkel
spiel and listen to electronic mu
sic makes no sense. All the seats
are irrelevant."
The 26-year-old doctoral can
didate in sociology explains his
interest in entertainment acti
vities as simply one kind of edu
cation, sometimes neglected in
