# Academic Senate
## 
### 
The proposed senate now being considered by
the Academic Council just might push educa
tional reform ahead during the coming year, but
it could also place obstacles before the delibera
tions and proposals of the Study of Education at
Stanford.
Until it is clear what the sponsors of the Aca
demic Senate envision, it is impossible to predict
which will be the case.
Considered by itself, the Academic Senate is
a desperately needed reform. The Academic
Council of over 800 members cannot be coordi
nate or excited, or even informed about crucial
needs of the University.
Academic Council meetings are too infrequent
and rarely attract more than two or three hun
dred. This fraction of the faculty can hardly be
termed representative and should not be expect
ed to act fairly on behalf of the whole faculty.
While some reform is immediately needed, the
present Academic Senate proposal has raised sig
nificant challenges from Associated Students
President Peter Lyman and others.
Perhaps the key question to be raised is the
place of the student and the administration mem
bers. The suggestion that five students and five
administrators be voting members of the Senate
is both a sham of representation and an attempt
to buy off these "other factions" of the Univer
sity.
If students are merely to express student opin
ion, their presence at faculty deliberations is a
positive alteration in present practices. However,
with students and administrators as voting mem
bers of such a Senate, then the nature of the fac
ulty body has been significantly changed.
It becomes impossible to predict how the func
tions of the Senate may be expanded given the

"endorsement" of student and administration
representatives.
Philip Dawson, one of the sponsors of the Sen
ate Proposal, admitted student membership was
kept "sufficiently small so it wouldn't make any
practical difference whether administration and
students were allowed to vote."
So we ask what is the purpose of voting mem
bership for the "other factions' if the Senate is
only designed to perform more efficiently the
present functions of the Academic Council.
Peter Lyman seems to be reading intentions
into the proposal which are not really there. Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer and the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council are not trying
to head off reforms that might be considered by
the Study of Education.
Rather, they are reacting to the real and acute
weakness of a council which cannot give careful
consideration to a large body of Study reports
during the coming 15 months. In this sense, the
Academic Senate could be a great stimulus to
educational reform.
However, the Senate may come to be consid
ered the reformed arul representative body to
reform the rest of the University. Such a claim is
foolish. In the first place, the proposal anticipates
rather than proceeds from yet undefined eoncept
of how the whole University is to be governed.
Secondly, it relegates discussion of other vital
reforms an unrepresentative body.
The sponsors of the Senate may even discour
age the formation of the advisory committees
which the Study of Education now envisions will
review its final proposals.
"Community government" may be within the
grasp of Stanford during the next year, but the
token inclusion of students and administrators
in the Academic Senate stands in the way of that
possibility.

positive alteration in present practices. However,
with students and administrators as voting mem
bers of such a Senate, then the nature of the fac
ulty body has been significantly changed.
It becomes impossible to predict how the func
tions of the Senate may be expanded given the

"endorsement" of student and administration
representatives.
Philip Dawson, one of the sponsors of the Sen
ate Proposal, admitted student membership was
kept "sufficiently small so it wouldn't make any
practical difference whether administration and
students were allowed to vote."
So we ask what is the purpose of voting mem
bership for the "other factions' if the Senate is
only designed to perform more efficiently the
present functions of the Academic Council.
Peter Lyman seems to be reading intentions
into the proposal which are not really there. Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer and the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council are not trying
to head off reforms that might be considered by
the Study of Education.
Rather, they are reacting to the real and acute
weakness of a council which cannot give careful
consideration to a large body of Study reports
during the coming 15 months. In this sense, the
Academic Senate could be a great stimulus to
educational reform.
However, the Senate may come to be consid
ered the reformed arul representative body to
reform the rest of the University. Such a claim is
foolish. In the first place, the proposal anticipates
rather than proceeds from yet undefined eoncept
of how the whole University is to be governed.
Secondly, it relegates discussion of other vital
reforms an unrepresentative body.
The sponsors of the Senate may even discour
age the formation of the advisory committees
which the Study of Education now envisions will
review its final proposals.
"Community government" may be within the
grasp of Stanford during the next year, but the
token inclusion of students and administrators
in the Academic Senate stands in the way of that
possibility.
The proposed senate now being considered by
the Academic Council just might push educa
tional reform ahead during the coming year, but
it could also place obstacles before the delibera
tions and proposals of the Study of Education at
Stanford.
Until it is clear what the sponsors of the Aca
demic Senate envision, it is impossible to predict
which will be the case.
Considered by itself, the Academic Senate is
a desperately needed reform. The Academic
Council of over 800 members cannot be coordi
nate or excited, or even informed about crucial
needs of the University.
Academic Council meetings are too infrequent
and rarely attract more than two or three hun
dred. This fraction of the faculty can hardly be
termed representative and should not be expect
ed to act fairly on behalf of the whole faculty.
While some reform is immediately needed, the
present Academic Senate proposal has raised sig
nificant challenges from Associated Students
President Peter Lyman and others.
Perhaps the key question to be raised is the
place of the student and the administration mem
bers. The suggestion that five students and five
administrators be voting members of the Senate
is both a sham of representation and an attempt
to buy off these "other factions" of the Univer
sity.
If students are merely to express student opin
ion, their presence at faculty deliberations is a
positive alteration in present practices. However,
with students and administrators as voting mem
bers of such a Senate, then the nature of the fac
ulty body has been significantly changed.
