# The 						Outpost
## A 						New Approach Is Needed 
### Louis Knowles 
In the wake of racial violence
at Menlo-Atherton High School
the problems at other campuses
of the Sequoia Union High
School District in southern San
Mateo County become of impor
tance in tracing the causes of
conflicts in the mid-peninsula
educational structure as a whole.
Black discontent stems not
only from conditions at Menlo-
Atherton but also is rooted in
the festering problem of Rav
neswood High which serves
most of the black community of
East Palo Alto and is the only
predominantly black school in
the District.
The Board of Trustees for the
District has consistently refused
to go beyond token gestures in
attempting to solve the educa
tional dilemma at Ravenswood.
The Mothers for Equal Educa
tion (MEE), from East Palo
Alto came before the Board re
peatedly last summer demand
ing black teachers for their
children who are suffering from
the effects of twelve years spent
mostly under white teachers
who have little idea of how to
relate education to the realities
of black society.

There were presented several
specific cases of highly qualified
black teacher applicants who
were turned down for teaching
jobs at Ravcnswood. The Board
of Trustees refused to believe
any discrimination was involved.
The recruiting procedures of
Dr. Bunning, the District's exec
utive in charge of hiring, were
notably lacking in the most im
portant area: results. Despite a
trip last year to Los Angeles
and the eastern seaboard osten
sibly in search of black person
nel he produced no significant
increase in the minute number
of black applicants for teaching
positions. The Board refused to
believe any discrimination or in
competence was involved.
Constructive Alternatives
The MEE offered a construc
tive alternative to the present
district policy. It asked the
Board to consider using black
men and women from East Palo
Alto to assist in the recruiting
and screening process. This idea
was totally rejected as imprac
tical and contrary to equalitari
an principles of the District.
And the ultimate reply that
the Board thought was supposed
to stop the show was, "Do you
want us to lower our standards
just to hire Negroes?"

What meaning do these sacred
standards have in the context of
a school that is over 75 per cent
black? In their scope of academ
ic records, years of experience,
and letters of recommendation
they leave out the key factor in
the present situation: race.
Knlightened Bureaucracy
In the best tradition of en
lightened American bureaucracy
the board members think that
pretending to be oblivious to a
man's race is the surest method
of applying equalitarian princi
ples.
This attitude ignores the so
cial complexities involved in the
presence of two cultures in one
country.
The old ideas of impartiality
and objectivity within white
dominated structures must be
discarded as naive approaches
that may have been sufficient at
one time but which are useless
in dealing with the new spirit of
black independence. The best
qualified teachers in the world
are not going to do Ravenswood

High a bit of good as long as
they are white.
No Identification
Black students are tired of the
white authority figure in the
classroom as a reminder of their
secondary status in American
society. It is impossible for them
to identify with whites as mod
els of personal achievement be
cause they realize the black
man's road to success has so
many more obstacles in it than
does that of the white.
The key phrase for the Black
Culture is no longer equality un
der the system, but self-determi
nation within the black commu
nity.
If bodies such as the Sequoia
Union High School District in
sist on keeping their minds
closed to this new self-aware
ness in the ghettoes and do not
exercise flexibility in their poli
cies across racial lines the black
leaders will have no choice but
to follow a separatist, revolu
tionary course that could easily
bring the American dream crash
ing down.

educational structure as a whole.
Black discontent stems not
only from conditions at Menlo-
Atherton but also is rooted in
the festering problem of Rav
neswood High which serves
most of the black community of
East Palo Alto and is the only
predominantly black school in
the District.
The Board of Trustees for the
District has consistently refused
to go beyond token gestures in
attempting to solve the educa
tional dilemma at Ravenswood.
The Mothers for Equal Educa
tion (MEE), from East Palo
Alto came before the Board re
peatedly last summer demand
ing black teachers for their
children who are suffering from
the effects of twelve years spent
mostly under white teachers
who have little idea of how to
relate education to the realities
of black society.

There were presented several
specific cases of highly qualified
black teacher applicants who
were turned down for teaching
jobs at Ravcnswood. The Board
of Trustees refused to believe
any discrimination was involved.
The recruiting procedures of
Dr. Bunning, the District's exec
utive in charge of hiring, were
notably lacking in the most im
portant area: results. Despite a
trip last year to Los Angeles
and the eastern seaboard osten
sibly in search of black person
nel he produced no significant
increase in the minute number
of black applicants for teaching
positions. The Board refused to
believe any discrimination or in
competence was involved.
Constructive Alternatives
The MEE offered a construc
tive alternative to the present
district policy. It asked the
Board to consider using black
men and women from East Palo
Alto to assist in the recruiting
and screening process. This idea
was totally rejected as imprac
tical and contrary to equalitari
an principles of the District.
And the ultimate reply that
the Board thought was supposed
to stop the show was, "Do you
want us to lower our standards
just to hire Negroes?"

What meaning do these sacred
standards have in the context of
a school that is over 75 per cent
black? In their scope of academ
ic records, years of experience,
and letters of recommendation
they leave out the key factor in
the present situation: race.
Knlightened Bureaucracy
In the best tradition of en
lightened American bureaucracy
the board members think that
pretending to be oblivious to a
man's race is the surest method
of applying equalitarian princi
ples.
This attitude ignores the so
cial complexities involved in the
presence of two cultures in one
country.
The old ideas of impartiality
and objectivity within white
dominated structures must be
discarded as naive approaches
that may have been sufficient at
one time but which are useless
in dealing with the new spirit of
black independence. The best
qualified teachers in the world
are not going to do Ravenswood

High a bit of good as long as
they are white.
No Identification
Black students are tired of the
white authority figure in the
classroom as a reminder of their
secondary status in American
society. It is impossible for them
to identify with whites as mod
els of personal achievement be
cause they realize the black
man's road to success has so
many more obstacles in it than
does that of the white.
The key phrase for the Black
Culture is no longer equality un
der the system, but self-determi
nation within the black commu
nity.
If bodies such as the Sequoia
Union High School District in
sist on keeping their minds
closed to this new self-aware
ness in the ghettoes and do not
exercise flexibility in their poli
cies across racial lines the black
leaders will have no choice but
to follow a separatist, revolu
tionary course that could easily
bring the American dream crash
ing down.
