# Lyman Letter Challenges Senate Plan
## 
### 
The following: letter was sent
yesterday by ASSU president
Peter Lyman to the executive
committee of the Academic
Council on the proposed faculty
"Academic Senate."
Gentlemen:
I am writing to question the
priority given the proposal for
a Faculty Senate over the more
basic and crucial question of
the reorganization of the Uni
versity government as a whole.
At present, the government of
the University is a confused and
inefficient collection of institu
tions representing various con
stituencies and principles, with
overlapping and vaguely defined
authorities, and without discern
ible logic. With this proposal we
are given one piece of a puzzle
to consider without a hint as to
how it should, or even will, fit
into the whole.
The separate reform of each
of these many institutions of
government cannot result in a
coherent and efficient govern
ment capable of solving the prob
lems we face. One of the faults
of such a pragmatic approach to

reform, as is pointed out by Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer in his
recent article in the New York
Review of Books, is the priority
given to the question of the solu
tion of the problem over the
identification and definition of
the problem. This "common fal
lacy" is in evidence in the cur
rent procedure: how can the
faculty decide how to better gov
ern itself before we consider
the general problem of the gov
ernment of the University?
'Piecemeal Approach'
This piecemeal approach to
reform will perpetuate the need
less and destructive separation
of the University community
into the "constituencies" of fac
ulty, students, and administra
tors. The Study of Education at
Stanford opposed the represen
tation of constituencies in for
mulating itself on the grounds
that all members of the Univer
sity can best communicate and
act creatively as equals; why,
then, does the first major re
form revert to an assumption of
constituencies?

I am not opposed to the fac
ulty having its own deliberative
body within a University govern
ment which establishes sane and
reasonable relations between all
those committed to the Univer
sity; I am opposed to any "re
form" which perpetuates the
present class system.
What will be the functions of
the new Faculty Senate? While
its stated purpose is to replace
the Academic Council, it is im
plied in the proposal that the
new body will considerably ex
pand the powers of the old. Since
I have long felt that the faculty
has not fulfilled its responsibi
lities to govern the University,
1 am delighted at the commit
ment of time and thought the
faculty is now willing to make
to University affairs. It is of cru
cial importance, however, to first
decide which of these new pow
ers belongs solely to the faculty,
and which should be shared with
the whole community.
I am concerned that although
the proposed Senate is a Faculty
Senate in composition, its func

tions might include powers bet
ter performed by a Community
Senate.
Decisions Affect Students
If, then, the Faculty Senate
is to govern the University, or
to consider issues which directly
affect members of the Univer
sity other than the faculty, the
five student "representatives"
are a mockery. Such issues be
long to an institution which
brings faculty, students, and ad
ministrators together as equals
speaking for the University.
If, alternatively, the Faculty
Senate speaks exclusively to fac
ulty issues, the five student rep
resentatives are a useful means
of communication. In the latter
case, however, I find the process
of reform a depressing refinish
ing of the past rather than a
new or creative solution to old
problems.
To summarize, I am not writ
ing to comment specifically on
the details of the proposal for
a Faculty Senate, but to question
the process in which the Univer
sity is seeking to revitalize and
reform itself.

Perhaps a Faculty Senate,
such as the one proposed, is
necessary to deal with questions
belonging primarily to the fac
ulty. But presented alone, with
out a reconsideration of the
relationships between the mem
bers of the University commu
nity, this proposal is impossible
to judge, and preserves a social
system fundamentally incapable
of solving problems in a manner
appropriate to a University.
Recognizing the natural lead
ership of the University by the
faculty, and because I feel that
this proposal is symptomatic of
a failure of the institutions of
the University to revitalize them
selves, may I encourage the Ex
ecutive Committee to invite stu
dents and administrators to join
them in establishing a sensible
procedure, in which the defini
tion of the problem precedes the
solution, and in which a philo
sophy of education and of the
role of the University in society
precedes specific reform.

affect members of the Univer
sity other than the faculty, the
five student "representatives"
are a mockery. Such issues be
long to an institution which
brings faculty, students, and ad
ministrators together as equals
speaking for the University.
If, alternatively, the Faculty
Senate speaks exclusively to fac
ulty issues, the five student rep
resentatives are a useful means
of communication. In the latter
case, however, I find the process
of reform a depressing refinish
ing of the past rather than a
new or creative solution to old
problems.
To summarize, I am not writ
ing to comment specifically on
the details of the proposal for
a Faculty Senate, but to question
the process in which the Univer
sity is seeking to revitalize and
reform itself.

Perhaps a Faculty Senate,
such as the one proposed, is
necessary to deal with questions
belonging primarily to the fac
ulty. But presented alone, with
out a reconsideration of the
relationships between the mem
bers of the University commu
nity, this proposal is impossible
to judge, and preserves a social
system fundamentally incapable
of solving problems in a manner
appropriate to a University.
Recognizing the natural lead
ership of the University by the
faculty, and because I feel that
this proposal is symptomatic of
a failure of the institutions of
the University to revitalize them
selves, may I encourage the Ex
ecutive Committee to invite stu
dents and administrators to join
them in establishing a sensible
procedure, in which the defini
tion of the problem precedes the
solution, and in which a philo
sophy of education and of the
role of the University in society
precedes specific reform.
PETER LYMAN
A.S.S.U. President
The following: letter was sent
yesterday by ASSU president
Peter Lyman to the executive
committee of the Academic
Council on the proposed faculty
"Academic Senate."
Gentlemen:
I am writing to question the
priority given the proposal for
a Faculty Senate over the more
basic and crucial question of
the reorganization of the Uni
versity government as a whole.
At present, the government of
the University is a confused and
inefficient collection of institu
tions representing various con
stituencies and principles, with
overlapping and vaguely defined
authorities, and without discern
ible logic. With this proposal we
are given one piece of a puzzle
to consider without a hint as to
how it should, or even will, fit
into the whole.
The separate reform of each
of these many institutions of
government cannot result in a
coherent and efficient govern
ment capable of solving the prob
lems we face. One of the faults
of such a pragmatic approach to

reform, as is pointed out by Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer in his
recent article in the New York
Review of Books, is the priority
given to the question of the solu
tion of the problem over the
identification and definition of
the problem. This "common fal
lacy" is in evidence in the cur
rent procedure: how can the
faculty decide how to better gov
ern itself before we consider
the general problem of the gov
ernment of the University?
'Piecemeal Approach'
This piecemeal approach to
reform will perpetuate the need
less and destructive separation
of the University community
into the "constituencies" of fac
ulty, students, and administra
tors. The Study of Education at
Stanford opposed the represen
tation of constituencies in for
mulating itself on the grounds
that all members of the Univer
sity can best communicate and
act creatively as equals; why,
then, does the first major re
form revert to an assumption of
constituencies?

I am not opposed to the fac
ulty having its own deliberative
body within a University govern
ment which establishes sane and
reasonable relations between all
those committed to the Univer
sity; I am opposed to any "re
form" which perpetuates the
present class system.
What will be the functions of
the new Faculty Senate? While
its stated purpose is to replace
the Academic Council, it is im
plied in the proposal that the
new body will considerably ex
pand the powers of the old. Since
I have long felt that the faculty
has not fulfilled its responsibi
lities to govern the University,
1 am delighted at the commit
ment of time and thought the
faculty is now willing to make
to University affairs. It is of cru
cial importance, however, to first
decide which of these new pow
ers belongs solely to the faculty,
and which should be shared with
the whole community.
I am concerned that although
the proposed Senate is a Faculty
Senate in composition, its func

tions might include powers bet
ter performed by a Community
Senate.
Decisions Affect Students
If, then, the Faculty Senate

to consider issues which directly
affect members of the Univer
sity other than the faculty, the
five student "representatives"

ernment of the University?
'Piecemeal Approach'
This piecemeal approach to
reform will perpetuate the need
less and destructive separation
of the University community
into the "constituencies" of fac
ulty, students, and administra
tors. The Study of Education at
Stanford opposed the represen
tation of constituencies in for
mulating itself on the grounds
that all members of the Univer
sity can best communicate and
act creatively as equals; why,
then, does the first major re
form revert to an assumption of
constituencies?

I am not opposed to the fac
ulty having its own deliberative
body within a University govern
ment which establishes sane and
reasonable relations between all
those committed to the Univer
sity; I am opposed to any "re
form" which perpetuates the
present class system.
What will be the functions of
the new Faculty Senate? While
its stated purpose is to replace
the Academic Council, it is im
plied in the proposal that the
new body will considerably ex
pand the powers of the old. Since
I have long felt that the faculty
has not fulfilled its responsibi
lities to govern the University,
1 am delighted at the commit
ment of time and thought the
faculty is now willing to make
to University affairs. It is of cru
cial importance, however, to first
decide which of these new pow
ers belongs solely to the faculty,
and which should be shared with
the whole community.
I am concerned that although
the proposed Senate is a Faculty
Senate in composition, its func

tions might include powers bet
ter performed by a Community
Senate.
Decisions Affect Students
If, then, the Faculty Senate
is to govern the University, or
to consider issues which directly
affect members of the Univer
sity other than the faculty, the
five student "representatives"
are a mockery. Such issues be
long to an institution which
brings faculty, students, and ad
ministrators together as equals
speaking for the University.
If, alternatively, the Faculty
Senate speaks exclusively to fac
ulty issues, the five student rep
resentatives are a useful means
of communication. In the latter
case, however, I find the process
of reform a depressing refinish
ing of the past rather than a
new or creative solution to old
problems.
To summarize, I am not writ
ing to comment specifically on
the details of the proposal for
a Faculty Senate, but to question
the process in which the Univer
sity is seeking to revitalize and
reform itself.

Perhaps a Faculty Senate,
such as the one proposed, is
necessary to deal with questions
belonging primarily to the fac
ulty. But presented alone, with
out a reconsideration of the
relationships between the mem
bers of the University commu
nity, this proposal is impossible
to judge, and preserves a social
system fundamentally incapable
of solving problems in a manner
appropriate to a University.
Recognizing the natural lead
ership of the University by the
faculty, and because I feel that
this proposal is symptomatic of
a failure of the institutions of
the University to revitalize them
selves, may I encourage the Ex
ecutive Committee to invite stu
dents and administrators to join
them in establishing a sensible
procedure, in which the defini
tion of the problem precedes the
solution, and in which a philo
sophy of education and of the
role of the University in society
precedes specific reform.
PETER LYMAN
A.S.S.U. President
The following: letter was sent
yesterday by ASSU president
Peter Lyman to the executive
committee of the Academic
Council on the proposed faculty
"Academic Senate."
Gentlemen:
I am writing to question the
priority given the proposal for
a Faculty Senate over the more
basic and crucial question of
the reorganization of the Uni
versity government as a whole.
At present, the government of
the University is a confused and
inefficient collection of institu
tions representing various con
stituencies and principles, with
overlapping and vaguely defined
authorities, and without discern
ible logic. With this proposal we
are given one piece of a puzzle
to consider without a hint as to
how it should, or even will, fit
into the whole.
The separate reform of each
of these many institutions of
government cannot result in a
coherent and efficient govern
ment capable of solving the prob
lems we face. One of the faults
of such a pragmatic approach to

reform, as is pointed out by Vice-
Provost Herbert Packer in his
recent article in the New York
Review of Books, is the priority
given to the question of the solu
tion of the problem over the
identification and definition of
the problem. This "common fal
lacy" is in evidence in the cur
rent procedure: how can the
faculty decide how to better gov
ern itself before we consider
the general problem of the gov
ernment of the University?
