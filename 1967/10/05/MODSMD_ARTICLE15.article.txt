## Studying The Third Largest Industry 
### Art Buchwald 
One of the ways to solve acute
problems in the United States
is to study them. At this writ
ing there are probably more
committees making more stud
ies jai more problems than at
any time in our history.

Prof. Heinrich Applebaum has
just completed a study on peo
ple who make studies, and the
results are fascinating.
Prof. Applebaum said, "I dis
covered that the average person
making a study today has had

five years of college, is married,
has 1.6 children, earns $15,000 a
year, lives in the suburbs, plays
tennis or golf on weekends and
believes in God."
"That's truly amazing."
"He will spend an average 8.9

months working on a study, 2.6
months discussing it in cc mmit
tee, 3.9 months writing a report
which will be typed up by 5.6
secretaries and then it will be
printed up and distributed to
1,250 persons who will read it in
its entirety."
"That isn't too many people."
"It's a lot considering that
only one out of every 23.6 re
ports is ever acted upon."
"What happens to the rest of
them?"
Filed For Future Reference
"They're filed away and used
as reference for other people
who will be asked to make fu
ture study on the same sub
ject."
"That sounds rather dis
couraging."
"On the contrary. The main
purpose of a study is not to
solve a problem, but to post
pone the solution of it in hopes
that it will go away. If it doesn't
go away, at least people will
have forgotten about it by the
time the report comes out."
"Could you give me an exam
ple?"
Blue-Kibbon Panels
"Well, at the moment the riots
in Detroit are under study. A
blue-ribbon panel of politicians
appointed the President is
making a report which will
probably be delivered sometime
in 1968. By then some other city
will probably be burned down,
and nobody will give a damn
what happened in Detroit.
They'll demand to know what
happened in Philadelphia or
Cleveland or whatever city

blows up next. The President j
will then appoint another com
mision to study that riot, and
by the time they get their re
port in, the President will have
to appoint another committee to
study what went wrong in
Washington, D.C., or Oakland,
Calif."
"A study group's work is
never done."
Rebuttal
"I should say not. Making
studies is now the third largest
industry in the United States.
Not only are large monies spent
in making studies, but great
sums are spent attacking studies
that people don't agree with.
Whenever the Public Health
Service issues a report on smok
ing, the tobacco industry imme
diately attacks it with a study
of its own."
"Even the National Guard
doesn't like to be studied," I
said.
"That's the beauty of the busi
ness. Every study demands a
counter • study to refute its
facts."
"Prof. Applebaum, your re
port will make a great contribu
tion to the study of studies. Can
you tell me why you decided to
do it in the first place?"
"I work for a foundation, and
everything we wanted to study
was being studied by somebody
else. This was the only subject
left that no one had made a
study on."
"Has anybody read it?"
"My wife thinks it's the best
thing I've ever done."
