## Practice What You Preach 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In the October 12, 1967, edi
tion of The New York Review of
Books Vice Provost Herbert
Packer has written a masterful
criticism of the report of Presi
dent Johnson's Commission on
Law Enforcement and Adminis
tration of Justice. Within the
essay Packer writes: "The com
mon fallacy in thinking about
the control of crime is to divorce
the question of how to deal
with crime from the question of
what crime is. This fallacy Is
perpetuated in the Report."

His criticism is well taken and
especially relevant when you
realize that Packer himself is
the chairman of an important
committee — The Study of Edu
cation at Stanford, Substituting
the appropriate terms in the
above quotation, we can imagine
Packer saying: "The common
fallacy in thinking about univer
sity education is to divorce the
question of how to deal with
university education from the
question of what university edu
cation is." In fact, however,
Packer has contradicted his crit
icism in his conduct of the SES.
The original decision to have a
committee answer the question,
"What is a University for?", has
been rescinded. It is now as
sumed that that question will be
answered when all of the com
mittees working on specific
problem areas have reported.
Thus, we will know what a uni
versity education is when we
have finished studying it. That
was the fallacy of the report on
crime.

• Real Questions
Editor, The Daily:
I was in White Plaza the oth
er day during the Resistance
rally and stopped to listen to
what Dave Harris had to say.
After listening to him I felt an
urge to run up and grab the mi
crophone and pose to the several
hundred listeners some ques
tions that were on my mind. I
didn't but would like to do so
now.
Dave Harris and Co. have
proffered a definition of the
American State, saying that it
is oppressive and tyrannical at
best and little short of totalitari
an in moderation. The present
American system, according to
Harris, would seem to be de
signed to promote only that

which is bad and choke off that
which is good. The broad spec
trum of consensus that is the
American middle class is con
demned in a variety of terms
that only fall short of the Ges
tapo or NKVD. For Harris
American democracy is a plati
tude foisted on the oppressed,
and hardly worth mentioning.
At the present time, he indi
cates the tyranny of the Ameri
can State is manifested in the
Selective Service System—enter
Resistance. To cast off the
bonds of this particular form of
undemocratic oppression, ac
cording to Harris, is a "very
simple act." All you have to do
is tear your draft card in half
on October 16 at the Federal
Building in San Francisco or a
variety of other conveniently lo
cated spots throughout the
country.
It's not an easy thing to create
a viable political system, much
less one based upon the consen
sus of free men. Political reali
ties dictate that there must be
shared values, functional insti
tutions and respect for the law
in order for a society to main
tain its cohesiveness. As incredi
ble as it seems, Harris is pro
posing that every man abide
only by his own conscience. This
certainly isn't a new concept,
Rousseau said to listen to your
heart over three hundred years
ago. The problem is how in the
hell do you tell the difference be
tween the forceful importuning
of your heart or conscience and
the forceful importuning of your
bowels. Today we live in an age
where a moment's hesitation
could cause one to be flushed
down a whirlpool toilet or worse.
I challenge David Harris and
his whole entourage to add yet
another definition to the ones
they have already given us. I
challenge them to define the real
society toward which they are
working wherein complete free
dom to follow one's conscience
exists. I challenge them to de
fine an alternative to consensus
that does not come out the bar
rel of a gun. And finally, I chal
lenge them to define realistic
solutions to the problems they
seek to overcome.

• Fuller Speaks
Editor, The Daily:
Last evening I attended a
speech by R. Buckminster Ful

ler, the keynote speaker for
Century 21. This morning I read
about it in the Daily. I find it
hard to believe that I and the
Daily reporter attended the
same speech. Mr. Fuller was
grossly misrepresented as stat
ing that the computer poses
"the threat of possible extinc
tion to the human race."
It is unbelievable that anyone
listening to Mr. Fuller could
possibly have come away with
an idea so contrary to his whole
philosophy. It is central to Mr.
Fuller's point to understand his
contention that computers will
take over the straight-jacket of
specialization to free man to be
come a comprehensive thinker
who can—on the basis of the
knowledge of the variables gov
erning the world—prepare and
anticipate future developments.
Mr. Fuller's speech was rich and
varied—something the Daily ar
ticle drowns in a listing of un
connected and out of context
quotes.

• Unionize Now!
Editor, The Daily;
Your editorial of Monday,
October 3, concerning the new
Graduate Students Union shows
a superficial perception of the
bases underlying its formation.
Anomie, lack of an interdepart
mental organization of any sort
and a complete lack of aware
ness that anything could be done
about their very real problems
has characterized the vast ma
jority of the graduate popula
tion of the University for lo,
these many years.
In Union there is strength!

• 'Flicks 9 Playroom
Editor, The Daily;
It would be advisable to make
available a playroom for the
children who attend the Sunday
night "Flicks" at Memorial Aud
itorium. The large number of
noisy 5-year olds infesting the
balcony evidently need a place
to test their lungs. They should
save their quarters.
