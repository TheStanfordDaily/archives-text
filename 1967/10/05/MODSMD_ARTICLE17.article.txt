In picture 1, Stanford linebacker
John Haygood breaks up a pass
intended for San Jose tight end
Rudy Leuhs. The ball bounced
off Haygood's chest and popped
into the air. Marty Brill (back
ground) picked the ball out of
the air and started on his way
to the goal (picture 2).
Danny Holman (14), Spartan
quarterback, races over to try to
stop Brill (pictures 2 and 3). But
Brill cuts back inside of Holman,
as Holman's futile dive misses
(picture 4). Brill scores (picture
5) what turned out to be the
winning TD. Notice Tribe ball
boy at left giving score signal.
