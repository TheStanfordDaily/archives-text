# Dis-Joint To Open With Plaza Dance
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Dis-Joint is both name and
description for the new student
run coffee house opening on
campus this week.
Tomorrow night, a dance con
cert on White Memorial Plaza
will introduce Dis-Joint to Stan
ford. The concert is to feature
the Gyre, plus free refresh
ments, and begins at 9:30 p.m.
in front of Mem Claw.
Friday night dances will be a
regular part of Dis-Joint. The
coffee house will continue in
Tresidder much the same as last
year, on Wednesday and Thurs
day nights, and perhaps sponsor
chamber music on Sundays and
"just about anything else that
will be of interest to students,"
according to Dis-Joint director
Greg Yahna.
New Name, New Idea
The new name reflects a
change in the coffee house. Last
year, Mem What? offered the
traditional coffee house atmos
phere, including impromptu
poetry reading and singing. Dis
joint "will be doing a lot more,"
says Yahna.
"Disjoint" means to "break
into parts," and that is just
what Dis-Joint plans to do, Yah
na explains. "We're willing to
put on anything, take sugges
tions from anybody, and just do
it."
One of the hopes of Dis-Joint
is to break through the formali
ty and bureaucracy plaguing
most social activities at Stan
ford. As Yahna explains it,
"We're not 'staging dances,' as
such. We are only providing a
band for people who just happen
to be walking by."
Money Problems
This new image for a coffee
house was conceived during the
summer. Mem What? tried to
continue in Tresidder but ran
out of money. A band, the O. J.
Express, volunteered to play and
donations permitted the coffee
house to offer free food. Four
concerts were held during the
summer at White Memorial

Plaza, the Old Union courtyard
and other locations on campus.
As Yahna describes them, the
dance concerts were "very infor
mal and not well publicized."
Yet large numbers of people
were attracted by the sound and
stayed to enjoy the music.
Although the performances
and refreshments were free, do
nations were accepted. At the
end of the summer, the coffee
house actually came out ahead.
Even after paying the band for
its work, enough money re
mained to provide free refresh
ments for the first dance this
fall.
The success of the summer
concerts convinced Mem What?
supporters to extend the pro
gram into the regular school
year. The coffee house was re
named Dis-Joint, according to
Yahna, because "Since we were
changing the idea of it so much,
we thought we needed to
change the name."
Changing Times
Yahna sees the changes which
have occurred in the coffee
house as merely keeping up
with the changes taking place
at Stanford.
"People are more interested
in getting away from their
rooms, meeting other people,
and enjoying the new San Fran
cisco sound in music," he said.
He expresses the hope that local
bands will donate their time to
Dis-Joint.
The Gyre will perform Friday
night for no charge but will ac
cept donations. Additional con
tributions will be needed to en
sure the continuance of the Fri
day night dances.
Wednesday and Thursday eve
nings, Dis-Joint plans to follow
Mem What? and setup a coffee
house in Tresidder. "We are go
ing to have such things as Dean
Napier performing on the piano
and a jug band," Yahna re
vealed. One of the conditions of
having the coffee house in Tres
idder is that Dis-Joint purchase
its food there.

donations permitted the coffee
house to offer free food. Four
concerts were held during the
summer at White Memorial

Plaza, the Old Union courtyard
and other locations on campus.
As Yahna describes them, the
dance concerts were "very infor
mal and not well publicized."
Yet large numbers of people
were attracted by the sound and
stayed to enjoy the music.
Although the performances
and refreshments were free, do
nations were accepted. At the
end of the summer, the coffee
house actually came out ahead.
Even after paying the band for
its work, enough money re
mained to provide free refresh
ments for the first dance this
fall.
The success of the summer
concerts convinced Mem What?
supporters to extend the pro
gram into the regular school
year. The coffee house was re
named Dis-Joint, according to
Yahna, because "Since we were
changing the idea of it so much,
we thought we needed to
change the name."
Changing Times
Yahna sees the changes which
have occurred in the coffee
house as merely keeping up
with the changes taking place
at Stanford.
"People are more interested
in getting away from their
rooms, meeting other people,
and enjoying the new San Fran
cisco sound in music," he said.
He expresses the hope that local
bands will donate their time to
Dis-Joint.
The Gyre will perform Friday
night for no charge but will ac
cept donations. Additional con
tributions will be needed to en
sure the continuance of the Fri
day night dances.
Wednesday and Thursday eve
nings, Dis-Joint plans to follow
Mem What? and setup a coffee
house in Tresidder. "We are go
ing to have such things as Dean
Napier performing on the piano
and a jug band," Yahna re
vealed. One of the conditions of
having the coffee house in Tres
idder is that Dis-Joint purchase
its food there.


GREG YAHNA
Describes his plans for Dis-Joint
Dis-Joint is both name and
description for the new student
run coffee house opening on
campus this week.
Tomorrow night, a dance con
cert on White Memorial Plaza
will introduce Dis-Joint to Stan
ford. The concert is to feature
the Gyre, plus free refresh
ments, and begins at 9:30 p.m.
in front of Mem Claw.
Friday night dances will be a
regular part of Dis-Joint. The
coffee house will continue in
Tresidder much the same as last
year, on Wednesday and Thurs
day nights, and perhaps sponsor
chamber music on Sundays and
"just about anything else that
will be of interest to students,"
according to Dis-Joint director
Greg Yahna.
New Name, New Idea
The new name reflects a
change in the coffee house. Last
year, Mem What? offered the
traditional coffee house atmos
phere, including impromptu
poetry reading and singing. Dis
joint "will be doing a lot more,"
says Yahna.
"Disjoint" means to "break
into parts," and that is just
what Dis-Joint plans to do, Yah
na explains. "We're willing to
put on anything, take sugges
tions from anybody, and just do
it."
One of the hopes of Dis-Joint
is to break through the formali
ty and bureaucracy plaguing
most social activities at Stan
ford. As Yahna explains it,
"We're not 'staging dances,' as
such. We are only providing a
band for people who just happen
to be walking by."
Money Problems
This new image for a coffee
house was conceived during the
summer. Mem What? tried to
continue in Tresidder but ran
out of money. A band, the O. J.
Express, volunteered to play and
donations permitted the coffee
house to offer free food. Four
concerts were held during the
summer at White Memorial

Plaza, the Old Union courtyard
and other locations on campus.
