# Kenpo Karate Throws, Tribe To New Heights
## 
### 
The Stanford Karate Club will
begin its fourth year of activity
this fall with programs offering
karate instruction to students at
all levels of proficiency. Member
ship is open to the entire Stan
ford community.
The Stanford Club teaches a
particularly effective style of
ancient Chinese karate called
kenpo. Like other forms of
karate, many parts of the body
(I.e. elbows, fingers, feet, hands,
etc.) are converted into wea
pons with sufficient power to de
fend against any assailant.
Kenpo Wins
The Stanford Club favors the
particular style of kenpo be
cause it embodies an ideal com
bination of speed and power,
while many styles limit them
selves in only one or the other
areas.
A second reason supporting
this preference is the fact that
kenpo has proven to be one of
the most effective styles in com
petitive tournaments.
Two Club Stars
Indeed, two returning mem
bers of the Stanford Karate Club
have already demonstrated the
effectiveness of this style in
competition.
Bob Mardian, the Vice-Presi
dent of the Club, placed second
in the white-belt heavyweight
division at the Northern Pacific
Nationals last year.
Another member, Jeff Lucas,
quick and competent with less
than a year of instruction, placed
third at the Pacific Coast Invita
tional Tournament last spring.
According to Black Belt Maga
zine, karate enthusiasts now out

number judo partisans in this
country, a fact confirmed by the
many tournaments held each
year and the thousands of com
petitors.
The Stanford Karate Club is
aware of this growing popu
larity, especially regarding the
competitive aspect of the sport.
This year the club is forming
a competition team to represent
Stanford University at all major
karate tournaments.
International Status
The person primarily respon
sible for the impressive achieve
ments and organization of the
club is its President, George Peg
elow. It was Mr. Pegelow who
succeeded in getting the club
recognized by the International
Kenpo Karate Association.
This recognition enables the
club to participate in all karate
tournaments and makes the pro
motions in rank, which are
granted by the club, recognized
internationally.
Pegelow Appointed
This devotion and contribu
tion to the club as well as kenpo
karate itself did not go unre
warded.
Last August, Edmund K. Park
er, world famous black-belt ka
rate instructor and President of
the International Kenpo Karate
Association, appointed Pegelow
chairman of the Collegiate Divi
sion of the Association.

all levels of proficiency. Member
ship is open to the entire Stan

The Stanford Club teaches a
particularly effective style of
ancient Chinese karate called
kenpo. Like other forms of
karate, many parts of the body
(I.e. elbows, fingers, feet, hands,
etc.) are converted into wea
pons with sufficient power to de
fend against any assailant.
Kenpo Wins
The Stanford Club favors the
particular style of kenpo be
cause it embodies an ideal com
bination of speed and power,
while many styles limit them
selves in only one or the other
areas.
A second reason supporting
this preference is the fact that
kenpo has proven to be one of
the most effective styles in com
petitive tournaments.
Two Club Stars
Indeed, two returning mem
bers of the Stanford Karate Club
have already demonstrated the
effectiveness of this style in
competition.
Bob Mardian, the Vice-Presi
dent of the Club, placed second
in the white-belt heavyweight
division at the Northern Pacific
Nationals last year.
Another member, Jeff Lucas,
quick and competent with less
than a year of instruction, placed
third at the Pacific Coast Invita
tional Tournament last spring.
According to Black Belt Maga
zine, karate enthusiasts now out

number judo partisans in this
country, a fact confirmed by the
many tournaments held each
year and the thousands of com
petitors.
The Stanford Karate Club is
aware of this growing popu
larity, especially regarding the
competitive aspect of the sport.
This year the club is forming
a competition team to represent
Stanford University at all major
karate tournaments.
International Status
The person primarily respon
sible for the impressive achieve
ments and organization of the
club is its President, George Peg
elow. It was Mr. Pegelow who
succeeded in getting the club
recognized by the International
Kenpo Karate Association.
This recognition enables the
club to participate in all karate
tournaments and makes the pro
motions in rank, which are
granted by the club, recognized
internationally.
Pegelow Appointed
This devotion and contribu
tion to the club as well as kenpo
karate itself did not go unre
warded.
Last August, Edmund K. Park
er, world famous black-belt ka
rate instructor and President of
the International Kenpo Karate
Association, appointed Pegelow
chairman of the Collegiate Divi
sion of the Association.
