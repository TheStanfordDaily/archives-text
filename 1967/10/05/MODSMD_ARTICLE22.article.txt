## Daily SPORTS 
### J. Q. WRIGHT 
Coed's will be more prevalent
on the lanes this autumn as
Stanford's bowling program be
gins its sixth year of operation
in Tresidder Union.
Under the recently revised IM
rules, women are now eligible
for intramural bowling (too bad
about touch football!).
Nine sections of bowling
classes have begun this week,
while Stanford's men's and wom
en's teams open their intercol
legiate competition Friday night,
Oct. 13 against Santa Clara.
Support
The bowling program at Stan
ford receives initial support
through the national Associa
tion of College Unions and the
Women's Recreation Association.
Stanford's Union and WRA
sponsored tournament teams are
advised by Mrs. Shirley Schoof
and Jack McKenna, Recreation
Co-ordinator of TMU.
Helping in the instructional
classes have been T.A.'s and
members of the Stanford Physi
cal Education Departments.
3,000 Indians Can't Be Wrong
The Tresidder Games Area of
fers various opportunities for
general recreation.
Fourteen air-conditioned bowl
ing lanes, twenty-two tables for
pocket billiards, snooker, and
carom billiards, as well as nine
table tennis tables are available
at reasonable prices for Univer
sity use.

During the past five years over
3,000 students have taken ad
vantage of the bowling classes
offered at Tresidder.
Several mixed sections offer
one of Stanford's best oppor
tunities for coed recreational ac
tivities.
Masters League
The Northern California Mas
ters League, in which Stanford
fields its men's and women's
teams, enters its second year of
existence this autumn.
The Indians have seven re
turning veterans to form a for
midable lineup. They include
John Steele, Chris Martin, Doug
Pirnie, Bruce Everett, John
Wright, Jeff Bonzon, and Ralph
Kimball.
Graduate student Biil Brown
will be among the new faces
challenging for a position on the
team.
Coach McKenna will use a lad
der system, based on cumulative
averages from team practices,
intramural competition, and in
tra-squad matches.
The top five on the ladder, as
of Thursday morning each week,
will bowl in the weekend match
es, with the number six man
acting as an alternate.
Mrs. Schoof will use a similar
system for the women's team.
She has six returnees from
last year's squad in Liz Black
ford, Sandra Boddum, Kathleen
Coolidge, Dede Hirst, Meriel Lee,
and Nancy Norberg.

New to the women's team are
two freshmen, Diane Depaolis
and Julie Fleece.
A nine-game roll-off will deter
mine the five women who will
compete in the first intercol
legiate match Friday, Oct. 13.
National Fame
Last year's Regional first-place
tie with Santa Barbara placed
the men's team fourth in the
U.S. on the basis of regional
scores.
The previous season Stanford
finished second in the country
with 2892 pins (192 average per
man), only eighteen pins behind
Southern Illinois's 2910 (193
average).
IM Action
One of the highlights of last
year's intramural bowling cham
pionship was the spirited battle
between the Kappa Sigs and the
Neutrinos.
A fine 242 game by Bruce Bar
rett and a consistent team effort
gained the IM bowling title for
the Neutrinos, and with it a good
chunk of their winning overall
IM total.
