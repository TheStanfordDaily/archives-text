Stanford University and the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commis
sion have extended for five years
the contract under which Stan
ford operates the Stanford Li
near Accelerator Center (SLAC).
The contract is being extend
ed to Sept. 30, 1972, according
to a report today from Congress
man Charles S. Gubser (JRep-
Gilroy).
Estimated annual operating
costs of SLAC are expected to
range between $23 million and
$33 million during the five-year
period. For the fiscal year end
ed June 30, 1967, operating costs
were about $15,300,000.
Stanford and AEC entered into
the original agreement in Dec.
1963.
SLAC, completed in 1966 after
four years of construction, is
now well into its first year of

operation. It is operated by Stan
ford for the AEC as a national
facility for high energy physics
research and is open to quali
fied scientists throughout the
world.
To date, 13 experiments are
scheduled or in progress by re
search teams from Stanford and
other U.S. institutions.
About 1,200 scientists, engi
