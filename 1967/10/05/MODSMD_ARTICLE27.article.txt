# New Party Seeks Support

### 
The Peace and Freedom Party
has from 5,000 to 7,000 of the
67,000 registrants needed in Cal
ifornia to get its candidates on
the ballot in 1968.
The acting party chairman for
Santa Clara County told The
Daily, "We're not doing awfully
well here." The fledgling party
has to get its signatures by Jan
uary 20, 1968 in order to be on
the ballot.
Dr. Richard White, the party's
temporary chairman and a doc
tor at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter, called the registration drive
a "significant protest" against
both major parties' stands on
Vietnam, poverty, and civil
rights.
Crisis Periods
White told The Daily, "There
have been three periods of crisis
in American political life. One

was the pre-civil war crisis out
of which emerged the abolition
ist Republicans as a political
power. One was the depression,
out of which emerged Roosevelt
and his young Democrats with
a rather radical view of the
economy. And the third period
is today, when we have a whole
generation of youth who are
alienated from the political and
economic institutions of our so
ciety."
"We hope the Peace and Free
dom Party can serve as a focus
for these people for effective po
litical action," he went on. White
believes that within the next
five years there will be a re
storing of political labels along
liberal and conservative lines
similar to what happened when
the Whig Party disappeared in
the 1850 s.

In the September organization
convention Negro delegates
walked out of the party when
denied 507r of the votes on all
resolutions. White does not think
this will adversely affect the
party since it is doubtful wheth
er those who walked out, many
of them members of the Black
Panther Party, would ever have
joined and worked for the party.
"Many Negroes will join the
party," White asserted. He said
the convention subsequently
voted to allow Negroes what
amounts to a veto power over
any decisions the convention
might make concerning the black
community.
The Stanford chapter of the
party will meet in the basement
of the History Corner at 8 p.m.
tonight (Thursday).

The Stanford chapter of the
party will meet in the basement
of the History Corner at 8 p.m.
tonight (Thursday).
The Peace and Freedom Party
has from 5,000 to 7,000 of the
67,000 registrants needed in Cal
ifornia to get its candidates on
the ballot in 1968.
The acting party chairman for
Santa Clara County told The
Daily, "We're not doing awfully
well here." The fledgling party
has to get its signatures by Jan
uary 20, 1968 in order to be on
the ballot.
Dr. Richard White, the party's
temporary chairman and a doc
tor at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter, called the registration drive
a "significant protest" against
both major parties' stands on
Vietnam, poverty, and civil
rights.
Crisis Periods
White told The Daily, "There
have been three periods of crisis
in American political life. One

was the pre-civil war crisis out
of which emerged the abolition
ist Republicans as a political
power. One was the depression,
out of which emerged Roosevelt
and his young Democrats with
a rather radical view of the
economy. And the third period
is today, when we have a whole
generation of youth who are
alienated from the political and
economic institutions of our so
ciety."
"We hope the Peace and Free
dom Party can serve as a focus
for these people for effective po
litical action," he went on. White
believes that within the next
five years there will be a re
storing of political labels along
liberal and conservative lines
similar to what happened when
the Whig Party disappeared in
the 1850 s.

In the September organization
convention Negro delegates
walked out of the party when
denied 507r of the votes on all
resolutions. White does not think
this will adversely affect the
party since it is doubtful wheth
er those who walked out, many
of them members of the Black
Panther Party, would ever have
joined and worked for the party.
"Many Negroes will join the
party," White asserted. He said
the convention subsequently
voted to allow Negroes what
amounts to a veto power over
any decisions the convention
might make concerning the black
community.
