R. G. Davis, the Mime
Troupe's founder and director
speaks of the Mime Troupe as
"guerrilla theatre." "You do
something because you think
it's right and you believe your
self ultimately We want to deal
with hypocrisy in America. I
deal with it on stage for every
body. You can't say 'this is the
conclusion' to the audience.
They have to come to the same
conclusion as you, hopefully.
Otherwise it's didactic theatre

and you might as well write an
essay. We're out to disturb you.
I'm willing to expose myself to
the same thing we expose the
audience to."
Tickets to the performance
are $2 and are on sale at the
