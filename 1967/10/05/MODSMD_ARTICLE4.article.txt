# Arrow Rebuts Lyman Objections To Proposed Academic Senate
## 
### 
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow, chair
man of the executive committee
of the Academic Council, reacted
calmly yesterday to charges of
"piecemeal reform" in the pro
posed establishment of a faculty
senate.
He said, "The attempt of the
faculty to reorganize itself is not
intended to preclude any future
reorganization of the govern
ment of the University."
ASSU President Peter Lyman,
in a letter to the executive com
mittee (see page 2), criticized
the proposed 65-member senate.
The group would include five
students and five administrators.
Lyman said he opposed "any
'reform' which perpetuates the

present class system (faculty,
students, administration)."
Arrow said he saw no point in
waiting for the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford to recommend
sweeping changes before the fac
ulty began some changes on its
own.
"I don't consider it advisable
for the faculty to postpone its
own reorganization pending a
larger reorganization that may
or may not take place," he said.
He added the faculty senate
had been under discussion for
about a year. (SES was set up
only last winter.)
Lyman in his letter said the
proposal implied greater powers
on the part of the faculty. Ar
row observed, however, "that

there are no new powers as mat
ters stand now."
He said the various powers of
the Academic Council are listed
in the by-laws of the University,
and that the new senate would
act within those vague rules.
He added, however, "Without
violating the by-laws, the Aca
demic Council is capable of do
ing considerably more than it is
now doing."
Lyman said the five student
members would be a "mockery"
if the senate is intended to "gov
ern the University." On the other
hand, if the faculty senate is to
concern itself only with faculty
matters, he said, it would be "a
depressing refinishing of the
past rather than a new or crea
tive solution to old problems."
"Of course that's not the in
tended result," he added.
"Vis-a-vis the students," Arrow
said, "things will be much as
they were before. That's not to
say they shouldn't be better. But
the main changes will be in the
relations between faculty and ad
ministration."

He added, however, "Without
violating the by-laws, the Aca
demic Council is capable of do
ing considerably more than it is
now doing."
Lyman said the five student
members would be a "mockery"
if the senate is intended to "gov
ern the University." On the other
hand, if the faculty senate is to
concern itself only with faculty
matters, he said, it would be "a
depressing refinishing of the
past rather than a new or crea
tive solution to old problems."
"Of course that's not the in
tended result," he added.
"Vis-a-vis the students," Arrow
said, "things will be much as
they were before. That's not to
say they shouldn't be better. But
the main changes will be in the
relations between faculty and ad
ministration."
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow, chair
man of the executive committee
of the Academic Council, reacted
calmly yesterday to charges of
"piecemeal reform" in the pro
posed establishment of a faculty
senate.
He said, "The attempt of the
faculty to reorganize itself is not
intended to preclude any future
reorganization of the govern
ment of the University."
ASSU President Peter Lyman,
in a letter to the executive com
mittee (see page 2), criticized
the proposed 65-member senate.
The group would include five
students and five administrators.
Lyman said he opposed "any
'reform' which perpetuates the

present class system (faculty,
students, administration)."
Arrow said he saw no point in
waiting for the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford to recommend
sweeping changes before the fac
ulty began some changes on its
own.
"I don't consider it advisable
for the faculty to postpone its
own reorganization pending a
larger reorganization that may
or may not take place," he said.
He added the faculty senate
had been under discussion for
about a year. (SES was set up
only last winter.)
Lyman in his letter said the
proposal implied greater powers
on the part of the faculty. Ar
row observed, however, "that

there are no new powers as mat
ters stand now."
He said the various powers of
the Academic Council are listed
in the by-laws of the University,
and that the new senate would
act within those vague rules.
