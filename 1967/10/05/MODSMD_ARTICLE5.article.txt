# Cardinals Seek Theme
## 
### 
Cardinals Board wants help
in selecting a theme for
Homecoming festivities,
which coincide this year with
the football match with the
University of California (Ber
keley) Nov. 18.
Last year's Homecoming
theme, for the Air Force
game, "Indians of a Feather
Pluck Falcons Together," was
not well received according to
board member John Arnold.
He hopes that this year a
more popular slogan can be
chosen if students are free to
submit suggestions.
Arnold suggested that a
good theme might mention
"The Axe," a traditional
Stanford symbol which was
stolen last spring, or "The
Bears," which is a nickname
for the football team at the
University of California (Ber

keley). Arnold mentioned
that he has heard reports that
the Axe Commission, a semi
nar group studying- The Axe,
endeavors to recover it prior
to the football contest.
Suggestions for the theme
should be submitted to
morrow to Homecoming
chairman Fidelia Zanetta in
the ASSU office.
The Homecoming festival
will lack a Queen. Last year
a student referendum prohib
ited the Cardinals board
from selecting a Homecoming
Queen, following the contest
ed election of Annabelle
Evans. A large write-in vote
was given to Wendy Wonka,
but Cardinals board would
not accept her as a candidate.
A street dance is being con
sidered as a supplement to
the usual Homecoming floats
and band activities.
