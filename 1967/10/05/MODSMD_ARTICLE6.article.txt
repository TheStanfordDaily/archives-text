# Meeting Tonite May Eliminate Three Legislature Committees
## 
### 
Three standing committees of
the ASSU Legislature (LASSU)
may be abolished.
LASSU Speaker Mike Wein
stein will make the proposal at
tonight's meeting. He said such
a proposal would allow more
people to become involved in
LASSU's work.
The legislature will also hear
reports from ASSU President
Peter Lyman and Vice-President
Cesare Massarenti, as well as a
short explanation of budget poli
cies and a review of the summer
conference of the National Stu
dent Association (NSA).
Within the context of the NSA
report, Weinstein intends to sub
mit three alternative proposals
concerning a Bay Area Student
Association.
He said that he personally fa
vored "getting out of NSA for a
variety or reasons which shall
be explained."
Tonight's meeting will bring
newly-elected delegates together
for the first time this fall. Rep

resentatives from each living
residence, fraternity, eating club,
graduate department, and off
campus compose the legislative
body.
LASSU Function
LASSU is responsible for the
chartering of all student organi
zations and for the budgeting of
student funds.
It also serves as a forum for
student opinion and frequently
acts as a student voice on Uni
versity issues.
In the past LASSU has met
once a week, however, Speaker
Weinstein hopes that the entire
body will meet only once every
two weeks and that committees
will complete the larger part of
work in separate meetings on
the alternate weeks.
"The amendment to change
the standing committee strue
ture stems for the desire to dis
tribute LASSU work load to a
greater number of representa
tives," Weinstein said.
"The reform will do awav with

three of the present five stand
ing committees and will replace
them with an undetermined
number of special committees."
Committees Dissolved
The By-Laws, Student Affairs,
and Judicial Committees would
be dissolved by the measure. Fi
nance and Rules would remain
as standing committees.
The special committees would
be small groups of delegates
which would simply be num
bered and would lack a particu
lar orientation or topic. Refer
ence people would be assigned
to aid committees when this ac
tion seemed warranted.
''The number of those commit
tees is flexible so all interested
representatives will have the op
tion of working on a commit
tee," added the Speaker.
He reminded all houses to
have an elected representative
present. The meeting is sched
uled for 7:30 tonight in Room
370, Geology Corner.

It also serves as a forum for
student opinion and frequently
acts as a student voice on Uni
versity issues.
In the past LASSU has met
once a week, however, Speaker
Weinstein hopes that the entire
body will meet only once every
two weeks and that committees
will complete the larger part of
work in separate meetings on
the alternate weeks.
"The amendment to change
the standing committee strue
ture stems for the desire to dis
tribute LASSU work load to a
greater number of representa
tives," Weinstein said.
"The reform will do awav with

three of the present five stand
ing committees and will replace
them with an undetermined
number of special committees."
Committees Dissolved
The By-Laws, Student Affairs,
and Judicial Committees would
be dissolved by the measure. Fi
nance and Rules would remain
as standing committees.
The special committees would
be small groups of delegates
which would simply be num
bered and would lack a particu
lar orientation or topic. Refer
ence people would be assigned
to aid committees when this ac
tion seemed warranted.
''The number of those commit
tees is flexible so all interested
representatives will have the op
tion of working on a commit
tee," added the Speaker.
He reminded all houses to
have an elected representative
present. The meeting is sched
uled for 7:30 tonight in Room
370, Geology Corner.
Three standing committees of
the ASSU Legislature (LASSU)
may be abolished.
LASSU Speaker Mike Wein
stein will make the proposal at
tonight's meeting. He said such
a proposal would allow more
people to become involved in
LASSU's work.
The legislature will also hear
reports from ASSU President
Peter Lyman and Vice-President
Cesare Massarenti, as well as a
short explanation of budget poli
cies and a review of the summer
conference of the National Stu
dent Association (NSA).
Within the context of the NSA
report, Weinstein intends to sub
mit three alternative proposals
concerning a Bay Area Student
Association.
He said that he personally fa
vored "getting out of NSA for a
variety or reasons which shall
be explained."
Tonight's meeting will bring
newly-elected delegates together
for the first time this fall. Rep

resentatives from each living
residence, fraternity, eating club,
graduate department, and off
campus compose the legislative
body.
LASSU Function
LASSU is responsible for the
chartering of all student organi
zations and for the budgeting of
student funds.
It also serves as a forum for
student opinion and frequently
acts as a student voice on Uni
versity issues.
