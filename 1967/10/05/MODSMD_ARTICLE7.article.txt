# ROTC Class Enrollment Open To 'Guests' Including 4 Women
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
With special government clear
ance, Military Science courses
are open to University "guests,"
including women, for the first
time and four women have al
ready registered.
At the same time, a petition
is being circulated and move
ments being formed to "remove
the military from our campus."

Special clearance came after
University officials asked that
the policy barring students who
are not Army Reserve Officers
Training Corps (ROTC) men
from classes be reconsidered, ac
cording to Colonel David Y. Nan
ney, Professor of Military Sci
ence and Executive Head of the
Military Science Department.
Some difficulty has developed

already with "guests" who wish
ed to, but could not take for
credit or audit courses that have
pre-requistes they have not met.
Nanney said, "When a student
comes to take a course, he will
have to take it the way it's set
up."
A meeting between Lieutenant
General James L. Richardson,
then commanding the Sixth
Army ir. San Francisco, and
President Wallace Sterling last
spring led the University to ask
for reconsideration, he added.
"Basic regulations will be
changed," said the memo which
Nanney received authorizing
"guests." Naval ROTC has in
the past been allowed to offer
their courses to other students.
The petition being circulated
against the military programs
on the campus "is not being
pushed by any one group," one
petitioner urged. "We will put
an advertisement in The Daily
which petitions the other stu
dents to join us in ousting them."
The Midpeninsula Free Uni
versity (MPFU) also listed in
its fall course listing a Special
Projects No. 75, "Counter Coun
ter Insurgency."
The courses will consist of bi
weekly meetings to consider
"both the failures of U.S. war
fare against nationalistic guer
illa liberation struggles 'md also
specific methods for eliminating
the military sciences from the
Stanford campus."
Enrollment in the MPFU
course required enrollment in
Military Science 131, "Leader
ship and Counterinsurgency,"
but interested student "guests"
were denied enrollment by Nan
ney because they lacked pre-req
uisites.
Marc Sapir, one of the stu
dents interested in getting an or

ganization against ROTC start
ed, said yesterday that pre-req
uisites had nothing to do with
it.
"It is very clear that if we
expose the kind of nonsense
that they are teaching in the
course, there will be a lot of
pressure on the campus gene
rated against the military on
the campus," Sapir claimed.
He also said that the special
project was not functioning
since students were not allowed
entrance to MS 131, and"the
only issue is to be allowed to
take the course."
Sapir also claimed that the
"guests" were not allowed to
have lists of the books read in
the course.
The petition reads:
"The undersigned members of
the Stanford community ask
your help and support in a uni
fied effort to remove the military
from our campus. For many rea
sons, which often differ, from
individual to individual, we are
convinced that the direct ties
between the military and this
University in the form of Mili
tary Sciences arrl Naval Scien
ces (ROTC programs) are im
proper and should be discon
tinued. We therefore ask you to
join with us in setting up a short
term organization whose sole
and immediate purpose will be
to effectively terminate the Stan
ford military sciences program.
We are signing this call as
individuals who do not neces
sarily subscribe to any single
notion of the tactics that should
be employed; we hope that a co
herent strategy can be developed
through an open meeting of all
interested individuals or, if nec
essary, by committees delegated
by that open meeting to work
on different ideas."
