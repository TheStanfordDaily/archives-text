# Thousand-Acre Site Subject Of Stanford-Palo Alto Debate
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
About 1,000 acres of Stanford
land continues to be the focal
point of debate between the Uni
versity, the City of Palo Alto,
two local counties, and several
other smaller communities.
The land—in the region be
tween the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) and
Alpine Road — is the proposed
site for a university research
industrial park and a flood-con
trolling dam.
Stanford plans to use some
900 acres in the area for an in
dustrial center similar to the
one already established in Palo
Alto. The industries would be
related to SLAC or other uni
versity research projects.
The Ladera Dam, as Palo Alto
city councilmen have suggested,
would be a solution to the city's
flooding problems on San Fran
cisquito Creek.
Army Solution
An Army Corps of Engineers
study conducted last year indi
cated that the dam would be
the best solution to the area's
flooding problems. Because of
Stanford's vehement objections
to this recommendation, the
Army Corps is now re-studying
flood control solutions.
A decision on the dam is ex
pected to be reached after re
ports are filed by the Army
Corps and a Palo Alto City
Council committee.
As long ago as last March,
Stanford Community Relations
Director Dixon Arnett felt con
fident that the park would be
built and the dam would not.
Stanford is going ahead with
plans for the industrial park,
Arnett said, because "we feel
there is sufficient doubt that a
dam will be built." Stanford has
fought the dam proposition as a

loss of revenue land for the uni
versity's future.
Cheaper Solution
Stanford has proposed anoth
er, less costly solution to Palo
Alto's problems, calling for re
inforcement of the creek's lower
banks. This plan, however,
would not attract the federal
funds that the dam project
would.
Palo Alto Councilman Robert
Cooley said at a City Council
meeting last Monday that "an
industrial or commercial devel
opment of this area increases
potential dangers to Palo Alto
of increased traffic and flood."
A city staff study indicated that
the proposed industrial develop
ment would bring about 18,200

employees, with about 15,000 au
tomobiles, to the area.
Both parties have had designs
on the area for several years.
Conflict first arose when the
members of the local flood con
trol district were unable to com' 1
to agreement on a joint project.
Included in the district are San
Mateo and Santa Clara Counties,
Palo Alto, Stanford, and Menlo
Park.
Ladera Annexation
Added political considerations
enter the picture with the con
troversy over the annexation of
the nearby town of Ladera. Sev
eral cities are wooing the 2,000
citizen complex, including Men
lo Park, Woodside, and Portola
Valley.

Mateo and Santa Clara Counties,
Palo Alto, Stanford, and Menlo
Park.
Ladera Annexation
Added political considerations
enter the picture with the con
troversy over the annexation of
the nearby town of Ladera. Sev
eral cities are wooing the 2,000
citizen complex, including Men
lo Park, Woodside, and Portola
Valley.
About 1,000 acres of Stanford
land continues to be the focal
point of debate between the Uni
versity, the City of Palo Alto,
two local counties, and several
other smaller communities.
The land—in the region be
tween the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) and
Alpine Road — is the proposed
site for a university research
industrial park and a flood-con
trolling dam.
Stanford plans to use some
900 acres in the area for an in
dustrial center similar to the
one already established in Palo
Alto. The industries would be
related to SLAC or other uni
versity research projects.
The Ladera Dam, as Palo Alto
city councilmen have suggested,
would be a solution to the city's
flooding problems on San Fran
cisquito Creek.
Army Solution
An Army Corps of Engineers
study conducted last year indi
cated that the dam would be
the best solution to the area's
flooding problems. Because of
Stanford's vehement objections
to this recommendation, the
Army Corps is now re-studying
flood control solutions.
A decision on the dam is ex
pected to be reached after re
ports are filed by the Army
Corps and a Palo Alto City
Council committee.
As long ago as last March,
Stanford Community Relations
Director Dixon Arnett felt con
fident that the park would be
built and the dam would not.
Stanford is going ahead with
plans for the industrial park,
Arnett said, because "we feel
there is sufficient doubt that a
dam will be built." Stanford has
fought the dam proposition as a

loss of revenue land for the uni
versity's future.
Cheaper Solution
Stanford has proposed anoth
er, less costly solution to Palo
Alto's problems, calling for re
inforcement of the creek's lower
banks. This plan, however,
would not attract the federal
funds that the dam project
would.
Palo Alto Councilman Robert
Cooley said at a City Council
meeting last Monday that "an
industrial or commercial devel
opment of this area increases
potential dangers to Palo Alto
of increased traffic and flood."
A city staff study indicated that
the proposed industrial develop
ment would bring about 18,200

employees, with about 15,000 au
tomobiles, to the area.
Both parties have had designs
on the area for several years.
Conflict first arose when the
members of the local flood con
trol district were unable to com' 1
to agreement on a joint project.
