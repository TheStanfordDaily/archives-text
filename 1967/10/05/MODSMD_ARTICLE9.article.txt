About 80 graduate students

A 1 Tapson, vice-president of the
California Federation of Teach

"What form of bargaining
agent we will be is not certain
yet," said Andrew Moss, pro

tics from London, now a re
search assistant in the Institute
of Mathematical Studies in the
Social Sciences.

The union's organization will
be discussed at the meeting, and
committees will bo formed to
consider salaries, fringe benefits,
the position of non-professional
library workers, and other griev
ances.
The group will also attempt to
arrive at a statement of its for
mal relationship to the Univer
sity and the ASSIJ.
The meeting will take place
at 7:30 tonight in Room 214,
History Corner.
The members of the union
were recruited last week at a
table in front of Tresidder. This
effort has been discontinued,
Moss said, until the group is
better organized.
