## A
						mysterious disease ravaged the Beta House last spring-diagnosis: typhoid fever 
### michael sweeney 
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"
