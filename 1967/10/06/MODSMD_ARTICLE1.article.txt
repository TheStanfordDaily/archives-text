# Epidemic
## A 						mysterious disease ravaged the Beta House last spring-diagnosis: typhoid fever 
### michael sweeney 
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease


Through these portals have passed
many things during the course of
the Betas' colorful history, but they
were noticeably empty during the
spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity

pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.

The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.

One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease

to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease

Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a

infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease


Through these portals have passed
many things during the course of
the Betas' colorful history, but they
were noticeably empty during the
spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around

dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo

vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease


Through these portals have passed
many things during the course of
the Betas' colorful history, but they
were noticeably empty during the
spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be

everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti

Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no

Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a

One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease

to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease

Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a

infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease


Through these portals have passed
many things during the course of
the Betas' colorful history, but they
were noticeably empty during the
spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.

gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease


Through these portals have passed
many things during the course of
the Betas' colorful history, but they
were noticeably empty during the
spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic

tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con

McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.

were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.

time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease

spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease

Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when

ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease


Through these portals have passed
many things during the course of
the Betas' colorful history, but they
were noticeably empty during the
spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around

dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.

pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
Dubinc the warm, sunny days last May, as
the school year languidly came to a close,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity was shattered by
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Within a month, 18
Betas were hospitalized with violent headaches,
chills and fevers. Almost all the fraternity's actives
were exposed to the highly infectious typhoid
bacillus.
It was the largest typhoid outbreak in the
United States in 12 years.
Nobody died, thanks to intensive hospital care
and the powerful antibotic Chloramphenicol.
Only members of Beta Theta Pi, and a fraternity
cook, were involved.
All of the Betas have recovered. It is not yet
known if any of the 33 persons infected by the
typhoid bacillus will be a permanent "carrier" of
the germ as was the fabled "Typhoid Mary."
The epidemic had a comically improbable be
ginning, a frenzied peak which panicked almost
everyone except the Betas themselves, and an anti
climatic ending. The 51 Beta Theta Pi actives and
21 pledges endured sickness, fear and stigma with
stoical nonchalance and wry humor. The fraternity
kept its high morale even as eight men were hos
pitalized in a single week and the Beta house was
filled with stories of victims' 105" fevers, who
shook from chills so violently that nurses at the
Cowell Student Health center had to strap them
in their beds.
Typhoid epidemics start when a typhoid carrier,
who has the bacillus in his gall bladder and con
stantly passes it out in his feces, somehow con
taminates food or water. The typhoid carrier him
self doesn't necessarily become ill. The Stanford
epidemic certainly started by contamination of
some meal at the Beta house, since only members
who actually ate there became ill.
Once a victim swallows something containing
SalmoncUa typhosa bacteria, a one to three week
incubation period will pass before the fever starts.

Some people ingest the bacteria and carry it in
their blood stream but experience little or no
sickness.
Typhoid first appeared at Beta Theta Pi when
Jon Huss woke up Monday, May 15, 1967 with a
headache, body pains and sore eyes.
"I thought it was the flu," says Huss, a varsity
football halfback. He continued to attend spring
football practice until Wednesday, May 17, when
his temperature hit 101. He spent that day in bed.
The fever worsened and on Friday he went to the
Cowell health center.
"The fever went down Saturday and I sneaked
out of the infirmary and went to football prac
tice," Huss recalls. "I felt all right—l had some
pretty good runs in drills. I didn't tell any of the
coaches about it because I still thought it was just
flu."
But the next day his fever was stronger than
ever. Huss weakened. James McClenahan, a health
center doctor who is now acting executive director
at Cowell, first diagnosed that Huss had either
flu, mononucleosis or pneumonia, all of which have
early symptoms similar to typhoid.
"There was no suspicion of typhoid," says Mc-
Clenahan. The disease is too rare in the United
States to be readily suspect as the cause of fevers.
McClenahan himself had seen only one case be
fore, an immigrant from Europe, when he was an
intern.
But for almost a week McClenahan was unable
to pin down the disease that afflicted Huss. Count
less laboratory tests failed. Meanwhile Huss, who
had lost 20 lbs. from his six-foot frame, lay in bed
with body temperatures up to 104.8". The only
medication he was permitted was two aspirin each
day.
Later Huss quietly described what it was like:
"I had peaks of fever every day. The heart rate
goes up with the fever. There was always pain in
the lower back and a tremendous headache. It's
really strange—you lie there and close your eyes

and see all kinds of things. You're delirious. You
can't control your mind real well. No sense of
time.
"All those tests!' he recalled with a wince. "The
most discouraging thing that first week was all the
unsuccessful tests the nurses made to find out
which disease it was. Every day they'd stick a
long tube—it looked like a nail—into my right arm
and fill four bottles with blood. Then they'd stick
the nail into my left arm and fill four more bottles.
It hurt like hell, but in that condition you don't
really care much. Only they'd never tell me why
they couldn't take the blood from just one arm."
The high body temperatures of the persistent
fevers often kill typhoid victims. For Huss and
later patients, nurses would rush in and rub down
the patient's body with alcohol whenever body
temperatures reached dangerous levels.
The nature of Muss's fever remained a mystery,
and the health center doctor's could do nothing
except keep him alive by controlling the fever.
Finally, on Wednesday, May 24, McClenahan
guessed that Huss might have typhoid fever.
"It occurred to us that it might be typhoid," he
says. "Nothing else checked out. We immediately
made blood count and antibody tests for typhoid
on lluss."
The samples were sent to the Palo Alto clinic
laboratory for analysis. McClenahan recalls jok
ing that day with a medical student, "Wouldn't
we be surprised if it were typhoid?"
It was. The tests indicating typhoid were com
pleted Thursday night, May 25. "We were glad
to finally find out what Huss had," McClenahan
says. "But we weren't elated to find out it was
typhoid." An epidemic of typhoid usually kills
3 per cent of its cases.
McClenahan told Huss the news the next morn
ing. "It didn't hit me at first," Huss says. "'Ty
phoid,' I thought, 'Oh, they'll give me a shot and
it'll go away. But then I thought, 'Typhoid! No
body gets that anymore!'"


Salmonella Typhosa
McClenahan's fears of a typhoid epidemic were
soon confirmed. By now the ancient killer disease
was running impudently through the bloodstreams
of dozens of Betas who were probably infected
about the same time as Huss. On May 20 Bob Con
rad went home to Los Angeles with fever. On May
25 Mike Hibler was admitted to the health center.
Then the cases came in a flood. John Read, Dick
Roth, Tim Brown and Tim Sheenhan were admit
ted in the next few days, and gradually the Cowell
infirmary filled with Betas.
At last McClenahan could administer an anti
botic to Huss. For typhoid the cure is almost as
dangerous as the disease. It's the antibiotic Chlor
amphenicol, which tends to destroy bone marrow.
Chloramphenicol was carefully administered to
Huss and the other patients, breaking their fevers
in a few days.
McClenahan's next concern was to prevent the
epidemic from spreading all over campus, as it
did in Stanford's first typhoid epidemic in 1903.
After a meeting of public health officials, orders
were given to close the Beta house kitchen and
make tests for typhoid on all Beta members.
The Beta house got the news Friday evening.
As Brent Lahe recalls, "We were sitting around
watching television. A big group was playing
poker. Then somebody walked in and said, 'Huss
has got typhoid.' Everybody said 'Sure' and laugh
ed about it."
The Betas found it hard to keep laughing.
Health authorities moved in the next day. All resi
dents were innoculated with typhoid vaccine.
Everyone was ordered to provide stool samples
which doctors could test for presence of Salmo
nella typhosa. And the kitchen believed to be the
source of the infection, was closed down.
"The DU's and Fijis offered to feed us," says one
Beta. "They were real careful not to drink out of
any of our glasses, though."
Dr. John C. Bolton, an intense young public
health "detective" with a stooped, awkward air,
came down from Berkeley to help control the epi
demic. He ordered all Betas to stop swimming in
public pools. Salmonella typhosa can easily be
spread through water. Betas who worked as hash
ers were ordered to quit their jobs.
Bolton's order brought a sudden halt to the
athletic careers of the many Beta swimmers and
water polo players, including Luis Nicolao, Greg

Buckingham, Mike Wall, Marc Parmely, John
Parker and Gary Sheerer.
The Beta actives who lived in the fraternity
house awaited the onset of the fever with com
plete fatalism. "Everybody in the house had been
in contact with the gtrm at meals. We could just
wait," explains Biff Barnard.
The disease struck in a definite pattern. Thir
teen of the members worked in the kitchen, and
ten of them contracted typhoid, including one of
the two cooks. Of the 48 actives who ate most of
their meals at the house, 56 per cent got typhoid.
Betas who rarely ate at the fraternity house had
few cases, and only one of the fraternity's 21
pledges tested "positive" with Salmonella typhosa.
Monty Orr, the house president, assumed re
sponsibility for making sure Betas got their shots
and turned in stool specimens. He also encour
aged house members with fevers and headaches
to report to the infirmary. Many were reluctant,
hoping their symptoms would pass. Finally Orr
himself came down with typhoid.
By June 1 the upstairs infirmary at the Cowell
health center was filled with typhoid victims.
Nurses gave intensive round-the-clock care to the
patients, who suffered 105° temperatures, chills,
profuse sweating, weight loss and"the worst head
aches I've ever had," according to one Beta.
The patients have high praise for their medical
treatment. "It was fantastic care, the best care in
the world," says Orr. "The nurses were always
around.." Special praise was given to Joyce H.
Sanders, chief nurse.
Life for the typhoid victims was fairly cheerful
during the breaks in their fevers. Patients were
free to walk around their corner of the infirmary.
Beta pledges organized book and mail deliveries
to the patients, girl friends sent boxes of cookies
and candy, and there was a continuous stream of
visitors. "They finally had to cut down on visitors
to the so-called sick men," says Biff Barnard. "It
was getting kind of wild."
The Betas made a big joke out of the stern warn
ings to them about personal hygiene, lest they
spread the disease. Monty Orr greated a visitor,
"Hi, I'd shake your hand but I might give you
typhoid." John Gamble, another patient, said sol
enmly "You get a thing about washing your hands
—all the time."

The epidemic had its comic side. Olympic swim
mer Dick Roth received the lion's share of the press
coverage. He was interviewed by ABC sports June
5. Roth was still recuperating from his 105' fevers
when he was taken downstairs at Cowell in a
wheelchair. There he was placed under hot lights
amid a litter of cameras and tape recorders.
Sweat glistened on Roth's brow by the time
Donna DaVarona of ABC started her interview.
The cameras rolled. She began by saying she was
at the "University of Stanford." Roth winced. She
went on to say that "Dick usually wins swimming
races, but now he has won a race with death.''
Roth winced again, but tried to smile modestly.
After an hour of takes and re-takes, Roth got a
chance to explain that the typhoid infection would
prevent him from practicing all summer, but that
he still hoped to be back in competition for the
1968 Oympics.
"It's drawn us all together because of the com
mon peril," said Eric Sutcliffe during the epidemic.
McClenahan was impressed by the fraternity's
calm. "They were all very relaxed. There was ab
solutely no panic reaction."
A large skull-and-crossbones was chalked on the
front door of the Beta house with the words, "Beta
Theta Ti Phoid." Inside a blackboard read, "No
swimming except in ocean and toilets."
The Beta alumni entered into the spirit of the
affair. They sent a get well card with the inscrip
tion, "A hell of a way to get out of finals—or are
you trying to get sympathetic alumni contribu
tions?" (Eventually the Betas got both.)
Once identified, the typhoid outbreak was com
pletely under the control of infirmary doctors and
public health authorities. But wild rumors en
veloped the campus and surrounding communi
ties. There were reports that the National Guard
was quarantining the entire campus. Other rumors
held that the cook in the Beta house was married
to another fraternity cook, who had spread the
epidemic. The Fiji house dog, Primo, became ill
and his owners rushed him to the veterinarian, as
suming he had typhoid.
"Every so often someone would come up and
say, 'I heard one of your boys died this morning,' "
recalls Monty Orr. "I just about dropped every
time I heard that."
One of the most persistent fears on campus was
that the Betas would somehow spread the disease


Through these portals have passed
many things during the course of
the Betas' colorful history, but they
were noticeably empty during the
spring typhoid scare.
to the rest of the students. "Girls would call up
and ask things like, Two weeks ago I sat next to
Jon Huss in Spanish class, so will I get typhoid?*"
says Orr. "People were afraid typhoid was carried
in the air or by flies." Actually an infected person
gives off the bacillus only through his feces, and
a person can contact typhoid only by swallowing
contaminated food or water.
The word "typhoid" had a kind of black magic
about it to some. Los Altos Hills warned its resi
dents against allowing Stanford students to use
their toilets, fearing that some student would con
taminate their septic tanks. Dr. McClenahan of
the health center says the manager of a local res
taurant complained to him that a former typhoid
patient was seen eating there. When the parents
of another patient tried to cash a check in a Palo
Alto store, the clerk recognized their name from
newspaper reports and refused to touch the check
lest he catch typhoid.
The story which amused the Betas most con
cerned a mother whose daughter was dating the
brother of one of the hardest-hit patients. This
woman called the patient's mother and explained
that she was sure the couple was at least at the
kissing stage, so she feared her daughter might get
typhoid. That was why her daughter was forbid
den to see the patient's brother again, the mother
explained.
The Cowell health center received dozens of
calls each day from local residents. Most wanted
to know if they should get typhoid shots. Finally
McClenahan issued a "Typhoid Bulletin" June 7
to clear the air. He denied any plans to quarantine
the campus and advised against mass immuniza
tion for typhoid.
The last typhoid patient was released June 20.
Meanwhile Dr. John Bolton, the public health
officer from Berkeley, was busy tracking down the
source of the epidemic. He discovered that seven
fraternity members had traveled to Mexico, Peru
or the Middle East recently. Typhoid is common
in these areas. Several were ill during their trips,
possibly from mild attacks of typhoid.
Once someone who carried Salmonella typhosa
in his system returned to the Beta house, condi

tions there were favorable to the start of an epi
demic, according to Bolton.
Bolton, showing little appreciation of the fra
ternity style of life, blasted the sanitary conditions
of the Beta house in his report on the epidemic:
"The house in general reflects a low level of
cleanliness. In some instances boys sleep on mat
resses directly on the floor. Orderliness does not
appear to be a strong point among the group. The
building itself is widely in need of repair."
Bolton believes the epidemic was the result of
• One or more Betas carrying the bacillus in
their systems by early May, 1967.
• The strange location of the Beta house sec
ond-floor bathroom—directly above the kitchen.
• The leaky ceiling between the bathroom and
kitchen.
• An epic water fight May 2, when a second
floor water hose burst and flooded the kitchen,
via the bathroom, with three inches of water.
In short, any Salmonella typhosa around the sec
ond floor toilets had an easy trip to the food prep
aration areas of the kitchen. Once the kitchen was
contaminated, a trace of Salmonella typhosa in the
potato salad could have infected the entire fra
ternity in one meal.
This is not the only plausible explanation of the
epidemic. One of the Beta hashers or cooks might
have been a typhoid carrier and contaminated the
food directly. The true cause of the epidemic will
never be known for sure.
Hal T. Wilson, Stanford's health officer, says
undesirable conditions in the Beta house had been
recognized in the past and corrected after period
inspections. But the old Beta house on Lasuen
street didn't cooperate, and violations kept recur
ring. Three years ago, for instance, the kitchen had
to be closed after a shower fell through the ceiling
above.
After the typhoid scare the University ordered
small changes in food handling procedures—milk
will no longer be served in large, open pitchers,
for example. Sanitary inspections through Wilsons

office may be increased. In the Beta house itself,
wood floors and counters in the kitchen and dining
room were ordered replaced and a new cement
floor installed in the second floor bathroom. The
renovations will cost $5,000.
Today, four months after the typhoid outbreak,
workmen have finished patching up the Beta
house and the Betas have patched up their inter
rupted lives. All the patients missed their final
examinations, and many took incompletes in
courses. Several Betas had planned to work as
waiters during the summer, but were forbidden
by public health regulations. Each typhoid pa
tient had to submit stool specimens regularly to
public health officials until three consecutive "neg
ative" tests were made. Then a blood test was
made before the patient was finally cleared.
One question remains unanswered. Will any of
the 33 persons who carried Salmonella typhosa in
the Stanford epidemic be permanent typhoid "car
riers"? Most, but not all the 33 persons involved
have been cleared. McClenahan is confident that
none of the victims will be carriers, capable of
starting new epidemics. "Typhoid is a disease
that's dangerous to infants and old people," he
says. "These men are all young and strong. It
doesn't hurt them nearly as much, and they're
much less likely to remain carriers."
If no one becomes a carrier, the men of Beta
Theta Pi can remember The Great Stanford Ty
phoid Epidemic of 1967 as a harmless, amusing
but painful interlude in their college years. "You
know,"says one Beta, "it was kind of a lark."
Stanford's first typhoid epidemic, from Decem
ber, 1902 to May, 1903, was a much more serious
affair than its second.
It all started with contaminated milk. The privy
at a local dairy drained into a creek from which
water was drawn to dilute the dairy's milk. A
member of the dairymen's family somehow con
tacted typhoid, and soon Palo Alto and Stanford
were in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.
Out of a combined Palo Alto-Stanford popula
tion of 3,500, there were 236 cases of typhoid.
Twelve died.


The Beta kitchen is the sus
pected source of contamina
tion. He was completely reno
vated following tne epidemic.
