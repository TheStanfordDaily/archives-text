# 'He wanted to see the world...'

At breakfast time on a jungle
road in Vietnam last week,
Dwight Owen killed a Com
munist and saw dozens of Americans
die," the Time magazine article be
gan.
That was the first time most peo
ple had heard of the Stanford soph
omore who had given up the aca
demic grind to see the war in South
east Asia.
Owen had been walking down a
path with a Ist Infantry Division
unit when several machine guns
opened up, the article continues.
Two soldiers died instantly in the
attack. Owen quickly took cover,
where from his vantage point he
saw movement in the darkness of
the jungle. "Then it moved again,"
he told Time. "I fired six shots. No
more movement."
Dwight Owen had left his native
Rhode Island five months earlier, ap
parently with designs of becoming a
war correspondent. After a quickie
tour of Europe on a motorscooter,
he convinced Italian officials to let
him work his way to Hong Kong on
a freighter as the ship's corpsman.
When he finally reached Saigon, he
flashed a letter from the Providence,
R. 1., Journal at officials and won full
accreditation as a war correspon
dent.
In lucid detail, readers learned

that Owen spent the night after the
Ist Infantry battle, "in a moonlit fox
hole half filled with water, surround
ed by the death-black jungle."
During the night, Owen thought
about the wrist watches still ticking
on the dead soldiers' wrists, about
the G.l.'s whose heads had been
blown off, and, surrealistically,
about the booze fests at Stanford
fraternities.
"I thought about mother and dad
and a girl back home," he told the
Time reporter. "And I thought
about my country and my own peo
ple."
Around Stanford the article
brought a sort of fame to Owen,
who wasn't here to enjoy it, and
probably couldn't have cared less
anyway.

A file found in the Stanford Daily
office tells much the same story, but
in much greater detail, and from
Owen's viewpoint:
October 17,1965
Hong Kong
Dear Editor,
After finishing my freshman year
at Stanford last June, I left the U.S.
for a fifteen month trip overseas. I
spent this summer in Europe and
then worked on a freighter as far as
here. Now I am going to Southeast
Asia—the real reason for my trip.

I plan to study our AID program
and guerrilla warfare in each of
these countries. This trip has the ap
proval of Dr. Buss and Dr. Liu, both
of whom were my professors last
year.
While I am out here, I would like
to write articles for The Daily. I
don't know whether or not you have
any other correspondents in this
part of the world; but judging from
last year, you do not. I have accredi
tation from The Providence Journal
and the Evening Bulletin in Provi
dence, Rhode Island. I will be writ
ing for them.
I have done some work on a high
school newspaper, which I have en
closed. I am considering reporting
as a vocation and thus would wel
come every opportunity to try my
skill and learn the business.
Of course, my writing would be
all feature articles. I will write
about what I see, what opinions I
discover, trends, people, places,
things, and I will attempt to bring
things up for discussion among the
students.
I would ask one thing. As I am fi
nancing this entire trip by myself,
would you be willing to pay the
postage for the articles I send in? It
won't amount to much, but to me
every little bit is important.
Sincerely,
Dwight H. Owen, Jr.


People were important to
Dwight Owen, and he made
friends easily. A bicycle was
his main means of transpor
tation, as it is with many of
the villagers he met.
