# A 						REAL THANKSGIVING MISSION
## 
### Dwight Owen, Jr 
SAIGON — This Thanksgiving 1
was privileged to accompany RAG
21 and RAG 27 (River Assault
Group) on their inaugural civic ac
tion mission.
We had an LCM partially loaded
with gifts of food, clothes, newspa
pers, books, soap, towels, and candy
for the poor of the villages we vis
ited.
We proceeded up the Mekong
River and turned up a canal. The
scenery along the narrow canal is
something out of a technicolor
movie.
We continued and shortly had the
peace shattered by the thump of
bullets splattering against the side
of the boats. Our guns opened fire
and then the snipers were silent.
The flotilla stopped at Binh Phuc
Nhut village to begin our civic ac
tion. The troops were ferried up the
canal to begin a search operation.
Binh Phuc Nhut is a typical Viet
namese delta village of a thousand
people. It had fifty Popular Force
troops and two fortified outposts for
protection. The Viet Cong attack
several times a month. The evidence
of battle is everywhere. One had to
be guided when walking around the
village because of the booby traps.
The medical team treated three
hundred patients with various ail
ments ranging from malnutrition to
heart conditions. The psywar team
broadcast propaganda and distrib
uted the gifts. Everyone got candy
but the village chief decided what
families were in need of food most.
I spent my time talking to the vil
lage chief of police. We spoke in
French and then I commenced to
teach him a few English phrases and
he to teach me a few in Vietnamese.
A crowd of villagers gathered
around to listen and laugh when my
tone changed the meaning of vari
ous words.
The flotilla went to where the
troops had been landed. One VC
had been captured and was calmly
being questioned by his captors.
At dusk the two gunboats turned
around. Our command boat fol-

lowed suit and we soon discovered
that our wake had upset a small
sampan.
The older men had swum ashore
hut two boys, 4 and 16, had
drowned. Our boat took the dis
traught father back up the canal to
the police station where he reported
what happened.
At eight we started home through
bad VC country. We had tried to
make amends as best we could and
now hoped we would not have to
pay in blood because the VC had

had plenty of time to set up an am
bush on our only route home. After
a tense hour we arrived home for a
Thanksgiving dinner of cook-your
own-eggs.

"QUANG NGAI, Sept. 1 (By
mail) —The tall, lean Stanford man
who more than any other persuaded
me to come to Vietnam did not live
to return with me. Dwight Hall
Owen, Jr., 21, died yesterday, try
ing to save a Vietnamese Revolu
tionary Development chief from an

"His life did offer an alternative
to the way a person can criticize the
war," said the black-haired girl who
first met Owen in early 1965.
"There were a lot of things in the
system that Dee didn't like, but he
wanted to be in a position to influ
ence the U.S. policy in Vietnam.
"Dee did a lot of things that peo
ple who are willing to burn their
draft cards would not. He had to go
where the action was—he joined
AID to work within the structure,
but he didn't feel limited by the
structure."
In the background the Stanford
stadium erupted with cheering as
this or that halfback sliced his way
to victory, part of another war.
She leaned back against the shady
eucalyptus tree. "Dee had a grasp
on life that I think a lot of people
never have.
"We were always talking about
the Owen luck," she laughed. "He
must have led a charmed life, he
never seemed to make rigid plans,
and \ hen everything always came
out iTht, we would laugh about
it and sa, that it was the Owen
luck.
"When he left for Eui 3pe it was
out of a sense of adventure. He only
had $600 in his pocket and he spent
most of that on the motorscooter.
He didn't know what was there but
he wanted to find out."
She paused. "He wanted to see
the world while he was young, be

fore the prejudices had a chance to
harden—those were his exact words.
Dee had a sense of adventure and
really enjoyed doing things like that
—he just liked that kind of life.
"Part of his concept of education
was not just sitting in his room and
reading. He wanted to talk to peo
ple and learn from them. All last
year he was constantly going to his
professors' offices and talking to
them.
"When his brother John was here,
they went to Haight-Ashbury just

to talk to the hippies all day to leam
something about them.
"He told me that he thought the
professors had a lot to say, but he
didn't want to be an innocent stu
dent just soaking it all in.
"In Europe he didn't go to any art
galleries — although he said later
that he wished he had—he used his
time talking to people.
"People were really important to
him.
"One night after a party here, he
drove a girl home. He was in a
hurry but she had a problem that
she had to work out. He spent an
hour talking to her trying to straight
en out the problem.
"He felt a kind of direction. He
just knew he had to do some of the
things he was doing.
"While most students say to them
selves, 'I'll get a Ph.D. so I can teach
or get a good job,' Dee would say 'I
guess I better get a Ph.D.' He'd
never say exactly why, but he
thought it would help. He wouldn't
say how he'd do it either; somehow
in the future he'd get his Ph.D.
"Whenever he had to catch a
plane, he would show up just barely
in time, often with all his luggage in
his hands, and board the plane sec
onds before it took off. He was too
busy with other things to go early
and wait for it.
Her dark eyes seemed to light up.
"He was filled with a vitality, that
after talking to him, you couldn't
help but bring some of it away with
you.
"He believed in fate, and he had
an idea that he might die over there.
But he said, 'If I die, then that's the
way it will have to be.'
"I don't think it was unusual that
he went halfway around the world
as a 19 year old—he just wanted to
see if a kid could still do it.
"That's just a miniscule part of
what he felt, though. When he was
there the first time he became very
caught up in the war and the Viet
namese people and what the war
was doing to their country.
"He made some Vietnamese
friends who really became impor
tant to him. He became very, very
concerned the first time he went to
Vietnam.
"He went back the second time
with a job to do, it wasn't just a
sense of adventure, but a feeling of
commitment.
"Dee told me when he went back
to Vietnam if his presence there
wasn't really creating the kind of
change he felt would do some good,
he would come back. 'If my pres
ence does mean something, I'll stay
over there six months, nine months,
a year,' he said.
"Dec returned to find out what
was going on. He received letters
from people he'd worked with say
ing he was really needed. It was out
of a sense of responsibility to his
friends in Vietnam that he re
turned."

"He believed in fate, and he had an idea that he might die
over there. But he said, If I die, then thats the way it will
have to be.' "

Funeral services for Dwight Hall
Owen Jr., 21, who was killed while
doing humanitarian work in Viet
nam were held at noon Saturday,
Sept. 9, at the Central Congrega
tionalist Church in Providence, R.I.
Owen was killed August 30 by
Viet Cong small arms fire near
Thanh Liem hamlet, several miles
south of the coastal city of Quang
Ngam. He was working for the
Agency for International Develop
ment (AID), which is sponsoring
economic development in Vietnam
as well as giving medical and hu
manitarian aid to the victims of the
fighting. Owen was an assistant to
the AID Provincial Representative
and was principally concerned with
community development.
Owen graduated from the Moses
Brown School in Providence in
1964 and had completed two years
of Asian and Political Science stud
ies at Stanford College in Califor
nia. He worked for AID from Feb
ruary to August 1966 and returned
there for another year's work last
month. He had intended to return
to Stanford in the fall of 1968.

draft cards would not. He had to go
where the action was—he joined
AID to work within the structure,
but he didn't feel limited by the
structure."
In the background the Stanford
stadium erupted with cheering as
this or that halfback sliced his way
to victory, part of another war.
She leaned back against the shady
eucalyptus tree. "Dee had a grasp
on life that I think a lot of people
never have.
"We were always talking about
the Owen luck," she laughed. "He
must have led a charmed life, he
never seemed to make rigid plans,
and \ hen everything always came
out iTht, we would laugh about
it and sa, that it was the Owen
luck.
"When he left for Eui 3pe it was
out of a sense of adventure. He only
had $600 in his pocket and he spent
most of that on the motorscooter.
He didn't know what was there but
he wanted to find out."
She paused. "He wanted to see
the world while he was young, be

fore the prejudices had a chance to
harden—those were his exact words.
Dee had a sense of adventure and
really enjoyed doing things like that
—he just liked that kind of life.
"Part of his concept of education
was not just sitting in his room and
reading. He wanted to talk to peo
ple and learn from them. All last
year he was constantly going to his
professors' offices and talking to
them.
"When his brother John was here,
they went to Haight-Ashbury just

to talk to the hippies all day to leam
something about them.
"He told me that he thought the
professors had a lot to say, but he
didn't want to be an innocent stu
dent just soaking it all in.
"In Europe he didn't go to any art
galleries — although he said later
that he wished he had—he used his
time talking to people.
"People were really important to
him.
"One night after a party here, he
drove a girl home. He was in a
hurry but she had a problem that
she had to work out. He spent an
hour talking to her trying to straight
en out the problem.
"He felt a kind of direction. He
just knew he had to do some of the
things he was doing.
"While most students say to them
selves, 'I'll get a Ph.D. so I can teach
or get a good job,' Dee would say 'I
guess I better get a Ph.D.' He'd
never say exactly why, but he
thought it would help. He wouldn't
say how he'd do it either; somehow
in the future he'd get his Ph.D.
"Whenever he had to catch a
plane, he would show up just barely
in time, often with all his luggage in
his hands, and board the plane sec
onds before it took off. He was too
busy with other things to go early
and wait for it.
Her dark eyes seemed to light up.
"He was filled with a vitality, that
after talking to him, you couldn't
help but bring some of it away with
you.
"He believed in fate, and he had
an idea that he might die over there.
But he said, 'If I die, then that's the
way it will have to be.'
"I don't think it was unusual that
he went halfway around the world
as a 19 year old—he just wanted to
see if a kid could still do it.
"That's just a miniscule part of
what he felt, though. When he was
there the first time he became very
caught up in the war and the Viet
namese people and what the war
was doing to their country.
"He made some Vietnamese
friends who really became impor
tant to him. He became very, very
concerned the first time he went to
Vietnam.
"He went back the second time
with a job to do, it wasn't just a
sense of adventure, but a feeling of
commitment.
"Dee told me when he went back
to Vietnam if his presence there
wasn't really creating the kind of
change he felt would do some good,
he would come back. 'If my pres
ence does mean something, I'll stay
over there six months, nine months,
a year,' he said.
"Dec returned to find out what
was going on. He received letters
from people he'd worked with say
ing he was really needed. It was out
of a sense of responsibility to his
friends in Vietnam that he re
turned."

"He believed in fate, and he had an idea that he might die
over there. But he said, If I die, then thats the way it will
have to be.' "

Funeral services for Dwight Hall
Owen Jr., 21, who was killed while
doing humanitarian work in Viet
nam were held at noon Saturday,
Sept. 9, at the Central Congrega
tionalist Church in Providence, R.I.
Owen was killed August 30 by
Viet Cong small arms fire near
Thanh Liem hamlet, several miles
south of the coastal city of Quang
Ngam. He was working for the
Agency for International Develop
ment (AID), which is sponsoring
economic development in Vietnam
as well as giving medical and hu
manitarian aid to the victims of the
fighting. Owen was an assistant to
the AID Provincial Representative
and was principally concerned with
community development.
Owen graduated from the Moses
Brown School in Providence in
1964 and had completed two years
of Asian and Political Science stud
ies at Stanford College in Califor
nia. He worked for AID from Feb
ruary to August 1966 and returned
there for another year's work last
month. He had intended to return
to Stanford in the fall of 1968.

SAIGON — This Thanksgiving 1
was privileged to accompany RAG
21 and RAG 27 (River Assault
Group) on their inaugural civic ac
tion mission.
We had an LCM partially loaded
with gifts of food, clothes, newspa
pers, books, soap, towels, and candy
for the poor of the villages we vis
ited.
We proceeded up the Mekong
River and turned up a canal. The
scenery along the narrow canal is
something out of a technicolor
movie.
We continued and shortly had the
peace shattered by the thump of
bullets splattering against the side
of the boats. Our guns opened fire
and then the snipers were silent.
The flotilla stopped at Binh Phuc
Nhut village to begin our civic ac
tion. The troops were ferried up the
canal to begin a search operation.
Binh Phuc Nhut is a typical Viet
namese delta village of a thousand
people. It had fifty Popular Force
troops and two fortified outposts for
protection. The Viet Cong attack
several times a month. The evidence
of battle is everywhere. One had to
be guided when walking around the
village because of the booby traps.
The medical team treated three
hundred patients with various ail
ments ranging from malnutrition to
heart conditions. The psywar team
broadcast propaganda and distrib
uted the gifts. Everyone got candy
but the village chief decided what
families were in need of food most.
I spent my time talking to the vil
lage chief of police. We spoke in
French and then I commenced to
teach him a few English phrases and
he to teach me a few in Vietnamese.
A crowd of villagers gathered
around to listen and laugh when my
tone changed the meaning of vari
ous words.
The flotilla went to where the
troops had been landed. One VC
had been captured and was calmly
being questioned by his captors.
At dusk the two gunboats turned
around. Our command boat fol-

lowed suit and we soon discovered
that our wake had upset a small
sampan.
The older men had swum ashore
hut two boys, 4 and 16, had
drowned. Our boat took the dis
traught father back up the canal to
the police station where he reported
what happened.
At eight we started home through
bad VC country. We had tried to
make amends as best we could and
now hoped we would not have to
pay in blood because the VC had

had plenty of time to set up an am
bush on our only route home. After
a tense hour we arrived home for a
Thanksgiving dinner of cook-your
own-eggs.

there the first time he became very
caught up in the war and the Viet

was doing to their country.
"He made some Vietnamese
friends who really became impor
tant to him. He became very, very
concerned the first time he went to
Vietnam.
"He went back the second time
with a job to do, it wasn't just a
sense of adventure, but a feeling of
commitment.
"Dee told me when he went back
to Vietnam if his presence there
wasn't really creating the kind of
change he felt would do some good,
he would come back. 'If my pres
ence does mean something, I'll stay
over there six months, nine months,
a year,' he said.
"Dec returned to find out what
was going on. He received letters
from people he'd worked with say
ing he was really needed. It was out
of a sense of responsibility to his
friends in Vietnam that he re
turned."

"He believed in fate, and he had an idea that he might die
over there. But he said, If I die, then thats the way it will
have to be.' "

Funeral services for Dwight Hall
Owen Jr., 21, who was killed while
doing humanitarian work in Viet
nam were held at noon Saturday,
Sept. 9, at the Central Congrega
tionalist Church in Providence, R.I.
Owen was killed August 30 by
Viet Cong small arms fire near
Thanh Liem hamlet, several miles
south of the coastal city of Quang
Ngam. He was working for the
Agency for International Develop
ment (AID), which is sponsoring
economic development in Vietnam
as well as giving medical and hu
manitarian aid to the victims of the
fighting. Owen was an assistant to
the AID Provincial Representative
and was principally concerned with
community development.
Owen graduated from the Moses
Brown School in Providence in
1964 and had completed two years
of Asian and Political Science stud
ies at Stanford College in Califor
nia. He worked for AID from Feb
ruary to August 1966 and returned
there for another year's work last
month. He had intended to return
to Stanford in the fall of 1968.

SAIGON — This Thanksgiving 1
was privileged to accompany RAG
21 and RAG 27 (River Assault
Group) on their inaugural civic ac
tion mission.
We had an LCM partially loaded
with gifts of food, clothes, newspa
pers, books, soap, towels, and candy
for the poor of the villages we vis
ited.
We proceeded up the Mekong
River and turned up a canal. The
scenery along the narrow canal is
something out of a technicolor
movie.
We continued and shortly had the
peace shattered by the thump of
bullets splattering against the side
of the boats. Our guns opened fire
and then the snipers were silent.
The flotilla stopped at Binh Phuc
Nhut village to begin our civic ac
tion. The troops were ferried up the
canal to begin a search operation.
Binh Phuc Nhut is a typical Viet
namese delta village of a thousand
people. It had fifty Popular Force
troops and two fortified outposts for
protection. The Viet Cong attack
several times a month. The evidence
of battle is everywhere. One had to
be guided when walking around the
village because of the booby traps.
The medical team treated three
hundred patients with various ail
ments ranging from malnutrition to
heart conditions. The psywar team
broadcast propaganda and distrib
uted the gifts. Everyone got candy
but the village chief decided what
families were in need of food most.
I spent my time talking to the vil
lage chief of police. We spoke in
French and then I commenced to
teach him a few English phrases and
he to teach me a few in Vietnamese.
A crowd of villagers gathered
around to listen and laugh when my
tone changed the meaning of vari
ous words.
The flotilla went to where the
troops had been landed. One VC
had been captured and was calmly
being questioned by his captors.
At dusk the two gunboats turned
around. Our command boat fol-

lowed suit and we soon discovered
that our wake had upset a small
sampan.
The older men had swum ashore
hut two boys, 4 and 16, had
drowned. Our boat took the dis
traught father back up the canal to
the police station where he reported
what happened.
At eight we started home through
bad VC country. We had tried to
make amends as best we could and
now hoped we would not have to
pay in blood because the VC had

had plenty of time to set up an am
bush on our only route home. After
a tense hour we arrived home for a
Thanksgiving dinner of cook-your
own-eggs.

"His life did offer an alternative
to the way a person can criticize the
war," said the black-haired girl who
first met Owen in early 1965.
"There were a lot of things in the
system that Dee didn't like, but he
wanted to be in a position to influ
ence the U.S. policy in Vietnam.
"Dee did a lot of things that peo
ple who are willing to burn their
draft cards would not. He had to go
where the action was—he joined
AID to work within the structure,
but he didn't feel limited by the
structure."
In the background the Stanford
stadium erupted with cheering as
this or that halfback sliced his way
to victory, part of another war.
She leaned back against the shady
eucalyptus tree. "Dee had a grasp
on life that I think a lot of people
never have.
"We were always talking about
the Owen luck," she laughed. "He
must have led a charmed life, he
never seemed to make rigid plans,
and \ hen everything always came
out iTht, we would laugh about
it and sa, that it was the Owen
luck.
"When he left for Eui 3pe it was
out of a sense of adventure. He only
had $600 in his pocket and he spent
most of that on the motorscooter.
He didn't know what was there but
he wanted to find out."
She paused. "He wanted to see
the world while he was young, be

fore the prejudices had a chance to
harden—those were his exact words.
Dee had a sense of adventure and
really enjoyed doing things like that
—he just liked that kind of life.
"Part of his concept of education
was not just sitting in his room and
reading. He wanted to talk to peo
ple and learn from them. All last
year he was constantly going to his
professors' offices and talking to
them.
"When his brother John was here,
they went to Haight-Ashbury just

to talk to the hippies all day to leam
something about them.
"He told me that he thought the
professors had a lot to say, but he
didn't want to be an innocent stu
dent just soaking it all in.
"In Europe he didn't go to any art
galleries — although he said later
that he wished he had—he used his
time talking to people.
"People were really important to
him.
"One night after a party here, he
drove a girl home. He was in a
hurry but she had a problem that
she had to work out. He spent an
hour talking to her trying to straight
en out the problem.
"He felt a kind of direction. He
just knew he had to do some of the
things he was doing.
"While most students say to them
selves, 'I'll get a Ph.D. so I can teach
or get a good job,' Dee would say 'I
guess I better get a Ph.D.' He'd
never say exactly why, but he
thought it would help. He wouldn't
say how he'd do it either; somehow
in the future he'd get his Ph.D.
"Whenever he had to catch a
plane, he would show up just barely
in time, often with all his luggage in
his hands, and board the plane sec
onds before it took off. He was too
busy with other things to go early
and wait for it.
Her dark eyes seemed to light up.
"He was filled with a vitality, that
after talking to him, you couldn't
help but bring some of it away with
you.
"He believed in fate, and he had
an idea that he might die over there.
But he said, 'If I die, then that's the
way it will have to be.'
"I don't think it was unusual that
he went halfway around the world
as a 19 year old—he just wanted to
see if a kid could still do it.
"That's just a miniscule part of
what he felt, though. When he was
there the first time he became very
caught up in the war and the Viet
namese people and what the war
was doing to their country.
"He made some Vietnamese

families were in need of food most.
I spent my time talking to the vil
lage chief of police. We spoke in
French and then I commenced to
teach him a few English phrases and
he to teach me a few in Vietnamese.
A crowd of villagers gathered
around to listen and laugh when my
tone changed the meaning of vari
ous words.
The flotilla went to where the
troops had been landed. One VC
had been captured and was calmly
being questioned by his captors.
At dusk the two gunboats turned
around. Our command boat fol-

lowed suit and we soon discovered
that our wake had upset a small
sampan.
The older men had swum ashore
hut two boys, 4 and 16, had
drowned. Our boat took the dis
traught father back up the canal to
the police station where he reported
what happened.
At eight we started home through
bad VC country. We had tried to
make amends as best we could and
now hoped we would not have to
pay in blood because the VC had

had plenty of time to set up an am
bush on our only route home. After
a tense hour we arrived home for a
Thanksgiving dinner of cook-your
own-eggs.

me to come to Vietnam did not live
to return with me. Dwight Hall
Owen, Jr., 21, died yesterday, try

"His life did offer an alternative
to the way a person can criticize the
war," said the black-haired girl who
first met Owen in early 1965.
"There were a lot of things in the
system that Dee didn't like, but he
wanted to be in a position to influ
ence the U.S. policy in Vietnam.
"Dee did a lot of things that peo
ple who are willing to burn their
draft cards would not. He had to go
where the action was—he joined
AID to work within the structure,
but he didn't feel limited by the
structure."
In the background the Stanford
stadium erupted with cheering as
this or that halfback sliced his way
to victory, part of another war.
She leaned back against the shady
eucalyptus tree. "Dee had a grasp
on life that I think a lot of people
never have.
"We were always talking about
the Owen luck," she laughed. "He
must have led a charmed life, he
never seemed to make rigid plans,
and \ hen everything always came
out iTht, we would laugh about
it and sa, that it was the Owen
luck.
"When he left for Eui 3pe it was
out of a sense of adventure. He only
had $600 in his pocket and he spent
most of that on the motorscooter.
He didn't know what was there but
he wanted to find out."
She paused. "He wanted to see
the world while he was young, be

fore the prejudices had a chance to
harden—those were his exact words.
Dee had a sense of adventure and
really enjoyed doing things like that
—he just liked that kind of life.
"Part of his concept of education
was not just sitting in his room and
reading. He wanted to talk to peo
ple and learn from them. All last
year he was constantly going to his
professors' offices and talking to
them.
"When his brother John was here,
they went to Haight-Ashbury just

to talk to the hippies all day to leam
something about them.
"He told me that he thought the
professors had a lot to say, but he
didn't want to be an innocent stu
dent just soaking it all in.
"In Europe he didn't go to any art
galleries — although he said later
that he wished he had—he used his
time talking to people.
"People were really important to
him.
"One night after a party here, he
drove a girl home. He was in a
hurry but she had a problem that
she had to work out. He spent an
hour talking to her trying to straight
en out the problem.
"He felt a kind of direction. He
just knew he had to do some of the
things he was doing.
"While most students say to them
selves, 'I'll get a Ph.D. so I can teach
or get a good job,' Dee would say 'I
guess I better get a Ph.D.' He'd
never say exactly why, but he
thought it would help. He wouldn't
say how he'd do it either; somehow
in the future he'd get his Ph.D.
"Whenever he had to catch a
plane, he would show up just barely
in time, often with all his luggage in
his hands, and board the plane sec
onds before it took off. He was too
busy with other things to go early
and wait for it.
Her dark eyes seemed to light up.
"He was filled with a vitality, that
after talking to him, you couldn't
help but bring some of it away with
you.
"He believed in fate, and he had
an idea that he might die over there.
But he said, 'If I die, then that's the
way it will have to be.'
"I don't think it was unusual that
he went halfway around the world
as a 19 year old—he just wanted to
see if a kid could still do it.
"That's just a miniscule part of
what he felt, though. When he was
there the first time he became very
caught up in the war and the Viet
namese people and what the war
was doing to their country.
"He made some Vietnamese
friends who really became impor
tant to him. He became very, very
concerned the first time he went to
Vietnam.
"He went back the second time
with a job to do, it wasn't just a
sense of adventure, but a feeling of
commitment.
"Dee told me when he went back
to Vietnam if his presence there
wasn't really creating the kind of
change he felt would do some good,
he would come back. 'If my pres
ence does mean something, I'll stay
over there six months, nine months,
a year,' he said.
"Dec returned to find out what
was going on. He received letters
from people he'd worked with say
ing he was really needed. It was out
of a sense of responsibility to his
friends in Vietnam that he re
turned."

"He believed in fate, and he had an idea that he might die
over there. But he said, If I die, then thats the way it will
have to be.' "

Funeral services for Dwight Hall
Owen Jr., 21, who was killed while
doing humanitarian work in Viet
nam were held at noon Saturday,
Sept. 9, at the Central Congrega
tionalist Church in Providence, R.I.
Owen was killed August 30 by
Viet Cong small arms fire near
Thanh Liem hamlet, several miles
south of the coastal city of Quang
Ngam. He was working for the
Agency for International Develop
ment (AID), which is sponsoring
economic development in Vietnam
as well as giving medical and hu
manitarian aid to the victims of the
fighting. Owen was an assistant to
the AID Provincial Representative
and was principally concerned with
community development.
Owen graduated from the Moses
Brown School in Providence in
1964 and had completed two years
of Asian and Political Science stud
ies at Stanford College in Califor
nia. He worked for AID from Feb
ruary to August 1966 and returned
there for another year's work last
month. He had intended to return
to Stanford in the fall of 1968.

SAIGON — This Thanksgiving 1
was privileged to accompany RAG
21 and RAG 27 (River Assault
Group) on their inaugural civic ac
tion mission.
We had an LCM partially loaded
with gifts of food, clothes, newspa
pers, books, soap, towels, and candy
for the poor of the villages we vis
ited.
We proceeded up the Mekong
River and turned up a canal. The
scenery along the narrow canal is
something out of a technicolor
movie.
We continued and shortly had the
peace shattered by the thump of
bullets splattering against the side
of the boats. Our guns opened fire
and then the snipers were silent.
The flotilla stopped at Binh Phuc
Nhut village to begin our civic ac
tion. The troops were ferried up the
canal to begin a search operation.
Binh Phuc Nhut is a typical Viet
namese delta village of a thousand
people. It had fifty Popular Force
troops and two fortified outposts for
protection. The Viet Cong attack
several times a month. The evidence
of battle is everywhere. One had to
be guided when walking around the
village because of the booby traps.
The medical team treated three
hundred patients with various ail
ments ranging from malnutrition to
heart conditions. The psywar team
broadcast propaganda and distrib
uted the gifts. Everyone got candy
but the village chief decided what
families were in need of food most.

year he was constantly going to his
professors' offices and talking to
them.
"When his brother John was here,
they went to Haight-Ashbury just

to talk to the hippies all day to leam
something about them.
"He told me that he thought the
professors had a lot to say, but he
didn't want to be an innocent stu
dent just soaking it all in.
"In Europe he didn't go to any art
galleries — although he said later
that he wished he had—he used his
time talking to people.
"People were really important to
him.
"One night after a party here, he
drove a girl home. He was in a
hurry but she had a problem that
she had to work out. He spent an
hour talking to her trying to straight
en out the problem.
"He felt a kind of direction. He
just knew he had to do some of the
things he was doing.
"While most students say to them
selves, 'I'll get a Ph.D. so I can teach
or get a good job,' Dee would say 'I
guess I better get a Ph.D.' He'd
never say exactly why, but he
thought it would help. He wouldn't
say how he'd do it either; somehow
in the future he'd get his Ph.D.
"Whenever he had to catch a
plane, he would show up just barely
in time, often with all his luggage in
his hands, and board the plane sec
onds before it took off. He was too
busy with other things to go early
and wait for it.
Her dark eyes seemed to light up.
"He was filled with a vitality, that
after talking to him, you couldn't
help but bring some of it away with
you.
"He believed in fate, and he had
an idea that he might die over there.
But he said, 'If I die, then that's the
way it will have to be.'
"I don't think it was unusual that
he went halfway around the world
as a 19 year old—he just wanted to
see if a kid could still do it.
"That's just a miniscule part of
what he felt, though. When he was
there the first time he became very
caught up in the war and the Viet
namese people and what the war
was doing to their country.
"He made some Vietnamese
friends who really became impor
tant to him. He became very, very
concerned the first time he went to
Vietnam.
"He went back the second time
with a job to do, it wasn't just a
sense of adventure, but a feeling of
commitment.
"Dee told me when he went back
to Vietnam if his presence there
wasn't really creating the kind of
change he felt would do some good,
he would come back. 'If my pres
ence does mean something, I'll stay
over there six months, nine months,
a year,' he said.
"Dec returned to find out what
was going on. He received letters
from people he'd worked with say
ing he was really needed. It was out
of a sense of responsibility to his
friends in Vietnam that he re
turned."

"He believed in fate, and he had an idea that he might die
over there. But he said, If I die, then thats the way it will
have to be.' "

Funeral services for Dwight Hall
Owen Jr., 21, who was killed while
doing humanitarian work in Viet
nam were held at noon Saturday,
Sept. 9, at the Central Congrega
tionalist Church in Providence, R.I.
Owen was killed August 30 by
Viet Cong small arms fire near
Thanh Liem hamlet, several miles
south of the coastal city of Quang
Ngam. He was working for the
Agency for International Develop
ment (AID), which is sponsoring
economic development in Vietnam
as well as giving medical and hu
manitarian aid to the victims of the
fighting. Owen was an assistant to
the AID Provincial Representative
and was principally concerned with
community development.
Owen graduated from the Moses
Brown School in Providence in
1964 and had completed two years
of Asian and Political Science stud
ies at Stanford College in Califor
nia. He worked for AID from Feb
ruary to August 1966 and returned
there for another year's work last
month. He had intended to return
to Stanford in the fall of 1968.
—from an AID press release
SAIGON — This Thanksgiving 1
was privileged to accompany RAG
21 and RAG 27 (River Assault
Group) on their inaugural civic ac
tion mission.
We had an LCM partially loaded
with gifts of food, clothes, newspa
pers, books, soap, towels, and candy
for the poor of the villages we vis
ited.
We proceeded up the Mekong
River and turned up a canal. The
scenery along the narrow canal is
something out of a technicolor
movie.
We continued and shortly had the
peace shattered by the thump of
bullets splattering against the side
of the boats. Our guns opened fire
and then the snipers were silent.
The flotilla stopped at Binh Phuc
Nhut village to begin our civic ac
tion. The troops were ferried up the
canal to begin a search operation.
Binh Phuc Nhut is a typical Viet
namese delta village of a thousand
people. It had fifty Popular Force
troops and two fortified outposts for
protection. The Viet Cong attack
several times a month. The evidence
of battle is everywhere. One had to
be guided when walking around the
village because of the booby traps.
The medical team treated three
hundred patients with various ail
ments ranging from malnutrition to
heart conditions. The psywar team
broadcast propaganda and distrib
uted the gifts. Everyone got candy
but the village chief decided what
families were in need of food most.
I spent my time talking to the vil
lage chief of police. We spoke in
French and then I commenced to
teach him a few English phrases and
he to teach me a few in Vietnamese.
A crowd of villagers gathered
around to listen and laugh when my
tone changed the meaning of vari
ous words.
The flotilla went to where the
troops had been landed. One VC
had been captured and was calmly
being questioned by his captors.
At dusk the two gunboats turned
around. Our command boat fol-

lowed suit and we soon discovered
that our wake had upset a small
sampan.
The older men had swum ashore
hut two boys, 4 and 16, had
drowned. Our boat took the dis
traught father back up the canal to
the police station where he reported
what happened.
At eight we started home through
bad VC country. We had tried to
make amends as best we could and
now hoped we would not have to
pay in blood because the VC had

had plenty of time to set up an am
bush on our only route home. After
a tense hour we arrived home for a
Thanksgiving dinner of cook-your
own-eggs.

"His life did offer an alternative
to the way a person can criticize the
war," said the black-haired girl who
first met Owen in early 1965.
"There were a lot of things in the
system that Dee didn't like, but he
wanted to be in a position to influ
ence the U.S. policy in Vietnam.
"Dee did a lot of things that peo
ple who are willing to burn their
draft cards would not. He had to go
where the action was—he joined
AID to work within the structure,
but he didn't feel limited by the
structure."
In the background the Stanford
stadium erupted with cheering as
this or that halfback sliced his way
to victory, part of another war.
She leaned back against the shady
eucalyptus tree. "Dee had a grasp
on life that I think a lot of people
never have.
"We were always talking about
the Owen luck," she laughed. "He
must have led a charmed life, he
never seemed to make rigid plans,
and \ hen everything always came
out iTht, we would laugh about
it and sa, that it was the Owen
luck.
"When he left for Eui 3pe it was
out of a sense of adventure. He only
had $600 in his pocket and he spent
most of that on the motorscooter.
He didn't know what was there but
he wanted to find out."
She paused. "He wanted to see
the world while he was young, be

harden—those were his exact words.
Dee had a sense of adventure and
