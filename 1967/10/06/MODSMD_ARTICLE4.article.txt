## news and reviews 'Hell's Angels' miss Stanford 
### 
Those soi-disant "lovers of the cinema" who
scoff at anything that is not poorly filmed in
some obscure foreign language will not doubt
miss one of the truly great art films of our
time.
I am referring, of course, to "Hells Angels on
Wheels," the brilliant first effort by a director
whose name I have unfortunately forgotten.
One has to go back to "Citizen Kane" or one
of the Abbott and Costello classics to find a
better evocation of what it means to be human
being in the twentieth century.
The action takes place in California, of
course; the Bay Area to be exact. (Stanford, for
some reason is never shown or even hinted at.
What this says about the relationship of Stan
ford to the Hells Angels I leave for others to
un^av^l.
From the opening scene, we know that this
movie is a rare gem. We see first the steeple of
a San Francisco church. The camera slowly
pins in on tho gokhn cross at the top of the
steeple and then suddenly—cuts!—to a close-up
of the Iron Cross hanging from the neck of the
hero.
Despite the magnificence of the first scene,
the film never loses its initial momentum. We
next see Hells Angels roaring through a
California hick-town strangely reminiscent of
Palo Alto. They soon pick up two girls, who
presumably have nothing better to do that day,
and the hero, who has just been fired from his
job at a gas station for insulting a customer.
Later that rvening, th°y stop at a roadside
tavern for a beer. After wrecking the place and
burning it to the ground, the pack leaves for
the local amusement park. In a brief but sharp
fracas, the pack leader kills a sailor with a flick
of his bike chain.
Th? whole group exits laughing and heads
for a favorite motel where they are met by an
angry mob armed with sticks. After mauling
the motel owner and his son, they succeed in
checking in.
At the party, the hero falls in love with the
pack leader's girl. She is a lithesome creature
whose leather jacket looks as if it was tailored
by I. Magnin. She confesses that she is about
to have the pack leader's baby, but the pack
leader refuses to marry her. The hero agrees to
do so immediately.
This tete-a-tete is overheard, unfortunately,
by the pack leader who makes preparations to
run down the hero with his Harley-Davidson.
Unbeknownst to the pack-leader, however,
there is a plate glass window between him and
the hero. As he crashes through the glass, the
movie ends.
I can say with all honesty that at the end of
this movie I was too numbed to move.

the hero. As he crashes through the glass, the
movie ends.
I can say with all honesty that at the end of
this movie I was too numbed to move.

Those soi-disant "lovers of the cinema" who
scoff at anything that is not poorly filmed in
some obscure foreign language will not doubt
miss one of the truly great art films of our
time.
I am referring, of course, to "Hells Angels on
Wheels," the brilliant first effort by a director
whose name I have unfortunately forgotten.
One has to go back to "Citizen Kane" or one
of the Abbott and Costello classics to find a
better evocation of what it means to be human
being in the twentieth century.
The action takes place in California, of
course; the Bay Area to be exact. (Stanford, for
some reason is never shown or even hinted at.
What this says about the relationship of Stan
ford to the Hells Angels I leave for others to
un^av^l.
From the opening scene, we know that this
movie is a rare gem. We see first the steeple of
a San Francisco church. The camera slowly
pins in on tho gokhn cross at the top of the
steeple and then suddenly—cuts!—to a close-up
of the Iron Cross hanging from the neck of the
hero.
Despite the magnificence of the first scene,
the film never loses its initial momentum. We
next see Hells Angels roaring through a
California hick-town strangely reminiscent of
Palo Alto. They soon pick up two girls, who
presumably have nothing better to do that day,
and the hero, who has just been fired from his
job at a gas station for insulting a customer.
Later that rvening, th°y stop at a roadside
tavern for a beer. After wrecking the place and
burning it to the ground, the pack leaves for
the local amusement park. In a brief but sharp
fracas, the pack leader kills a sailor with a flick
of his bike chain.
Th? whole group exits laughing and heads
for a favorite motel where they are met by an
angry mob armed with sticks. After mauling
the motel owner and his son, they succeed in
checking in.
At the party, the hero falls in love with the
pack leader's girl. She is a lithesome creature
whose leather jacket looks as if it was tailored
by I. Magnin. She confesses that she is about
to have the pack leader's baby, but the pack
leader refuses to marry her. The hero agrees to
do so immediately.
This tete-a-tete is overheard, unfortunately,
by the pack leader who makes preparations to
run down the hero with his Harley-Davidson.
Unbeknownst to the pack-leader, however,
there is a plate glass window between him and
the hero. As he crashes through the glass, the
movie ends.
I can say with all honesty that at the end of
this movie I was too numbed to move.
