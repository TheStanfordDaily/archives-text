# Sensitive camerman follows perfect wave
## 
### 
The most amazing thing about "The Endless
Summer" (now at the Guild) is that it's not
boring. After all, the story is slight by any
standards—a couple of surfers travel around
the world in search of "The Perfect Wave." For
an hour and a half, most of what we see is
water.
The reason "The Endless Summer" is not
boring can be attributed solely to Bruce Brown,
who wrote, directed, photographed, and nar
rated it. First of all, Brown himself is an excel
lent surfer. He didn't have to read up on his
subject.
Secondly, he knows a lot about photography
and has employed a number of different cam
eras and techniques to get his subject on film.
He shoots from shore with telephoto lenses, he
shoots while on a board, and he mounts the
camera on the board.
However, simply being a good surfer and a
good photographer does not ensure a good film
about surfing. Brown is also an acute observer.
As he follows his surfer friends around the
world, he differentiates between each stretch of
beach and emphasizes its individual character
istics.
In New Zealand, the two surfers find a cove
where they can ride so long that Brown
more than one roll of film to film a single ride.
At Cape St. Francis in South Africa, they have
to hike over huge sand dunes to reach the
beach, which they utilize for some dune-surfing.
In Tahiti they find a place which name
"Ins and Outs" because can actually get a
better ride heading out to sea rather than into
shore. Waimea in Hawaii is the only place
where the usual crowd of onlookers is aug
mented by an ambulance.
Brown not only knows how to surf and han
dle a camera, but somewhere he has also
learned how to make a film—or maybe he
knew all along. He knows the value of contrast.
He is constantly counterpointing the actual
surfing with shots of on-shore shenanigans and
scenes showing his fellow surfers traveling
from one spot to another. In Australia they are
more interested in the mini-bikinied gMs than
surfing. They reflect on the irony that they
have had no luck surfing in Australia, where
there was reputedly good surfing ("You
should've be°n here a month ago"). Yet they
have found at least three good surfing spots in
Tahiti where there was supposedly none.
Brown's narration is informative, anecdotal
and refreshingly low-keyed, although at times
it is just plain silly. The overall tone of the
movie seems to be "I want to show you some
thing I like." He doesn't apologize for surfing
or the image it has, he doesn't attempt to justi
fy it or to prove it's the thing for everyone.
H? is simply content to let his film speak for
itself.
In doing all these things, Brown has made
easily the best film on surfing as well as a
first-rate film as film.
