Ashish Khan and Pandit Ma
hapurush Misra, two young In
dian musicians with an uncom
mon feeling for their music,
made their Stanford debut last
Saturday night before a "-arm
ly enthusiastic audience in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

The talented performers, who
have been in the forefront of
the recent Indian music 'move
ment' in this country, left very
little to be desired in an in
spired and inspiring presenta
tion of a traditional Indian pro
gram.
Perhaps the outstanding as
pect of the concert was the

sense of involvement the two
artists were able to generate
in their listeners. Both have
youthful, dynamic personali
ties, and they build an imme
diate and obvious rapport with
those whom they are entertain
ing.
Ashish Khan, a nephew of
Ravi Shankar, plays the guitar
like sarod with almost uncon
trolled zeal. His solo perform
ance during the second half of
Saturday evening's concert was
superb. Only twenty-eight, he
seems sure to surpass the
achievements of his father, Ali
Akbar Khan, who is generally
considered the world's greatest
living master of the ancient in
strument.
Pandit Misra, who has do
voted most of his thirty-three
years to the study of the labia
(classical Indian drum) com
plemented Khan exceptionally
well. He was flaw'ess in the
finale of the program, in
which he echoed Khan's com
plex ragas (variations) down
to the smallest detail.
Misra's tabla solo, although
excellent, did not measure up
to his accompaniment of Khan.
It lacked the degree of fiery
improvisation which, curiously
enough, Misra was able to
achieve throughout the rest of
the program.
The evening was not with
out humor. During a lengthy
passage of the finale, one of
the four main strings on
Khan's sarod snapped. As the
audience looked on first in
amusement and then in awe,
Khan coo'ly repaired the dam
age and in a matter of seconds
proceeded from where he had
been interrupted.
Reaction at the conclusion of
the concert was overwhelm
ing. Khan and Misra were ap
plauded for over five minutes
by an audience which had sat
spellbound for ever three
hours. The Stanford India As
sociation, which brought the
two artists to the campus, cer
tainly scored a major success.

Ashish Khan, a nephew of
Ravi Shankar, plays the guitar
like sarod with almost uncon
trolled zeal. His solo perform
ance during the second half of
Saturday evening's concert was
superb. Only twenty-eight, he
seems sure to surpass the
achievements of his father, Ali
Akbar Khan, who is generally
considered the world's greatest
living master of the ancient in
strument.
Pandit Misra, who has do
voted most of his thirty-three
years to the study of the labia
(classical Indian drum) com
plemented Khan exceptionally
well. He was flaw'ess in the
finale of the program, in
which he echoed Khan's com
plex ragas (variations) down
to the smallest detail.
Misra's tabla solo, although
excellent, did not measure up
to his accompaniment of Khan.
It lacked the degree of fiery
improvisation which, curiously
enough, Misra was able to
achieve throughout the rest of
the program.
The evening was not with
out humor. During a lengthy
passage of the finale, one of
the four main strings on
Khan's sarod snapped. As the
audience looked on first in
amusement and then in awe,
Khan coo'ly repaired the dam
age and in a matter of seconds
proceeded from where he had
been interrupted.
Reaction at the conclusion of
the concert was overwhelm
ing. Khan and Misra were ap
plauded for over five minutes
by an audience which had sat
spellbound for ever three
hours. The Stanford India As
sociation, which brought the
two artists to the campus, cer
tainly scored a major success.
Ashish Khan and Pandit Ma
hapurush Misra, two young In
dian musicians with an uncom
mon feeling for their music,
made their Stanford debut last
Saturday night before a "-arm
ly enthusiastic audience in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

The talented performers, who
have been in the forefront of
the recent Indian music 'move
ment' in this country, left very
little to be desired in an in
spired and inspiring presenta
tion of a traditional Indian pro
gram.
Perhaps the outstanding as
pect of the concert was the

sense of involvement the two
artists were able to generate
in their listeners. Both have
youthful, dynamic personali
ties, and they build an imme
diate and obvious rapport with
those whom they are entertain
ing.
