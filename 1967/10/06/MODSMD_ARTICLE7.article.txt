Umberto D, Victorio de Sica's classic film of
old age and loneliness, is at the Tresidder flicks
tonight, and it is well worth seeing. It is a land
mark in the neo-realist movement in the Italian
cinema; rightly so, for it is a poignant and mov
ing study. As far as Saturday's entry, Senso, is
concerned, it sounds like some to this observer
like some more Mondo Cane hash. Enough said.
If you have missed it to this date, you must
see The Sand Pebbles, which is now on at the
Varsity. It is surely the best spectacular ever
made, with all the usual ingredients—brilliant
settings, color, music, etc. What is unusual is that
the story it tells is a solid, well-developed one
with considerable impact.
Don't Look Back, a documentary of Bob Dy
lan's concert tour of England, is now playing at
the Paris. The film offers interesting and honest
insight into the character of Dylan and the new
trends he has started in popular music.
For those who care only for visual entertain
ment, Bruce Brown's Endless Summer is at the
Guild. The film follows two surfers around the
world in search of the "perfect wave."
Tonight and tomorrow evenings, the Interplay
ers will continue their run of Agatha Christie's
mystery-drama The Mousetrap. This snappy num
ber has been going strong in London for 15 long
years. True, it does manage to generate audience
involvement, but if you don't immediately guess
who-done-it, we will be very much surprised. At
the Playhouse, also on Friday and Saturday, Nik
olai Gogol's farce The Inspector General will be
presented. Both plays are performed under com

bined management at Beach and Hyde Streets in
the City. Curtain time is 8:30.
Philadelphia, Here I Come with Jack Aranson
is now in its last three weeks at the City Theatre,
465 Post. Aranson almost tops his spectacular
role as Dylan Thomas two years ago in this out
standing production. Performances are at 8:30
tonight and tomorrow, 8:00 on Sunday, with a
2:30 matinee also on Sunday.
The Stanford Repertory will present perform
ances of Chekhov and Hard Rock tonight and to
morrow, 8:00 p.m., Little Theater. It promises to
be an unusual evening at the theater, with its
advertised "three one-act plays by Anton Chek
hov and discotheque party." Besides, student ad
mission is only two bits, so how can you lose?
On Sunday, Duke Ellington and his orchestra
will be at Mt. Tamalpais at 3:30 in the afternoon
as a conclusion to the Atheneum's 1967 Fall Fes
tival on the Mountain. Ellington's most recent
works will be featured as well as the guest ap
pearance of Brazilian guitarist Bela Soto and his
trio.
Don't forget Big Mama May Thornton, a unique
virtuoso who will sing country style blues this
afternoon from 4 to 6 in Tresidder's Large
Lounge. Tickets are $1.50. Also on campus to
night is Score's presentation of the San Francisco
Mime Troupe in "Lamant Militaire." Two per
formances, admission $2.00, will be presented in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, at 7:30 and 10:00.
The San Francisco Opera offers an amazing
slate this weekend: tonight, Macbeth (Verdi) at
8 p.m.; tomorrow Der Rosenkavalier (Strauss)
at the same time; and Th«> Magic Flute (Mo
zart) Sunday afternoon at 2. You might have a
chance for standing room.
