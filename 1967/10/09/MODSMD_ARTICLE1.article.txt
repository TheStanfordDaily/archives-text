# Katz: Colleges Should Focus On Diversity
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
"For most students, the academic offer
ings of college do not connect adequately
with their own personal motivations," thus
frustrating personel involvement in intellec
tual inquiry, concludes Dr. Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
In the results of a four-year study of stu
dents at Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley released today Katz
emphasized that colleges have failed to capi
talize on the diversity of their students' in
terests and talents. Moreover, many students
"do not learn adequately to connect their
reasoning capacities with the problems they
face in their own development." This causes
major life decisions, including choice of
careers and marriage partners, often to be
made by default, Katz explains.
"For many students the college years do
not bring sufficient opportunity to develop
the non-intellectual parts of their character,"
he adds. "The development of more autono
mous identity, of the capacity of intimate
communication with other people, and of tak
ing responsibility for others is not brought
to the fruitation that most students impli
citly desire but do not know & without furth
er education help — how to bring about."
These findings are the result of a massive

research project which included eight inter
views apiece with 500 students in the 1965
graduating classes of Stanford and Berkeley.
Interviews were conducted periodically dur
ing the students' undergraduate years in
order to give researchers a chance to observe
the development which occurs from the time
a student enters college until he receives his
diploma.
A direct outgrowth of the Mellon Founda
tion research project at Vassar College, this
study is also based on test and questionnaire
data from over 3,000 members of the Class
of 1965. Financed by the Danforth Founda
tion and the U.S. Office of Education, the
project is summarized in a 666-page volume,
Growth and Constraint in Sollege Students,
edited by Katz.
Topics covered include personality devel
opment, student attitudes toward teachers
and curricula, relationships with fellow stu
dents and parents, occupational choice, rela
tionships with fellow students and parents,
occupational choice, and the development of
personal values in college. In addition, spe
cial chapters are devoted to personality char
acteristics of students arrested during the
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 1964
and voting patterns in the 1966 Stanford
elections when David Harris was selected stu
dent body president.
During a period of highly-publicized stu

dent "activism" (1961-1965), the study show
ed that most underrgaduates at Stanford and
Berkeley are primarily concerned with their
own personal development . The college en
vironment is characterized as "a highly con
trolling one ... to the point of stress for
many students. But some individuals have
the psychological equipment not to let the
formal and informal requirements of the
structure interfere with their own individual
development, and they can utilize both the
opportunities and the obstacles of their en
vironment for the purpose of their own
growth.
"At the other extreme are those whose
needs for passivity, for being told what to
do have become so ego-snytonic that the
comfort of orderly security does not make
them experience requirements as either
stressful or inhibiting." Grouped somewhere
in between are the bulk of people "whose
lives never reach an adequate expression of
their potential.' 'The study revealed that thes
students are handicapped by inadequate self
awareness and self-assertion and by "an en
vironment whose demands and constraints"
thwart spontaneity and do not sufficiently eli
cite their potential.
Katz strongly urges colleges to realize
these diverse indiivdual needs of students.
"Educational planning must begin with the
recognition that students differ greatly from

each other, not only in ability and interests,
but also in their purposes, learning styles,
backgrounds, and personalities ..." He feels
that colleges must link these varied ap
proaches and styles to their traditional edu
cation tasks.
Unit of Education
"The starting point is to make the student
the 'unit of education' — not the course, the
interest of the professor, the department, the
graduate or professional school," Katz em
phasizes. Rather than just recording the
number of courses completed in high school,
Katz suggests that colleges develop indivi
dual profiles showing strong personal profi
ciences as well as weaknesses. An individual
plan should then be worked out with each
student, designed to further strengthen those
areas in which his interests persis and to im
prove at least one area in which he shows
initial weakness.
"Establishing and maintaining a student's
profile might require a heavier outlay of aca
demic personnel, particularly on entrance to
college. But there might be an eventual sav
ing, since it would allow the student to be
come much more self-directed than he is
now," he explains.
In an interview with The Daily, Katz was
quick to point out the importance of offering
a wide range of options to students, both in
the classroom, in their activities, and in their

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
ways — one emphasizes lectures, the other
seminar-type discussions. He favors letting
the student choose between letter grades or
a "pass-fail" system.
Extracurricular activities are usually re
garded as auxiliary to college, but "in opera
tion they have been of primary significance
to many students," Katz reports. Tutoring
the underprivileged, serving in Vista or the
Peace Corps, or other socially oriented proj
ects have often awakened educational inter
est in a growing segment of students, but
most colleges have been unable to incorpor
ate this type of "active education" into their
programs, Katz notes.
Recent housing innovations at Stanford
were praised by Katz because they offer
more diversity and enable students to select
a living arrangement suited to their indivi
dual needs. He found that one of the major
problems in institutions the size of Stanford
and Berkeley is the lack of communication
between the university and the student and
among students themselves. Personalized
dorm units help to create more channels for
communication and interraction, he said.
Self Determination
Katz believes that students should be en
couraged to plan their own type of college
