# Katz: Colleges Should Focus On Diversity
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
"For most students, the academic offer
ings of college do not connect adequately
with their own personal motivations," thus
frustrating personel involvement in intellec
tual inquiry, concludes Dr. Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
In the results of a four-year study of stu
dents at Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley released today Katz
emphasized that colleges have failed to capi
talize on the diversity of their students' in
terests and talents. Moreover, many students
"do not learn adequately to connect their
reasoning capacities with the problems they
face in their own development." This causes
major life decisions, including choice of
careers and marriage partners, often to be
made by default, Katz explains.
"For many students the college years do
not bring sufficient opportunity to develop
the non-intellectual parts of their character,"
he adds. "The development of more autono
mous identity, of the capacity of intimate
communication with other people, and of tak
ing responsibility for others is not brought
to the fruitation that most students impli
citly desire but do not know & without furth
er education help — how to bring about."
These findings are the result of a massive

research project which included eight inter
views apiece with 500 students in the 1965
graduating classes of Stanford and Berkeley.
Interviews were conducted periodically dur
ing the students' undergraduate years in
order to give researchers a chance to observe
the development which occurs from the time
a student enters college until he receives his
diploma.
A direct outgrowth of the Mellon Founda
tion research project at Vassar College, this
study is also based on test and questionnaire
data from over 3,000 members of the Class
of 1965. Financed by the Danforth Founda
tion and the U.S. Office of Education, the
project is summarized in a 666-page volume,
Growth and Constraint in Sollege Students,
edited by Katz.
Topics covered include personality devel
opment, student attitudes toward teachers
and curricula, relationships with fellow stu
dents and parents, occupational choice, rela
tionships with fellow students and parents,
occupational choice, and the development of
personal values in college. In addition, spe
cial chapters are devoted to personality char
acteristics of students arrested during the
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 1964
and voting patterns in the 1966 Stanford
elections when David Harris was selected stu
dent body president.
During a period of highly-publicized stu

dent "activism" (1961-1965), the study show
ed that most underrgaduates at Stanford and
Berkeley are primarily concerned with their
own personal development . The college en
vironment is characterized as "a highly con
trolling one ... to the point of stress for
many students. But some individuals have
the psychological equipment not to let the
formal and informal requirements of the
structure interfere with their own individual
development, and they can utilize both the
opportunities and the obstacles of their en
vironment for the purpose of their own
growth.
"At the other extreme are those whose
needs for passivity, for being told what to
do have become so ego-snytonic that the
comfort of orderly security does not make
them experience requirements as either
stressful or inhibiting." Grouped somewhere
in between are the bulk of people "whose
lives never reach an adequate expression of
their potential.' 'The study revealed that thes
students are handicapped by inadequate self
awareness and self-assertion and by "an en
vironment whose demands and constraints"
thwart spontaneity and do not sufficiently eli
cite their potential.
Katz strongly urges colleges to realize
these diverse indiivdual needs of students.
"Educational planning must begin with the
recognition that students differ greatly from

each other, not only in ability and interests,
but also in their purposes, learning styles,
backgrounds, and personalities ..." He feels
that colleges must link these varied ap
proaches and styles to their traditional edu
cation tasks.
Unit of Education
"The starting point is to make the student
the 'unit of education' — not the course, the
interest of the professor, the department, the
graduate or professional school," Katz em
phasizes. Rather than just recording the
number of courses completed in high school,
Katz suggests that colleges develop indivi
dual profiles showing strong personal profi
ciences as well as weaknesses. An individual
plan should then be worked out with each
student, designed to further strengthen those
areas in which his interests persis and to im
prove at least one area in which he shows
initial weakness.
"Establishing and maintaining a student's
profile might require a heavier outlay of aca
demic personnel, particularly on entrance to
college. But there might be an eventual sav
ing, since it would allow the student to be
come much more self-directed than he is
now," he explains.
In an interview with The Daily, Katz was
quick to point out the importance of offering
a wide range of options to students, both in
the classroom, in their activities, and in their

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
ways — one emphasizes lectures, the other
seminar-type discussions. He favors letting
the student choose between letter grades or
a "pass-fail" system.
Extracurricular activities are usually re
garded as auxiliary to college, but "in opera
tion they have been of primary significance
to many students," Katz reports. Tutoring
the underprivileged, serving in Vista or the
Peace Corps, or other socially oriented proj
ects have often awakened educational inter
est in a growing segment of students, but
most colleges have been unable to incorpor
ate this type of "active education" into their
programs, Katz notes.
Recent housing innovations at Stanford
were praised by Katz because they offer
more diversity and enable students to select
a living arrangement suited to their indivi
dual needs. He found that one of the major
problems in institutions the size of Stanford
and Berkeley is the lack of communication
between the university and the student and
among students themselves. Personalized
dorm units help to create more channels for
communication and interraction, he said.
Self Determination
Katz believes that students should be en
couraged to plan their own type of college
experience as soon as possible.
He adds that colleges should de
vote their best resources and
people to the freshman year.
"Those freshmen who feel ready
to assume independence, even if
it seems a brash independence,
ought to be given it, with the ex
pectation that they will confront
themselves and will be confront
ed with the consequences of mis
taken choices.
"Mistakes should be made an
occasion for learning," he con
tinued, "rather than of censure
or punishment. Those freshmen
who expect to be told what to
do, graded, and directed ought
to be given this opportunity with
the intent of confronting them
with the consequences of pas
sivity."
Creativity Loss
Many freshmen are faced with
academic values "that are out
of keeping with their status as
adolescents," Katz commented.
This results in a loss of crea
tivity in many cases. "The fresh
man is a much less theoretical
person than he is an ideological

one. He likes to work with great
ideas, comprehensive in scope,
and his ideas are closely related
to his own emotions, confusions,
and gropings ... In the fresh
man year this ideological bent
should be given full chance of
expression. This may go against
the grain of academic orienta
tion."
Students can conform, says
Katz, because their previous
training has already taught them
"what the coin of the realm is."
However, according to Katz, "it
is not what he wants to do, and
he gets the sense that his idea
tional products are unworthy.
He feels humiliated and inept,
and hence, finds it difficult to
connect academic reasoning, and
perhaps thought in general, with
himself. So to some extent, the
colleges themselves produce the
'anti-intellectuals' they complain
about.
Mask of Submissiveness
"We must enlarge the oppor
tunities for the freshmen to act
independently. We constantly
underestimate the intelligence

and autonomy of people of all
ages. We are misguided in part
because in front of teachers, stu
dents often put on masks of sub
missiveness ..."
Katz makes further sugges
tions concerning academic re
quirements, still closely relating
these to individual choice. To
meet the present "core" or "dis
tribution" requirements, Katz
proposes pure lecture courses be
offered without grades and with
only voluntary attendance. Stu
dents would have a chance to
take them at any time during
their four undergraduate years.
While some students will prefer
a more structured educational
program than others, "self-deter
mination ought to be a cardinal
principle from the beginning,"
says Katz.
Small Experiments
Though not advocating adopt
ing these or other changes on
a full-scale, Katz does hope that
colleges could develop them as
smaller, alternative programs.
"Perhaps one of the reasons for
the relative stagnation in higher
education has been the unwit
ting principle that reform ought
to be college-wide," he comments.
"This will allow greater freedom
to experiment, bypass 'political'
objections from the faculty, and
pave the way for eventual easier
adoption of procedures that have
proven themselves by example."
Katz also recommends the de
velopment of an "auxiliary fac
ulty" incorporating "explorers,
archeologists, journalists, busi
nessmen, and government offi
cials" for a short period of time.
In addition, "We should make
it much more possible for stu
dents to be useful to each other.

This might, for instance, be done
by enlisting students for teach
ing other students . . . Such
teaching is not only one of the
best devices of having the stu
dent-teachers learn subject mat
ter, but also would enhance their
self-esteem and sense of pur
pose. These students should be
under the supervision of a pro
fessor who himself would learn
much about the teaching process
through their experience."
New Fle'd
The concept of studying col
lege students and their environ
ment is relatively new, having
been undertaken only in the last
decade, Katz explained. He said
that data collection for this proj
ect began during a period of
new student involvement, and
to some extent information be
comes obsolete within a year. As
an example of changing atti
tudes, he cited the theory of in
loco parentis which was widely
debated in 1963, but is now con
sidered "out of date."
He said that he found Stanford
and Berkeley to be more alike in
many ways than most people ex
pect. "Berkeley has more visible
activity only in an absolute
sense. Stanford can be an equal
shock to an entering student's
values and pre-conceptions." He
added that many of the prob
lems and conflicts of interest ex
perienced by students at both
schools could be traced to the
same factors in their curricula
and living groups.
(Editor's Note: The Daily will
review the individual topics dealt
with in "Growth and Constraint
in College Students" in a future
series of articles.)

fessor who himself would learn
much about the teaching process
through their experience."
New Fle'd
The concept of studying col
lege students and their environ
ment is relatively new, having
been undertaken only in the last
decade, Katz explained. He said
that data collection for this proj
ect began during a period of
new student involvement, and
to some extent information be
comes obsolete within a year. As
an example of changing atti
tudes, he cited the theory of in
loco parentis which was widely
debated in 1963, but is now con
sidered "out of date."
He said that he found Stanford
and Berkeley to be more alike in
many ways than most people ex
pect. "Berkeley has more visible
activity only in an absolute
sense. Stanford can be an equal
shock to an entering student's
values and pre-conceptions." He
added that many of the prob
lems and conflicts of interest ex
perienced by students at both
schools could be traced to the
same factors in their curricula
and living groups.

"For most students, the academic offer
ings of college do not connect adequately
with their own personal motivations," thus
frustrating personel involvement in intellec
tual inquiry, concludes Dr. Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
In the results of a four-year study of stu
dents at Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley released today Katz
emphasized that colleges have failed to capi
talize on the diversity of their students' in
terests and talents. Moreover, many students
"do not learn adequately to connect their
reasoning capacities with the problems they
face in their own development." This causes
major life decisions, including choice of
careers and marriage partners, often to be
made by default, Katz explains.
"For many students the college years do
not bring sufficient opportunity to develop
the non-intellectual parts of their character,"
he adds. "The development of more autono
mous identity, of the capacity of intimate
communication with other people, and of tak
ing responsibility for others is not brought
to the fruitation that most students impli
citly desire but do not know & without furth
er education help — how to bring about."
These findings are the result of a massive

research project which included eight inter
views apiece with 500 students in the 1965
graduating classes of Stanford and Berkeley.
Interviews were conducted periodically dur
ing the students' undergraduate years in
order to give researchers a chance to observe
the development which occurs from the time
a student enters college until he receives his
diploma.
A direct outgrowth of the Mellon Founda
tion research project at Vassar College, this
study is also based on test and questionnaire
data from over 3,000 members of the Class
of 1965. Financed by the Danforth Founda
tion and the U.S. Office of Education, the
project is summarized in a 666-page volume,
Growth and Constraint in Sollege Students,
edited by Katz.
Topics covered include personality devel
opment, student attitudes toward teachers
and curricula, relationships with fellow stu
dents and parents, occupational choice, rela
tionships with fellow students and parents,
occupational choice, and the development of
personal values in college. In addition, spe
cial chapters are devoted to personality char
acteristics of students arrested during the
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 1964
and voting patterns in the 1966 Stanford
elections when David Harris was selected stu
dent body president.
During a period of highly-publicized stu

dent "activism" (1961-1965), the study show
ed that most underrgaduates at Stanford and
Berkeley are primarily concerned with their
own personal development . The college en
vironment is characterized as "a highly con
trolling one ... to the point of stress for
many students. But some individuals have
the psychological equipment not to let the
formal and informal requirements of the
structure interfere with their own individual
development, and they can utilize both the
opportunities and the obstacles of their en
vironment for the purpose of their own
growth.
"At the other extreme are those whose
needs for passivity, for being told what to
do have become so ego-snytonic that the
comfort of orderly security does not make
them experience requirements as either
stressful or inhibiting." Grouped somewhere
in between are the bulk of people "whose
lives never reach an adequate expression of
their potential.' 'The study revealed that thes
students are handicapped by inadequate self
awareness and self-assertion and by "an en
vironment whose demands and constraints"
thwart spontaneity and do not sufficiently eli
cite their potential.
Katz strongly urges colleges to realize
these diverse indiivdual needs of students.
"Educational planning must begin with the
recognition that students differ greatly from

each other, not only in ability and interests,
but also in their purposes, learning styles,
backgrounds, and personalities ..." He feels
that colleges must link these varied ap
proaches and styles to their traditional edu
cation tasks.
Unit of Education
"The starting point is to make the student
the 'unit of education' — not the course, the
interest of the professor, the department, the
graduate or professional school," Katz em
phasizes. Rather than just recording the
number of courses completed in high school,
Katz suggests that colleges develop indivi
dual profiles showing strong personal profi
ciences as well as weaknesses. An individual
plan should then be worked out with each
student, designed to further strengthen those
areas in which his interests persis and to im
prove at least one area in which he shows
initial weakness.
"Establishing and maintaining a student's
profile might require a heavier outlay of aca
demic personnel, particularly on entrance to
college. But there might be an eventual sav
ing, since it would allow the student to be
come much more self-directed than he is
now," he explains.
In an interview with The Daily, Katz was
quick to point out the importance of offering
a wide range of options to students, both in
the classroom, in their activities, and in their

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
ways — one emphasizes lectures, the other
seminar-type discussions. He favors letting
the student choose between letter grades or
a "pass-fail" system.
Extracurricular activities are usually re
garded as auxiliary to college, but "in opera
tion they have been of primary significance
to many students," Katz reports. Tutoring
the underprivileged, serving in Vista or the
Peace Corps, or other socially oriented proj
ects have often awakened educational inter
est in a growing segment of students, but
most colleges have been unable to incorpor
ate this type of "active education" into their
programs, Katz notes.
Recent housing innovations at Stanford
were praised by Katz because they offer
more diversity and enable students to select
a living arrangement suited to their indivi
dual needs. He found that one of the major
problems in institutions the size of Stanford
and Berkeley is the lack of communication
between the university and the student and
among students themselves. Personalized
dorm units help to create more channels for
communication and interraction, he said.
Self Determination
Katz believes that students should be en
couraged to plan their own type of college
experience as soon as possible.
He adds that colleges should de
vote their best resources and
people to the freshman year.
"Those freshmen who feel ready
to assume independence, even if
it seems a brash independence,
ought to be given it, with the ex
pectation that they will confront
themselves and will be confront
ed with the consequences of mis
taken choices.
"Mistakes should be made an
occasion for learning," he con
tinued, "rather than of censure
or punishment. Those freshmen
who expect to be told what to
do, graded, and directed ought
to be given this opportunity with
the intent of confronting them
with the consequences of pas
sivity."
Creativity Loss
Many freshmen are faced with
academic values "that are out
of keeping with their status as
adolescents," Katz commented.
This results in a loss of crea
tivity in many cases. "The fresh
man is a much less theoretical
person than he is an ideological

one. He likes to work with great
ideas, comprehensive in scope,
and his ideas are closely related
to his own emotions, confusions,
and gropings ... In the fresh
man year this ideological bent
should be given full chance of
expression. This may go against
the grain of academic orienta
tion."
Students can conform, says
Katz, because their previous
training has already taught them
"what the coin of the realm is."
However, according to Katz, "it
is not what he wants to do, and
he gets the sense that his idea
tional products are unworthy.
He feels humiliated and inept,
and hence, finds it difficult to
connect academic reasoning, and
perhaps thought in general, with
himself. So to some extent, the
colleges themselves produce the
'anti-intellectuals' they complain
about.
Mask of Submissiveness
"We must enlarge the oppor
tunities for the freshmen to act
independently. We constantly
underestimate the intelligence

and autonomy of people of all
ages. We are misguided in part
because in front of teachers, stu
dents often put on masks of sub
missiveness ..."
Katz makes further sugges
tions concerning academic re
quirements, still closely relating
these to individual choice. To
meet the present "core" or "dis
tribution" requirements, Katz
proposes pure lecture courses be
offered without grades and with
only voluntary attendance. Stu
dents would have a chance to
take them at any time during
their four undergraduate years.
While some students will prefer
a more structured educational
program than others, "self-deter
mination ought to be a cardinal
principle from the beginning,"
says Katz.
Small Experiments
Though not advocating adopt
ing these or other changes on
a full-scale, Katz does hope that
colleges could develop them as
smaller, alternative programs.
"Perhaps one of the reasons for
the relative stagnation in higher
education has been the unwit
ting principle that reform ought
to be college-wide," he comments.
"This will allow greater freedom
to experiment, bypass 'political'
objections from the faculty, and
pave the way for eventual easier
adoption of procedures that have
proven themselves by example."
Katz also recommends the de
velopment of an "auxiliary fac
ulty" incorporating "explorers,
archeologists, journalists, busi
nessmen, and government offi
cials" for a short period of time.
In addition, "We should make
it much more possible for stu
dents to be useful to each other.

This might, for instance, be done
by enlisting students for teach
ing other students . . . Such
teaching is not only one of the
best devices of having the stu
dent-teachers learn subject mat
ter, but also would enhance their
self-esteem and sense of pur
pose. These students should be
under the supervision of a pro
fessor who himself would learn
much about the teaching process
through their experience."

mination ought to be a cardinal
principle from the beginning,"
says Katz.
Small Experiments
Though not advocating adopt
ing these or other changes on
a full-scale, Katz does hope that
colleges could develop them as
smaller, alternative programs.
"Perhaps one of the reasons for
the relative stagnation in higher
education has been the unwit
ting principle that reform ought
to be college-wide," he comments.
"This will allow greater freedom
to experiment, bypass 'political'
objections from the faculty, and
pave the way for eventual easier
adoption of procedures that have
proven themselves by example."
Katz also recommends the de
velopment of an "auxiliary fac
ulty" incorporating "explorers,
archeologists, journalists, busi
nessmen, and government offi
cials" for a short period of time.
In addition, "We should make
it much more possible for stu
dents to be useful to each other.

This might, for instance, be done
by enlisting students for teach
ing other students . . . Such
teaching is not only one of the
best devices of having the stu
dent-teachers learn subject mat
ter, but also would enhance their
self-esteem and sense of pur
pose. These students should be
under the supervision of a pro
fessor who himself would learn
much about the teaching process
through their experience."
New Fle'd
The concept of studying col
lege students and their environ
ment is relatively new, having
been undertaken only in the last
decade, Katz explained. He said
that data collection for this proj
ect began during a period of
new student involvement, and
to some extent information be
comes obsolete within a year. As
an example of changing atti
tudes, he cited the theory of in
loco parentis which was widely
debated in 1963, but is now con
sidered "out of date."
He said that he found Stanford
and Berkeley to be more alike in
many ways than most people ex
pect. "Berkeley has more visible
activity only in an absolute
sense. Stanford can be an equal
shock to an entering student's
values and pre-conceptions." He
added that many of the prob
lems and conflicts of interest ex
perienced by students at both
schools could be traced to the
same factors in their curricula
and living groups.

"For most students, the academic offer
ings of college do not connect adequately
with their own personal motivations," thus
frustrating personel involvement in intellec
tual inquiry, concludes Dr. Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
In the results of a four-year study of stu
dents at Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley released today Katz
emphasized that colleges have failed to capi
talize on the diversity of their students' in
terests and talents. Moreover, many students
"do not learn adequately to connect their
reasoning capacities with the problems they
face in their own development." This causes
major life decisions, including choice of
careers and marriage partners, often to be
made by default, Katz explains.
"For many students the college years do
not bring sufficient opportunity to develop
the non-intellectual parts of their character,"
he adds. "The development of more autono
mous identity, of the capacity of intimate
communication with other people, and of tak
ing responsibility for others is not brought
to the fruitation that most students impli
citly desire but do not know & without furth
er education help — how to bring about."
These findings are the result of a massive

research project which included eight inter
views apiece with 500 students in the 1965
graduating classes of Stanford and Berkeley.
Interviews were conducted periodically dur
ing the students' undergraduate years in
order to give researchers a chance to observe
the development which occurs from the time
a student enters college until he receives his
diploma.
A direct outgrowth of the Mellon Founda
tion research project at Vassar College, this
study is also based on test and questionnaire
data from over 3,000 members of the Class
of 1965. Financed by the Danforth Founda
tion and the U.S. Office of Education, the
project is summarized in a 666-page volume,
Growth and Constraint in Sollege Students,
edited by Katz.
Topics covered include personality devel
opment, student attitudes toward teachers
and curricula, relationships with fellow stu
dents and parents, occupational choice, rela
tionships with fellow students and parents,
occupational choice, and the development of
personal values in college. In addition, spe
cial chapters are devoted to personality char
acteristics of students arrested during the
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 1964
and voting patterns in the 1966 Stanford
elections when David Harris was selected stu
dent body president.
During a period of highly-publicized stu

dent "activism" (1961-1965), the study show
ed that most underrgaduates at Stanford and
Berkeley are primarily concerned with their
own personal development . The college en
vironment is characterized as "a highly con
trolling one ... to the point of stress for
many students. But some individuals have
the psychological equipment not to let the
formal and informal requirements of the
structure interfere with their own individual
development, and they can utilize both the
opportunities and the obstacles of their en
vironment for the purpose of their own
growth.
"At the other extreme are those whose
needs for passivity, for being told what to
do have become so ego-snytonic that the
comfort of orderly security does not make
them experience requirements as either
stressful or inhibiting." Grouped somewhere
in between are the bulk of people "whose
lives never reach an adequate expression of
their potential.' 'The study revealed that thes
students are handicapped by inadequate self
awareness and self-assertion and by "an en
vironment whose demands and constraints"
thwart spontaneity and do not sufficiently eli
cite their potential.
Katz strongly urges colleges to realize
these diverse indiivdual needs of students.
"Educational planning must begin with the
recognition that students differ greatly from

each other, not only in ability and interests,
but also in their purposes, learning styles,
backgrounds, and personalities ..." He feels
that colleges must link these varied ap
proaches and styles to their traditional edu
cation tasks.
Unit of Education
"The starting point is to make the student
the 'unit of education' — not the course, the
interest of the professor, the department, the
graduate or professional school," Katz em
phasizes. Rather than just recording the
number of courses completed in high school,
Katz suggests that colleges develop indivi
dual profiles showing strong personal profi
ciences as well as weaknesses. An individual
plan should then be worked out with each
student, designed to further strengthen those
areas in which his interests persis and to im
prove at least one area in which he shows
initial weakness.
"Establishing and maintaining a student's
profile might require a heavier outlay of aca
demic personnel, particularly on entrance to
college. But there might be an eventual sav
ing, since it would allow the student to be
come much more self-directed than he is
now," he explains.
In an interview with The Daily, Katz was
quick to point out the importance of offering
a wide range of options to students, both in
the classroom, in their activities, and in their

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
ways — one emphasizes lectures, the other
seminar-type discussions. He favors letting
the student choose between letter grades or
a "pass-fail" system.
Extracurricular activities are usually re
garded as auxiliary to college, but "in opera
tion they have been of primary significance
to many students," Katz reports. Tutoring
the underprivileged, serving in Vista or the
Peace Corps, or other socially oriented proj
ects have often awakened educational inter
est in a growing segment of students, but
most colleges have been unable to incorpor
ate this type of "active education" into their
programs, Katz notes.
Recent housing innovations at Stanford
were praised by Katz because they offer
more diversity and enable students to select
a living arrangement suited to their indivi
dual needs. He found that one of the major
problems in institutions the size of Stanford
and Berkeley is the lack of communication
between the university and the student and
among students themselves. Personalized
dorm units help to create more channels for
communication and interraction, he said.
Self Determination
Katz believes that students should be en
couraged to plan their own type of college
experience as soon as possible.
He adds that colleges should de
vote their best resources and
people to the freshman year.
"Those freshmen who feel ready
to assume independence, even if
it seems a brash independence,
ought to be given it, with the ex
pectation that they will confront
themselves and will be confront
ed with the consequences of mis
taken choices.
"Mistakes should be made an
occasion for learning," he con
tinued, "rather than of censure
or punishment. Those freshmen
who expect to be told what to
do, graded, and directed ought
to be given this opportunity with
the intent of confronting them
with the consequences of pas
sivity."
Creativity Loss
Many freshmen are faced with
academic values "that are out
of keeping with their status as
adolescents," Katz commented.
This results in a loss of crea
tivity in many cases. "The fresh
man is a much less theoretical
person than he is an ideological

one. He likes to work with great
ideas, comprehensive in scope,
and his ideas are closely related
to his own emotions, confusions,
and gropings ... In the fresh
man year this ideological bent
should be given full chance of
expression. This may go against
the grain of academic orienta
tion."
Students can conform, says
Katz, because their previous
training has already taught them
"what the coin of the realm is."
However, according to Katz, "it
is not what he wants to do, and
he gets the sense that his idea
tional products are unworthy.
He feels humiliated and inept,
and hence, finds it difficult to
connect academic reasoning, and
perhaps thought in general, with
himself. So to some extent, the
colleges themselves produce the
'anti-intellectuals' they complain
about.
Mask of Submissiveness
"We must enlarge the oppor
tunities for the freshmen to act
independently. We constantly
underestimate the intelligence

and autonomy of people of all
ages. We are misguided in part
because in front of teachers, stu
dents often put on masks of sub
missiveness ..."
Katz makes further sugges
tions concerning academic re
quirements, still closely relating
these to individual choice. To
meet the present "core" or "dis
tribution" requirements, Katz
proposes pure lecture courses be
offered without grades and with
only voluntary attendance. Stu
dents would have a chance to
take them at any time during
their four undergraduate years.
While some students will prefer
a more structured educational
program than others, "self-deter
mination ought to be a cardinal
principle from the beginning,"
says Katz.

Katz, because their previous
training has already taught them
"what the coin of the realm is."
However, according to Katz, "it
is not what he wants to do, and
he gets the sense that his idea
tional products are unworthy.
He feels humiliated and inept,
and hence, finds it difficult to
connect academic reasoning, and
perhaps thought in general, with
himself. So to some extent, the
colleges themselves produce the
'anti-intellectuals' they complain
about.
Mask of Submissiveness
"We must enlarge the oppor
tunities for the freshmen to act
independently. We constantly
underestimate the intelligence

and autonomy of people of all
ages. We are misguided in part
because in front of teachers, stu
dents often put on masks of sub
missiveness ..."
Katz makes further sugges
tions concerning academic re
quirements, still closely relating
these to individual choice. To
meet the present "core" or "dis
tribution" requirements, Katz
proposes pure lecture courses be
offered without grades and with
only voluntary attendance. Stu
dents would have a chance to
take them at any time during
their four undergraduate years.
While some students will prefer
a more structured educational
program than others, "self-deter
mination ought to be a cardinal
principle from the beginning,"
says Katz.
Small Experiments
Though not advocating adopt
ing these or other changes on
a full-scale, Katz does hope that
colleges could develop them as
smaller, alternative programs.
"Perhaps one of the reasons for
the relative stagnation in higher
education has been the unwit
ting principle that reform ought
to be college-wide," he comments.
"This will allow greater freedom
to experiment, bypass 'political'
objections from the faculty, and
pave the way for eventual easier
adoption of procedures that have
proven themselves by example."
Katz also recommends the de
velopment of an "auxiliary fac
ulty" incorporating "explorers,
archeologists, journalists, busi
nessmen, and government offi
cials" for a short period of time.
In addition, "We should make
it much more possible for stu
dents to be useful to each other.

This might, for instance, be done
by enlisting students for teach
ing other students . . . Such
teaching is not only one of the
best devices of having the stu
dent-teachers learn subject mat
ter, but also would enhance their
self-esteem and sense of pur
pose. These students should be
under the supervision of a pro
fessor who himself would learn
much about the teaching process
through their experience."
New Fle'd
The concept of studying col
lege students and their environ
ment is relatively new, having
been undertaken only in the last
decade, Katz explained. He said
that data collection for this proj
ect began during a period of
new student involvement, and
to some extent information be
comes obsolete within a year. As
an example of changing atti
tudes, he cited the theory of in
loco parentis which was widely
debated in 1963, but is now con
sidered "out of date."
He said that he found Stanford
and Berkeley to be more alike in
many ways than most people ex
pect. "Berkeley has more visible
activity only in an absolute
sense. Stanford can be an equal
shock to an entering student's
values and pre-conceptions." He
added that many of the prob
lems and conflicts of interest ex
perienced by students at both
schools could be traced to the
same factors in their curricula
and living groups.

"For most students, the academic offer

with their own personal motivations," thus
frustrating personel involvement in intellec

of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
In the results of a four-year study of stu

emphasized that colleges have failed to capi
talize on the diversity of their students' in
terests and talents. Moreover, many students
"do not learn adequately to connect their
reasoning capacities with the problems they
face in their own development." This causes
major life decisions, including choice of
careers and marriage partners, often to be
made by default, Katz explains.
"For many students the college years do
not bring sufficient opportunity to develop
the non-intellectual parts of their character,"
he adds. "The development of more autono
mous identity, of the capacity of intimate
communication with other people, and of tak
ing responsibility for others is not brought
to the fruitation that most students impli
citly desire but do not know & without furth
er education help — how to bring about."
These findings are the result of a massive

research project which included eight inter
views apiece with 500 students in the 1965
graduating classes of Stanford and Berkeley.
Interviews were conducted periodically dur
ing the students' undergraduate years in
order to give researchers a chance to observe
the development which occurs from the time
a student enters college until he receives his
diploma.
A direct outgrowth of the Mellon Founda
tion research project at Vassar College, this
study is also based on test and questionnaire
data from over 3,000 members of the Class
of 1965. Financed by the Danforth Founda

project is summarized in a 666-page volume,
Growth and Constraint in Sollege Students,
edited by Katz.
Topics covered include personality devel
opment, student attitudes toward teachers
and curricula, relationships with fellow stu

tionships with fellow students and parents,
occupational choice, and the development of
personal values in college. In addition, spe

acteristics of students arrested during the
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 1964
and voting patterns in the 1966 Stanford
elections when David Harris was selected stu
dent body president.
During a period of highly-publicized stu

dent "activism" (1961-1965), the study show
ed that most underrgaduates at Stanford and
Berkeley are primarily concerned with their

vironment is characterized as "a highly con
trolling one ... to the point of stress for
many students. But some individuals have
the psychological equipment not to let the
formal and informal requirements of the
structure interfere with their own individual

opportunities and the obstacles of their en

comfort of orderly security does not make

lives never reach an adequate expression of
their potential.' 'The study revealed that thes
students are handicapped by inadequate self
awareness and self-assertion and by "an en

thwart spontaneity and do not sufficiently eli

Katz strongly urges colleges to realize
these diverse indiivdual needs of students.
"Educational planning must begin with the
recognition that students differ greatly from

each other, not only in ability and interests,
but also in their purposes, learning styles,
backgrounds, and personalities ..." He feels
that colleges must link these varied ap

cation tasks.
Unit of Education
"The starting point is to make the student
the 'unit of education' — not the course, the
interest of the professor, the department, the
graduate or professional school," Katz em
phasizes. Rather than just recording the
number of courses completed in high school,
Katz suggests that colleges develop indivi
dual profiles showing strong personal profi
ciences as well as weaknesses. An individual
plan should then be worked out with each
student, designed to further strengthen those
areas in which his interests persis and to im
prove at least one area in which he shows
initial weakness.
"Establishing and maintaining a student's
profile might require a heavier outlay of aca
demic personnel, particularly on entrance to
college. But there might be an eventual sav
ing, since it would allow the student to be
come much more self-directed than he is
now," he explains.
In an interview with The Daily, Katz was
quick to point out the importance of offering
a wide range of options to students, both in
the classroom, in their activities, and in their

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
ways — one emphasizes lectures, the other
seminar-type discussions. He favors letting
the student choose between letter grades or
a "pass-fail" system.
Extracurricular activities are usually re
garded as auxiliary to college, but "in opera
tion they have been of primary significance
to many students," Katz reports. Tutoring
the underprivileged, serving in Vista or the
Peace Corps, or other socially oriented proj
ects have often awakened educational inter
est in a growing segment of students, but
most colleges have been unable to incorpor
ate this type of "active education" into their
programs, Katz notes.
Recent housing innovations at Stanford
were praised by Katz because they offer
more diversity and enable students to select
a living arrangement suited to their indivi

problems in institutions the size of Stanford

He adds that colleges should de
vote their best resources and
people to the freshman year.
"Those freshmen who feel ready
to assume independence, even if
it seems a brash independence,
ought to be given it, with the ex
pectation that they will confront
themselves and will be confront
ed with the consequences of mis
taken choices.
"Mistakes should be made an
occasion for learning," he con
tinued, "rather than of censure
or punishment. Those freshmen
who expect to be told what to
do, graded, and directed ought
to be given this opportunity with
the intent of confronting them
with the consequences of pas
sivity."
Creativity Loss
Many freshmen are faced with
academic values "that are out
of keeping with their status as
adolescents," Katz commented.
This results in a loss of crea
tivity in many cases. "The fresh
man is a much less theoretical
person than he is an ideological

one. He likes to work with great
ideas, comprehensive in scope,
and his ideas are closely related
to his own emotions, confusions,
and gropings ... In the fresh
man year this ideological bent
should be given full chance of
expression. This may go against
the grain of academic orienta
tion."
Students can conform, says
Katz, because their previous
training has already taught them
"what the coin of the realm is."

people to the freshman year.
"Those freshmen who feel ready
to assume independence, even if
it seems a brash independence,
ought to be given it, with the ex
pectation that they will confront
themselves and will be confront
ed with the consequences of mis
taken choices.
"Mistakes should be made an
occasion for learning," he con
tinued, "rather than of censure
or punishment. Those freshmen
who expect to be told what to
do, graded, and directed ought
to be given this opportunity with
the intent of confronting them
with the consequences of pas
sivity."
Creativity Loss
Many freshmen are faced with
academic values "that are out
of keeping with their status as
adolescents," Katz commented.
This results in a loss of crea
tivity in many cases. "The fresh
man is a much less theoretical
person than he is an ideological

one. He likes to work with great
ideas, comprehensive in scope,
and his ideas are closely related
to his own emotions, confusions,
and gropings ... In the fresh
man year this ideological bent
should be given full chance of
expression. This may go against
the grain of academic orienta
tion."
Students can conform, says
Katz, because their previous
training has already taught them
"what the coin of the realm is."
However, according to Katz, "it
is not what he wants to do, and
he gets the sense that his idea
tional products are unworthy.
He feels humiliated and inept,
and hence, finds it difficult to
connect academic reasoning, and
perhaps thought in general, with
himself. So to some extent, the
colleges themselves produce the
'anti-intellectuals' they complain
about.
Mask of Submissiveness
"We must enlarge the oppor
tunities for the freshmen to act
independently. We constantly
underestimate the intelligence

and autonomy of people of all
ages. We are misguided in part
because in front of teachers, stu
dents often put on masks of sub
missiveness ..."
Katz makes further sugges
tions concerning academic re
quirements, still closely relating
these to individual choice. To
meet the present "core" or "dis
tribution" requirements, Katz
proposes pure lecture courses be
offered without grades and with
only voluntary attendance. Stu
dents would have a chance to
take them at any time during
their four undergraduate years.
While some students will prefer
a more structured educational
program than others, "self-deter
mination ought to be a cardinal
principle from the beginning,"
says Katz.
Small Experiments
Though not advocating adopt
ing these or other changes on
a full-scale, Katz does hope that
colleges could develop them as
smaller, alternative programs.
"Perhaps one of the reasons for
the relative stagnation in higher
education has been the unwit
ting principle that reform ought
to be college-wide," he comments.
"This will allow greater freedom
to experiment, bypass 'political'
objections from the faculty, and
pave the way for eventual easier
adoption of procedures that have
proven themselves by example."
Katz also recommends the de
velopment of an "auxiliary fac
ulty" incorporating "explorers,
archeologists, journalists, busi
nessmen, and government offi
cials" for a short period of time.
In addition, "We should make
it much more possible for stu
dents to be useful to each other.

This might, for instance, be done
by enlisting students for teach
ing other students . . . Such
teaching is not only one of the
best devices of having the stu
dent-teachers learn subject mat
ter, but also would enhance their
self-esteem and sense of pur
pose. These students should be
under the supervision of a pro
fessor who himself would learn
much about the teaching process
through their experience."
New Fle'd
The concept of studying col
lege students and their environ
ment is relatively new, having
been undertaken only in the last
decade, Katz explained. He said
that data collection for this proj
ect began during a period of
new student involvement, and
to some extent information be
comes obsolete within a year. As
an example of changing atti
tudes, he cited the theory of in
loco parentis which was widely
debated in 1963, but is now con
sidered "out of date."
He said that he found Stanford
and Berkeley to be more alike in
many ways than most people ex
pect. "Berkeley has more visible
activity only in an absolute
sense. Stanford can be an equal
shock to an entering student's
values and pre-conceptions." He
added that many of the prob
lems and conflicts of interest ex
perienced by students at both
schools could be traced to the
same factors in their curricula
and living groups.

"For most students, the academic offer
ings of college do not connect adequately
with their own personal motivations," thus
frustrating personel involvement in intellec
tual inquiry, concludes Dr. Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
In the results of a four-year study of stu
dents at Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley released today Katz
emphasized that colleges have failed to capi
talize on the diversity of their students' in
terests and talents. Moreover, many students
"do not learn adequately to connect their
reasoning capacities with the problems they
face in their own development." This causes
major life decisions, including choice of
careers and marriage partners, often to be
made by default, Katz explains.
"For many students the college years do
not bring sufficient opportunity to develop
the non-intellectual parts of their character,"
he adds. "The development of more autono
mous identity, of the capacity of intimate
communication with other people, and of tak
ing responsibility for others is not brought
to the fruitation that most students impli
citly desire but do not know & without furth
er education help — how to bring about."
These findings are the result of a massive

research project which included eight inter
views apiece with 500 students in the 1965
graduating classes of Stanford and Berkeley.
Interviews were conducted periodically dur
ing the students' undergraduate years in
order to give researchers a chance to observe
the development which occurs from the time
a student enters college until he receives his
diploma.
A direct outgrowth of the Mellon Founda
tion research project at Vassar College, this
study is also based on test and questionnaire
data from over 3,000 members of the Class
of 1965. Financed by the Danforth Founda
tion and the U.S. Office of Education, the
project is summarized in a 666-page volume,
Growth and Constraint in Sollege Students,
edited by Katz.
Topics covered include personality devel
opment, student attitudes toward teachers
and curricula, relationships with fellow stu
dents and parents, occupational choice, rela
tionships with fellow students and parents,
occupational choice, and the development of
personal values in college. In addition, spe
cial chapters are devoted to personality char
acteristics of students arrested during the
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 1964
and voting patterns in the 1966 Stanford
elections when David Harris was selected stu
dent body president.
During a period of highly-publicized stu

dent "activism" (1961-1965), the study show
ed that most underrgaduates at Stanford and
Berkeley are primarily concerned with their
own personal development . The college en
vironment is characterized as "a highly con
trolling one ... to the point of stress for
many students. But some individuals have
the psychological equipment not to let the
formal and informal requirements of the
structure interfere with their own individual
development, and they can utilize both the
opportunities and the obstacles of their en
vironment for the purpose of their own
growth.
"At the other extreme are those whose
needs for passivity, for being told what to
do have become so ego-snytonic that the
comfort of orderly security does not make
them experience requirements as either
stressful or inhibiting." Grouped somewhere
in between are the bulk of people "whose
lives never reach an adequate expression of
their potential.' 'The study revealed that thes
students are handicapped by inadequate self
awareness and self-assertion and by "an en
vironment whose demands and constraints"
thwart spontaneity and do not sufficiently eli
cite their potential.
Katz strongly urges colleges to realize
these diverse indiivdual needs of students.
"Educational planning must begin with the
recognition that students differ greatly from

each other, not only in ability and interests,
but also in their purposes, learning styles,
backgrounds, and personalities ..." He feels
that colleges must link these varied ap
proaches and styles to their traditional edu
cation tasks.
Unit of Education
"The starting point is to make the student
the 'unit of education' — not the course, the
interest of the professor, the department, the
graduate or professional school," Katz em
phasizes. Rather than just recording the
number of courses completed in high school,
Katz suggests that colleges develop indivi
dual profiles showing strong personal profi
ciences as well as weaknesses. An individual
plan should then be worked out with each
student, designed to further strengthen those
areas in which his interests persis and to im
prove at least one area in which he shows
initial weakness.
"Establishing and maintaining a student's
profile might require a heavier outlay of aca
demic personnel, particularly on entrance to
college. But there might be an eventual sav
ing, since it would allow the student to be
come much more self-directed than he is
now," he explains.
In an interview with The Daily, Katz was
quick to point out the importance of offering
a wide range of options to students, both in
the classroom, in their activities, and in their

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
ways — one emphasizes lectures, the other
seminar-type discussions. He favors letting
the student choose between letter grades or
a "pass-fail" system.
Extracurricular activities are usually re
garded as auxiliary to college, but "in opera
tion they have been of primary significance
to many students," Katz reports. Tutoring
the underprivileged, serving in Vista or the
Peace Corps, or other socially oriented proj
ects have often awakened educational inter
est in a growing segment of students, but
most colleges have been unable to incorpor
ate this type of "active education" into their
programs, Katz notes.
Recent housing innovations at Stanford
were praised by Katz because they offer
more diversity and enable students to select
a living arrangement suited to their indivi
dual needs. He found that one of the major
problems in institutions the size of Stanford
and Berkeley is the lack of communication
between the university and the student and
among students themselves. Personalized
dorm units help to create more channels for
communication and interraction, he said.
Self Determination
Katz believes that students should be en
couraged to plan their own type of college
experience as soon as possible.
He adds that colleges should de
vote their best resources and
people to the freshman year.
"Those freshmen who feel ready
to assume independence, even if
it seems a brash independence,
ought to be given it, with the ex
pectation that they will confront
themselves and will be confront
ed with the consequences of mis
taken choices.

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
ways — one emphasizes lectures, the other
seminar-type discussions. He favors letting
the student choose between letter grades or
a "pass-fail" system.
Extracurricular activities are usually re
garded as auxiliary to college, but "in opera
tion they have been of primary significance
to many students," Katz reports. Tutoring
the underprivileged, serving in Vista or the
Peace Corps, or other socially oriented proj
ects have often awakened educational inter
est in a growing segment of students, but
most colleges have been unable to incorpor
ate this type of "active education" into their
programs, Katz notes.
Recent housing innovations at Stanford
were praised by Katz because they offer
more diversity and enable students to select
a living arrangement suited to their indivi
dual needs. He found that one of the major
problems in institutions the size of Stanford
and Berkeley is the lack of communication
between the university and the student and
among students themselves. Personalized
dorm units help to create more channels for
communication and interraction, he said.
Self Determination
Katz believes that students should be en
couraged to plan their own type of college
experience as soon as possible.
He adds that colleges should de
vote their best resources and
people to the freshman year.
"Those freshmen who feel ready
to assume independence, even if
it seems a brash independence,
ought to be given it, with the ex
pectation that they will confront
themselves and will be confront
ed with the consequences of mis
taken choices.
"Mistakes should be made an
occasion for learning," he con
tinued, "rather than of censure
or punishment. Those freshmen
who expect to be told what to
do, graded, and directed ought
to be given this opportunity with
the intent of confronting them
with the consequences of pas
sivity."
Creativity Loss
Many freshmen are faced with
academic values "that are out
of keeping with their status as
adolescents," Katz commented.
This results in a loss of crea
tivity in many cases. "The fresh
man is a much less theoretical
person than he is an ideological

one. He likes to work with great
ideas, comprehensive in scope,
and his ideas are closely related
to his own emotions, confusions,
and gropings ... In the fresh
man year this ideological bent
should be given full chance of
expression. This may go against
the grain of academic orienta
tion."
Students can conform, says
Katz, because their previous
training has already taught them
"what the coin of the realm is."
However, according to Katz, "it
is not what he wants to do, and
he gets the sense that his idea
tional products are unworthy.
He feels humiliated and inept,
and hence, finds it difficult to
connect academic reasoning, and
perhaps thought in general, with
himself. So to some extent, the
colleges themselves produce the
'anti-intellectuals' they complain
about.
Mask of Submissiveness
"We must enlarge the oppor
tunities for the freshmen to act
independently. We constantly
underestimate the intelligence

and autonomy of people of all
ages. We are misguided in part
because in front of teachers, stu
dents often put on masks of sub
missiveness ..."
Katz makes further sugges
tions concerning academic re
quirements, still closely relating
these to individual choice. To
meet the present "core" or "dis
tribution" requirements, Katz
proposes pure lecture courses be
offered without grades and with
only voluntary attendance. Stu
dents would have a chance to
take them at any time during
their four undergraduate years.
While some students will prefer
a more structured educational
program than others, "self-deter
mination ought to be a cardinal
principle from the beginning,"
says Katz.
Small Experiments
Though not advocating adopt
ing these or other changes on
a full-scale, Katz does hope that
colleges could develop them as
smaller, alternative programs.
"Perhaps one of the reasons for
the relative stagnation in higher
education has been the unwit
ting principle that reform ought
to be college-wide," he comments.
"This will allow greater freedom
to experiment, bypass 'political'
objections from the faculty, and
pave the way for eventual easier
adoption of procedures that have
proven themselves by example."
Katz also recommends the de
velopment of an "auxiliary fac
ulty" incorporating "explorers,
archeologists, journalists, busi
nessmen, and government offi
cials" for a short period of time.
In addition, "We should make
it much more possible for stu
dents to be useful to each other.

This might, for instance, be done
by enlisting students for teach
ing other students . . . Such
teaching is not only one of the
best devices of having the stu
dent-teachers learn subject mat
ter, but also would enhance their
self-esteem and sense of pur
pose. These students should be
under the supervision of a pro
fessor who himself would learn
much about the teaching process
through their experience."
New Fle'd
The concept of studying col
lege students and their environ
ment is relatively new, having
been undertaken only in the last
decade, Katz explained. He said
that data collection for this proj
ect began during a period of
new student involvement, and
to some extent information be
comes obsolete within a year. As
an example of changing atti
tudes, he cited the theory of in
loco parentis which was widely
debated in 1963, but is now con
sidered "out of date."
He said that he found Stanford
and Berkeley to be more alike in
many ways than most people ex
pect. "Berkeley has more visible
activity only in an absolute
sense. Stanford can be an equal
shock to an entering student's
values and pre-conceptions." He
added that many of the prob
lems and conflicts of interest ex
perienced by students at both
schools could be traced to the
same factors in their curricula
and living groups.

"For most students, the academic offer
ings of college do not connect adequately
with their own personal motivations," thus
frustrating personel involvement in intellec
tual inquiry, concludes Dr. Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
In the results of a four-year study of stu
dents at Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley released today Katz
emphasized that colleges have failed to capi
talize on the diversity of their students' in
terests and talents. Moreover, many students
"do not learn adequately to connect their
reasoning capacities with the problems they
face in their own development." This causes
major life decisions, including choice of
careers and marriage partners, often to be
made by default, Katz explains.
"For many students the college years do
not bring sufficient opportunity to develop
the non-intellectual parts of their character,"
he adds. "The development of more autono
mous identity, of the capacity of intimate
communication with other people, and of tak
ing responsibility for others is not brought
to the fruitation that most students impli
citly desire but do not know & without furth
er education help — how to bring about."
These findings are the result of a massive

research project which included eight inter
views apiece with 500 students in the 1965
graduating classes of Stanford and Berkeley.
Interviews were conducted periodically dur
ing the students' undergraduate years in
order to give researchers a chance to observe
the development which occurs from the time
a student enters college until he receives his
diploma.
A direct outgrowth of the Mellon Founda
tion research project at Vassar College, this
study is also based on test and questionnaire
data from over 3,000 members of the Class
of 1965. Financed by the Danforth Founda
tion and the U.S. Office of Education, the
project is summarized in a 666-page volume,
Growth and Constraint in Sollege Students,
edited by Katz.
Topics covered include personality devel
opment, student attitudes toward teachers
and curricula, relationships with fellow stu
dents and parents, occupational choice, rela
tionships with fellow students and parents,
occupational choice, and the development of
personal values in college. In addition, spe
cial chapters are devoted to personality char
acteristics of students arrested during the
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 1964
and voting patterns in the 1966 Stanford
elections when David Harris was selected stu
dent body president.
During a period of highly-publicized stu

dent "activism" (1961-1965), the study show
ed that most underrgaduates at Stanford and
Berkeley are primarily concerned with their
own personal development . The college en
vironment is characterized as "a highly con
trolling one ... to the point of stress for
many students. But some individuals have
the psychological equipment not to let the
formal and informal requirements of the
structure interfere with their own individual
development, and they can utilize both the
opportunities and the obstacles of their en
vironment for the purpose of their own
growth.
"At the other extreme are those whose
needs for passivity, for being told what to
do have become so ego-snytonic that the
comfort of orderly security does not make
them experience requirements as either
stressful or inhibiting." Grouped somewhere
in between are the bulk of people "whose
lives never reach an adequate expression of
their potential.' 'The study revealed that thes
students are handicapped by inadequate self
awareness and self-assertion and by "an en
vironment whose demands and constraints"
thwart spontaneity and do not sufficiently eli
cite their potential.
Katz strongly urges colleges to realize
these diverse indiivdual needs of students.
"Educational planning must begin with the
recognition that students differ greatly from

each other, not only in ability and interests,
but also in their purposes, learning styles,
backgrounds, and personalities ..." He feels
that colleges must link these varied ap
proaches and styles to their traditional edu
cation tasks.
Unit of Education
"The starting point is to make the student
the 'unit of education' — not the course, the
interest of the professor, the department, the
graduate or professional school," Katz em
phasizes. Rather than just recording the
number of courses completed in high school,
Katz suggests that colleges develop indivi
dual profiles showing strong personal profi
ciences as well as weaknesses. An individual
plan should then be worked out with each
student, designed to further strengthen those
areas in which his interests persis and to im
prove at least one area in which he shows
initial weakness.
"Establishing and maintaining a student's
profile might require a heavier outlay of aca
demic personnel, particularly on entrance to
college. But there might be an eventual sav
ing, since it would allow the student to be
come much more self-directed than he is
now," he explains.
In an interview with The Daily, Katz was
quick to point out the importance of offering
a wide range of options to students, both in
the classroom, in their activities, and in their

living groups. In classcs he proposes giving
students a choice of studying subjects in two
