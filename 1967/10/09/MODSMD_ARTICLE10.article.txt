# The 						Capitol Scene
## Contrary To Current Rumors, I'm Definitely Not A Candidate 
### Art Buchwald 
It's probably too early to an
nounce it, but I have decided not
to run for the President of the
United States on the Republican
ticket. In so doing I join a long
list of distinguished men who
are also not running for Pres
ident, including Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, Gov. Ronald Rea
gan, Sen. Charles Percy, former
Vive President Richard Nixon
and Gen. James Gavin, who
have all publicly stated they
are not interested in the office.
(Romney still hasn't made up
his mind.)
Like all these men I am ter
ribly embarassed by my many
well-meaning friends and sup
porters who have opened up
campaign headquarters in cities
throughout the country, and I
would like to disassociate myself
from their enthusiasm and ar
dor.
I've done everything possible
to persuade them that I wish to
remain in my present position
where I can do the most good
for the people.
But these supporters refuse to
take no for an answer, and all I
can do is keep denying I am a
candidate for the Presidency
right up until the Republican

convention where I would prob
ably not even accept a draft.
Leading in lowa
It's true that I've been leading
President Johnson in the lowa
polls, but everybody is leading
President Johnson in lowa, so
J must in all modesty say that
although I'm pleased, I'm not
surprised.
There are those who say that
I have accepted speaking en
gagements in all parts of the
country as a method of lining up
delegates. This, of course, is a
dastardly accusation. The only
reason I have been making these
trips is to meet the American
people so they can see what sort
of man they could have had for
President, if I were running for
the office, which I am, of course,
not doing.
Forsaken Values
But at the same time like all
other men who are not running
for the Presidency, I am dis
turbed about the war in Viet
nam, rampant crime in the
streets, wasteful government
spending, the credibility gap and
our hippie youth who have for
saken the true values of the
American way of life.
There are great urban prob
lems to be solved, but let's not

forget the farmer or the old peo
ple on Social Security or our
gallant forest fire fighters.
The question that the Ameri
can people will have to ask in
1968, and I can't answer it be
cause I'm not a candidate, is, are
we moving with the times, or
are we being pushed aside by
tevents that will eventually
smother us and make us a sec
ond-rate power, where the only
thing the Communists under
stand is strength.
I have been asked by those
who put their country above
everything else if I would recon
sider my irrevocable decision not
to run for the presidential nom
ination, and I have told them
that it would be unfair for me
even to consider it when Rocky,
Dick, Ronnie, Charles and Jim
have all announced that they
(were not candidates for the
same office.
So if you get invited to a fund
raising dinner or a political rally
by the "Citizens for Buchwald"
committee, I want you to know
I had nothing to do with it, and
I repudiate their efforts and
would nip the groundswell in
the bud if I only knew how.

list of distinguished men who
are also not running for Pres
ident, including Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, Gov. Ronald Rea
gan, Sen. Charles Percy, former
Vive President Richard Nixon
and Gen. James Gavin, who
have all publicly stated they
are not interested in the office.
(Romney still hasn't made up
his mind.)
Like all these men I am ter
ribly embarassed by my many
well-meaning friends and sup
porters who have opened up
campaign headquarters in cities
throughout the country, and I
would like to disassociate myself
from their enthusiasm and ar
dor.
I've done everything possible
to persuade them that I wish to
remain in my present position
where I can do the most good
for the people.
But these supporters refuse to
take no for an answer, and all I
can do is keep denying I am a
candidate for the Presidency
right up until the Republican

convention where I would prob
ably not even accept a draft.
Leading in lowa
It's true that I've been leading
President Johnson in the lowa
polls, but everybody is leading
President Johnson in lowa, so
J must in all modesty say that
although I'm pleased, I'm not
surprised.
There are those who say that
I have accepted speaking en
gagements in all parts of the
country as a method of lining up
delegates. This, of course, is a
dastardly accusation. The only
reason I have been making these
trips is to meet the American
people so they can see what sort
of man they could have had for
President, if I were running for
the office, which I am, of course,
not doing.
Forsaken Values
But at the same time like all
other men who are not running
for the Presidency, I am dis
turbed about the war in Viet
nam, rampant crime in the
streets, wasteful government
spending, the credibility gap and
our hippie youth who have for
saken the true values of the
American way of life.
There are great urban prob
lems to be solved, but let's not

forget the farmer or the old peo
ple on Social Security or our
gallant forest fire fighters.
The question that the Ameri
can people will have to ask in
1968, and I can't answer it be
cause I'm not a candidate, is, are
we moving with the times, or
are we being pushed aside by
tevents that will eventually
smother us and make us a sec
ond-rate power, where the only
thing the Communists under
stand is strength.
I have been asked by those
who put their country above
everything else if I would recon
sider my irrevocable decision not
to run for the presidential nom
ination, and I have told them
that it would be unfair for me
even to consider it when Rocky,
Dick, Ronnie, Charles and Jim
have all announced that they
(were not candidates for the
same office.
So if you get invited to a fund
raising dinner or a political rally
by the "Citizens for Buchwald"
committee, I want you to know
I had nothing to do with it, and
I repudiate their efforts and
would nip the groundswell in
the bud if I only knew how.
