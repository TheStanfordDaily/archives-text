# Letters To The Editor
## See Here, Mr. Hargrove! 
### 
Editor, The Dally;
Now Hargrove, just stop and
think for a minute. All this
about the Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps (Daily, October 6, p.
2) seems to be a bit of Mis-Guid
ed Miscellany. As it stands now,
the ROTC offers the Stanford
student an alternative to mili
tary service as an enlisted man.
Traditionally, the officer ranks
have included most of our pub
lic leaders, and it seems to me
that since the United States
Army is in no danger of being
eliminated by the Midpeninsula
Free University, we ought to
keep the channels open for the
entry of Stanford students into
the officers' ranks.
Certainly the war in Vietnam
is dreadful and tedious, but then
all wars are. Certainly the final
answer to whether or not we
should be there, if there is one,
is obscured in a tangle of inter
national law and contradictory
public rhetoric.
Hold The Line
The one thing that is certain
is that those holding the great
est responsibility for our in
volvement in Vietnam sincerely
believe, despite possible politi
cal suicide, that it is in our best
interests to hold the line there.
This is not America Right or
Wrong. We're living in a hostile
world, and it is a difficult thing
to accept the necessity for prac
tices that are alien to our prin
ciples, such as defoliation, in
terrogation using force, so-called
pinpoint bombing (which admit
tedly often kills North Vietnam
ese citizens, as the Viet Cong
terrorist attacks in the South
kill South Vietnamese, without
any attempt to spare civilians),
managed news, and most of all
killing.
Traditionally, American dissen
ters have often reached heights
of reason and understanding
from which they have changed
the course of the nation. Dig
nity, respect for those who hon
estly believe in what they pro
fess, common sense and an open
mind supplied with all the facts
available were most often the
tools used.
Flower power, wistfully beau
tiful as it is sometimes, will not
long be granted a place in the
arena of realities.
When we reach the extreme
of trying to characterize mili
tary commanders as warm
blooded man-killing machines in
an attempt to discredit the mili
tary training in the colleges and
universities, we've fallen victim
to shameful excess.
One can almost und-rstand
why the Department of Military
Science is not eager to open Its
enrollment to the militant dis
senter. I have little faith in the
willingness of those protestors
to avoid disrupting the class or
impeding its progress.
Aware Of Decision
The military science class
room is simply not the place for
dialogue of that type; many
forums are available, but the
job of Military Science is to
train officer candidates. These
students enrolled in the ROTC
program are quite aware of the
moral decision involved in serv
ing in the military; they don't
need someone to remind them.
The central matter is the con
tinuation or the abolishment of
officer training at Stanford. I
should think that, as long as the
Army and its training programs
will certainly prevail, those op
posed might do well to keep the
institution close at hand here in
the University.
At least then, perhaps, can
we observe the process, hope
fully in an orderly manner
befitting the responsibilities
placed the students here at
Stanford.

• A Moral Question
Editor, the Daily:
Perhaps it is just a matter of
semantics, but in the article,
ROTC Doesn't Belong," Chris
topher Hargrove makes a num
ber of rather leading and ambig
uous statements.
I agree with him that students
outside of the ROTC program
should have the opportunity to
take courses which are solely

offered in the military sciences
(Thank you, Dan. B.), but what
is the implication of his state
ment "Why the Reserve Officer
Training Corps was ever allowed
into the University in the first
place has never really been
clear?"
After reading further into the
article it appears as though Mr.
Hargrove has singularly pro
jected throughout his critique
the belief that the ROTC is a di
rect manifestation of the war in
Vietnam and, consequently,
should be abolished from this
campus. Is this the sole object
of ROTC? Is Stanford's adminis
tration a war-mongering one be
cause they allow the program to
exist?
Who's To Say
As is the case in most argu
ments directly or indirectly con
cerning the war in Vietnam, the
question of morals inevitably
arises. But who is to say finally
what an individual's morals are
to be?
Morals are not absolutistic and
no institution, whether church or
state, has the authority to estab
lish a hard, inflexible code of
morals by which the individual
is to judge himself, yet Mr. Har
grove places himself in this ab
solutistic position when he
makes mention of "the moral de
cision you (as an ROTC student)
have probably forfeited."
Replacement
Are the morals of Mr. Har
grove, which he has projected in
such a god-like manner onto all
ROTC students, necessarily the
only ones by which they must
gauge their actions? Is that sys
tem, which so many contend is
highly reflective of the inflexible
and absolutistic society they live
in and which Mr. Hargrove ob
viously wishes to amend, to be
replaced by one of his own which
is equally bigoted?
The decision of whether ROTC
has a place within the frame
work of this University is the re
sponsibility of the entire com
munity and should be considered
in that whole context, and not
from an "absolute," "fundamen
tal" point of view.

• Classified Section
Editor, the Daily:
I write to invite your attention
and that of your readers to a
rather serious error that ap
peared in your otherwise careful
coverage of the recent report to
the Academic Council on classi
fied research.
Your story in Friday's edition
attributed to me the statement
that "about two dozen contracts
. . . may be called 'classified,'
meaning the scientific work and
results cannot be made public."
You go on to sav in the next para
graph that "The committee de
fined a classified prolect as one
where a researcher would need
a security clearance to visit a
professional colleague to discuss
his work."
Neither of the foregoing state
ments is quite accurate. The Aca
demic Council has adopted a very
broad definition of the term
"classified contract" so as to as
sure that every contract affected
in any way by security classifi
cation will come to the Commit
tee for review. A contract is de
fined as classified if it is neces
sary that any person who works
on it hold a security clearance.
Usual Publication
Within the meaning of this
broad definition it is true that
there are about two dozen "classi
fied contracts," but it is by no
means true that there are two
dozen contracts involving re
search whose fruits cannot be
made public. On the contrary, in
the vast majority of those two
dozen instances either all of the
results of the investigation, or
very nearly all of those results,
will be published in the usual
way.
Let me illustrate: One contract
provides a summer program for
work in aeronautics. The partici
pants need security clearance to
have physical access to classified
laboratories at Ames Research
Center where they do their ex
perimental work. The contract
therefore is defined as classified;
but classified information is not
used in their research and all of
the results of the research done

under the program is published
each year.
There are a number of con
tracts of this type where access,
and therefore clearance, is neces
sary for reasons tangential to the
research itself, and where the
fruits of the research are entirely
unclassified.
Specific Classification
In another large group of con
tracts the sponsoring entities are
interested in a line of compara
tively basic research because cer
tain specific applications of it are
important to them. In these cases
the results of the basic investi
gation will not be classified, but
the small portion of the work
that is devoted to the specific ap
plications may be.
In still other instances clear
ance is necessary so that the re
searcher may familiarize himself
with the results of classified re
search done elsewhere on a sim
ilar problem merely to assure
that he does not needlessly dupli
cate experiments that have
already been conducted. Here,
too, the fruits of the investigat
or's work generally will be
wholly unclassified.
In short, no such extensive re
striction on dissemination of the
fruits of investigation attends
the fact that, under the very
broad definition adopted, the con
tract is classified.

• We Are Sad
Editor, the Daily:
It is sad that LASSU, during
its first meeting, would fall to
the level of petty and incom
plete disputations concerning
NSA. It is sadder still that Miss
Ackerley failed to record accu
rately who said what. Miss Gail
Kitaji spoke in defense of NSA,
though somewhat disjointedly.
Miss Herwig, while her opinions
of LASSU may be similar, lim
ited her action on the floor of
LASSU to giving the Speaker
instruction in the operation of
the tape recorder.

• Beta's Thanks
Editor, the Dally:
I feel it is appropriate at this
time to thank those people who
were so closely concerned with
the typhoid outbreak here at
Beta House.
Initially, it was Dr. Rodney
Beard, Professor of Preventive
Medicine at Stanford, who
spear-headed an epidemiological
analysis which proved to be
vital in terms of finding the
source and eventually control
ling the epidemic itself. A board,
headed by Dr. Beard, including
Drs. Osborne and McClenahan
from the Stanford Health Cen
ter, Dr. Bolton from the Calif
ornia State Department of Pub
lic Health, and Hal Wilson, the
Health Officer for Stanford, was
the moving force behind the in
vestigation.
The medical attention received
was superb, largely a result of
the hard-working efforts of the
chief nurse Mrs. Sanders, her
staff, and the doctors. The high
spirits of the receptionists, sec
retaries, and even the harpies
(blood takers) contributed to
the uncommonly high morale
in the Infirmary.
We are also indebted to the
entire office of the Dean of Stu
dents who helped us in commu
nicating with our instructors
throughout the outbreak.
To all of these people we of
the Beta House are forever
grateful.

• So Who Counts?
Editor, the Daily:
In the Daily article concern
ing the arrest of the Grateful
Dead, a "familiar 12-letter epi
thet" was mentioned. After sev
eral minutes of thought we
were able to recall 11 "familiar
12-letter epithets". We now ask
for a hint.
