# Another Attempt
## Our Side's Pride Turns Tide 
### Herbie Hinckes 
"Why don't you join ROTC?"
Simon Sellout asked his room
mate, Milton Pallid.
"Well, I don't know," Pallid
answered. "Ever since you join
ed, you been after me to join up,
but I just don't know ..."
"It's a lot of fun, Miltie, you
ought to come to one of our
drills sometime and watch us
march around the soccer field.
You'd be pretty proud of your
country if you did."
"I already did. All I saw was
a bunch of college students in
Army unifiorms going in all dif
ferent directions. But if you say
it's fun, I'll believe you."
Ebb, Tide
"Miltie, it's not only the drills
that make it worthwhile. I've
learned all about military tac
tics too. It's men like me that
will save this country from the
tide of International Commu
nism."
"Well, I heard the tide was
coming, but I'm not a surfer
so I didn't pay any attention to
it." Pallid scratched his head.
"You're sure that learning about
military tactics is interesting?"
"Better believe it. The books
don't really say anything inter
esting, but Major Garbage told
us last Friday how to kill with
our bare hands."

"With your bare hands? I
didn't know that was possible.
Maybe this ROTC stuff is aca
demic alter all. But some of my
friends say they don't teach you
how to think." Pallid smiled.
"Of course I didn't know how to
think when came here, so why
should I know how to think
when I leave?"
"That's right, Miltie," Sellout
agreed quickly. "And besides if
you want to get into the Awful
Krappa Lambdas, you have to
join ROTC anyway."
"That's the intellectual frater
nity, isn't it?" Pallid queried.
"Yeah, I wouldn't mind being in
that at all, people might think I
was an intellectual. But don't
the officers give you a lot of
heat at the drills?"
Happy Home I-ife
"Look, it's just one big happy
family. Sure, sometimes you
have to stay up all night polish
ing your shoes, but it's all just
one big happy family."
"Polishing shoes? What does
that have to do with marching?
Don't they get dirty anyway
when you march through the
dirt?"
"Don't make such a big deal
out of polishing shoes. They al
ways get dirty, but I really en
joy polishing them. It's helpful

for later life, too. Just think,
when you get a job with some
big business firm, you're going
to have to have your shoes pol
ished everyday, aren't you?"
"Well, I never thought of it
that way," Pallid answered, look
ing at his own shoes, still green
with grass stains after his last
frolic in the Roble bushes.
Un-Automated
"And besides, Miltie, once you
become a second lieutenant, you
won't be part of the man-killing
machine."
"I won't?" Pallid asked, com
pletely dumbfounded.
"No, roomie, you'll be an offi
cer and a gentleman. There's a
difference, you know."
"I do?"
Status!
"Sure, you'll make a lot of
money, you'll get to go out with
generals' daughters, and you'll
have status."
'That's a thought. I wouldn't
mind going out with those gen
erals' daughters," Pallid mused
as he thought back to the Roble
bushes again. "But Simon, are
you sure there are any generals'
daughters in Saigon?"
Don't be silly, Miltie, there
aren't even any generals in Sai
gon. But remember that you'll
be too busy defending the Amer-

lean Way of Life in Vietnam to
worry about sex."
Proud Swells
"Oh. I didn't realize that. I
thought the American Way of
Life was connected with sex ..
"Doesn't your breast swell up
with pride when you see the
American flag go marching by?"
"Actually, ..."
"And don't you feel like a full
American when you hear about
another American victory in
Vietnam?"
"Well, maybe I don't hear all
the news ..."
'Ask What You Can D 0...'
"I really get excited when I'm
out on the drill field and Major
Garbage calls us to attention and
the American flag marches by.
I tell you, Miltie, if I hadn't join
ed ROTC, I wouldn't think that
I had done enough for my coun
try.
"We're going to make Viet
nam a free country if we have
to pave it over and send in 10
million troops. That's the great
thing about the U.S., if anyone
gets in its way, they wind up
paying for it."
"Who, the U.S. or the Vietna
mese?" Pallid asked.
Sellout nervously inspected
Pallid's face. "Say," he said,
"did you forget to shave this
morning?"
