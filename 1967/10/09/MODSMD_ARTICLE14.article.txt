# Post Office Grant For SRI Study
## 
### 
The Post Office Department
has awarded a $597,00 contract
to Stanford Research Institute
for a long-range study of the
nation's entire mail handling
system with an eye to devising
new methods of speeding mail
flow.
Already flooded with some 80-
billion pieces of mail a year and
facing a 3-4 billion increase every
year, the Post Office Department
is looking for new and effective
approaches to the tremendous
problem of sorting and deliver
ing this mail.
One approach SRI will investi
gate is containerization of bulk
mail. Mail with the same destina
. tion will be united into discrete
bundles for more effective dis
patch and elimination of the
need for multiple handling of
individual pieces of mail. The
findings of the study will be used

in developing a new family of
containers and materials-handl
ing equipment that will facili
tate the rapid unit loading and
unloading of mail.
The SRI study team will also
attempt to develop a computer
"model" of the entire mail-handl
ing system. By manipulation of
this "model," researchers will ob
serve the effects of various
changes in procedures, transport
methods and volume flow. Solu
tions to mail handling problems
can be worked out with a mini
mum of live experimentation in
an actual postal facility, a costly
procedure and one that disrupts
normal mail-handling operations.
