# Tribe Taste Of Southern Cal's O.J.--Bitter
## 
### NICK SELBY 
O. J. Simpson is the greatest
college running back in the
country.
That's what Stanford's foot
ball team must have been think
ing after it lost to the USC Tro
jans Saturday night 30-0 in the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
Simpson put on another fan
tastic performance, carrying the
ball 29 times for 160 net yards
and a 5.54 average. Although
he did not score himself, he
threw for a TD and his constant
gains helped set up the others.
Earl The Pearl
The Trojan's back's efforts
were equaled by Earl McCul
louch, USC's split end, who
caught seven passes for 122
yards and two touchdowns.
His battery mate Steve Sogge
quarterbacked an offense which
netted 460 yards for the night.
McCullouch was tabbed line
man of the game for his efforts,

while Simpson won every vote
for back of thu* game.
Simpson's size (205 lbs.) and
9.4 speed made him a threat all
night, as countless times he ap
peared stopped by the Stanford
defense but slipped free for
additional yardage.
Forced To Punt
Stanford started with a deter
mined defense after USC won
the toss and elected to receive.
Twice the Cards forced the Tro
jans to punt the ball.
Stanford was also unable to
move the ball twice. Halfway
through the first quarter the
Trojans got the ball on their 27.
Simpson carried four times
for 21, fullback Mike Hull added
five, and a 15 yard personal foul
penalty against Stanford line
backer Pat Preston put the Tro
jans on the Card 35.
Secondary Collapses
The Stanford defense steadied
and the Trojans had a fourth

and five situation on the Card 28.
But on that play, the Stanford
secondary collapsed completely.
McCullouch slipped past every
one and a poised Steve Sogge
fired the ball to him for the
score. The nearest Card defend
er was 15 yards away.
Rikki Aldridge's kick was
good, putting the Trojans ahead
7-0 after 10:13 of the first quar
ter.
Cards Almost Come Back
It appeared as though Stan
ford would come right back to
even the score. Nate Kirtman
took a pitchout from Card quar
terback Mark Marquess and
raced around left end for 39
yards.
A play later, Kirtman went for
seven more, and successive
plunges by fullback Jack Root
earned a first down on the 27.
But Trojan halfback Mike Bat
tle leaped high for an over
thrown Marquess pass on the
next play for an interception to
end the Tribe drive.
It was the first of two inter
ceptions by battle. His second,
with 50 seconds left in the first
half, also ended a Card drive.
Cards' Goal Line Stand
The Trojans launched another
drive in the second quarter,
which went 79 yards in 13 plays
and ended on the one yard line.
USC was unable to score with
a first and goal situation on
the ten. Linebacker Preston, a
sophomore, was credited with
three tackles during the goal
line stand.
Stanford was again unable to
move the ball, and Bob Reinhard
had to punt from the end of the
endzone. USC got the ball on the
Card 47.
McColluch's Second
Simpson renewed the pressure
with an 18 yard sprint around
left end for a first down. Earl
McCullouch then ran a perfect
curl-in pattern and took a Sogge
pass on the ten for the score.
Two Card defenders, Bob Rink
er and Dick Oliver, just missed
knocking the ball down.
Aldridge converted again to
make it 14-0.
Chuck Williams replaced Mar
quess as the Tribe went to its
alternate game plan of throw
ing the ball. Williams hit flanker
Gene Washington on a slant
over the middle good for 47
yards.
Intentional Grounding
Williams hit Washington again
for ten yards on a buttonhook,
and the Cards had a first down
on the 17.
However, Williams was called
for intentionally grounding the
ball on the next play, which

meant five yards from the site
of the penalty and loss of down.
The 17 yard loss came despite
the fact the Williams had a re
ceiver in the general direction he
threw the ball.
Williams completed two short
passes, but did not get a first
down. Battle's second intercep
tion killed the drive and the half
ended.
No Rousing Start
Stanford began the second half
under anything but a head of
steam and had to punt after
three plays. USC then controlled

the ball for 14 plays, going 35
yards before the Card defense
stiffened and ended the drive.
USC got the ball back after
the Cards made a first down on
a roughing the kicker penalty.
Again the Tribe defense stiffen
ed near the goal line, forcing Al
dridge to kick a 26 yard field
goal.
Fourth Quarter Scores
USC scored twice in the fourth
quarter, the first coming on a
nine yard pass from Simpson
to halfback Steve Dale after 2:29
had elasped.
USC scored again with 50 sec
onds left in the game when Toby
Page, who replaced Sogge at the
controls, quarterback - sneaked
the final yard.
Aldridge missed his first con
version of the year, making the
final score 30-0.
Ralston Laments
Tribe coach John Ralston un
derstandably was not very hap
py after the game. "We got whip
ped, everyway you can get lick
ed," he lamented.
"We had some moments in
the first half — the two oppor
tunities to score and goal line
stand — I'm proud of everyone
on the team. But I'm disap
pointed in our inability to score,"
he concluded.

Sogge. Neither contestant reached the ball. USC shutout the Indians 30-0 Saturday night in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
O. J. Simpson is the greatest
college running back in the
country.
That's what Stanford's foot
ball team must have been think
ing after it lost to the USC Tro
jans Saturday night 30-0 in the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
Simpson put on another fan
tastic performance, carrying the
ball 29 times for 160 net yards
and a 5.54 average. Although
he did not score himself, he
threw for a TD and his constant
gains helped set up the others.
Earl The Pearl
The Trojan's back's efforts
were equaled by Earl McCul
louch, USC's split end, who
caught seven passes for 122
yards and two touchdowns.
His battery mate Steve Sogge
quarterbacked an offense which
netted 460 yards for the night.
McCullouch was tabbed line
man of the game for his efforts,

while Simpson won every vote
for back of thu* game.
Simpson's size (205 lbs.) and
9.4 speed made him a threat all
night, as countless times he ap
peared stopped by the Stanford
defense but slipped free for
additional yardage.
Forced To Punt
Stanford started with a deter
mined defense after USC won
the toss and elected to receive.
Twice the Cards forced the Tro
jans to punt the ball.
Stanford was also unable to
move the ball twice. Halfway
through the first quarter the
Trojans got the ball on their 27.
Simpson carried four times
for 21, fullback Mike Hull added
five, and a 15 yard personal foul
penalty against Stanford line
backer Pat Preston put the Tro
jans on the Card 35.
Secondary Collapses
The Stanford defense steadied
and the Trojans had a fourth

and five situation on the Card 28.
But on that play, the Stanford
secondary collapsed completely.
McCullouch slipped past every
one and a poised Steve Sogge
fired the ball to him for the
score. The nearest Card defend
er was 15 yards away.
Rikki Aldridge's kick was
good, putting the Trojans ahead
7-0 after 10:13 of the first quar
ter.
Cards Almost Come Back
It appeared as though Stan
ford would come right back to
even the score. Nate Kirtman
took a pitchout from Card quar
terback Mark Marquess and
raced around left end for 39
yards.
A play later, Kirtman went for
seven more, and successive
plunges by fullback Jack Root
earned a first down on the 27.
But Trojan halfback Mike Bat
tle leaped high for an over
thrown Marquess pass on the
next play for an interception to
end the Tribe drive.
It was the first of two inter
ceptions by battle. His second,
with 50 seconds left in the first
half, also ended a Card drive.
Cards' Goal Line Stand
The Trojans launched another
drive in the second quarter,
which went 79 yards in 13 plays
and ended on the one yard line.
USC was unable to score with
a first and goal situation on
the ten. Linebacker Preston, a
sophomore, was credited with
three tackles during the goal
line stand.
Stanford was again unable to
move the ball, and Bob Reinhard
had to punt from the end of the
endzone. USC got the ball on the
Card 47.
McColluch's Second
Simpson renewed the pressure
with an 18 yard sprint around
left end for a first down. Earl
McCullouch then ran a perfect
curl-in pattern and took a Sogge
pass on the ten for the score.
Two Card defenders, Bob Rink
er and Dick Oliver, just missed
knocking the ball down.
Aldridge converted again to
make it 14-0.
Chuck Williams replaced Mar
quess as the Tribe went to its
alternate game plan of throw
ing the ball. Williams hit flanker
Gene Washington on a slant
over the middle good for 47
yards.
Intentional Grounding
Williams hit Washington again
for ten yards on a buttonhook,
and the Cards had a first down
on the 17.
However, Williams was called
for intentionally grounding the
ball on the next play, which

meant five yards from the site
of the penalty and loss of down.
The 17 yard loss came despite
the fact the Williams had a re
ceiver in the general direction he
threw the ball.
Williams completed two short
passes, but did not get a first
down. Battle's second intercep
tion killed the drive and the half
ended.
No Rousing Start
Stanford began the second half
under anything but a head of
steam and had to punt after
three plays. USC then controlled

the ball for 14 plays, going 35
yards before the Card defense
stiffened and ended the drive.
USC got the ball back after
the Cards made a first down on
a roughing the kicker penalty.
Again the Tribe defense stiffen
ed near the goal line, forcing Al
dridge to kick a 26 yard field
goal.
Fourth Quarter Scores
USC scored twice in the fourth
quarter, the first coming on a
nine yard pass from Simpson
to halfback Steve Dale after 2:29
had elasped.
USC scored again with 50 sec
onds left in the game when Toby
Page, who replaced Sogge at the
controls, quarterback - sneaked
the final yard.
Aldridge missed his first con
version of the year, making the
final score 30-0.
Ralston Laments
Tribe coach John Ralston un
derstandably was not very hap
py after the game. "We got whip
ped, everyway you can get lick
ed," he lamented.
"We had some moments in
the first half — the two oppor
tunities to score and goal line
stand — I'm proud of everyone
on the team. But I'm disap
pointed in our inability to score,"
he concluded.

THE BOLSHOI?: Stanford safety Bob Rinker (10) and USC halfback Jim Lawrence (28) appear to
be taking ballet parts as they stretch toward a pass from the golden arm of Trojan quarterback Steve
Sogge. Neither contestant reached the ball. USC shutout the Indians 30-0 Saturday night in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
O. J. Simpson is the greatest
college running back in the
country.
That's what Stanford's foot
ball team must have been think
ing after it lost to the USC Tro
jans Saturday night 30-0 in the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
Simpson put on another fan
tastic performance, carrying the
ball 29 times for 160 net yards
and a 5.54 average. Although
he did not score himself, he
threw for a TD and his constant
gains helped set up the others.
Earl The Pearl
The Trojan's back's efforts
were equaled by Earl McCul
louch, USC's split end, who
caught seven passes for 122
yards and two touchdowns.
His battery mate Steve Sogge
quarterbacked an offense which
netted 460 yards for the night.
McCullouch was tabbed line
man of the game for his efforts,

while Simpson won every vote
for back of thu* game.
Simpson's size (205 lbs.) and
9.4 speed made him a threat all
night, as countless times he ap
peared stopped by the Stanford
defense but slipped free for
additional yardage.
Forced To Punt
Stanford started with a deter
mined defense after USC won
the toss and elected to receive.
Twice the Cards forced the Tro
jans to punt the ball.
Stanford was also unable to
move the ball twice. Halfway
through the first quarter the
Trojans got the ball on their 27.
Simpson carried four times
for 21, fullback Mike Hull added
five, and a 15 yard personal foul
penalty against Stanford line
backer Pat Preston put the Tro
jans on the Card 35.
Secondary Collapses
The Stanford defense steadied
and the Trojans had a fourth

and five situation on the Card 28.
But on that play, the Stanford
secondary collapsed completely.
McCullouch slipped past every
one and a poised Steve Sogge
fired the ball to him for the
score. The nearest Card defend
er was 15 yards away.
Rikki Aldridge's kick was
good, putting the Trojans ahead
7-0 after 10:13 of the first quar
ter.
Cards Almost Come Back
It appeared as though Stan
ford would come right back to
even the score. Nate Kirtman
took a pitchout from Card quar
terback Mark Marquess and
raced around left end for 39
yards.
A play later, Kirtman went for
seven more, and successive
plunges by fullback Jack Root
earned a first down on the 27.
But Trojan halfback Mike Bat
tle leaped high for an over
thrown Marquess pass on the
next play for an interception to
end the Tribe drive.
It was the first of two inter
ceptions by battle. His second,
with 50 seconds left in the first
half, also ended a Card drive.
Cards' Goal Line Stand
The Trojans launched another
drive in the second quarter,
which went 79 yards in 13 plays
and ended on the one yard line.
USC was unable to score with
a first and goal situation on
the ten. Linebacker Preston, a
sophomore, was credited with
three tackles during the goal
line stand.
Stanford was again unable to
move the ball, and Bob Reinhard
had to punt from the end of the
endzone. USC got the ball on the
Card 47.
McColluch's Second
Simpson renewed the pressure
with an 18 yard sprint around
left end for a first down. Earl
McCullouch then ran a perfect
curl-in pattern and took a Sogge
pass on the ten for the score.
Two Card defenders, Bob Rink
er and Dick Oliver, just missed
knocking the ball down.
Aldridge converted again to
make it 14-0.
Chuck Williams replaced Mar
quess as the Tribe went to its
alternate game plan of throw
ing the ball. Williams hit flanker
Gene Washington on a slant
over the middle good for 47
yards.
Intentional Grounding
Williams hit Washington again
for ten yards on a buttonhook,
and the Cards had a first down
on the 17.
However, Williams was called
for intentionally grounding the
ball on the next play, which

meant five yards from the site
of the penalty and loss of down.
The 17 yard loss came despite
the fact the Williams had a re
ceiver in the general direction he
threw the ball.
Williams completed two short
passes, but did not get a first
down. Battle's second intercep
tion killed the drive and the half
ended.
No Rousing Start
Stanford began the second half
under anything but a head of
steam and had to punt after
three plays. USC then controlled

the ball for 14 plays, going 35
yards before the Card defense
stiffened and ended the drive.
USC got the ball back after
the Cards made a first down on
a roughing the kicker penalty.
Again the Tribe defense stiffen
ed near the goal line, forcing Al
dridge to kick a 26 yard field
goal.
Fourth Quarter Scores
USC scored twice in the fourth
quarter, the first coming on a
nine yard pass from Simpson
to halfback Steve Dale after 2:29
had elasped.
USC scored again with 50 sec
onds left in the game when Toby
Page, who replaced Sogge at the
controls, quarterback - sneaked
the final yard.
Aldridge missed his first con
version of the year, making the
final score 30-0.
Ralston Laments
Tribe coach John Ralston un
derstandably was not very hap
py after the game. "We got whip
ped, everyway you can get lick
ed," he lamented.
"We had some moments in
the first half — the two oppor
tunities to score and goal line
stand — I'm proud of everyone
on the team. But I'm disap
pointed in our inability to score,"
he concluded.

THE BOLSHOI?: Stanford safety Bob Rinker (10) and USC halfback Jim Lawrence (28) appear to
be taking ballet parts as they stretch toward a pass from the golden arm of Trojan quarterback Steve
Sogge. Neither contestant reached the ball. USC shutout the Indians 30-0 Saturday night in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
O. J. Simpson is the greatest
college running back in the
country.
That's what Stanford's foot
ball team must have been think
ing after it lost to the USC Tro
jans Saturday night 30-0 in the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
Simpson put on another fan
tastic performance, carrying the
ball 29 times for 160 net yards
and a 5.54 average. Although
he did not score himself, he
threw for a TD and his constant
gains helped set up the others.
Earl The Pearl
The Trojan's back's efforts
were equaled by Earl McCul
louch, USC's split end, who
caught seven passes for 122
yards and two touchdowns.
His battery mate Steve Sogge
quarterbacked an offense which
netted 460 yards for the night.
McCullouch was tabbed line
man of the game for his efforts,

while Simpson won every vote
for back of thu* game.
Simpson's size (205 lbs.) and
9.4 speed made him a threat all
night, as countless times he ap
peared stopped by the Stanford
defense but slipped free for
additional yardage.
Forced To Punt
Stanford started with a deter
mined defense after USC won
the toss and elected to receive.
Twice the Cards forced the Tro
jans to punt the ball.
Stanford was also unable to
move the ball twice. Halfway
through the first quarter the
Trojans got the ball on their 27.
Simpson carried four times
for 21, fullback Mike Hull added
five, and a 15 yard personal foul
penalty against Stanford line
backer Pat Preston put the Tro
jans on the Card 35.
Secondary Collapses
The Stanford defense steadied
and the Trojans had a fourth

and five situation on the Card 28.
But on that play, the Stanford
secondary collapsed completely.
McCullouch slipped past every
one and a poised Steve Sogge
fired the ball to him for the
score. The nearest Card defend
er was 15 yards away.
Rikki Aldridge's kick was
good, putting the Trojans ahead
7-0 after 10:13 of the first quar
ter.
Cards Almost Come Back
It appeared as though Stan
ford would come right back to
even the score. Nate Kirtman
took a pitchout from Card quar
terback Mark Marquess and
raced around left end for 39
yards.
A play later, Kirtman went for
seven more, and successive
plunges by fullback Jack Root
earned a first down on the 27.
But Trojan halfback Mike Bat
tle leaped high for an over
thrown Marquess pass on the
next play for an interception to
end the Tribe drive.
It was the first of two inter
ceptions by battle. His second,
with 50 seconds left in the first
half, also ended a Card drive.
Cards' Goal Line Stand
The Trojans launched another
drive in the second quarter,
which went 79 yards in 13 plays
and ended on the one yard line.
USC was unable to score with
a first and goal situation on
the ten. Linebacker Preston, a
sophomore, was credited with
three tackles during the goal
line stand.
Stanford was again unable to
move the ball, and Bob Reinhard
had to punt from the end of the
endzone. USC got the ball on the
Card 47.
McColluch's Second
Simpson renewed the pressure
with an 18 yard sprint around
left end for a first down. Earl
McCullouch then ran a perfect
curl-in pattern and took a Sogge
pass on the ten for the score.
Two Card defenders, Bob Rink
er and Dick Oliver, just missed
knocking the ball down.
Aldridge converted again to
make it 14-0.
Chuck Williams replaced Mar
quess as the Tribe went to its
alternate game plan of throw
ing the ball. Williams hit flanker
Gene Washington on a slant
over the middle good for 47
yards.
Intentional Grounding
Williams hit Washington again
for ten yards on a buttonhook,
and the Cards had a first down
on the 17.
However, Williams was called
for intentionally grounding the
ball on the next play, which

meant five yards from the site
of the penalty and loss of down.
The 17 yard loss came despite
the fact the Williams had a re
ceiver in the general direction he
threw the ball.
Williams completed two short
passes, but did not get a first
down. Battle's second intercep
tion killed the drive and the half
ended.
No Rousing Start
Stanford began the second half
under anything but a head of
steam and had to punt after
three plays. USC then controlled

the ball for 14 plays, going 35
yards before the Card defense
stiffened and ended the drive.
USC got the ball back after
the Cards made a first down on
a roughing the kicker penalty.
Again the Tribe defense stiffen
ed near the goal line, forcing Al
dridge to kick a 26 yard field
goal.
Fourth Quarter Scores
USC scored twice in the fourth
quarter, the first coming on a
nine yard pass from Simpson
to halfback Steve Dale after 2:29
had elasped.
USC scored again with 50 sec
onds left in the game when Toby
Page, who replaced Sogge at the
controls, quarterback - sneaked
the final yard.
Aldridge missed his first con
version of the year, making the
final score 30-0.
Ralston Laments
Tribe coach John Ralston un
derstandably was not very hap
py after the game. "We got whip
ped, everyway you can get lick
ed," he lamented.
"We had some moments in
the first half — the two oppor
tunities to score and goal line
stand — I'm proud of everyone
on the team. But I'm disap
pointed in our inability to score,"
he concluded.
