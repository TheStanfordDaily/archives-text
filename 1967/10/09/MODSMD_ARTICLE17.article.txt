# Cal Squeezes Past Stanford Booters
## 
### 
A lucky shot was all that en
abled heavily favored Cal to de
feat the Indians 2-1 in their ex
siting soccer match at Stanford
Saturday.
The Bears were awarded a
free shot early in the third pe
riod. The ball was hit towards
the sideline but bounced off the
head of an Indian halfback into
the goal.
That put the Cal rooters ahead
2-0, but the Indians continued to
press them for the rest of the
game.
Cal Scores First
The first period of the game
was a defensive match with
neither team breaking into the
scoring column. The Bears drew
first blood, however, in the sec
ond period.
From then until halftime the
score remained 1-0.
Immediately after the half
time break the Bears scored on
the freak shot. The Cards prov
ed to be undisturbed by the bad
break, and proceeded to march
right back down the field to
score.
A cross shot from Paul Silva
to Dann Boyd resulted in the In
dians' lone tally of the day.
From that point on the pres
sure was on the Bears, who were
attempting to maintain an eleven
game winning streak.
The Cards, sparked by Bob
Adams, Larry Holmgren, and
Boyd, however, just couldn't
manage to put the ball in.
Coach Priddle, in reference to

a comment made by Cal's coach
prior to the game, said, "They
didn't win on conditioning; they
won on a lucky shot."
The Cal coach had suspected
Stanford would not be in shape.
Freshmen Win
The freshmen team added
some good news to the soccer
picture with an 8-2 victory over
the Cal frosh.
The Papoose booters had the
Bears 6-0 at halftime.
The star for the Indian's was
Carlos Quintana, little brother of
varsity fullback Manny Quin
tana, who put in four goals from
his center forward position.

UP IN THE AIR: The fate of the Stanford-Cal soccer game last Sat
urday is literally up in the air as the Cal goalie and Stanford co
captain Dann Boyd leap for the ball in front of the Cal goal. The
goalie managed to knock the ball away with his hand. Boyd, trying
here to head it in, scored the Tribe's only goal in the 2-1 loss.
A lucky shot was all that en
abled heavily favored Cal to de
feat the Indians 2-1 in their ex
siting soccer match at Stanford
Saturday.
The Bears were awarded a
free shot early in the third pe
riod. The ball was hit towards
the sideline but bounced off the
head of an Indian halfback into
the goal.
That put the Cal rooters ahead
2-0, but the Indians continued to
press them for the rest of the
game.
Cal Scores First
The first period of the game
was a defensive match with
neither team breaking into the
scoring column. The Bears drew
first blood, however, in the sec
ond period.
From then until halftime the
score remained 1-0.
Immediately after the half
time break the Bears scored on
the freak shot. The Cards prov
ed to be undisturbed by the bad
break, and proceeded to march
right back down the field to
score.
A cross shot from Paul Silva
to Dann Boyd resulted in the In
dians' lone tally of the day.
From that point on the pres
sure was on the Bears, who were
attempting to maintain an eleven
game winning streak.
The Cards, sparked by Bob
Adams, Larry Holmgren, and
Boyd, however, just couldn't
manage to put the ball in.
Coach Priddle, in reference to

a comment made by Cal's coach
prior to the game, said, "They
didn't win on conditioning; they
won on a lucky shot."
