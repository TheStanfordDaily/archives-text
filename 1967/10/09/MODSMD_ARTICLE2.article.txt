# Changes In College Youth
## Sterling Talks To Parents 
### 
President Wallace Sterling
told a Parents' Day audience Sat
urday that Stanford could not do
in four years what family and
home had failed to accomplish
in 18, and therefore university
life was no threat to the new stu
dents.
The 900 parents of freshmen
heard the President discuss the
effects of the school on the enter
ing students, and comment on
the nature of this period of "un
precedented change."
Other speakers were Provost
Richard Lyman, Assistant Pro
fesor of History and advisor to
conscientious objectors Paul S.
Seaver, Executive Head and Pro
fessor of Biology Donald Ken
nedy, Associate Head and Pro
fessor of Electrical Engineering
Ralph J. Smith, and Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier.
Instigator Of Change
Sterling pointed out that the
university must be an instigator
of change, since it is the creator
of new things.
"Every knowledge explosion
in history," said the President,
"has made the status quo inse
cure." He used the Renaissance,
the Industrial Revolution, and
Darwinism as illustrations of
his point.
According to Sterling, the uni
versity is a moderator between
extremes, a selector of new val

ues which puts all ideas to the
test called proof.
Provost Lyman also spoke,
commenting on the severe need
for English instruction for all
freshman students, calling it a
"reproach to secondary schools."
Discussing the undergraduate re
quirements for either math or a
foreign language, Lyman said
he didn't "understand how that
curricular trade-off came about."
Emotional Maturity
One of the more Interesting
points of Parents' Day was an
address delivered in the after
noon by Dean Napier. He re
marked, "I am impressed with
the new campus morality." Ad
mitting that he is very much
"pro-student," Napier presented
seven criteria for emotional ma
turity, commenting that fear
and loneliness are prevalent in
the university.
He explained further that
communication between stu
dents and parents is more diffi
cult, and more frustrating than
ever. The university becomes
school, church, community, and
country, according to Napier. In
short, it is the last and greatest
hope in a rapidly changing so
ciety.
"Some of the old gods are dy
ing," says Napier, and we can
not recussitate them even if we
would."

From the extreme left, which
desires total destruction, and
from the extreme right, which
desires total restoration, the stu
dent must construct the society
of the future, according to the
Dean.
One of the more controversial
figures on campus, Paul S. Sea

ver, proclaimed the innocence of
Western Civilization classes in
relation to "leftist indoctrina
tion." Seaver confessed that he,
like most of the freshmen, was
basically unaware of the politi
cal views of most of the instruc
tors in his department.


PARENTS' DAY featured a student panel, of which these intent souls are members, to discuss
various issues relevant to the University with visiting parents, in addition to a number of speeches
by President Sterling, Provost Lyman, and Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier.

ing students, and comment on
the nature of this period of "un
precedented change."
Other speakers were Provost
Richard Lyman, Assistant Pro
fesor of History and advisor to
conscientious objectors Paul S.
Seaver, Executive Head and Pro
fessor of Biology Donald Ken
nedy, Associate Head and Pro
fessor of Electrical Engineering
Ralph J. Smith, and Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier.
Instigator Of Change
Sterling pointed out that the
university must be an instigator
of change, since it is the creator
of new things.
"Every knowledge explosion
in history," said the President,
"has made the status quo inse
cure." He used the Renaissance,
the Industrial Revolution, and
Darwinism as illustrations of
his point.
According to Sterling, the uni
versity is a moderator between
extremes, a selector of new val

ues which puts all ideas to the
test called proof.
Provost Lyman also spoke,
commenting on the severe need
for English instruction for all
freshman students, calling it a
"reproach to secondary schools."
Discussing the undergraduate re
quirements for either math or a
foreign language, Lyman said
he didn't "understand how that
curricular trade-off came about."
Emotional Maturity
One of the more Interesting
points of Parents' Day was an
address delivered in the after
noon by Dean Napier. He re
marked, "I am impressed with
the new campus morality." Ad
mitting that he is very much
"pro-student," Napier presented
seven criteria for emotional ma
turity, commenting that fear
and loneliness are prevalent in
the university.
He explained further that
communication between stu
dents and parents is more diffi
cult, and more frustrating than
ever. The university becomes
school, church, community, and
country, according to Napier. In
short, it is the last and greatest
hope in a rapidly changing so
ciety.
"Some of the old gods are dy
ing," says Napier, and we can
not recussitate them even if we
would."

From the extreme left, which
desires total destruction, and
from the extreme right, which
desires total restoration, the stu
dent must construct the society
of the future, according to the
Dean.
One of the more controversial
figures on campus, Paul S. Sea

ver, proclaimed the innocence of
Western Civilization classes in
relation to "leftist indoctrina
tion." Seaver confessed that he,
like most of the freshmen, was
basically unaware of the politi
cal views of most of the instruc
tors in his department.


PARENTS' DAY featured a student panel, of which these intent souls are members, to discuss
various issues relevant to the University with visiting parents, in addition to a number of speeches
by President Sterling, Provost Lyman, and Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier.
President Wallace Sterling
told a Parents' Day audience Sat
urday that Stanford could not do
in four years what family and
home had failed to accomplish
in 18, and therefore university
life was no threat to the new stu
dents.
The 900 parents of freshmen
heard the President discuss the
effects of the school on the enter
ing students, and comment on
the nature of this period of "un
precedented change."
