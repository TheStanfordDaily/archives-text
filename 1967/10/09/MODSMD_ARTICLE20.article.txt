# Indian Water Poloists Sink Cal
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford water poloists bag
ged the Berkeley Bears, 94, in
Cal's pool Friday in a contest
billed as a national showdown.
Preseason predictions rated
Cal, Stanford, and UCLA even
runners for the NCAA crown.
Mark Parmely rammed in
four goals and Gary Sheerer hit
three for the bulk of the Indians'
scoring.
Cal's touted offense, featuring
Pan Am team members Barry
Weitzenberg and Jon Shores,
poured in 55 goals in the Bears'
first two games of the season.
But Cal could manage only one
field goal against the Tribe de
fense. Penalty shots accounted
for the other three.
Take It To T£m
Stanford asserted itself at the
very start of the game. Greg
Buckingham took the sprint, and
moments later Parmely laced a
sweep shot past Cal's goalie An
ton Kajlich, formerly the Czech
oslovakian national goalie.
Sheerer, sitting at half court,

spotted an open corner in the
Bear net and promptly packed
it with yellow rubber.
The Indians stretched their
lead to 5-1 by halftime on a Par
mely backhand, a penalty shot
by Sheerer, and a patented
Sheerer-to-John Parker cross
goal pattern.
Wall O'Momsen
A big question that used to
plague the Stanford defense was
how would the inexperienced
Indian goalie stand up to the
test of Pan American arms. Bob
Momsen answered emphatically,
blocking 10 Bear shots while los
ing only one field goal — that on
a tip-in after a deflected shot.
Kajlich made 16 saves.
The Indians increased their
lead in the second half. Parmely
took a pin-point Parker pass and
converted. Sheerer intercepted a
Cal pass and fired across court
to Parmely's waiting arms for
Stanford's seventh score.
Buckingham and Sheerer put
the final scores on the Stan
ford books.
Cards Control Ball
Stanford maintained tight ball
control throughout the game,
working it carefully to set up a
good shot or catch the Bears on
a break.
The Card defense kept Cal
from getting a man open for a
single open shot.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughan

praised the play of Parmely and
Sheerer.
Gaughran looked wistfully at
the locker room ceiling, and,
poorly concealing an expansive
grin, sighed, "It's just too bad
we don't have a goalie. Ho hum."
Gaughran, on a more serious
note, commented, "We commit
ted far too many fouls. We just
can't affard to give up those pen
alty shots to UCLA."
A new NCAA regulation
awards a penalty shot to a team
for every 10 fouls committed
against it. Cal collected three
goals on penalty throws.
Stanford next plays a rugged
San Jose State squad in the
Spartan bath tub.
