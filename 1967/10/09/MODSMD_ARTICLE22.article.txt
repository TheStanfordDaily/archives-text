# Silence, Unhappiness
## Losing's Hurt Reaches All 
### NICK SELBY 
Losing is the worst thing in
the world. And the hurt reach
es everyone involved in an ath
letic contest.
Take the case of the contes
tant, where surely the loss rank
les the most. In the game of
football, he has no recourse after
a loss but to sit silently and
ponder the "if only's."
The player can't blame a 30-0
loss on the referees or the crowd
or the coaches. He can only ad
mit to himself that he has been
beaten physically.
"If Only's"
He can't start a fight to sho- /
the opponent that he is a tough
er guy. That would only look
foolish.
"If only I hadn't called that
play. If only I had run this way,
or if I only hadn't come up to
the line on that pass play."
Questions, questions. The dis
appointed player's mind replays
the game over and over again
in his head.
Silent Bus
The player has the long, quiet
bus ride to the airport so he can
go back to school. It is not the
silent ride before the game, when
everyone is keyed and concen
trating.
Everyone has the urge to
swear very loudly.
But the player knows he
can't. The team wants someone
to yell at them, anger them so
they can forget their failures.
But there's silence.
Thirst Stings
There's the plane ride, when
everyone begins to feel the de
hydration from two hours of
steady sweating. The steward
esses give them cokes but it
will be a while before the thirst
goes.
Finally the plane lands and
the players load onto another bus
for the final ride back to school.
The driver has a radio that keeps
blaring out obnoxious tunes,
sounds that keep everyone
awake.
A break in the music for some

scores. "USC trounced Stanford
30-0 tonight." "You bums lost,"
is what the announcer is saying
to everyone on the bus. No one
moves or says a thing.
Coach's Agony
For the coach, the agony is
the same. After the game, he has
to say something to the players.
Should he get mad at them? Can
he scream at them for making
stupid mistakes? He might feel
the urge to, but he doesn't.
Then he has to face the re
porters, the constantly querying
members of the press, who can't
ask anything more intelligent
than "Was USC better this year
than last?" or "Is Simpson bet
ter than Garrett?"
Surprised ?
What can the coach say? After
the long hours of preparation,
the days of eye-burning study
of films, with tiny players run
ning backwards and forwards
over and over again, how can
he answer a question like, "Were
you surprised by anything the
Trojans did?"
And in his disappointment in
himself and the team, he must
watch that he doesn't say some
thing carelessly, something that
will be exploded by the press
into something he didn't mean.
He too suffers the ride back
on the plane, asking himself "if
only's" with a probing depth
that he is glad the reporters did
n't bother with.
If he's lucky, when he gets
home, his wife is at the airport
to meet him. A coach's wife has
to take the sting out of every
defeat, or the coach will find it
hard to be effective the next
week.
Frustrated Fans
It's even unpleasant for the
fans, who've travelled 400 miles
hoping to see a big upset, to see
the proud USC fans sad and
silent for once.
But it doesn't happen. The sta
dium announcer on'y reads sta
tistics about O.J. Simpson. "He
gained 166 yards on 29 carries
for a 5.5 average," he says.
"And he can't read," the fans
yell back. Big deal — he sure
can carry a football. He doesn't
have to spell "touchdown" to
score one.
So there's still another who

wants to rid his frustrations but
can't.
Reporter Suffers
Even the reporter suffers.
When he follows a team close
ly, and his team loses, he can't
help but feel sad.
He doesn't want to ask diffi
cult questions of either the play
ers or the coach. "What happen
ed when you let him score Bob?"
is a question which might end
with a bloody nose.

So he sticks to stupidities, feel
ing as disappointed in the loss
as in his lack of an exciting lock
er room story.
There's no way to change the
effects of losing. Every time,
life is extremely miserable for
a few hours or a day or two.
But the players and coaches,
who find it most hard, have to
perk up and start over again.
They have to do the job, or
else not be counted as men.

about to fall from the tackle attempt made by an unidentified USC
player. Pass protection for quarterbacks Marquess and Chuck Wil
liiams was marginal most of the night, and only dodging by the two
prevented large losses.
Losing is the worst thing in
the world. And the hurt reach
es everyone involved in an ath
letic contest.
Take the case of the contes
tant, where surely the loss rank
les the most. In the game of
football, he has no recourse after
a loss but to sit silently and
ponder the "if only's."
The player can't blame a 30-0
loss on the referees or the crowd
or the coaches. He can only ad
mit to himself that he has been
beaten physically.
"If Only's"
He can't start a fight to sho- /
the opponent that he is a tough
er guy. That would only look
foolish.
"If only I hadn't called that
play. If only I had run this way,
or if I only hadn't come up to
the line on that pass play."
Questions, questions. The dis
appointed player's mind replays
the game over and over again
in his head.
Silent Bus
The player has the long, quiet
bus ride to the airport so he can
go back to school. It is not the
silent ride before the game, when
everyone is keyed and concen
trating.
Everyone has the urge to
swear very loudly.
But the player knows he
can't. The team wants someone
to yell at them, anger them so
they can forget their failures.
But there's silence.
Thirst Stings
There's the plane ride, when
everyone begins to feel the de
hydration from two hours of
steady sweating. The steward
esses give them cokes but it
will be a while before the thirst
goes.
Finally the plane lands and
the players load onto another bus
for the final ride back to school.
The driver has a radio that keeps
blaring out obnoxious tunes,
sounds that keep everyone
awake.
A break in the music for some

scores. "USC trounced Stanford
30-0 tonight." "You bums lost,"
is what the announcer is saying
to everyone on the bus. No one
moves or says a thing.
Coach's Agony
For the coach, the agony is
the same. After the game, he has
to say something to the players.
Should he get mad at them? Can
he scream at them for making
stupid mistakes? He might feel
the urge to, but he doesn't.
Then he has to face the re
porters, the constantly querying
members of the press, who can't
ask anything more intelligent
than "Was USC better this year
than last?" or "Is Simpson bet
ter than Garrett?"
Surprised ?
What can the coach say? After
the long hours of preparation,
the days of eye-burning study
of films, with tiny players run
ning backwards and forwards
over and over again, how can
he answer a question like, "Were
you surprised by anything the
Trojans did?"
And in his disappointment in
himself and the team, he must
watch that he doesn't say some
thing carelessly, something that
will be exploded by the press
into something he didn't mean.
He too suffers the ride back
on the plane, asking himself "if
only's" with a probing depth
that he is glad the reporters did
n't bother with.
If he's lucky, when he gets
home, his wife is at the airport
to meet him. A coach's wife has
to take the sting out of every
defeat, or the coach will find it
hard to be effective the next
week.
Frustrated Fans
It's even unpleasant for the
fans, who've travelled 400 miles
hoping to see a big upset, to see
the proud USC fans sad and
silent for once.
But it doesn't happen. The sta
dium announcer on'y reads sta
tistics about O.J. Simpson. "He
gained 166 yards on 29 carries
for a 5.5 average," he says.
"And he can't read," the fans
yell back. Big deal — he sure
can carry a football. He doesn't
have to spell "touchdown" to
score one.
So there's still another who

wants to rid his frustrations but
can't.
Reporter Suffers
Even the reporter suffers.
When he follows a team close
ly, and his team loses, he can't
help but feel sad.
He doesn't want to ask diffi
cult questions of either the play
ers or the coach. "What happen
ed when you let him score Bob?"
is a question which might end
with a bloody nose.

So he sticks to stupidities, feel
ing as disappointed in the loss
as in his lack of an exciting lock
er room story.
There's no way to change the
effects of losing. Every time,
life is extremely miserable for
a few hours or a day or two.
But the players and coaches,
who find it most hard, have to
perk up and start over again.
They have to do the job, or
else not be counted as men.

They have to do the job, or

ABOUT TO FALL: Card quarterback Mark Marquess seems
about to fall from the tackle attempt made by an unidentified USC
player. Pass protection for quarterbacks Marquess and Chuck Wil
liiams was marginal most of the night, and only dodging by the two
prevented large losses.
Losing is the worst thing in
the world. And the hurt reach
es everyone involved in an ath
letic contest.
Take the case of the contes
tant, where surely the loss rank
les the most. In the game of
football, he has no recourse after
a loss but to sit silently and
ponder the "if only's."
The player can't blame a 30-0
loss on the referees or the crowd
or the coaches. He can only ad
mit to himself that he has been
beaten physically.
"If Only's"
He can't start a fight to sho- /
the opponent that he is a tough
er guy. That would only look
foolish.
"If only I hadn't called that
play. If only I had run this way,
or if I only hadn't come up to
the line on that pass play."
Questions, questions. The dis
appointed player's mind replays
the game over and over again
in his head.
Silent Bus
The player has the long, quiet
bus ride to the airport so he can
go back to school. It is not the
silent ride before the game, when
everyone is keyed and concen
trating.
Everyone has the urge to
swear very loudly.
But the player knows he
can't. The team wants someone
to yell at them, anger them so
they can forget their failures.
But there's silence.
Thirst Stings
There's the plane ride, when
everyone begins to feel the de
hydration from two hours of
steady sweating. The steward
esses give them cokes but it
will be a while before the thirst
goes.
Finally the plane lands and
the players load onto another bus
for the final ride back to school.
The driver has a radio that keeps
blaring out obnoxious tunes,
sounds that keep everyone
awake.
A break in the music for some

scores. "USC trounced Stanford
30-0 tonight." "You bums lost,"
is what the announcer is saying
to everyone on the bus. No one
moves or says a thing.
Coach's Agony
For the coach, the agony is
the same. After the game, he has
to say something to the players.
Should he get mad at them? Can
he scream at them for making
stupid mistakes? He might feel
the urge to, but he doesn't.
Then he has to face the re
porters, the constantly querying
members of the press, who can't
ask anything more intelligent
than "Was USC better this year
than last?" or "Is Simpson bet
ter than Garrett?"
Surprised ?
What can the coach say? After
the long hours of preparation,
the days of eye-burning study
of films, with tiny players run
ning backwards and forwards
over and over again, how can
he answer a question like, "Were
you surprised by anything the
Trojans did?"
And in his disappointment in
himself and the team, he must
watch that he doesn't say some
thing carelessly, something that
will be exploded by the press
into something he didn't mean.
He too suffers the ride back
on the plane, asking himself "if
only's" with a probing depth
that he is glad the reporters did
n't bother with.
If he's lucky, when he gets
home, his wife is at the airport
to meet him. A coach's wife has
to take the sting out of every
defeat, or the coach will find it
hard to be effective the next
week.
Frustrated Fans
It's even unpleasant for the
fans, who've travelled 400 miles
hoping to see a big upset, to see
the proud USC fans sad and
silent for once.
But it doesn't happen. The sta
dium announcer on'y reads sta
tistics about O.J. Simpson. "He
gained 166 yards on 29 carries
for a 5.5 average," he says.
"And he can't read," the fans
yell back. Big deal — he sure
can carry a football. He doesn't
have to spell "touchdown" to
score one.
So there's still another who

wants to rid his frustrations but
can't.
Reporter Suffers
Even the reporter suffers.
When he follows a team close
ly, and his team loses, he can't
help but feel sad.
He doesn't want to ask diffi
cult questions of either the play
ers or the coach. "What happen
ed when you let him score Bob?"
is a question which might end
with a bloody nose.

So he sticks to stupidities, feel
ing as disappointed in the loss
as in his lack of an exciting lock
er room story.
There's no way to change the
effects of losing. Every time,
life is extremely miserable for
a few hours or a day or two.
But the players and coaches,
who find it most hard, have to
perk up and start over again.
They have to do the job, or
else not be counted as men.
