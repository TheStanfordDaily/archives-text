# Mime Troupe Slaps War
## 
### 
Glabrous with humor, the San
Francisco Mime Troupe struck
again with its usual riotous slap
stick.
The Dinkelspiel performance
was marked by verbal graffiti as
the actors kept the normally
somber Stanfordites in the pain
of laughter throughout the eve
ning.
"Ciao. That's all those wops
ever think of," probably one of
the funniest puns outside of
Rome, rocked the house.
And an unannounced shower
for dirty pedantics was worth

the price of admission. "I've
come to water the flower-chil
dren," Arlecchino announced to
the crowd, eagerly searching
for a few misplaced Haight-Ash
bury types. Finding none, he con
tented himself with spraying
water over the first row of Stan
ford children.
Joan Holden's adaption of
Spain's attempt to conquer Italy
while staging a few civil wars
of its own brought down the
house.
Unfortunately, it also brought
down the actors as their movable

stage collapsed during the first
performance.
Noble Venture
But with a bold sense of ad
venture, the young actors pro
claimed their noble and original
venture. They want something
done and they are doing it. If it
is true wars are due to a cer
tain emptiness at home, then
like the inmates at the asylum of
Agnews, their revolution is at
hand.
Actually, wars may come and
go, but the Mime Troupe may
live forever. It melts in your
mind, not in your mouth.
