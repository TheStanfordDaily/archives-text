# Collegiate Leaders Start Petition Drive
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” Leaders of several
major student and youth organ
izations have endorsed a nation
al drive to obtain signatures on
a petition calling on President
Johnson to end the bombing
of North Vietnam and to nego
tiate now to end the war.
The student leaders called for
campus support of the national
student and faculty registration
for negotiation now. They an
nounced that some 175 local cam
pus drives are already under
way in support of the petition
campaign.
The petitions call on President
Johnson to end the bombing and
to recognize the National Lib
eration Front as meaningful
steps toward negotiation and a
political settlement of the Viet
nam war.
Signers of the statement rep
resent the following organiza
tions: Campus Americans for
Democratic Action, College
Young Democratic Clubs of
America, Council on Internation
al Relations and U.N. Affairs
(College Affiliate), National Fed
eration of Catholic College Stu
dents, U.S. Youth Council, North
American Commission, Pax fto
mana, the U.S. National Student

Association, the Young Peoples
Socialist League, and the Young
Women's Christian Association.
The student leaders' statement
was issued as the Negotiation
Now campaign announced it
would continue through the elec
tion year.
"This will be a crucial year
for those who are working for
a new American policy in Viet
nam," the statement said. "The
stage is being set for the 1968
elections and proper efforts,
made now, can assure the widest
discussion of Vietnam in the
electorate and a strong trend
against war and escalation in
the voting."
The student leaders also said,
"During the summer months our
government has pursued, with
ever increasing steps, a policy
of military escalation in Viet
nam. We see no basis for be
lieving that these steps will lead
to a resolution of the conflict
in Vietnam; rather there is every
reason to believe that these des
perate military measurs are lead
ing to further disasters in South
east Asia and in our own domes
tic affairs. We believe that Amer
ica does have an alternative in
Vietnam and that a just and
peaceful resolution of the con
flict is possible."
