# Study Suggests Police Abolition

### 
(CPS) — A special commis
sion at Cornell has recommend
ed that the university give up
campus law enforcement activi
ties and restrict its disciplinary
authority over students "solely
to acts of misconduct damaging
the university's educational ob
jectives."
Police coverage of the Stan
ford campus has been under
study for several months. Cam
pus police served as peace offi
cers until state legislation re
quired that peace officers be em
ployed and paid by a county or
municipality.
Previously Cornell has helped
local law enforcement author
ities apprehend student law
breakers, particularly mariju
ana users.
The commission found that
the behavior and attitudes ac
companying student use of mari
juana "were damaging to the
education environment and that
the university should have reg
ulations against the possession,
use, or sale" of it.
Although the report called for
a greater student voice in disci
plinary matters on campus, it
recommended that the faculty
review cases adjudicated by the
student's Conduct Board, when
ever it was necessary to "rec
tify any gross miscarriage of
justice."
The commission, which in
cludes faculty, administration
and student representatives, was
set up last Spring because of
growing student unrest over the
administration's disciplinary pol
icies, particularly with regard to
outside authorities.
Students protested when the
university tried to curtail the
activities of a S.D.S. group that
was recruiting students to go to
New York and burn their draft
cards.
