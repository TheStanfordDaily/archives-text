# Mancall Raps Viet War, Blasts Anti-Communism
## 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
"Enemy and Communist have
become synonomous in America
today," stated Mark Mancall, as
sistant professor of history, in a
discussion on Vietnam held in
Jordan House last night.
The event was the second in

a Vietnam forum on this subject
being sponsored by the Row
Houses. "We fail to learn the
lesson of our own experience ..
he stated, "and are unwilling to
admit that Communism per se
is not necessarily an enemy."
This, Mancall feels, is the basis
of our involvement in Vietnam
today. The war, he emphasized,
"is based on a very naive anti
communism which sees anyone
against us ... as a communist."
He drew a close parallel between
this attitude to McCarthy-ism.
"But what," he asked, "is the
earthly strategic or tactical
danger of a Communist govern
ment in Southeast Asia for us?"
When the Domino Theory was
presented as an answer to this
question, he claimed that it had
been completely disproven by
history in that "while South
Vietnam has not even gone com
munist yet, many other coun
tries in the area have gone and
come back without any help
from Saigon."

He cites as examples Indone
sia, which "se-saws back and
forth," Cambodia, which would
seek our aid if we could help it
in its main purpose, i.e., peace in
Southeast Asia, or Burma, where
Americans have been all but
pushed out. As valid a theory
would be, "If we let South Viet
nam go, all the other countries
in the area would jump into
our arms."
Lee To Rubles
Yet the government persists
with the war while the American
public Is "lied to by inuendo."
Members of the American gov
ernment he calls "either knaves
or fools." Although he suspects
they are the former, he feels
the situation would be easier if
they were the latter. "Fools can
somehow be reckoned with. Not
so knaves," he explained.
Washington, he said, "Must be
willing to admit to either an
eventual communist takeover of
the South Vietnam government

or a century or so of involve
ment in Southeast Asia."
Mancall reminded the audience
that the Communists have been
entrenched in Southeast Asia
for decades and, in the minds of
many Vietnamese, Communism
and nationalism are synono
mous. The United States, how
ever, entered in a military capa
city and promised democracy,
which, he implied, is not even
practiced there.
Voting Discrimination
"Those suspected as neutra
lists, much less Communists,
were excluded from voting . . .
by not being given voting cards."
Much more important than po
litical conquest is social organi
zation and economic growth.
Tomorrow Profesor Van Slyke
and Dave Truong will discuss
the Vietnamese elections at 8
p.m. at Roth House. Professor
Michael Novak, of the Depart
ment of Religious Studies, will
conclude the series with a lec
ture "A Bucket of Worms: A
Report on Vietnam" Tuesday in
Dinkelspiel at 8 p.m.
