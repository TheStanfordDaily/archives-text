# Drama Review
## SRT Opens New Season 
### MICHAEL MORTON 
The Stanford Repertory Thea
ter opened its third season last
Thursday with Chekov and Hard
Rock, four one-act plays by An
ton Chekhov and a discotheque
party.
In a short introductory speech
to the audience, resident Actor-
Director Gerald Hiken termed
this "our first real year of rep
ertory."
The first production, "The
Harmfulness of Tobacco," occa
sionally showed the lack of re
hearsal that is regrettably pres
ent throughout the evening. Nev
ertheless, Sheldon Feldner is by
and large believable as Ivan
Ivanovich, a henpecked husband
forced by his wife to deliver
"popular lectures for charity."
From the outset he establishes
a complete rapport with the au
dience through his disjointed
speech, odd placement of ad
verbs, and excellent delivery of
punch lines. Only this intial feel
ing for the character keeps the
audience from completely losing
identification with the later ac
tion onstage, for Feldner's at
tempts at depth characterization
often hollov -specially when he
raises his voic.
Occasionally l>. clayed
Feldner is most oxi n able
to draw the audience to his side
when his introspection is done
quietly. Statements on the order

of, "I'm a failure," would be
more readily acceptable if de
livered in the meekly designed
tone characterizing most of the
play, rather than the shout he
employs.
'The Boor" is easily the high
point of the evening. Paul Rich
ards as Smirnov, the frustrated
creditor, commands the stage at
all times. His elastic face and
wealth of expressions contrast
beautifully with the death mask
of his opponent, Elena Popova, a
young widow. Barbara Richards
is competent in this role, al
though she never seems to rise
very far above the level of the
ludicrously self-pitying, egotisti
cal bitch.
Throughout the hilarious
"Tom Jones" eating scenes, nose
thumbing asides, the raging soli
loquies, the characterization fal
ters only once when Mr. Rich
ards add ten decibels to an al
ready full shout.
Lack of Rehearsal
This play also shows the lack
of rehearsal in occasional breaks
in the continuity and flow of
the action. This is especially re
grettable here for despite its
small scale, a fully polished
"Boor" could be among SRT's
finest work.
In his second performance of
the evening, Sheldon Feldner is
again amusingly good as the
milksop butler, particularly

when he is caught between the
battlings of the two antagonists.
In "The Reluctant Tragedian,"
SRT returns to the realm of the
henpacked husband. Sergei Tsch
ernisch as Tolkachov, the pater
familias, is for most of the play
unable to impart a significant
degree of life to his character.
However, Charles Edelman as
the artist Muroshkin is a per
fect sounding board for the rant
ings and ravings of his perse
cuted friend.
It is only when Murashkin
unconsciously takes on the role
of Tolkachov's domineering wife
that Tschernisch comes to life,
and his screams of, "I want
blood," bring down the house.
Homosexual Allusions
The play is fraught with homo
sexual allusions, the point of
which this reviewer missed en
tirely, assuming that they did in
fact have some point. Such allu
sions in this sort of production
seem to be a rather desperate
grabbing for something to prop
up the weak points in lieu of
consistently strong character
presentation.
"Swan Song" is the only non
comic offering of the evening
and it bears the traditional SRT
stamp of competence without
brilliance.
Credibility Without Life
Gerald Hiken as the old actor
Vassile Bassilevich once again

displays his near-consumate
mastery of the technical aspects
of the actor's craft through his
multi-faceted character. Unfor
tunately he only rarely gives life
to a thoroughly credible presen
tation.
There is no point at which the
audience does not believe him,
but it is seldom that Hiken can
make the audience feel the vast
dimensions of emotion of this
character. Perhaps he should set
tle on either directing or act
ing, rather than tackling two
full time jobs at once.
Kudos once more to Paul
Richards as he joins the ranks
of the two-time performers. In
the role of the old prompter, a
far narrower part than Hiken's,
he gently draws the audience
into his feeling of hero-worship
for Vassilevich.
Discotheque
The Hard Rock discotheque
following the production was
about as successful as first time
ventures usually are. However, it
is a format that should be pre
served, if for no other reason,
for the free and easy contact
with the performers.
SRT will repeat the production
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
of this week. Tickets are avail
able at the TMU Box Office.

ludicrously self-pitying, egotisti
cal bitch.
Throughout the hilarious
"Tom Jones" eating scenes, nose
thumbing asides, the raging soli
loquies, the characterization fal
ters only once when Mr. Rich
ards add ten decibels to an al
ready full shout.
Lack of Rehearsal
This play also shows the lack
of rehearsal in occasional breaks
in the continuity and flow of
the action. This is especially re
grettable here for despite its
small scale, a fully polished
"Boor" could be among SRT's
finest work.
In his second performance of
the evening, Sheldon Feldner is
again amusingly good as the
milksop butler, particularly

when he is caught between the
battlings of the two antagonists.
In "The Reluctant Tragedian,"
SRT returns to the realm of the
henpacked husband. Sergei Tsch
ernisch as Tolkachov, the pater
familias, is for most of the play
unable to impart a significant
degree of life to his character.
However, Charles Edelman as
the artist Muroshkin is a per
fect sounding board for the rant
ings and ravings of his perse
cuted friend.
It is only when Murashkin
unconsciously takes on the role
of Tolkachov's domineering wife
that Tschernisch comes to life,
and his screams of, "I want
blood," bring down the house.
Homosexual Allusions
The play is fraught with homo
sexual allusions, the point of
which this reviewer missed en
tirely, assuming that they did in
fact have some point. Such allu
sions in this sort of production
seem to be a rather desperate
grabbing for something to prop
up the weak points in lieu of
consistently strong character
presentation.
"Swan Song" is the only non
comic offering of the evening
and it bears the traditional SRT
stamp of competence without
brilliance.
Credibility Without Life
Gerald Hiken as the old actor
Vassile Bassilevich once again

displays his near-consumate
mastery of the technical aspects
of the actor's craft through his
multi-faceted character. Unfor
tunately he only rarely gives life
to a thoroughly credible presen
tation.
There is no point at which the
audience does not believe him,
but it is seldom that Hiken can
make the audience feel the vast
dimensions of emotion of this
character. Perhaps he should set
tle on either directing or act
ing, rather than tackling two
full time jobs at once.
Kudos once more to Paul
Richards as he joins the ranks
of the two-time performers. In
the role of the old prompter, a
far narrower part than Hiken's,
he gently draws the audience
into his feeling of hero-worship
for Vassilevich.
Discotheque
The Hard Rock discotheque
following the production was
about as successful as first time
ventures usually are. However, it
is a format that should be pre
served, if for no other reason,
for the free and easy contact
with the performers.
SRT will repeat the production
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
of this week. Tickets are avail
able at the TMU Box Office.
The Stanford Repertory Thea
ter opened its third season last
Thursday with Chekov and Hard
Rock, four one-act plays by An
ton Chekhov and a discotheque
party.
In a short introductory speech
to the audience, resident Actor-
Director Gerald Hiken termed
this "our first real year of rep
ertory."
The first production, "The
Harmfulness of Tobacco," occa
sionally showed the lack of re
hearsal that is regrettably pres
ent throughout the evening. Nev
ertheless, Sheldon Feldner is by
and large believable as Ivan
Ivanovich, a henpecked husband
forced by his wife to deliver
"popular lectures for charity."
From the outset he establishes
a complete rapport with the au
dience through his disjointed
speech, odd placement of ad
verbs, and excellent delivery of
punch lines. Only this intial feel
ing for the character keeps the
audience from completely losing
identification with the later ac
tion onstage, for Feldner's at
tempts at depth characterization
often hollov -specially when he
raises his voic.
Occasionally l>. clayed
Feldner is most oxi n able
to draw the audience to his side
when his introspection is done
quietly. Statements on the order

of, "I'm a failure," would be
more readily acceptable if de
livered in the meekly designed
tone characterizing most of the
play, rather than the shout he
employs.
'The Boor" is easily the high
point of the evening. Paul Rich
ards as Smirnov, the frustrated
creditor, commands the stage at
all times. His elastic face and
wealth of expressions contrast
beautifully with the death mask
of his opponent, Elena Popova, a
young widow. Barbara Richards
is competent in this role, al
though she never seems to rise
very far above the level of the
ludicrously self-pitying, egotisti
cal bitch.

and it bears the traditional SRT
stamp of competence without
brilliance.
Credibility Without Life
Gerald Hiken as the old actor
Vassile Bassilevich once again

displays his near-consumate
mastery of the technical aspects
of the actor's craft through his
multi-faceted character. Unfor
tunately he only rarely gives life
to a thoroughly credible presen
tation.
There is no point at which the
audience does not believe him,
but it is seldom that Hiken can
make the audience feel the vast
dimensions of emotion of this
character. Perhaps he should set
tle on either directing or act
ing, rather than tackling two
full time jobs at once.
Kudos once more to Paul
Richards as he joins the ranks
of the two-time performers. In
the role of the old prompter, a
far narrower part than Hiken's,
he gently draws the audience
into his feeling of hero-worship
for Vassilevich.
Discotheque
The Hard Rock discotheque
following the production was
about as successful as first time
ventures usually are. However, it
is a format that should be pre
served, if for no other reason,
for the free and easy contact
with the performers.
SRT will repeat the production
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
of this week. Tickets are avail
able at the TMU Box Office.
The Stanford Repertory Thea
ter opened its third season last
Thursday with Chekov and Hard
Rock, four one-act plays by An
ton Chekhov and a discotheque
party.
In a short introductory speech
to the audience, resident Actor-
Director Gerald Hiken termed
this "our first real year of rep
ertory."
The first production, "The
Harmfulness of Tobacco," occa
sionally showed the lack of re
hearsal that is regrettably pres
ent throughout the evening. Nev
ertheless, Sheldon Feldner is by
and large believable as Ivan
Ivanovich, a henpecked husband
forced by his wife to deliver
"popular lectures for charity."
From the outset he establishes
a complete rapport with the au
dience through his disjointed
speech, odd placement of ad
verbs, and excellent delivery of
punch lines. Only this intial feel
ing for the character keeps the
audience from completely losing
identification with the later ac
tion onstage, for Feldner's at
tempts at depth characterization
often hollov -specially when he
raises his voic.
Occasionally l>. clayed
Feldner is most oxi n able
to draw the audience to his side
when his introspection is done
quietly. Statements on the order

of, "I'm a failure," would be
more readily acceptable if de
livered in the meekly designed
tone characterizing most of the
play, rather than the shout he
employs.
'The Boor" is easily the high
point of the evening. Paul Rich
ards as Smirnov, the frustrated
creditor, commands the stage at
all times. His elastic face and
wealth of expressions contrast
beautifully with the death mask
of his opponent, Elena Popova, a
young widow. Barbara Richards
is competent in this role, al
though she never seems to rise
very far above the level of the
ludicrously self-pitying, egotisti
cal bitch.
Throughout the hilarious
"Tom Jones" eating scenes, nose
thumbing asides, the raging soli
loquies, the characterization fal
ters only once when Mr. Rich
ards add ten decibels to an al
ready full shout.
Lack of Rehearsal
This play also shows the lack
of rehearsal in occasional breaks
in the continuity and flow of
the action. This is especially re
grettable here for despite its
small scale, a fully polished
"Boor" could be among SRT's
finest work.
In his second performance of
the evening, Sheldon Feldner is
again amusingly good as the
milksop butler, particularly

when he is caught between the
battlings of the two antagonists.
In "The Reluctant Tragedian,"
SRT returns to the realm of the
henpacked husband. Sergei Tsch
ernisch as Tolkachov, the pater
familias, is for most of the play
unable to impart a significant
degree of life to his character.
However, Charles Edelman as
the artist Muroshkin is a per
fect sounding board for the rant
ings and ravings of his perse
cuted friend.
It is only when Murashkin
unconsciously takes on the role
of Tolkachov's domineering wife
that Tschernisch comes to life,
and his screams of, "I want
blood," bring down the house.
Homosexual Allusions
The play is fraught with homo
sexual allusions, the point of
which this reviewer missed en
tirely, assuming that they did in
fact have some point. Such allu
sions in this sort of production
seem to be a rather desperate
grabbing for something to prop
up the weak points in lieu of
consistently strong character
presentation.
