objectives: to understand the
complexities of implementing or
changing substantive laws in the
face of conflicting demands;
from the public, from politicians,
and from the legal profession it
self. And to give students a de
gree of familiarity with those
substantive laws that shape the
social welfare of cities. Crime,
Housing, Health, and Revolution
are among the subjects to be dis
cussed. Students will try to ap

proach the problem from the
standpoint of various members
of the legal community including
jurists, jurors, legislators, ad
ministrators, and police.
Among the weekly readings are
Manchild in the Promised Land
and The Other America. Using
the case method, each week the
seminar will be presented with a
hypothetical situation from real
life.

ligious studies.
