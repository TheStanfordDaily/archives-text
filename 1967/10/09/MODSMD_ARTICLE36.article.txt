# Top Administrators Attend Conferences
## 
### 
Three top Stanford adminis
trators are visiting Washington,
D.C. and New York City this
week to gather ideas and express
opinions on problems besetting
private universities.
Provost Richard W. Lyman
and Vice President for Finance
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson flew to
New York Saturday to attend the
"Seven Universties" conference
of private institutions today and
tomorrow. They will join Dean
of Students Joel Smith Wednes
day in Washington at the Ameri
can Council on Education (ACE)
meeting, which runs until Fri
day.
Smith flew to Washington to
day.
All three men will have busy
schedules outside the confer
ences. Lyman will visit friends
who have recently taken top posi
tions in universities, according to
his assistant Raymond Bacchetti.
Cuthbertson will confer with fi
nancial donors to Stanford, and
may not attend the ACE meeting

for that reason. Smith is flying
to Washington early to talk to
government officials.
The Seven Universities—Stan
ford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Chicago and Columbia—
will meet Oct. 9-10 "informally
with no agenda," said Bacchetti.
The officials from each will dis
cuss "topics of common in
terest," including financing, an
increasingly serious problem for
private universities.
The ACE conference will be an
elaborate affair with writers on
education discussing the theme,
"goals of higher education."
Hundreds of colleges and uni
versities will be represented.
Smith said he was looking for
ward to the opportunity for ex
change of ideas offered by the
conference.
All three Stanford administra
tors will return to campus by Sat
urday, Oct. 14. Their journeys
are not related to Stanford's
search for a president, Bacchetti
and Smith said.
