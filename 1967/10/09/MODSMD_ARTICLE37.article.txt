# Quad Ends Single Pics
## 
### 
There will no longer be In
dividual portraits in the un
dergraduate residences sec
tion of the Quad, according to
Quad Editor Bruce Howard.
This decision represents a
major policy change in the;
year. In previous editions,
the crowding of "mug shots"
onto a page resulted in a
postage - stamp appearance
The use of group pictures
will alleviate this crowding
and make the pages more 5
attractive.
Another reason for the
change Is the desire to pic
ture a larger percentage off
the undergraduate student:
body. In the 1967 Quad, only:
of more than 5000 under
graduates had their pictures
taken. With group pictures,
â€žhe cost to each person will;
be lower and the pictures will |
be easier and quicker to take.!
Seniors will still have in
dividual portraits made in
black and white. Details on
these will be announced
later.
