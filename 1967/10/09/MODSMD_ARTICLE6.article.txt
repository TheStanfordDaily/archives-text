## Hoover Institute: Expansion, Controversy 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN (First article in a series) 
In less than a decade, the Hoover In
stitution on War, Revolution and Peace
has expanded from preeminence as a li
brary to become a major center for re
search and publication.
Since 1960 it has raised over $7 mil
lion, more than in its previous forty
years, capping that effort with the con
struction of the Lou Henry Hoover
Building and the opening of a $5 million
endowment drive.
Unanswered Questions
But that decade has left unanswered
many controversial questions. Many
scholars criticize the Hoover Institution
for what they claim to be disreputable
scholarship and political activity im
proper in an academic environment.
At Stanford the cries of outrage are
loudly articulated, carrying with them
criticisms and questions about the rela
tionship between the University and the
Institution. A relationship which many
faculty members claim to be ambiguous
at best.
What motivates such claims? Why
and how has Hoover expanded? Where

are the funds generated, and the politics,
if indeed they exist? Why is the scholar
ship considered disreputable, and exact
ly what is the relationship between Stan
ford and the Institution? And maybe
most unclear: where is Hoover headed?
Basic to any answers is the question:
what is the Hoover Institution?
More Than Library
The name itself implies it is more
than a library. But the collections are
central to the whole structure. It was
founded as a library by Herbert Hoover
nearly half a century ago.
Soon after the outbreak of World War
I, Hoover conceived the idea of collect
ing documents, mostly primary sources
such as newspapers and government
publications. At the end of the war he
came to Stanford, his alma mater of
1895, seeking expert assistance. Supply
ing his own money and personnel, he
founded the Institution.
After the war, a team of Stanford re
searchers swept through Europe search
ing for significant records. This pattern
of intensive search by scholars was fol
lowed during the Second Wo r ld War

and is continued today by specialists at
Hoover.
Present Library Holdings
The library now contains over one mil
lion books, pamphlets, and government
documents. There are also over 26,000
newspaper and periodical titles. In total
the library contains about one-third of
Stanford's library holdings.
A library of this size creates large
problems of administering, acquiring,
and financing. The Hoover Institution is
directed by W. Glenn Campbell, but the
daily running of the library is handled
by Witold S. Sworakowski, associate di
rector, who will retire at year's end.
Sworakowski oversees the eleven divi
sions of the collection. Each division has
its own curator and the major ones each
have a complete staff.
Divided Into Six Areas
The library is divided into six major
area collections. These are East Asia.
Eastern Europe, the Middle East. Latin
America, Africa, and Western Europe
including Great Britain and the United
States. East Asia and Eastern Europe
contain the most extensive holdings.

Most of the library's material pertains
to war, revolution and peace since the
middle 19th Century with great empha
sis on documents of the 20th Century.
Materials on communist revolution and
communist society are the pride of the
Institution.
Each collection has its share of rare
and valuable resources. A tour with
Sworakowski leaves no doubt of this.
As he winds down the stacks of the 14-
story tower, one sentence continually
reverberates: "Look at this one. But
wait only a minute. Then you will really
see something."
Czar, Goebbels, Mao ...
The trail through a special elevator,
locked vaults, and yellowing pages in
cludes stops at the original drafts of
Czar Nicholas's abdiction statement, the
files of the Czar's secret police, the diary
of Joseph Goebbels, and original writ
ings of Mao Tse-tung.
The library also holds the collection
of the late Boris Nicolaevsky, a top ex
pert on Russian politics. It is widely
considered to be one of the world's most
valuable collections of Russian political
documents.

Sworakowski describes the acquisi
tion of such material as, "a game, with
competition from other libraries." Last
year Hoover spent over $150,000 pur
chasing documents, receiving another
$27,000's worth through gifts. The total
budget for library expenditures this
year is $580,000.
Much of this sum goes into tracking
down documents, plus shipping and cata
loguing them. Getting important rare
material from communist countries, a
speciality of the Institution, often in
volves extensive travel and major diffi
culties.
Chinese Problems
The East Asian collection has run into
such difficulties recently stemming from
the disruptive Cultural Revolution in
Red China. John Ma, curator of the col
lection, just returned from a three week
trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong tn search
of materials no longer accessible
through direct contact with Red China.
The Hoover library used to get over
130 journals and newspapers from Red
China through an exchange with the Na-
