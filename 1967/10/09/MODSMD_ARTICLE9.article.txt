# Presidential Search
## 
### 
Behind the apparently calm search for Stan
ford's next President, an intense discussion of
student participation in the selection pro
cedures is taking place.
Trustees point out they have been given the
legal right and responsibility for the selection
of the President. The Founding Grant states the
Trustees have the power "To appoint a President
of the University, who shall not be one of their
number, and to remove him at will."
Students are not contesting this right. How
ever, they are contesting the basic attitude of
the Trustees which implies students have noth
ing at all to offer in the process of selection.
What about the faculty? Although they have
no legal right to select the President, they are
directly consulted. The Trustees established a
faculty committee to meet with the Trustee com
mittee to discuss presidential candidates.
Although the faculty will not formally vote,
it is generally understood that the Trustees will
not select a man who does not have the support
of the faculty.
What then of the role of the students? We
admit students generally do not have the knowl
edge of a broad range of potential Presidential
candidates, as do some trustees and faculty.
However, we would contend the students do
have a viewpoint and series of perspectives
essential to the Presidential selection.
When it has been suggested students meet
with the trustees and faculty committees, the
request has been summarily dismissed. The only
comment given is that the students may meet
with individual members of the faculty commit
tee at any time they wish.

Implicit in this is the assumption that the
Trustees do not see any value in actively seek
ing student opinion, in authorizing a student
committee to express opinions on what type of
issues the new President will face, thereby help
ing to define what type of man Stanford should
seek.
The Trustees' assumption that student opinion
is worth nothing is hard to accept. It appears
students are defined as wards of the University
and are told that the Trustees with the aid of the
faculty will decide what is best for their future.
The immediate rejoiner is that members of the
faculty selection committee are always available
on campus and the students can always talk with
them. However, far be it from the trustees to
seek student help or even to allow it in any
meaningful way.
The refusal of the Trustees to seek student
participation reflects beyond the bounds of this
particular issue, the Presidential selection. It
first shows an unwillingness to value student
opinion on any subject. Secondly it severely re
stricts the understanding that could develop be
tween the students and the Trustees if some
common meetings were held.
We urge the Trustees to actively involve the
students in the process of defining what issues
Stanford's next president will face and thereby
define what type of person he should be.
This participation might take the form of joint
committees, or Trustees visiting campus to dis
cuss the selection with all interested students.
But it must take place or a greater misunder
standing between students and the Trustees can
be the only result.

of the faculty.
What then of the role of the students? We
admit students generally do not have the knowl
edge of a broad range of potential Presidential
candidates, as do some trustees and faculty.
However, we would contend the students do
have a viewpoint and series of perspectives
essential to the Presidential selection.
When it has been suggested students meet
with the trustees and faculty committees, the
request has been summarily dismissed. The only
comment given is that the students may meet
with individual members of the faculty commit
tee at any time they wish.

Implicit in this is the assumption that the
Trustees do not see any value in actively seek
ing student opinion, in authorizing a student
committee to express opinions on what type of
issues the new President will face, thereby help
ing to define what type of man Stanford should
seek.
The Trustees' assumption that student opinion
is worth nothing is hard to accept. It appears
students are defined as wards of the University
and are told that the Trustees with the aid of the
faculty will decide what is best for their future.
The immediate rejoiner is that members of the
faculty selection committee are always available
on campus and the students can always talk with
them. However, far be it from the trustees to
seek student help or even to allow it in any
meaningful way.
The refusal of the Trustees to seek student
participation reflects beyond the bounds of this
particular issue, the Presidential selection. It
first shows an unwillingness to value student
opinion on any subject. Secondly it severely re
stricts the understanding that could develop be
tween the students and the Trustees if some
common meetings were held.
We urge the Trustees to actively involve the
students in the process of defining what issues
Stanford's next president will face and thereby
define what type of person he should be.
This participation might take the form of joint
committees, or Trustees visiting campus to dis
cuss the selection with all interested students.
But it must take place or a greater misunder
standing between students and the Trustees can
be the only result.
Behind the apparently calm search for Stan
ford's next President, an intense discussion of
student participation in the selection pro
cedures is taking place.
Trustees point out they have been given the
legal right and responsibility for the selection
of the President. The Founding Grant states the
Trustees have the power "To appoint a President
of the University, who shall not be one of their
number, and to remove him at will."
Students are not contesting this right. How
ever, they are contesting the basic attitude of
the Trustees which implies students have noth
ing at all to offer in the process of selection.
What about the faculty? Although they have
no legal right to select the President, they are
directly consulted. The Trustees established a
faculty committee to meet with the Trustee com
mittee to discuss presidential candidates.
Although the faculty will not formally vote,
it is generally understood that the Trustees will
not select a man who does not have the support
of the faculty.
