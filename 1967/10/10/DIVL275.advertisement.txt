CLOSE THE DOOR TO WAR
Join us from 6 A.M. to 12 noon Monday, October 16
Oakland Induction Center 15th and Clay Streets
On October 16 hundreds of young men across the country will publicly re
turn their draft cords, refusing to cooperate with conscription.
David Harris and other Stanford men have led this movement.
Last Spring We Pledged Our Support
When the first draftees arrive at the Oakland Induction Center on October 16, we and others
pledging support will sit down in the doorway to impede conscription non-violently and to wit
ness our belief that these young men must be freed to take up peacetime vocations. At noon,
those remaining at Oakland will transfer by car and bus to the Federal Buliding in San Francisco
to support the several hundred men who at 1:00 P.M. will turn in their draft cards. The Monday
action is being organized by the Civil Action Day Committee which has already conducted three
sit-ins at Oakland and has a clearly defined purpose and discipline of non-violence which looks
to changing men's minds and actions, but whicl. respects the dignity and humanity of its
opponents.
I From protest and dissent we new turn to resistance and
non-cooperation. We urge our fellow citizens to join us.
Come whether or not you plan to join in civil disobedience. We wel
come supporters.
