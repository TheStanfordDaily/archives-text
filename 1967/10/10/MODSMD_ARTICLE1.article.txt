# Controversy Dominates Hoover Research
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per
cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43
percent of the budget.
This change signaled a shift in
direction at Hoover, making it,
as Director Glenn Campbell de
scribes, "more and more a center
for advanced study."
Controversy has grown with
the advanced study. The Hoover
staff includes spokesmen for dia
metrically opposed political view
points such as Stefan Possony,
famous for his ultra-conserva
tism, and Theodore Draper, a
leading writer with liberal views.
Possony is the object of nu
merous attacks for his active po
litical and military affiliations.
It has been suggested, in fact,
that except for a few individuals
such as Draper, the Hoover re
search and publications program
is an organ for anti-communist
propaganda.
Flare-up in 1960's
Part of this claim is based on
a flare-up in the early 19605. In
1959 the Stanford Board of Trus
tees passed a resolution concern
ing the relationship of the Uni
versity and the Institution. At
tached to this resolution was a
preface written by Herbert Hoo
ver. He wrote, in part:
"The purpose of this Institu

tion must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx—whether Communism, So
cialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus to protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It seems that this preface
didn't come to the public's atten
tion until early in 1960. In the
March 29th and 30th issues of
The Daily, it appeared in print
though the exact sequence of
events is unclear.
Faculty Protests
Evidently some time earlier in
the year, the faculty saw the
preface and violently protested.
At a February meeting of the
Board, the Trustees adopted a
statement noting that the preface
was not meant to be part of the
resolution, but rather only Hoo
ver's personal evaluation of
goals. In the same statement, the
Trustees said they stood for free
inquiry at Hoover.
The March 29th issue of the
Daily included an interview with
Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx
ism, and I hope we expose them."
Campbell was Herbert Hoo

ver's last appointee as Director of
the Institution. A Canadian by
birth, Campbell came to the In
stitution from The American En
terprise Institute for Public Pol
icy Research in Washington,
where he had been Research Di
rector. The Institute does studies
on recent major legislation.
Since his appointment at Hoo
ver, the Institution has grown
rapidly, bringing with it contin
uing controversy.
Financial Crises
In 1959 the Hoover Institution
faced a financial crisis. Its budget
was $390,000 and the Institution
was going nowhere. Easton Roth
well had retired as Director to
become President of Mills Col
lege, though many observers still
suggest he was pushed out by
Herbert Hoover because he
couldn't raise funds, and pro
tected liberal scholars working
in the library.
When Campbell was appointed
he immediately sought ways to

raisc funds. One method was
through publications. Since its
earliest days, the library had
published a few titles each year.
This reached a peak during the
19305, but became practically ex
tinct during the '50s. Campbell
rapidly enlarged this depart
ment. By 1962 the Institution was
publishing over 30 books a year.
At the same time, Campbell
began to concentrate on estab
lishing a large and active re
search staff.
The results were soon appar
ent. Foundations, especially the
Ford, and private donors around
the country, began to pour mon
ey into the Institution.
Use Funds Productively
Speaking of this phenomenon,
Campbell says, "Most people
think it's impossible to get funds
for a library. That's not so, but
to get them you have to show
they are going to be used pro
ductively, such as in a research
and publications program."

With the gifts, the programs
grew and the gifts in turn en
larged. In 1966-67, the Institu
tion received over $1,600,000 in
gifts and grants. At the same
time, over 100 research projects
are in progress and the Institu
tion has it owns large hierarchy
of researchers.
Today controversy centers on
these researchers more than the
Institution's philosophy. As a
whole, some critics still claim the
atmosphere isn't conducive to ob
jective study.
One professor of Political Sci
ence at Stanford said, "There is
no pressure for objectivity at
Hoover." Another commented:
"As long as they have the schol
ars they do now, nothing positive
will come out of Hoover."
There seems to be no factual
support for charges of any actual
interference by Institution ad
ministrators in the work of re
searchers.

Theodore Draper has been a
research fellow at Hoover for
four years, during which he has
written four books. His most re
cently published work is The
Abuse of Power, an analysis of
America's policy in Vietnam,
about which he is strongly criti
cal.
He said in a recent interview,
"I have had no interference from
anyone. I do nothing but my own
work and it's done just as I
please. I tell publishers and mag
azines to send copies of my ma
terial to Hoover. They see noth
ing until it's published."
Draper is going to Yale this
January as a visiting professor
for six months. Ho plans to re
turn to Hoover where he has a
contract for three more years.
Many scholars consider Dra
per's presence at Hoover a token
concession to the liberal point of
view. They argue that the Insti
tution uses Draper's presence to

fend off liberal criticism of right
wing bias in the staff.
Most charges of such bias are
directed at Stefan Possony, Di
rector of the International Stud
ies Program at Hoover. He came
to Hoover in 1961 from George
town University, where he was a
professor.
His actions have led numerous
scholars to question not so much
his conservative views as the
propriety of his using a sup
posedly academic institution for
a broadcasting platform.
They cite his active participa
tion in the Goldwater presiden
tial campaign, his defense of
South African apartheid, and his
contributions to Air Force proj
ects.
Possony suggests that not all
the charges are true. "I did not
work for Barry Goldwater. I sent
in occasional suggestions, but
never left the Hoover staff."
