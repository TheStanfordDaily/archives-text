# Controversy Dominates Hoover Research
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per
cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43
percent of the budget.
This change signaled a shift in
direction at Hoover, making it,
as Director Glenn Campbell de
scribes, "more and more a center
for advanced study."
Controversy has grown with
the advanced study. The Hoover
staff includes spokesmen for dia
metrically opposed political view
points such as Stefan Possony,
famous for his ultra-conserva
tism, and Theodore Draper, a
leading writer with liberal views.
Possony is the object of nu
merous attacks for his active po
litical and military affiliations.
It has been suggested, in fact,
that except for a few individuals
such as Draper, the Hoover re
search and publications program
is an organ for anti-communist
propaganda.
Flare-up in 1960's
Part of this claim is based on
a flare-up in the early 19605. In
1959 the Stanford Board of Trus
tees passed a resolution concern
ing the relationship of the Uni
versity and the Institution. At
tached to this resolution was a
preface written by Herbert Hoo
ver. He wrote, in part:
"The purpose of this Institu

tion must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx—whether Communism, So
cialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus to protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It seems that this preface
didn't come to the public's atten
tion until early in 1960. In the
March 29th and 30th issues of
The Daily, it appeared in print
though the exact sequence of
events is unclear.
Faculty Protests
Evidently some time earlier in
the year, the faculty saw the
preface and violently protested.
At a February meeting of the
Board, the Trustees adopted a
statement noting that the preface
was not meant to be part of the
resolution, but rather only Hoo
ver's personal evaluation of
goals. In the same statement, the
Trustees said they stood for free
inquiry at Hoover.
The March 29th issue of the
Daily included an interview with
Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx
ism, and I hope we expose them."
Campbell was Herbert Hoo

ver's last appointee as Director of
the Institution. A Canadian by
birth, Campbell came to the In
stitution from The American En
terprise Institute for Public Pol
icy Research in Washington,
where he had been Research Di
rector. The Institute does studies
on recent major legislation.
Since his appointment at Hoo
ver, the Institution has grown
rapidly, bringing with it contin
uing controversy.
Financial Crises
In 1959 the Hoover Institution
faced a financial crisis. Its budget
was $390,000 and the Institution
was going nowhere. Easton Roth
well had retired as Director to
become President of Mills Col
lege, though many observers still
suggest he was pushed out by
Herbert Hoover because he
couldn't raise funds, and pro
tected liberal scholars working
in the library.
When Campbell was appointed
he immediately sought ways to

raisc funds. One method was
through publications. Since its
earliest days, the library had
published a few titles each year.
This reached a peak during the
19305, but became practically ex
tinct during the '50s. Campbell
rapidly enlarged this depart
ment. By 1962 the Institution was
publishing over 30 books a year.
At the same time, Campbell
began to concentrate on estab
lishing a large and active re
search staff.
The results were soon appar
ent. Foundations, especially the
Ford, and private donors around
the country, began to pour mon
ey into the Institution.
Use Funds Productively
Speaking of this phenomenon,
Campbell says, "Most people
think it's impossible to get funds
for a library. That's not so, but
to get them you have to show
they are going to be used pro
ductively, such as in a research
and publications program."

With the gifts, the programs
grew and the gifts in turn en
larged. In 1966-67, the Institu
tion received over $1,600,000 in
gifts and grants. At the same
time, over 100 research projects
are in progress and the Institu
tion has it owns large hierarchy
of researchers.
Today controversy centers on
these researchers more than the
Institution's philosophy. As a
whole, some critics still claim the
atmosphere isn't conducive to ob
jective study.
One professor of Political Sci
ence at Stanford said, "There is
no pressure for objectivity at
Hoover." Another commented:
"As long as they have the schol
ars they do now, nothing positive
will come out of Hoover."
There seems to be no factual
support for charges of any actual
interference by Institution ad
ministrators in the work of re
searchers.

Theodore Draper has been a
research fellow at Hoover for
four years, during which he has
written four books. His most re
cently published work is The
Abuse of Power, an analysis of
America's policy in Vietnam,
about which he is strongly criti
cal.
He said in a recent interview,
"I have had no interference from
anyone. I do nothing but my own
work and it's done just as I
please. I tell publishers and mag
azines to send copies of my ma
terial to Hoover. They see noth
ing until it's published."
Draper is going to Yale this
January as a visiting professor
for six months. Ho plans to re
turn to Hoover where he has a
contract for three more years.
Many scholars consider Dra
per's presence at Hoover a token
concession to the liberal point of
view. They argue that the Insti
tution uses Draper's presence to

fend off liberal criticism of right
wing bias in the staff.
Most charges of such bias are
directed at Stefan Possony, Di
rector of the International Stud
ies Program at Hoover. He came
to Hoover in 1961 from George
town University, where he was a
professor.
His actions have led numerous
scholars to question not so much
his conservative views as the
propriety of his using a sup
posedly academic institution for
a broadcasting platform.
They cite his active participa
tion in the Goldwater presiden
tial campaign, his defense of
South African apartheid, and his
contributions to Air Force proj
ects.
Possony suggests that not all
the charges are true. "I did not
work for Barry Goldwater. I sent
in occasional suggestions, but
never left the Hoover staff."
Part of the apartheid case con-
cerns a letter he sent to the New
York Times in November, 1965.
Possony wrote in part, "In brief,
there is no legally persuasive
evidence to substantiate the al
legations of oppression which
Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the
House Armed Services Commit
tee prepared by the American
Security Council, a privately run
group. Possony is on its Board of
Directors. The recommendations,
entitled, "The Changing Strate
gic Military Balance: USA vs.
USSR," were made by a 17 man
committee. Fourteen were mili
tary men, none of lower rank
than Lt. General or Vice Admir
al, two were "professors" includ
ing Possony, and a third civilian
was the physicist Dr. Edward
Teller, a well known hawk.
Political Objectivity
Possony defended his political
objectivity in a recent interview.
"I supported both a Republican
and a Democrat in 1964. I voted
for Goldwater, but I also backed
Senator Thomas Dodd, a Demo
crat from Connecticut." Dodd
was censured by the Senate this
year for ethical irregularities.
A Stanford Professor of His
tory termed Possony, "a great
misfortune." Campbell defends
his staff member. Asked about,
"Mr. Possony's activities," Camp
bell said, "Please refer to him as
Dr. Possony. The only thing that
distinguishes him from other
faculty members is that he dis
agrees with them. Others should
look at their own glass houses.
Possony's position is perfectly
reasonable."
As part of its research pro
gram, Hoover has begun to take
on government contracts. Most
recently it finished a report on
arms control for the Far East
prepared for the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency.
This is the largest contract Hoo

ver has accepted, but others may
be in the offing.
Government Contracts
Campbell says that the only
thing that might substantially
enlarge the research program
would be government contracts.
He notes, however, that, "Hoover
is not. in the contract business.
We take .only contracts that fit
into our research and publica
tions program."
All Hoover contracts must pass
through regular University
clearing channels.
The Hoover Institution expand
ed publications program is di
rected by Karol Maichel who is
also curator of the Eastern Eu
rope collection. Maichel points
out that Hoover is neither a com
mercial publisher nor a regular
university press.
Most Institution books are pub
lished under Hoover imprint by
other presses such as Stanford,
Praeger, Chicago, Cambridge,
etc. Some books are printed in
foreign countries to lower their
retail price in the United States.
Hoover critics suggest prices
are inflated anyway. One person,
involved in Hoover publications
said their recent book, The Poli

tics of the Chinese Red Army was
intentionally printed in large
type and on extra thick paper so
the price could be raised. The
book sells for $35.00.
Low Aeadcmic Standards
Many members of the academ
ic community claim the level of
Hoover books is far below even
mediocre academic standards.
They suggest the books are heav
ily weighted toward anti-commu
nist propaganda.
Maichel outlined the require
ments a book needs for publica
tion by Hoover. "It must be read
by two Hoover people, and then
by two people outside Hoover,
unless it is written by a Hoover
person. In that case, all four
readers come from outside the
Institution. If any of these peo
ple question the objectivity or
value of a book, its chances of
publication are very small."
Writers are not told who reads
their books and Maichel would
not name any readers Hoover has
used.
One of the Institution's special
ities is printing bibliographies
for scholars. These books at
tempt to give a scholar one
source for finding all other

sources on a particular topic. For
example there is the Guide to
Russian Reference Books pre
pared by Maichel.
Ambitious Project
The most ambitious publica
tion project at Hoover is the
Yearbook On International Com
munist Affairs. The editor is
Richard V. Allen, who formerly
headed the Center for Strategic
Studies at Georgetown Univer
sity.
The yearbook will be an over
view of the year's activities and
thoughts in communist parties
around the world. Material on 90
parties will be included in over
1000 pages of material. Allen de
scribes it as, "a compendium
without judgement."
Allen is one of the more out
spoken Hoover staff members.
He testified before Congress
against ratification of the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. Consular Treaty. He has
written several books on commu
nism, including Peace or Peace
ful Coexistence written for the
American Bar Association Stand
ing Committee on Education
Against Communism.
Hoover finances and adminis
tration will be examined to
morrow.
In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per
cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43

there is no legally persuasive
evidence to substantiate the al
legations of oppression which
Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the
House Armed Services Commit
tee prepared by the American
Security Council, a privately run
group. Possony is on its Board of
Directors. The recommendations,
entitled, "The Changing Strate
gic Military Balance: USA vs.
USSR," were made by a 17 man
committee. Fourteen were mili
tary men, none of lower rank
than Lt. General or Vice Admir
al, two were "professors" includ
ing Possony, and a third civilian
was the physicist Dr. Edward
Teller, a well known hawk.
Political Objectivity
Possony defended his political
objectivity in a recent interview.
"I supported both a Republican
and a Democrat in 1964. I voted
for Goldwater, but I also backed
Senator Thomas Dodd, a Demo
crat from Connecticut." Dodd
was censured by the Senate this
year for ethical irregularities.
A Stanford Professor of His
tory termed Possony, "a great
misfortune." Campbell defends
his staff member. Asked about,
"Mr. Possony's activities," Camp
bell said, "Please refer to him as
Dr. Possony. The only thing that
distinguishes him from other
faculty members is that he dis
agrees with them. Others should
look at their own glass houses.
Possony's position is perfectly
reasonable."
As part of its research pro
gram, Hoover has begun to take
on government contracts. Most
recently it finished a report on
arms control for the Far East
prepared for the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency.
This is the largest contract Hoo

ver has accepted, but others may
be in the offing.
Government Contracts
Campbell says that the only
thing that might substantially
enlarge the research program
would be government contracts.
He notes, however, that, "Hoover
is not. in the contract business.
We take .only contracts that fit
into our research and publica
tions program."
All Hoover contracts must pass
through regular University
clearing channels.
The Hoover Institution expand
ed publications program is di
rected by Karol Maichel who is
also curator of the Eastern Eu
rope collection. Maichel points
out that Hoover is neither a com
mercial publisher nor a regular
university press.
Most Institution books are pub
lished under Hoover imprint by
other presses such as Stanford,
Praeger, Chicago, Cambridge,
etc. Some books are printed in
foreign countries to lower their
retail price in the United States.
Hoover critics suggest prices
are inflated anyway. One person,
involved in Hoover publications
said their recent book, The Poli

tics of the Chinese Red Army was
intentionally printed in large
type and on extra thick paper so
the price could be raised. The
book sells for $35.00.
Low Aeadcmic Standards
Many members of the academ
ic community claim the level of
Hoover books is far below even
mediocre academic standards.
They suggest the books are heav
ily weighted toward anti-commu
nist propaganda.
Maichel outlined the require
ments a book needs for publica
tion by Hoover. "It must be read
by two Hoover people, and then
by two people outside Hoover,
unless it is written by a Hoover
person. In that case, all four
readers come from outside the
Institution. If any of these peo
ple question the objectivity or
value of a book, its chances of
publication are very small."
Writers are not told who reads
their books and Maichel would
not name any readers Hoover has
used.
One of the Institution's special
ities is printing bibliographies
for scholars. These books at
tempt to give a scholar one
source for finding all other

sources on a particular topic. For
example there is the Guide to
Russian Reference Books pre
pared by Maichel.
Ambitious Project
The most ambitious publica
tion project at Hoover is the
Yearbook On International Com
munist Affairs. The editor is
Richard V. Allen, who formerly
headed the Center for Strategic
Studies at Georgetown Univer
sity.
The yearbook will be an over
view of the year's activities and
thoughts in communist parties
around the world. Material on 90
parties will be included in over
1000 pages of material. Allen de
scribes it as, "a compendium
without judgement."
Allen is one of the more out
spoken Hoover staff members.
He testified before Congress
against ratification of the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. Consular Treaty. He has
written several books on commu
nism, including Peace or Peace
ful Coexistence written for the
American Bar Association Stand
ing Committee on Education
Against Communism.
Hoover finances and adminis
tration will be examined to
morrow.
In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per
cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43
percent of the budget.
This change signaled a shift in
direction at Hoover, making it,
as Director Glenn Campbell de
scribes, "more and more a center
for advanced study."
Controversy has grown with
the advanced study. The Hoover
staff includes spokesmen for dia
metrically opposed political view
points such as Stefan Possony,
famous for his ultra-conserva
tism, and Theodore Draper, a
leading writer with liberal views.
Possony is the object of nu
merous attacks for his active po
litical and military affiliations.
It has been suggested, in fact,
that except for a few individuals
such as Draper, the Hoover re
search and publications program
is an organ for anti-communist
propaganda.
Flare-up in 1960's
Part of this claim is based on
a flare-up in the early 19605. In
1959 the Stanford Board of Trus
tees passed a resolution concern
ing the relationship of the Uni
versity and the Institution. At
tached to this resolution was a
preface written by Herbert Hoo
ver. He wrote, in part:
"The purpose of this Institu

tion must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx—whether Communism, So
cialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus to protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It seems that this preface
didn't come to the public's atten
tion until early in 1960. In the
March 29th and 30th issues of
The Daily, it appeared in print
though the exact sequence of
events is unclear.
Faculty Protests
Evidently some time earlier in
the year, the faculty saw the
preface and violently protested.
At a February meeting of the
Board, the Trustees adopted a
statement noting that the preface
was not meant to be part of the
resolution, but rather only Hoo
ver's personal evaluation of
goals. In the same statement, the
Trustees said they stood for free
inquiry at Hoover.
The March 29th issue of the
Daily included an interview with
Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx
ism, and I hope we expose them."
Campbell was Herbert Hoo

ver's last appointee as Director of
the Institution. A Canadian by
birth, Campbell came to the In
stitution from The American En
terprise Institute for Public Pol
icy Research in Washington,
where he had been Research Di
rector. The Institute does studies
on recent major legislation.
Since his appointment at Hoo
ver, the Institution has grown
rapidly, bringing with it contin
uing controversy.
Financial Crises
In 1959 the Hoover Institution
faced a financial crisis. Its budget
was $390,000 and the Institution
was going nowhere. Easton Roth
well had retired as Director to
become President of Mills Col
lege, though many observers still
suggest he was pushed out by
Herbert Hoover because he
couldn't raise funds, and pro
tected liberal scholars working
in the library.
When Campbell was appointed
he immediately sought ways to

raisc funds. One method was
through publications. Since its
earliest days, the library had
published a few titles each year.
This reached a peak during the
19305, but became practically ex
tinct during the '50s. Campbell
rapidly enlarged this depart
ment. By 1962 the Institution was
publishing over 30 books a year.
At the same time, Campbell
began to concentrate on estab
lishing a large and active re
search staff.
The results were soon appar
ent. Foundations, especially the
Ford, and private donors around
the country, began to pour mon
ey into the Institution.
Use Funds Productively
Speaking of this phenomenon,
Campbell says, "Most people
think it's impossible to get funds
for a library. That's not so, but
to get them you have to show
they are going to be used pro
ductively, such as in a research
and publications program."

With the gifts, the programs
grew and the gifts in turn en
larged. In 1966-67, the Institu
tion received over $1,600,000 in
gifts and grants. At the same
time, over 100 research projects
are in progress and the Institu
tion has it owns large hierarchy
of researchers.
Today controversy centers on
these researchers more than the
Institution's philosophy. As a
whole, some critics still claim the
atmosphere isn't conducive to ob
jective study.
One professor of Political Sci
ence at Stanford said, "There is
no pressure for objectivity at
Hoover." Another commented:
"As long as they have the schol
ars they do now, nothing positive
will come out of Hoover."
There seems to be no factual
support for charges of any actual
interference by Institution ad
ministrators in the work of re
searchers.

Theodore Draper has been a
research fellow at Hoover for
four years, during which he has
written four books. His most re
cently published work is The
Abuse of Power, an analysis of
America's policy in Vietnam,
about which he is strongly criti
cal.
He said in a recent interview,
"I have had no interference from
anyone. I do nothing but my own
work and it's done just as I
please. I tell publishers and mag
azines to send copies of my ma
terial to Hoover. They see noth
ing until it's published."
Draper is going to Yale this
January as a visiting professor
for six months. Ho plans to re
turn to Hoover where he has a
contract for three more years.
Many scholars consider Dra
per's presence at Hoover a token
concession to the liberal point of
view. They argue that the Insti
tution uses Draper's presence to

fend off liberal criticism of right
wing bias in the staff.
Most charges of such bias are
directed at Stefan Possony, Di
rector of the International Stud
ies Program at Hoover. He came
to Hoover in 1961 from George
town University, where he was a
professor.
His actions have led numerous
scholars to question not so much
his conservative views as the
propriety of his using a sup
posedly academic institution for
a broadcasting platform.
They cite his active participa
tion in the Goldwater presiden
tial campaign, his defense of
South African apartheid, and his
contributions to Air Force proj
ects.
Possony suggests that not all
the charges are true. "I did not
work for Barry Goldwater. I sent
in occasional suggestions, but
never left the Hoover staff."
Part of the apartheid case con-
cerns a letter he sent to the New
York Times in November, 1965.
Possony wrote in part, "In brief,
there is no legally persuasive
evidence to substantiate the al
legations of oppression which
Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the
House Armed Services Commit
tee prepared by the American
Security Council, a privately run
group. Possony is on its Board of
Directors. The recommendations,
entitled, "The Changing Strate
gic Military Balance: USA vs.
USSR," were made by a 17 man
committee. Fourteen were mili
tary men, none of lower rank
than Lt. General or Vice Admir
al, two were "professors" includ
ing Possony, and a third civilian
was the physicist Dr. Edward
Teller, a well known hawk.

objectivity in a recent interview.

Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx
ism, and I hope we expose them."
Campbell was Herbert Hoo

ver's last appointee as Director of
the Institution. A Canadian by
birth, Campbell came to the In
stitution from The American En
terprise Institute for Public Pol
icy Research in Washington,
where he had been Research Di
rector. The Institute does studies
on recent major legislation.
Since his appointment at Hoo
ver, the Institution has grown
rapidly, bringing with it contin
uing controversy.
Financial Crises
In 1959 the Hoover Institution
faced a financial crisis. Its budget
was $390,000 and the Institution
was going nowhere. Easton Roth
well had retired as Director to
become President of Mills Col
lege, though many observers still
suggest he was pushed out by
Herbert Hoover because he
couldn't raise funds, and pro
tected liberal scholars working
in the library.
When Campbell was appointed
he immediately sought ways to

raisc funds. One method was
through publications. Since its
earliest days, the library had
published a few titles each year.
This reached a peak during the
19305, but became practically ex
tinct during the '50s. Campbell
rapidly enlarged this depart
ment. By 1962 the Institution was
publishing over 30 books a year.
At the same time, Campbell
began to concentrate on estab
lishing a large and active re
search staff.
The results were soon appar
ent. Foundations, especially the
Ford, and private donors around
the country, began to pour mon
ey into the Institution.
Use Funds Productively
Speaking of this phenomenon,
Campbell says, "Most people
think it's impossible to get funds
for a library. That's not so, but
to get them you have to show
they are going to be used pro
ductively, such as in a research
and publications program."

With the gifts, the programs
grew and the gifts in turn en
larged. In 1966-67, the Institu
tion received over $1,600,000 in
gifts and grants. At the same
time, over 100 research projects
are in progress and the Institu
tion has it owns large hierarchy
of researchers.
Today controversy centers on
these researchers more than the
Institution's philosophy. As a
whole, some critics still claim the
atmosphere isn't conducive to ob
jective study.
One professor of Political Sci
ence at Stanford said, "There is
no pressure for objectivity at
Hoover." Another commented:
"As long as they have the schol
ars they do now, nothing positive
will come out of Hoover."
There seems to be no factual
support for charges of any actual
interference by Institution ad
ministrators in the work of re
searchers.

Theodore Draper has been a
research fellow at Hoover for
four years, during which he has
written four books. His most re
cently published work is The
Abuse of Power, an analysis of
America's policy in Vietnam,
about which he is strongly criti
cal.
He said in a recent interview,
"I have had no interference from
anyone. I do nothing but my own
work and it's done just as I
please. I tell publishers and mag
azines to send copies of my ma
terial to Hoover. They see noth
ing until it's published."
Draper is going to Yale this
January as a visiting professor
for six months. Ho plans to re
turn to Hoover where he has a
contract for three more years.
Many scholars consider Dra
per's presence at Hoover a token
concession to the liberal point of
view. They argue that the Insti
tution uses Draper's presence to

fend off liberal criticism of right
wing bias in the staff.
Most charges of such bias are
directed at Stefan Possony, Di
rector of the International Stud
ies Program at Hoover. He came
to Hoover in 1961 from George
town University, where he was a
professor.
His actions have led numerous
scholars to question not so much
his conservative views as the
propriety of his using a sup
posedly academic institution for
a broadcasting platform.
They cite his active participa
tion in the Goldwater presiden
tial campaign, his defense of
South African apartheid, and his
contributions to Air Force proj
ects.
Possony suggests that not all
the charges are true. "I did not
work for Barry Goldwater. I sent
in occasional suggestions, but
never left the Hoover staff."
Part of the apartheid case con-
cerns a letter he sent to the New
York Times in November, 1965.
Possony wrote in part, "In brief,
there is no legally persuasive
evidence to substantiate the al
legations of oppression which
Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the
House Armed Services Commit
tee prepared by the American
Security Council, a privately run
group. Possony is on its Board of
Directors. The recommendations,
entitled, "The Changing Strate
gic Military Balance: USA vs.
USSR," were made by a 17 man
committee. Fourteen were mili
tary men, none of lower rank
than Lt. General or Vice Admir
al, two were "professors" includ
ing Possony, and a third civilian
was the physicist Dr. Edward
Teller, a well known hawk.
Political Objectivity
Possony defended his political
objectivity in a recent interview.
"I supported both a Republican
and a Democrat in 1964. I voted
for Goldwater, but I also backed
Senator Thomas Dodd, a Demo
crat from Connecticut." Dodd
was censured by the Senate this
year for ethical irregularities.
A Stanford Professor of His
tory termed Possony, "a great
misfortune." Campbell defends
his staff member. Asked about,
"Mr. Possony's activities," Camp
bell said, "Please refer to him as
Dr. Possony. The only thing that
distinguishes him from other
faculty members is that he dis
agrees with them. Others should
look at their own glass houses.
Possony's position is perfectly
reasonable."
As part of its research pro
gram, Hoover has begun to take
on government contracts. Most
recently it finished a report on
arms control for the Far East
prepared for the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency.
This is the largest contract Hoo

ver has accepted, but others may
be in the offing.
Government Contracts
Campbell says that the only
thing that might substantially
enlarge the research program
would be government contracts.
He notes, however, that, "Hoover
is not. in the contract business.
We take .only contracts that fit
into our research and publica
tions program."
All Hoover contracts must pass
through regular University
clearing channels.
The Hoover Institution expand
ed publications program is di
rected by Karol Maichel who is
also curator of the Eastern Eu
rope collection. Maichel points
out that Hoover is neither a com
mercial publisher nor a regular
university press.
Most Institution books are pub
lished under Hoover imprint by
other presses such as Stanford,
Praeger, Chicago, Cambridge,
etc. Some books are printed in
foreign countries to lower their
retail price in the United States.
Hoover critics suggest prices
are inflated anyway. One person,
involved in Hoover publications
said their recent book, The Poli

tics of the Chinese Red Army was
intentionally printed in large
type and on extra thick paper so
the price could be raised. The
book sells for $35.00.
Low Aeadcmic Standards
Many members of the academ
ic community claim the level of
Hoover books is far below even
mediocre academic standards.
They suggest the books are heav
ily weighted toward anti-commu
nist propaganda.
Maichel outlined the require
ments a book needs for publica
tion by Hoover. "It must be read
by two Hoover people, and then
by two people outside Hoover,
unless it is written by a Hoover
person. In that case, all four
readers come from outside the
Institution. If any of these peo
ple question the objectivity or
value of a book, its chances of
publication are very small."
Writers are not told who reads
their books and Maichel would
not name any readers Hoover has
used.
One of the Institution's special
ities is printing bibliographies
for scholars. These books at
tempt to give a scholar one
source for finding all other

sources on a particular topic. For
example there is the Guide to
Russian Reference Books pre
pared by Maichel.
Ambitious Project
The most ambitious publica
tion project at Hoover is the
Yearbook On International Com
munist Affairs. The editor is
Richard V. Allen, who formerly
headed the Center for Strategic
Studies at Georgetown Univer
sity.
The yearbook will be an over
view of the year's activities and
thoughts in communist parties
around the world. Material on 90
parties will be included in over
1000 pages of material. Allen de
scribes it as, "a compendium
without judgement."
Allen is one of the more out
spoken Hoover staff members.
He testified before Congress
against ratification of the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. Consular Treaty. He has
written several books on commu
nism, including Peace or Peace
ful Coexistence written for the
American Bar Association Stand
ing Committee on Education
Against Communism.
Hoover finances and adminis
tration will be examined to
morrow.
In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per
cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43
percent of the budget.
This change signaled a shift in
direction at Hoover, making it,
as Director Glenn Campbell de
scribes, "more and more a center
for advanced study."
Controversy has grown with
the advanced study. The Hoover
staff includes spokesmen for dia
metrically opposed political view
points such as Stefan Possony,
famous for his ultra-conserva
tism, and Theodore Draper, a
leading writer with liberal views.
Possony is the object of nu
merous attacks for his active po
litical and military affiliations.
It has been suggested, in fact,
that except for a few individuals
such as Draper, the Hoover re
search and publications program
is an organ for anti-communist
propaganda.
Flare-up in 1960's
Part of this claim is based on
a flare-up in the early 19605. In
1959 the Stanford Board of Trus
tees passed a resolution concern
ing the relationship of the Uni
versity and the Institution. At
tached to this resolution was a
preface written by Herbert Hoo
ver. He wrote, in part:
"The purpose of this Institu

tion must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx—whether Communism, So
cialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus to protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It seems that this preface
didn't come to the public's atten
tion until early in 1960. In the
March 29th and 30th issues of
The Daily, it appeared in print
though the exact sequence of
events is unclear.
Faculty Protests
Evidently some time earlier in
the year, the faculty saw the
preface and violently protested.
At a February meeting of the
Board, the Trustees adopted a
statement noting that the preface
was not meant to be part of the
resolution, but rather only Hoo
ver's personal evaluation of
goals. In the same statement, the
Trustees said they stood for free
inquiry at Hoover.
The March 29th issue of the
Daily included an interview with
Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx

other presses such as Stanford,
Praeger, Chicago, Cambridge,
etc. Some books are printed in
foreign countries to lower their
retail price in the United States.
Hoover critics suggest prices
are inflated anyway. One person,
involved in Hoover publications
said their recent book, The Poli

tics of the Chinese Red Army was
intentionally printed in large
type and on extra thick paper so
the price could be raised. The
book sells for $35.00.
Low Aeadcmic Standards
Many members of the academ
ic community claim the level of
Hoover books is far below even
mediocre academic standards.
They suggest the books are heav
ily weighted toward anti-commu
nist propaganda.
Maichel outlined the require
ments a book needs for publica
tion by Hoover. "It must be read
by two Hoover people, and then
by two people outside Hoover,
unless it is written by a Hoover
person. In that case, all four
readers come from outside the
Institution. If any of these peo
ple question the objectivity or
value of a book, its chances of
publication are very small."
Writers are not told who reads
their books and Maichel would
not name any readers Hoover has
used.
One of the Institution's special
ities is printing bibliographies
for scholars. These books at
tempt to give a scholar one
source for finding all other

sources on a particular topic. For
example there is the Guide to
Russian Reference Books pre
pared by Maichel.
Ambitious Project
The most ambitious publica
tion project at Hoover is the
Yearbook On International Com
munist Affairs. The editor is
Richard V. Allen, who formerly
headed the Center for Strategic
Studies at Georgetown Univer
sity.
The yearbook will be an over
view of the year's activities and
thoughts in communist parties
around the world. Material on 90
parties will be included in over
1000 pages of material. Allen de
scribes it as, "a compendium
without judgement."
Allen is one of the more out
spoken Hoover staff members.
He testified before Congress
against ratification of the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. Consular Treaty. He has
written several books on commu
nism, including Peace or Peace
ful Coexistence written for the
American Bar Association Stand
ing Committee on Education
Against Communism.
Hoover finances and adminis
tration will be examined to
morrow.
In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per
cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43
percent of the budget.
This change signaled a shift in
direction at Hoover, making it,
as Director Glenn Campbell de
scribes, "more and more a center
for advanced study."
Controversy has grown with
the advanced study. The Hoover
staff includes spokesmen for dia
metrically opposed political view
points such as Stefan Possony,
famous for his ultra-conserva
tism, and Theodore Draper, a
leading writer with liberal views.
Possony is the object of nu
merous attacks for his active po
litical and military affiliations.
It has been suggested, in fact,
that except for a few individuals
such as Draper, the Hoover re
search and publications program
is an organ for anti-communist
propaganda.
Flare-up in 1960's
Part of this claim is based on
a flare-up in the early 19605. In
1959 the Stanford Board of Trus
tees passed a resolution concern
ing the relationship of the Uni
versity and the Institution. At
tached to this resolution was a
preface written by Herbert Hoo
ver. He wrote, in part:
"The purpose of this Institu

tion must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx—whether Communism, So
cialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus to protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It seems that this preface
didn't come to the public's atten
tion until early in 1960. In the
March 29th and 30th issues of
The Daily, it appeared in print
though the exact sequence of
events is unclear.
Faculty Protests
Evidently some time earlier in
the year, the faculty saw the
preface and violently protested.
At a February meeting of the
Board, the Trustees adopted a
statement noting that the preface
was not meant to be part of the
resolution, but rather only Hoo
ver's personal evaluation of
goals. In the same statement, the
Trustees said they stood for free
inquiry at Hoover.
The March 29th issue of the
Daily included an interview with
Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx
ism, and I hope we expose them."
Campbell was Herbert Hoo

ver's last appointee as Director of
the Institution. A Canadian by
birth, Campbell came to the In
stitution from The American En
terprise Institute for Public Pol
icy Research in Washington,
where he had been Research Di
rector. The Institute does studies
on recent major legislation.
Since his appointment at Hoo
ver, the Institution has grown
rapidly, bringing with it contin
uing controversy.
Financial Crises
In 1959 the Hoover Institution
faced a financial crisis. Its budget
was $390,000 and the Institution
was going nowhere. Easton Roth
well had retired as Director to
become President of Mills Col
lege, though many observers still
suggest he was pushed out by
Herbert Hoover because he
couldn't raise funds, and pro
tected liberal scholars working
in the library.
When Campbell was appointed
he immediately sought ways to

raisc funds. One method was
through publications. Since its
earliest days, the library had
published a few titles each year.
This reached a peak during the
19305, but became practically ex
tinct during the '50s. Campbell
rapidly enlarged this depart
ment. By 1962 the Institution was
publishing over 30 books a year.
At the same time, Campbell
began to concentrate on estab
lishing a large and active re
search staff.
The results were soon appar
ent. Foundations, especially the
Ford, and private donors around
the country, began to pour mon
ey into the Institution.
Use Funds Productively
Speaking of this phenomenon,
Campbell says, "Most people
think it's impossible to get funds
for a library. That's not so, but
to get them you have to show
they are going to be used pro
ductively, such as in a research
and publications program."

With the gifts, the programs
grew and the gifts in turn en
larged. In 1966-67, the Institu
tion received over $1,600,000 in
gifts and grants. At the same
time, over 100 research projects
are in progress and the Institu
tion has it owns large hierarchy
of researchers.
Today controversy centers on
these researchers more than the
Institution's philosophy. As a
whole, some critics still claim the
atmosphere isn't conducive to ob
jective study.
One professor of Political Sci
ence at Stanford said, "There is
no pressure for objectivity at
Hoover." Another commented:
"As long as they have the schol
ars they do now, nothing positive
will come out of Hoover."
There seems to be no factual
support for charges of any actual
interference by Institution ad
ministrators in the work of re
searchers.

Theodore Draper has been a
research fellow at Hoover for
four years, during which he has
written four books. His most re
cently published work is The
Abuse of Power, an analysis of
America's policy in Vietnam,
about which he is strongly criti
cal.
He said in a recent interview,
"I have had no interference from
anyone. I do nothing but my own
work and it's done just as I
please. I tell publishers and mag
azines to send copies of my ma
terial to Hoover. They see noth
ing until it's published."
Draper is going to Yale this
January as a visiting professor
for six months. Ho plans to re
turn to Hoover where he has a
contract for three more years.
Many scholars consider Dra
per's presence at Hoover a token
concession to the liberal point of
view. They argue that the Insti
tution uses Draper's presence to

fend off liberal criticism of right
wing bias in the staff.
Most charges of such bias are
directed at Stefan Possony, Di
rector of the International Stud
ies Program at Hoover. He came
to Hoover in 1961 from George
town University, where he was a
professor.
His actions have led numerous
scholars to question not so much
his conservative views as the
propriety of his using a sup
posedly academic institution for
a broadcasting platform.
They cite his active participa
tion in the Goldwater presiden
tial campaign, his defense of
South African apartheid, and his
contributions to Air Force proj
ects.
Possony suggests that not all
the charges are true. "I did not
work for Barry Goldwater. I sent
in occasional suggestions, but
never left the Hoover staff."
Part of the apartheid case con-
cerns a letter he sent to the New
York Times in November, 1965.
Possony wrote in part, "In brief,
there is no legally persuasive
evidence to substantiate the al
legations of oppression which
Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the
House Armed Services Commit
tee prepared by the American
Security Council, a privately run
group. Possony is on its Board of
Directors. The recommendations,
entitled, "The Changing Strate
gic Military Balance: USA vs.
USSR," were made by a 17 man
committee. Fourteen were mili
tary men, none of lower rank
than Lt. General or Vice Admir
al, two were "professors" includ
ing Possony, and a third civilian
was the physicist Dr. Edward
Teller, a well known hawk.
Political Objectivity
Possony defended his political
objectivity in a recent interview.
"I supported both a Republican
and a Democrat in 1964. I voted
for Goldwater, but I also backed
Senator Thomas Dodd, a Demo
crat from Connecticut." Dodd
was censured by the Senate this
year for ethical irregularities.
A Stanford Professor of His
tory termed Possony, "a great
misfortune." Campbell defends
his staff member. Asked about,
"Mr. Possony's activities," Camp
bell said, "Please refer to him as
Dr. Possony. The only thing that
distinguishes him from other
faculty members is that he dis
agrees with them. Others should
look at their own glass houses.
Possony's position is perfectly
reasonable."
As part of its research pro
gram, Hoover has begun to take
on government contracts. Most
recently it finished a report on
arms control for the Far East
prepared for the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency.
This is the largest contract Hoo

ver has accepted, but others may
be in the offing.
Government Contracts
Campbell says that the only
thing that might substantially
enlarge the research program
would be government contracts.
He notes, however, that, "Hoover
is not. in the contract business.
We take .only contracts that fit
into our research and publica
tions program."
All Hoover contracts must pass
through regular University
clearing channels.
The Hoover Institution expand
ed publications program is di
rected by Karol Maichel who is
also curator of the Eastern Eu
rope collection. Maichel points
out that Hoover is neither a com
mercial publisher nor a regular
university press.
Most Institution books are pub
lished under Hoover imprint by
other presses such as Stanford,
Praeger, Chicago, Cambridge,
etc. Some books are printed in
foreign countries to lower their

Hoover critics suggest prices

Many members of the academ

Hoover books is far below even

The most ambitious publica

was censured by the Senate this

As part of its research pro

on government contracts. Most
recently it finished a report on

Campbell says that the only

would be government contracts.
He notes, however, that, "Hoover

All Hoover contracts must pass
through regular University

In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per
cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43
percent of the budget.
This change signaled a shift in
direction at Hoover, making it,
as Director Glenn Campbell de
scribes, "more and more a center
for advanced study."
Controversy has grown with
the advanced study. The Hoover
staff includes spokesmen for dia
metrically opposed political view
points such as Stefan Possony,
famous for his ultra-conserva
tism, and Theodore Draper, a
leading writer with liberal views.
Possony is the object of nu
merous attacks for his active po
litical and military affiliations.
It has been suggested, in fact,
that except for a few individuals
such as Draper, the Hoover re
search and publications program
is an organ for anti-communist
propaganda.
Flare-up in 1960's
Part of this claim is based on
a flare-up in the early 19605. In
1959 the Stanford Board of Trus
tees passed a resolution concern
ing the relationship of the Uni
versity and the Institution. At
tached to this resolution was a
preface written by Herbert Hoo
ver. He wrote, in part:
"The purpose of this Institu

tion must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx—whether Communism, So
cialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus to protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It seems that this preface
didn't come to the public's atten
tion until early in 1960. In the
March 29th and 30th issues of
The Daily, it appeared in print
though the exact sequence of
events is unclear.
Faculty Protests
Evidently some time earlier in
the year, the faculty saw the
preface and violently protested.
At a February meeting of the
Board, the Trustees adopted a
statement noting that the preface
was not meant to be part of the
resolution, but rather only Hoo
ver's personal evaluation of
goals. In the same statement, the
Trustees said they stood for free
inquiry at Hoover.
The March 29th issue of the
Daily included an interview with
Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx
ism, and I hope we expose them."
Campbell was Herbert Hoo

ver's last appointee as Director of
the Institution. A Canadian by
birth, Campbell came to the In
stitution from The American En
terprise Institute for Public Pol
icy Research in Washington,
where he had been Research Di
rector. The Institute does studies
on recent major legislation.
Since his appointment at Hoo
ver, the Institution has grown
rapidly, bringing with it contin
uing controversy.
Financial Crises
In 1959 the Hoover Institution
faced a financial crisis. Its budget
was $390,000 and the Institution
was going nowhere. Easton Roth
well had retired as Director to
become President of Mills Col
lege, though many observers still
suggest he was pushed out by
Herbert Hoover because he
couldn't raise funds, and pro
tected liberal scholars working
in the library.
When Campbell was appointed
he immediately sought ways to

raisc funds. One method was
through publications. Since its
earliest days, the library had
published a few titles each year.
This reached a peak during the
19305, but became practically ex
tinct during the '50s. Campbell
rapidly enlarged this depart
ment. By 1962 the Institution was
publishing over 30 books a year.
At the same time, Campbell
began to concentrate on estab
lishing a large and active re
search staff.
The results were soon appar
ent. Foundations, especially the
Ford, and private donors around
the country, began to pour mon
ey into the Institution.
Use Funds Productively
Speaking of this phenomenon,
Campbell says, "Most people
think it's impossible to get funds
for a library. That's not so, but
to get them you have to show
they are going to be used pro
ductively, such as in a research
and publications program."

With the gifts, the programs
grew and the gifts in turn en
larged. In 1966-67, the Institu
tion received over $1,600,000 in
gifts and grants. At the same
time, over 100 research projects
are in progress and the Institu
tion has it owns large hierarchy
of researchers.
Today controversy centers on
these researchers more than the
Institution's philosophy. As a
whole, some critics still claim the
atmosphere isn't conducive to ob
jective study.
One professor of Political Sci
ence at Stanford said, "There is
no pressure for objectivity at
Hoover." Another commented:
"As long as they have the schol
ars they do now, nothing positive
will come out of Hoover."
There seems to be no factual
support for charges of any actual
interference by Institution ad
ministrators in the work of re
searchers.

Theodore Draper has been a
research fellow at Hoover for
four years, during which he has
written four books. His most re
cently published work is The
Abuse of Power, an analysis of
America's policy in Vietnam,
about which he is strongly criti
cal.
He said in a recent interview,
"I have had no interference from
anyone. I do nothing but my own
work and it's done just as I
please. I tell publishers and mag
azines to send copies of my ma
terial to Hoover. They see noth
ing until it's published."
Draper is going to Yale this
January as a visiting professor
for six months. Ho plans to re
turn to Hoover where he has a
contract for three more years.
Many scholars consider Dra
per's presence at Hoover a token
concession to the liberal point of
view. They argue that the Insti
tution uses Draper's presence to

fend off liberal criticism of right
wing bias in the staff.
Most charges of such bias are
directed at Stefan Possony, Di
rector of the International Stud
ies Program at Hoover. He came
to Hoover in 1961 from George
town University, where he was a
professor.
His actions have led numerous
scholars to question not so much
his conservative views as the
propriety of his using a sup
posedly academic institution for
a broadcasting platform.
They cite his active participa
tion in the Goldwater presiden
tial campaign, his defense of
South African apartheid, and his
contributions to Air Force proj
ects.
Possony suggests that not all
the charges are true. "I did not
work for Barry Goldwater. I sent
in occasional suggestions, but
never left the Hoover staff."
Part of the apartheid case con-
cerns a letter he sent to the New
York Times in November, 1965.
Possony wrote in part, "In brief,
there is no legally persuasive
evidence to substantiate the al
legations of oppression which
Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the

cent of its budget in research and
publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43
percent of the budget.
This change signaled a shift in
direction at Hoover, making it,
as Director Glenn Campbell de
scribes, "more and more a center
for advanced study."
Controversy has grown with
the advanced study. The Hoover
staff includes spokesmen for dia
metrically opposed political view
points such as Stefan Possony,
famous for his ultra-conserva
tism, and Theodore Draper, a
leading writer with liberal views.
Possony is the object of nu
merous attacks for his active po
litical and military affiliations.
It has been suggested, in fact,
that except for a few individuals
such as Draper, the Hoover re
search and publications program
is an organ for anti-communist
propaganda.
Flare-up in 1960's
Part of this claim is based on
a flare-up in the early 19605. In
1959 the Stanford Board of Trus
tees passed a resolution concern
ing the relationship of the Uni
versity and the Institution. At
tached to this resolution was a
preface written by Herbert Hoo
ver. He wrote, in part:
"The purpose of this Institu

tion must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx—whether Communism, So
cialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus to protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It seems that this preface
didn't come to the public's atten
tion until early in 1960. In the
March 29th and 30th issues of
The Daily, it appeared in print
though the exact sequence of
events is unclear.
Faculty Protests
Evidently some time earlier in
the year, the faculty saw the
preface and violently protested.
At a February meeting of the
Board, the Trustees adopted a
statement noting that the preface
was not meant to be part of the
resolution, but rather only Hoo
ver's personal evaluation of
goals. In the same statement, the
Trustees said they stood for free
inquiry at Hoover.
The March 29th issue of the
Daily included an interview with
Campbell, who had just been ap
pointed Director on January Ist.
Asked about the preface, he is
quoted as saying, "I see nothing
wrong with it, do you?" He also
said, "There are evils in Marx
ism, and I hope we expose them."
Campbell was Herbert Hoo

ver's last appointee as Director of
the Institution. A Canadian by
birth, Campbell came to the In
stitution from The American En
terprise Institute for Public Pol
icy Research in Washington,
where he had been Research Di
rector. The Institute does studies
on recent major legislation.
Since his appointment at Hoo
ver, the Institution has grown
rapidly, bringing with it contin
uing controversy.
Financial Crises
In 1959 the Hoover Institution
faced a financial crisis. Its budget
was $390,000 and the Institution
was going nowhere. Easton Roth
well had retired as Director to
become President of Mills Col
lege, though many observers still
suggest he was pushed out by
Herbert Hoover because he
couldn't raise funds, and pro
tected liberal scholars working
in the library.
When Campbell was appointed
he immediately sought ways to

raisc funds. One method was
through publications. Since its
earliest days, the library had
published a few titles each year.
This reached a peak during the
19305, but became practically ex
tinct during the '50s. Campbell
rapidly enlarged this depart
ment. By 1962 the Institution was
publishing over 30 books a year.
At the same time, Campbell
began to concentrate on estab
lishing a large and active re
search staff.
The results were soon appar
ent. Foundations, especially the
Ford, and private donors around
the country, began to pour mon
ey into the Institution.
Use Funds Productively
Speaking of this phenomenon,
Campbell says, "Most people
think it's impossible to get funds
for a library. That's not so, but
to get them you have to show
they are going to be used pro
ductively, such as in a research
and publications program."

With the gifts, the programs
grew and the gifts in turn en
larged. In 1966-67, the Institu
tion received over $1,600,000 in
gifts and grants. At the same
time, over 100 research projects
are in progress and the Institu
tion has it owns large hierarchy
of researchers.
Today controversy centers on
these researchers more than the
Institution's philosophy. As a
whole, some critics still claim the
atmosphere isn't conducive to ob
jective study.
One professor of Political Sci
ence at Stanford said, "There is
no pressure for objectivity at
Hoover." Another commented:
"As long as they have the schol
ars they do now, nothing positive
will come out of Hoover."
There seems to be no factual
support for charges of any actual
interference by Institution ad
ministrators in the work of re
searchers.

Theodore Draper has been a
research fellow at Hoover for
four years, during which he has
written four books. His most re
cently published work is The
Abuse of Power, an analysis of
America's policy in Vietnam,
about which he is strongly criti
cal.
He said in a recent interview,
"I have had no interference from
anyone. I do nothing but my own
work and it's done just as I
please. I tell publishers and mag
azines to send copies of my ma
terial to Hoover. They see noth
ing until it's published."
Draper is going to Yale this
January as a visiting professor
for six months. Ho plans to re
turn to Hoover where he has a
contract for three more years.
Many scholars consider Dra
per's presence at Hoover a token
concession to the liberal point of
view. They argue that the Insti
tution uses Draper's presence to

fend off liberal criticism of right
wing bias in the staff.
Most charges of such bias are
directed at Stefan Possony, Di
rector of the International Stud
ies Program at Hoover. He came
to Hoover in 1961 from George
town University, where he was a
professor.
His actions have led numerous
scholars to question not so much
his conservative views as the
propriety of his using a sup
posedly academic institution for
a broadcasting platform.
They cite his active participa
tion in the Goldwater presiden
tial campaign, his defense of
South African apartheid, and his
contributions to Air Force proj
ects.
Possony suggests that not all
the charges are true. "I did not
work for Barry Goldwater. I sent
in occasional suggestions, but
never left the Hoover staff."
Part of the apartheid case con-
cerns a letter he sent to the New
York Times in November, 1965.
Possony wrote in part, "In brief,
there is no legally persuasive
evidence to substantiate the al
legations of oppression which
Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the
House Armed Services Commit
tee prepared by the American
Security Council, a privately run
group. Possony is on its Board of
Directors. The recommendations,
entitled, "The Changing Strate
gic Military Balance: USA vs.
USSR," were made by a 17 man
committee. Fourteen were mili
tary men, none of lower rank
than Lt. General or Vice Admir
al, two were "professors" includ
ing Possony, and a third civilian
was the physicist Dr. Edward
Teller, a well known hawk.
Political Objectivity
Possony defended his political
objectivity in a recent interview.
"I supported both a Republican
and a Democrat in 1964. I voted
for Goldwater, but I also backed
Senator Thomas Dodd, a Demo
crat from Connecticut." Dodd
was censured by the Senate this
year for ethical irregularities.
A Stanford Professor of His
tory termed Possony, "a great
misfortune." Campbell defends
his staff member. Asked about,
"Mr. Possony's activities," Camp
bell said, "Please refer to him as
Dr. Possony. The only thing that
distinguishes him from other
faculty members is that he dis
agrees with them. Others should
look at their own glass houses.
Possony's position is perfectly
reasonable."
As part of its research pro
gram, Hoover has begun to take
on government contracts. Most
recently it finished a report on
arms control for the Far East
prepared for the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency.
This is the largest contract Hoo

ver has accepted, but others may
be in the offing.
Government Contracts
Campbell says that the only
thing that might substantially
enlarge the research program
would be government contracts.
He notes, however, that, "Hoover
is not. in the contract business.
We take .only contracts that fit
into our research and publica
tions program."
All Hoover contracts must pass
through regular University
clearing channels.
The Hoover Institution expand
ed publications program is di
rected by Karol Maichel who is
also curator of the Eastern Eu
rope collection. Maichel points
out that Hoover is neither a com
mercial publisher nor a regular
university press.
Most Institution books are pub
lished under Hoover imprint by
other presses such as Stanford,
Praeger, Chicago, Cambridge,
etc. Some books are printed in
foreign countries to lower their
retail price in the United States.
Hoover critics suggest prices
are inflated anyway. One person,
involved in Hoover publications
said their recent book, The Poli

tics of the Chinese Red Army was
intentionally printed in large
type and on extra thick paper so
the price could be raised. The
book sells for $35.00.
Low Aeadcmic Standards
Many members of the academ
ic community claim the level of
Hoover books is far below even
mediocre academic standards.
They suggest the books are heav
ily weighted toward anti-commu
nist propaganda.
Maichel outlined the require
ments a book needs for publica
tion by Hoover. "It must be read
by two Hoover people, and then
by two people outside Hoover,
unless it is written by a Hoover
person. In that case, all four
readers come from outside the
Institution. If any of these peo
ple question the objectivity or
value of a book, its chances of
publication are very small."
Writers are not told who reads
their books and Maichel would
not name any readers Hoover has
used.
One of the Institution's special
ities is printing bibliographies
for scholars. These books at
tempt to give a scholar one
source for finding all other

sources on a particular topic. For
example there is the Guide to
Russian Reference Books pre
pared by Maichel.
Ambitious Project
The most ambitious publica
tion project at Hoover is the
Yearbook On International Com
munist Affairs. The editor is
Richard V. Allen, who formerly
headed the Center for Strategic
Studies at Georgetown Univer
sity.
The yearbook will be an over
view of the year's activities and
thoughts in communist parties
around the world. Material on 90
parties will be included in over
1000 pages of material. Allen de
scribes it as, "a compendium
without judgement."
Allen is one of the more out
spoken Hoover staff members.
He testified before Congress
against ratification of the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. Consular Treaty. He has
written several books on commu
nism, including Peace or Peace
ful Coexistence written for the
American Bar Association Stand
ing Committee on Education
Against Communism.
Hoover finances and adminis
tration will be examined to
morrow.
In 1959-60 the Hoover Institu
tion invested $38,000 or 10 per

publications. By 1964-65 that fig
ure had jumped to $533,000 or 43

Liberia and Ethopia initially pre
sented to the International
Court."
His military associations in
clude work on a report for the
House Armed Services Commit
tee prepared by the American
Security Council, a privately run
group. Possony is on its Board of
Directors. The recommendations,
entitled, "The Changing Strate
gic Military Balance: USA vs.
USSR," were made by a 17 man
committee. Fourteen were mili
tary men, none of lower rank
than Lt. General or Vice Admir
al, two were "professors" includ
ing Possony, and a third civilian
was the physicist Dr. Edward
Teller, a well known hawk.
Political Objectivity
Possony defended his political
objectivity in a recent interview.
"I supported both a Republican
and a Democrat in 1964. I voted
for Goldwater, but I also backed
Senator Thomas Dodd, a Demo
crat from Connecticut." Dodd
was censured by the Senate this
year for ethical irregularities.
A Stanford Professor of His
tory termed Possony, "a great
misfortune." Campbell defends
his staff member. Asked about,
"Mr. Possony's activities," Camp
bell said, "Please refer to him as
Dr. Possony. The only thing that
distinguishes him from other
faculty members is that he dis
agrees with them. Others should
look at their own glass houses.
Possony's position is perfectly
reasonable."
As part of its research pro
gram, Hoover has begun to take
on government contracts. Most
recently it finished a report on
arms control for the Far East
prepared for the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency.
This is the largest contract Hoo

ver has accepted, but others may
be in the offing.
Government Contracts
Campbell says that the only
thing that might substantially
enlarge the research program
would be government contracts.
He notes, however, that, "Hoover
is not. in the contract business.
We take .only contracts that fit
into our research and publica
tions program."
All Hoover contracts must pass
through regular University
clearing channels.
The Hoover Institution expand
ed publications program is di
rected by Karol Maichel who is
also curator of the Eastern Eu
rope collection. Maichel points
out that Hoover is neither a com
mercial publisher nor a regular
university press.
Most Institution books are pub
lished under Hoover imprint by
other presses such as Stanford,
Praeger, Chicago, Cambridge,
etc. Some books are printed in
foreign countries to lower their
retail price in the United States.
Hoover critics suggest prices
are inflated anyway. One person,
involved in Hoover publications
said their recent book, The Poli

tics of the Chinese Red Army was
intentionally printed in large
type and on extra thick paper so
the price could be raised. The
book sells for $35.00.
Low Aeadcmic Standards
Many members of the academ
ic community claim the level of
Hoover books is far below even
mediocre academic standards.
They suggest the books are heav
ily weighted toward anti-commu
nist propaganda.
Maichel outlined the require
ments a book needs for publica
tion by Hoover. "It must be read
by two Hoover people, and then
by two people outside Hoover,
unless it is written by a Hoover
person. In that case, all four
readers come from outside the
Institution. If any of these peo
ple question the objectivity or
value of a book, its chances of
publication are very small."
Writers are not told who reads
their books and Maichel would
not name any readers Hoover has
used.
One of the Institution's special
ities is printing bibliographies
for scholars. These books at
tempt to give a scholar one
source for finding all other

sources on a particular topic. For
example there is the Guide to
Russian Reference Books pre
pared by Maichel.
Ambitious Project
The most ambitious publica
tion project at Hoover is the
Yearbook On International Com
munist Affairs. The editor is
Richard V. Allen, who formerly
headed the Center for Strategic
Studies at Georgetown Univer
sity.
The yearbook will be an over
view of the year's activities and
thoughts in communist parties
around the world. Material on 90
parties will be included in over
1000 pages of material. Allen de
scribes it as, "a compendium
without judgement."
Allen is one of the more out
spoken Hoover staff members.
He testified before Congress
against ratification of the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. Consular Treaty. He has
written several books on commu
nism, including Peace or Peace
ful Coexistence written for the
American Bar Association Stand
ing Committee on Education
Against Communism.
Hoover finances and adminis
tration will be examined to
morrow.
