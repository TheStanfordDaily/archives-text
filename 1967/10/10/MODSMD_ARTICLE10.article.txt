## Toothless Social Regulations Keep Parents Contented 
### Michael Sweeney 
The latest edition of women's
social regulations has coughed
out of the mimeograph machines.
The social regs aren't very
precise. They make lavish use
of weak, ambiguous phrases like
"a woman is asked to ...
or "a freshman woman should

"The social regs don't have
much to do with reality. The
teeth seem to be missing from
them, because the University
hasn't shown much determina
tion in recent years to follow its
traditional policy of treating
adult women like so many cat
tle, counting them and locking
their doors at night.
Would You Believe ... ?
Yet I never cease to be amazed
at the fact that these regulations
still exist — these sheets of
paper marked "Women's Sign-
Out Procedures" and "Open
House Regulations." Here they
are on my desk, in black and
white, at Stanford University on
October 9, 1967 A.D. It makes
you want to fall off the Edge
of Greatness.
Let's look at some of these
social regs:
• When a woman stays out
past midnight, she has to write
down on a card where she's go
ing and when she'll be back.
• A freshman or sophomore
woman must return by 2:30 a.m.
unless she "takes an overnight."
• A freshman woman can't
stay out past midnight more
than 25 times during her first
quarter at Stanford. Why? Be
cause "she lacks experience with
the academic demands of the
University, with dormitory liv
ing conditions, and with the so
cial patterns of Stanford. . . . "
Gad.
• A junior or senior woman
must return by 6 a.m. unless
she takes an overnight. To me,
making anyone return anywhere
at 6 a.m. is inexpressibly cruel.
• If a woman takes an over
night, she has to leave a phone
number where she can be reach
ed. Juniors and seniors can take
unlimited overnights as long as
they don't disappear "so fre
quently . . . that the residential

policy of the University is
abused." Whatever that means.
• Nobody — men included —
can have a member of the oppo
site sex, if you'll pardon the ex
pression, in its room after mid
night. This is called open house
regulation, or, in the colloquial,
fiction.
Now, I'm not going to discuss
how much more liberal this clap
trap is than the claptrap two
years ago. It's still claptrap.
Men have complete, unfettered
freedom to come and go at Stan
ford. Women do not, at least on
paper. Any distinction between
the freedom given certain groups
of Stanford's adult students is
unjustified discrimination. Any
double standard is an anacharon
ism.
Barrier To Some
Even if social regs are largely
circumvented, they still pose a
barrier to some women and a
nuisance to all.
There are three conceivable
reasons why the Dean of Stu
dents continues this blatant
double standard:
1) He believes in it.
2) The trustees believe in it,
and won't let him eliminate it.
3) It is desirable for Stanford
to maintain women's social regs
on paper to placate alumni and
parents.

I suspect that (3) is the rea
son why Stanford still has social
regs. To be coldly pragmatic
about it, maybe social regs make
sense on these grounds.
Stanford has enough trouble
already getting alumni contribu
tions. If social regs vanished, the
moral outrage among the Class
es of 1909 through 1960 might
cause widespread paralysis of
the check-writing hand. And we
wouldn't want that, would we?
Help Save Dollies
Conservative parents might de
cide in droves not to send their
daughters to Stanford if there
are no longer house mothers
and such to keep men out of
their daughters' beds, heaven
forbid. As it is, Stanford life res
cues lots of these girls from
their upbringings. TTiey won't
be saved if their parents refuse
to send them to Stanford in the
first place.
So perhaps Stanford should
keep social regs a while longer.
But what regulations remain
serve exclusively to keep alumni
and parents content. In fact,
there should be just one social
reg: "Women shall return to
their residences by 2:30 a.m."
Period. Print this regulation in
booklets and catalogues, men
tion it in letters, broadcast it on
radio, write it in the sky.
And then forget it exists.
