## Will The Real Stanford Please Stand Up? 
### Robert E. Stone 
Saturday was Parents' Day
here on the Farm, a day when
900 parents were led around by
the nose, ushered here and there,
talked to, at, and down to, and
generally given what will be
their lasting impression of Le
land Stanford Junior University.
While we would like to ques
tion the validity of such an in
troduction, we can't really do so.
What the parents saw and heard
is not greatly different from
what anyone hears and sees
when he is introduced to the
Farm.
"This is Memorial Church,
built to the glory of God and
Leland Stanford." "And over
here is Tresidder Union. They
have 14 bowling alleys."
What is more important than
what newcomers see, however,
is what newcomers are told by
members of the administration.
Moved In Mem Aud
To sit in Memorial Auditorium
and listen to the great pundits
talk about Stanford must be a
terribly moving experience. To
be told that university life rep
resents no threat to students
must be terribly comforting, and
to hear President Sterling blithe
ly toss out the old bromide that
"the university must be an insti
gator of change, since it is the
creator of new things," must
leave one with the warm glow
of sharing an environment with
such an understanding liberal.
But, is any or all of this Stan
ford? Sitting in Mem Aud Sat
urday, we were tempted to ask,

"Will the real Stanford please
stand up?"
Of course, we did no such
thing. The real Stanford is an
individual thing, as different for
you and the guy next to you
as you are from each other.
... Therefore It Exists
In all the introductions to this
great University, whether they
be to parents, students, or pros
pective students, the great lie
continues to be perpetrated. Per
haps it is perpetrated sub-con
sciously, but it is there never
theless — "Stanford exists as
an entity without any of you."
The buildings, the grounds, the
classes, the departments — es
pecially the heavily research
oriented ones — to a certain ex
tent do exist in and of them
selves.
Any life, however, which these
entities have, is dependent on
you.
"We Shall Continue"
That is why Parents' Day is
held so early in the Quarter, be
fore students get a chance to
form their own opinions of what
Stanford is. The myth marches
on — "Stanford will be here long
after you are gone. What you
accomplish or fail to accomplish
while you are here, will have
little or no effect on us. We shall
continue forever." Amen.
While it may, therefore, be
difficult to criticize the type of
introduction that the freshmen's
parents were given Saturday, it
is easy to criticize the motives

concealed behind that introduc
tion.
In a few weeks each and every
freshman will be well on the way
to forming an opinion as to
what Stanford is for him. There
is little doubt that that opinion
will vary greatly from the opin
ion that his parents formed last
Saturday as to what Stanford is.
Beware!
This dichotomy of opinion is
going to be very difficult to re
solve. Tempers will fray on both
sides and as Dean Napier said
Saturday, "Communication be
tween students and parents will
become more difficult and frus
trating than ever."
Freshmen and parents take
heed. Freshmen, this University
is yours to mold and develop as
you see fit. The University does
not exist without you. Parents,
the University is not as you
think it is; it is certainly not
as it was presented to you. Stan
ford exists only as it exists for
your son or daughter and their
Stanford is much truer, much
more real than the impressions
of the University you may now
have.
So slow down. Reserve judg
ment. One thing you heard Sat
urday is true. Stanford will con
tinue.

here on the Farm, a day when
900 parents were led around by
the nose, ushered here and there,
talked to, at, and down to, and
generally given what will be
their lasting impression of Le
land Stanford Junior University.
While we would like to ques
tion the validity of such an in
troduction, we can't really do so.
What the parents saw and heard
is not greatly different from
what anyone hears and sees
when he is introduced to the
Farm.
"This is Memorial Church,
built to the glory of God and
Leland Stanford." "And over
here is Tresidder Union. They
have 14 bowling alleys."
What is more important than
what newcomers see, however,
is what newcomers are told by
members of the administration.
Moved In Mem Aud
To sit in Memorial Auditorium
and listen to the great pundits
talk about Stanford must be a
terribly moving experience. To
be told that university life rep
resents no threat to students
must be terribly comforting, and
to hear President Sterling blithe
ly toss out the old bromide that
"the university must be an insti
gator of change, since it is the
creator of new things," must
leave one with the warm glow
of sharing an environment with
such an understanding liberal.
But, is any or all of this Stan
ford? Sitting in Mem Aud Sat
urday, we were tempted to ask,

"Will the real Stanford please
stand up?"
Of course, we did no such
thing. The real Stanford is an
individual thing, as different for
you and the guy next to you
as you are from each other.
... Therefore It Exists
In all the introductions to this
great University, whether they
be to parents, students, or pros
pective students, the great lie
continues to be perpetrated. Per
haps it is perpetrated sub-con
sciously, but it is there never
theless — "Stanford exists as
an entity without any of you."
The buildings, the grounds, the
classes, the departments — es
pecially the heavily research
oriented ones — to a certain ex
tent do exist in and of them
selves.
Any life, however, which these
entities have, is dependent on
you.
"We Shall Continue"
That is why Parents' Day is
held so early in the Quarter, be
fore students get a chance to
form their own opinions of what
Stanford is. The myth marches
on — "Stanford will be here long
after you are gone. What you
accomplish or fail to accomplish
while you are here, will have
little or no effect on us. We shall
continue forever." Amen.
While it may, therefore, be
difficult to criticize the type of
introduction that the freshmen's
parents were given Saturday, it
is easy to criticize the motives

concealed behind that introduc
tion.
In a few weeks each and every
freshman will be well on the way
to forming an opinion as to
what Stanford is for him. There
is little doubt that that opinion
will vary greatly from the opin
ion that his parents formed last
Saturday as to what Stanford is.
Beware!
This dichotomy of opinion is
going to be very difficult to re
solve. Tempers will fray on both
sides and as Dean Napier said
Saturday, "Communication be
tween students and parents will
become more difficult and frus
trating than ever."
Freshmen and parents take
heed. Freshmen, this University
is yours to mold and develop as
you see fit. The University does
not exist without you. Parents,
the University is not as you
think it is; it is certainly not
as it was presented to you. Stan
ford exists only as it exists for
your son or daughter and their
Stanford is much truer, much
more real than the impressions
of the University you may now
have.
So slow down. Reserve judg
ment. One thing you heard Sat
urday is true. Stanford will con
tinue.
