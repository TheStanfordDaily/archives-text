# Katz Looks At Promiscuity, Profs
## Students Not Really So Wild 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The popular stereotype of widespread sexual
promiscuity among college students has not
wirhstood scientific scrutiny.
More than three-fifths of Stanford and Berk
eley men have not had sexual intercouse by the
middle of their junior year according to figures
released yesterday in a 666-page report, Growth
and Constraint in College Students, edited by
Dr. David Katz.
The data also showed that about two-thirds
of both Stanford and Berkeley women did not
have sexual intercourse by their third year in
college.
The report, financed by the Danforth Founda
tion and the U.S. Office of Education, and a di
rect outgrowth of a Mellon Foundation project
at Vassar College, was based on data gathered
from over 3,000 members of the Class of 1965.
Liberal Attitudes
Despite a lack of physical experience, the
overwhelming majority of those students ques
tioned developed liberal attitudes towards sex
during their college years.
Almost 70 per cent of the UC men and 70
per cent of those at Stanford believed "that full
sexual relations are permissible to the male
before marriage," when interviewed as seniors.
A slightly smaller percentage of the women
agreed with this statement, as three-fifths of the
females at the two schools concurred.
Dating Not Stereotype
Dating habits of the students also struck at
the stereotype. "Roughly a third of the men
and a quarter of the women seem to date little
or not at all even as college seniors," according
to the report.

More than half the Stanford and Berkeley
men said they had no dates at all in an average
week in their freshman year.
"Other data supports the thesis that physical
sexual activity alone is not strongly desired by
the students," wrote Dr. Katz. "In our list of
14 interests and activities, only between seven
and 17 per cent of male and female students
rank sexual needs among the three most im
portant."
Sex And Affection
One question put to the students as juniors
asked whether sex and affection were strongly
linked. Forty-eight per cent of Stanford men
and 32 per cent of those at Berkeley thought
it was.
More females went along with this sentiment
â€”86 per cent of Stanford women and 63 per
cent of UC coeds concurred.
This finding was also borne out by Katz's re
port that those students who had engaged in
sexual intercourse "knew each other for a pro
tracted period of time" beforehand.
Several statements were put to the students
both as freshmen and as seniors. The students
were asked whether they agreed with the
remarks.
One sentence read, "No man of character
would ask his fiancee to have sexual intercourse
with him before marriage."
As freshmen, 52 per cent of Stanford students
went along with the remark, while 47 per cent
of Berkeley men and 54 per cent of UC women
concurred.
When questioned again as seniors, only 11
per cent of those at Stanford, 13 per cent of
Berkeley men. and 21 per cent of UC coeds
agreed.
