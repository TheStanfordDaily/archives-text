# Teaching Methods Scored

### 
One of the many areas explored by Dr. Katz
in his massive report on college education
based on several years of studying students at
Stanford and Berkeley was the reaction of the
students to the educational methods employed.
He charges that the entire focus is wrong.
"The starting point is to make the student
the unit of education, not the course, the inter
est of the professor, the department, the grad
uate or professional school," Katz states.
Entire Student
To do this, he states, the university must
look at the entire student, not just his previous
academic achievements. His profile must con
sist of more than his grades and courses.
Katz insists that such things as the areas of
a student's strength and the points where he is
significantly weak should be recorded.
Such items as a flair for writing poetry or
a skill in debating may give a false impression
when listed without deficiencies such as an
inability to do objective research and analyze
data, or a lack of aesthetic appreciation.
The purpose of such a profile, according to
Katz, would be to create a four-year plan which
would "strengthen him further in selected
areas in which he is already strong, as well as
to achieve a considerable strengthening in at
least one area in which he is initially weak."
Co-requisites
He also scores the present system of "mechan
ical shuffling of requirements, requisites, co-re
quisites, and pre-requisites."
Katz states that this should be replaced by
"the principles of sequentialness and closure."
By "closure" Katz means the ability to delve
deeply into a subject, to reach a fairly well
developed level of knowledge. The present

method of required courses allows a student
to get "often just to the beginning of a subject
matter, leaving him with one more bit of dis
connected 'knowledge.' "
He also states that educational goals should
not be stated in terms of such-and-such cour
ses passed and so many units taken but "rather
as achievement in relatively well-defined areas
of skill or competence."
The type of faculty, as well as the type of edu
cation, also comes in for criticism. The report
concludes that many different types of people
are needed on a faculty in order to give a stu
dent a proper education.
Some of these types are often missing.
"We need a considerable enlargement of the
kind of people that we bring our students in
contact with," Katz notes. "This may be done
by enlisting faculty from non-academic occu
pations."
Untolerable Perspectives
Katz also states that the discouragement of
questioning by many professors often causes a
student to lose interest, and even have effects
outside the one course.
"Suppose that one of the lessons of history
is that for many problems clear-cut and unam
biguous answers do not exist," he notes.
"How is the instructor to respond to those
students who cannot tolerate his perspec
tives . . . ? The usual response is to ignore the
differing view of the student, or to show in
some way his displeasure.
"Perhaps at one time such responses might
be appropriate. When they become the primary
kind of response, as they inevitably do, for
certain kinds of students the individual growth
ceases to be a possibility and the rote learning
is substituted."

a student's strength and the points where he is
significantly weak should be recorded.
Such items as a flair for writing poetry or
a skill in debating may give a false impression
when listed without deficiencies such as an
inability to do objective research and analyze
data, or a lack of aesthetic appreciation.
The purpose of such a profile, according to
Katz, would be to create a four-year plan which
would "strengthen him further in selected
areas in which he is already strong, as well as
to achieve a considerable strengthening in at
least one area in which he is initially weak."
Co-requisites
He also scores the present system of "mechan
ical shuffling of requirements, requisites, co-re
quisites, and pre-requisites."
Katz states that this should be replaced by
"the principles of sequentialness and closure."
By "closure" Katz means the ability to delve
deeply into a subject, to reach a fairly well
developed level of knowledge. The present

method of required courses allows a student
to get "often just to the beginning of a subject
matter, leaving him with one more bit of dis
connected 'knowledge.' "
He also states that educational goals should
not be stated in terms of such-and-such cour
ses passed and so many units taken but "rather
as achievement in relatively well-defined areas
of skill or competence."
The type of faculty, as well as the type of edu
cation, also comes in for criticism. The report
concludes that many different types of people
are needed on a faculty in order to give a stu
dent a proper education.
Some of these types are often missing.
"We need a considerable enlargement of the
kind of people that we bring our students in
contact with," Katz notes. "This may be done
by enlisting faculty from non-academic occu
pations."
Untolerable Perspectives
Katz also states that the discouragement of
questioning by many professors often causes a
student to lose interest, and even have effects
outside the one course.
"Suppose that one of the lessons of history
is that for many problems clear-cut and unam
biguous answers do not exist," he notes.
"How is the instructor to respond to those
students who cannot tolerate his perspec
tives . . . ? The usual response is to ignore the
differing view of the student, or to show in
some way his displeasure.
"Perhaps at one time such responses might
be appropriate. When they become the primary
kind of response, as they inevitably do, for
certain kinds of students the individual growth
ceases to be a possibility and the rote learning
is substituted."
One of the many areas explored by Dr. Katz
in his massive report on college education
based on several years of studying students at
Stanford and Berkeley was the reaction of the
students to the educational methods employed.
He charges that the entire focus is wrong.
"The starting point is to make the student
the unit of education, not the course, the inter
est of the professor, the department, the grad
uate or professional school," Katz states.
Entire Student
To do this, he states, the university must
look at the entire student, not just his previous
academic achievements. His profile must con
sist of more than his grades and courses.
Katz insists that such things as the areas of
a student's strength and the points where he is
significantly weak should be recorded.
