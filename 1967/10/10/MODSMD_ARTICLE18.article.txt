# NSA Officials Deny Govt. Pressure

### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — Officials
of the National Student Association
and the Office of Economic Opportu
nity have denied that NSA dropped
plans for an anti-war march and a
"Dump Johnson" effort because OEO
threatened to cut off NSA funds.
The charges were made in a copy
righted article in the Friday issue of
The South End, campus newspaper at
Wayne State University in Detroit.
They were attributed to a member of
NSA's National Supervisory Board
(NSB).
Though the paper did not name its
source, one staff member said it was
a girl who lived in New York City.
However, the only girl NSB member
in New York, Lynda Millspaugh, de
nies that she gave the story.
Pack Of Lies
Officials of both NSA and OEO de
nied the charges. Ed Schwartz, NSA
I resident, angrily called the story "a
pack of lies" and Jim Williams of
OEO's Office of Public Affairs issued
a categorical denial that OEO pres
sured NSA.
According to the campus paper, the
anonymous NSB member said that
at a secret board meeting Schwartz
said OEO had threatened to take away
financial support of NSA if it went
through with the demonstration. It

was scheduled for August 24, the end
of the NSA Congress.
The NSB then agreed, according
to the story, and the march was can
celled. The "Dump Johnson" effort
has since fizzled from a national ef
fort to campaigns in a few states.
$800,000 Budget
NSA has a $244,000 grant from
OEO to run its tutorial projects
(NSA's total budget is about $800,-
000.) It also just received a grant
from VISTA to run another program.
Both Schwartz and OEO officials say
that the VISTA grant was held up
for several weeks because OEO was
concerned about the political reaction.
Congress has been giving OEO's bud
get a rough going over. It also has a
number of NSA critics, but they say
the criticism had no connection with
the march and Dump Johnson move
ment. OEO says it had a representa
tive at NSA's congress for a few
days, but that she put no pressure on
NSA.
So far no one who attended the
NSB meeting at which the decisions
were allegedly made has corrobrated
The South End's story. The paper says
all NSB members were sworn to sec
recy.
March Not Discussed
Miss Millspaugh told CPS that the

subject of the march "wasn't even
brought up."
Schwartz says no decisions were
made at the meeting. "We discussed
the possible implications of some of
the things we were doing such as
the resolution on Black Power," he
said. "But there was no decision to be
less radical in order to avoid losing
funds."
Paul Soglin, another NSB member,
said Schwartz was "telling the truth"
and NSB did not decide to call off the
march because of financial pressure.
He said the cancellation was announc
ed at the meeting, after the discussion
of NSA's financial problems and the
government's unhappiness with some
resolutions passed at the congress.
NSA lost a large share of its bud
get when it left the Central Intelli
gence Agency.
The minutes of the meeting confirm
that the decision to call off the march
was made independently of NSA offi
cials and only announced at the NSB
meeting.
Schwartz
Soglin says he is sure that Sam
Brown, the defeated candidate for
NSA President and the organizer of
the march, would not have lied about
the reasons for calling off the march,
"But I imagine Ed (Schwartz) was
relieved that it was called off."

Both Schwartz and Brown say it
was Brown who suggested that the
march be called off. Brown did not
attend the closed meeting and says
that he first made the suggestion to
Schwartz.
Brown then went before a congress
plenary before the march was sche
duled and said heavy rain was fore
cast for the next day, that Lafayette
Park where the march was planned
was knee deep in mud, and buses to
take the demonstrators from the
congress in College Park, Md„ to
Washington were not available. The
congress voted overwhelmingly to
call the demonstration off.
Notes Rumors
Schwartz noted the rumors that
NSA was cancelling the march be
cause of OEO pressure. Eric Van
Loon, a delegate from the University
of North Carolina, then asked if any
one knew about the rumors and, ac
cording to Sam Brown, no one answer
ed.
According to the Wayne Paper's ac
count, Jim Krumm, a delegate from
Wayne State, confronted Schwartz
with the charge and Schwartz denied
it. The paper says Schwartz admitted
OEO "had indicated its displeasure at
the march but that NSA would not sell
itself out the U.S. government."
