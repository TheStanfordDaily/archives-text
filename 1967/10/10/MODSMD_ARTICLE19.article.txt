# Important IM Clash
## Neutrinos Look Set Daily SPORTS 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
• • w —
A league champion could be
decided this afternoon when the
Neutrinos and Dislocations clash
during the fourth day of intra
mural touch football.
Five "B" league games and
two other grad school games
complete the day's schedule.
The Neutrinos and the Dislo
cations each won their league
championship last year, but both
were defeated in the first round
of the University playoffs.
Neutrinos Stronger
For some inexplicable reason,
they were placed in the same
league this year, and then paired
during the first week when most
teams have not yet jelled.
The Neutrinos, from the phy
sics grad school, should be a
stronger football team than the
one which contributed to its Uni
versity IM championship last
year.
Bob Mattox, a recruit from the
chemistry department, takes
over the all-important quarter
back position from veteran
Burke Jackson, who has moved
to one of the ends.

Under intramural rules, each
unit is allowed one non-affiliated
member per quarter.
Teaming with Mattox on pass
plays will be Ed Sabella at the
other end position.
Great Claws
Sabella and Mattox have play
ed together for five years, and
knowing each other's moves and
habits could make them a hard
to-beat defense combination.
Mattox's passes often look
more like bullets than footballs,
but Sabella reputedly possesses
a pair of talented claws.
At center for the Neutrinos
will be Dick Zdarko, while Jim
Murray holds down the one
guard position on the line.
Vicious Elbow
All linemen are eligible for
pass-receiving under intramural
rules, so Zdarko and Murray fit
into Mattox's pass patterns along
with Sadella and Jackson.
Frank Jones and Doug Green
man the backfiold blocking
duties for the Neutrinos.
Jones plays both ways and
is the key man in the Neutrino's
defensive rush. According to

team manager Zdarko, Green
doesn't have exceptional size,
but is "just mean."
Last year during ope game,
Green put teammate Jones out
of action with a flying elbow in
tended for a vicious but elusive
opponent.
Dislocated?
The Dislocations, from the
grad school material science,
may not be as strong as last
year when they lost in the play
offs to Sigma Chi.
Like the Neutrinos, the Dis
locations feature a strong pass
ing game, speed but little power,
and a good defense.

plays will be Ed Sabella at the
other end position.
Great Claws
Sabella and Mattox have play
ed together for five years, and
knowing each other's moves and
habits could make them a hard
to-beat defense combination.
Mattox's passes often look
more like bullets than footballs,
but Sabella reputedly possesses
a pair of talented claws.
At center for the Neutrinos
will be Dick Zdarko, while Jim
Murray holds down the one
guard position on the line.
Vicious Elbow
All linemen are eligible for
pass-receiving under intramural
rules, so Zdarko and Murray fit
into Mattox's pass patterns along
with Sadella and Jackson.
Frank Jones and Doug Green
man the backfiold blocking
duties for the Neutrinos.
Jones plays both ways and
is the key man in the Neutrino's
defensive rush. According to

team manager Zdarko, Green
doesn't have exceptional size,
but is "just mean."
Last year during ope game,
Green put teammate Jones out
of action with a flying elbow in
tended for a vicious but elusive
opponent.
Dislocated?
The Dislocations, from the
grad school material science,
may not be as strong as last
year when they lost in the play
offs to Sigma Chi.
Like the Neutrinos, the Dis
locations feature a strong pass
ing game, speed but little power,
and a good defense.

A league champion could be
decided this afternoon when the
Neutrinos and Dislocations clash
during the fourth day of intra
mural touch football.
Five "B" league games and
two other grad school games
complete the day's schedule.
The Neutrinos and the Dislo
cations each won their league
championship last year, but both
were defeated in the first round
of the University playoffs.
Neutrinos Stronger
For some inexplicable reason,
they were placed in the same
league this year, and then paired
during the first week when most
teams have not yet jelled.
The Neutrinos, from the phy
sics grad school, should be a
stronger football team than the
one which contributed to its Uni
versity IM championship last
year.
Bob Mattox, a recruit from the
chemistry department, takes
over the all-important quarter
back position from veteran
Burke Jackson, who has moved
to one of the ends.

Under intramural rules, each
unit is allowed one non-affiliated
member per quarter.
Teaming with Mattox on pass
plays will be Ed Sabella at the
other end position.
