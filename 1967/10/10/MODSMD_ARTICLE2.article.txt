# Johnson Telegram Highlights Hoover Building Dedication
## 
### MARTA MAHONEY 
A congratulatory telegram
from President Lyndon B. John
son highlighted yesterday's dedi
cation of the Lou Henry Hoover
addition to the Hoover Institu
tion.
Former Presidents Dwight
Eisenhower and Harry Truman,
Governor Ronald Reagan, Sena
tor Robert Kennedy, King Bau
doin of Belgium, and Yen Chia
kan, Vice-President of the Re
public of China also sent mes
sages of congratulation to the
Institution.
In addition to the Lou Henry
Hoover building, named for
President Hoover's wife, two re
modeled areas in the main
tower—The Jeremiah Milbank
Room and the Nicolas A. de-
Basily Room—were also dedi
cated.

"lt is fitting," said Johnson,
"that the wife of this world
renowned statesman and late
President should be memorial
ized by the great university that
prepared him for public life."
Senator Kennedy wired, "I
know that this new facility will
bring an increased awareness
of and appreciation for Presi
dent Hoover's contributions to
our country as well as continue
to foster the goals and high
ideals of the Institution."
The Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing will be used for the Insti
tution's Chinese and Japanese
collections and general overflow.
The Milbank Room is the reno
vated main reading room in
Hoover Tower, while the Nicolas
de Basily Room contains the
personal library and records of
Nicolas de Basily, an Imperial

Russian diplomat, which were
donated to the Institution by
his widow.
Speakers at the dedication
ceremonies included Pr sident
J. E. Wallace Sterling, W. Par
mer Fuller 111, Chairman of the
Board of Trustees, Trustee
David Packard, a member of the
Hoover Institution's Advisory
Board, W. Glenn Campbell, Di
rector of the Hoover Institution,
Herbert Hoover, Jr., undersecre
tary of state under President
Eisenhower, and Baron Louis
Scheyven, Belgian Ambassador
to the United States.
Campbell, who presided dur
ing the speeches, named Hoover
as "Stanford's greatest gradu
ate," and pointed out that Mrs.
Hoover was a great woman in
her own right. Baron Scheyven,
the next speaker, noted Hoover's
own service to humanity in a
message he read from King
Baudoin of Belguim: "My peo
ple and I remain deeply in
debted to President Hoover. Not
only did he organize food relief
to our long-suffering population
during World War I, but he also
contributed in a very substan
tial way, to bring closer to
gether the American and Bel
gian intellectual elite."
Herbert Hoover, Jr., expressed
the gratitude of the Hoover fam
ily at the naming of the new
building for Mrs. Hoover.
Trustee David Packard praised
Hoover's service to the pub
lic, and his influence on the busi
ness world. "Service to humanity
was not a common characteris
tic of the worlds of commerce
and industry . . . Mr. Hoover rad
ically changed this . . . toward
a higher ethic in business af
fairs. Hoover is part of the Stan

ford tradition of graduates who
have served their fellow men in
practical as well as intellectual
areas."
W. Parmer Fuller, Chairman
of the Board of Trustees, began
his speech by saying, "I have
n't dedicated very many build
ings ... I had some practice
when I assisted at the dedica
tion of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, but I was on
probation, so they left my name
off the program."
Sterling Ended It
President Sterling ended the
ceremonies by examining the
role of the Hoover Institution in
world affairs. "When I first met
the Hoover Institution," he said,
"it was eleven years old, and it
was then already making its
mark among those libraries
whose strength relates to par
ticular problems and periods . . .
In 1941 when the Hoover Tower
was dedicated, nations had not
yet learned the lessons which
the Hoover resources were and
are intended to teach ... To
forsee . . . when nations will be
able to lay down their swords
is impossible ..."
The dedication climaxed the
first day of the Hoover Institu
tion on War. Revolution and
Peace's conference, "Fifty Years
of Communism in Russia." In
today's lectures Lewis Feuer of
the University of Toronto will
discuss "The Socio - Political
Transformation of Soviet So
ciety," and G. Warren Nutter of
the University of Virginia will
speak on "The Soviet Economy,
A Retrospect and a Prospect."
Tomorrow's subjects include So
viet diplomacy, law, and science,
and an evening address on "Na
tional Security" by U.S. Senator
Henry M. Jackson.
