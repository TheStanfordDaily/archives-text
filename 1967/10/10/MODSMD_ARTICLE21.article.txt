It was the day of the shutout
yesterday on the IM touch foot
ball fields as six teams achieved
shutout wins in eight contests.
Heading the scoring parade
for those teams was El Toro,
which streaked to a 40-0 win over
hapless El Capitan. Soto defeat
ed Holaday 20-0, Serra overcame
the Durand men 17-0, and El
Cuadro topped Los Arcos 7-0.
Grove overturned Otero 15-6,
the Branner men beat Muir
12-0, El Tigre beat El Campo
20-0, and Burbank cranked out
enough yardage, .against Larkin
to get the nod in a 6-6 tie.
