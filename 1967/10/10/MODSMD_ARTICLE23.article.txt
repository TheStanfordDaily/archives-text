Kenneth Leroy Norton has recently been named a PEACE CORPS
VOLUNTEER after completing 12 weeks of training at Blue Knob,
Pennsylvania.
Norton, son of Mr. and Mrs. Donald B. Norton of Palo Alto, and
former Stanford student, is one of 100 volunteers who will teach
English in Korean secondary schools.
The new volunteers will try to introduce and encourage the use
of inductive methods of teaching and problem solving rather than
the traditional Korean emphasis on rote learning. They will also
encourage English conversation classes for their fellow Korean
teachers and help to organize extracurricular student activities.

PHI KAPPA PSI FRATERNITY will hold an open house tomor
row from 3:30 to 5:30 for all foreign students on the Stanford cam
pus. Representatives will attend from an lIR sponsored exchange
program with the Free University of Berlin, the University of Bei
rut, and Keio University (Tokyo).
The open house is part of a program this year to heighten the
meaningful contact between foreign students and American. The
first idea to get off the ground was the idea of placing foreign stu
dents in American living groups.
The fraternities offered the simplest arrangement of keeping
contact with the students, and foreign students this year have been
placed in SAE, Lambda Nu, and Beta Chi.
Other ideas are to rotate I-Center coffee hours among various
living groups.
