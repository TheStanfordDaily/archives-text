# Viet Dove's Son Hits Elections
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Stanford senior David Tru
ong's father is being held pris
oner in his home by the Viet
namese government.
David's home is in Saigon,
and his father is Truong Dinh
Dzu, whom the New York Times
calls "South Vietnam's No. 1
Dove" and who ran up 800,000
votes for a second place in the
recent national election.
"I got a cable from him yes
terday," David said in an inter
view with The Dally this week
end.
"He is still a bit ill, but he
said not to worry." Dzu had
spent six days incommunicado
in the national police headquar
ters jail and had lost. 17 pounds
while on a hunger strike.
"If he were not under house
arrest," David said, "he would
be leading the opposition to
Thieu and Ky. He really ex
pects more trouble."
Fraudulent Elections
Dzu ran on a white dove of
peace ticket and finished second
behind incumbent Chief of State
Nguyen Van Thieu. Later he
aligned himself with groups ac
cusing Thieu and his running
mate, former premier Nguyen
Cao Ky, of fraud in the election.
"The election was an attempt
at legitimization," David re
marked. "It was aimed at an
American audience to reduce the
critics in this country.
"The feeling is widespread (in
Vietnam) that the elections
were rigged." David continued.
"The Validation Committee (of
the National Assembly) named
38 charges of fraud. The most

serious was Ky's statement that
he would overthrow any civilian
government he didn't like.
"Out of 1,600,000 vot.-s Thieu
and Ky got," said David, "1,100,-
000 came from the military."
When the Assembly came to
vote on validating the election,
he charged, there were secret
agents in and outside the build
ing. And the chief of the secret
police was inside watching the
voting.
Impatient With Johnson
"Most Vietnamese are getting
very impatient with the (John
son) administration," David
said.
"And with the military in
power, the prospect of forming
a viable government is pretty
far away. Nothing has been
changed substantially by the
election."
Meanwhile, according to
David, his father's political
strength continues to grow. He
admits to contacts with every
party involved in Vietnam "He
has been close to American in
telligence," said David, "and he
still is. He has friends in the
top levels of the NLF. And he
also has contacts in Hanoi."
Dzu's organization, the Peo
ple's United Front, has 10,000
cadres working very effectively,
according to David, "even in
areas of Viet Cong control."
Halt Bombing
Truong Dinh Dzu is a "peace
man," his son said. He presented
a detailed peace program during
the campaign, calling first for
an end to bombing North Viet
nam.
If this were done, said David,
"International pressure from

both Communist and non-Com
munist countries could force
North Vietnam to come to
terms"
If the U.S. pulled out of South
Vietnam immediately, said
David, "maybe it would mean a
North Vietnamese takeover. But
maybe the feeling of indepond
ence in South Vietnam would be
strong enough to allow non-
Communist elements to stand
up against them.
"In my opinion we would be
strong enough. But we would
have to eliminate all these un
desirable elements. Thieu and
Ky, for example," he said.
Tldeu Charges Dzu
The criminal charges against
him by the Thieu regime are "a
power play with my father to
wipe him out," David said rec
ently. He called the three
charges fraudulent. They are for
passing a bad check, illegal
transfer of funds to the U.S. and
tax evasion.

In any case, David said he is
convinced the People's United
Front would continue without
his father's leadership. "Our
movement will still go on, no
matter what happens to him."
As for David's plans to return
to his home country, he said, "If

things continue to deteriorate on
the political front, I'm pretty
sure I'd go back next year.
"But I cannot go back as long
as Ky is in power. I would be
a political nuisance. They have
a tendency to draft political
nuisances."

a political nuisance. They have
a tendency to draft political
nuisances."
Stanford senior David Tru
ong's father is being held pris
oner in his home by the Viet
namese government.
David's home is in Saigon,
and his father is Truong Dinh
Dzu, whom the New York Times
calls "South Vietnam's No. 1
Dove" and who ran up 800,000
votes for a second place in the
recent national election.
"I got a cable from him yes
terday," David said in an inter
view with The Dally this week
end.
"He is still a bit ill, but he
said not to worry." Dzu had
spent six days incommunicado
in the national police headquar
ters jail and had lost. 17 pounds
while on a hunger strike.
"If he were not under house
arrest," David said, "he would
be leading the opposition to
Thieu and Ky. He really ex
pects more trouble."
Fraudulent Elections
Dzu ran on a white dove of
peace ticket and finished second
behind incumbent Chief of State
Nguyen Van Thieu. Later he
aligned himself with groups ac
cusing Thieu and his running
mate, former premier Nguyen
Cao Ky, of fraud in the election.
"The election was an attempt
at legitimization," David re
marked. "It was aimed at an
American audience to reduce the
critics in this country.
"The feeling is widespread (in
Vietnam) that the elections
were rigged." David continued.
"The Validation Committee (of
the National Assembly) named
38 charges of fraud. The most

serious was Ky's statement that
he would overthrow any civilian
government he didn't like.
"Out of 1,600,000 vot.-s Thieu
and Ky got," said David, "1,100,-
000 came from the military."
When the Assembly came to
vote on validating the election,
he charged, there were secret
agents in and outside the build
ing. And the chief of the secret
police was inside watching the
voting.
Impatient With Johnson
"Most Vietnamese are getting
very impatient with the (John
son) administration," David
said.
"And with the military in
power, the prospect of forming
a viable government is pretty
far away. Nothing has been
changed substantially by the
election."
Meanwhile, according to
David, his father's political
strength continues to grow. He
admits to contacts with every
party involved in Vietnam "He
has been close to American in
telligence," said David, "and he
still is. He has friends in the
top levels of the NLF. And he
also has contacts in Hanoi."
Dzu's organization, the Peo
ple's United Front, has 10,000
cadres working very effectively,
according to David, "even in
areas of Viet Cong control."
Halt Bombing
Truong Dinh Dzu is a "peace
man," his son said. He presented
a detailed peace program during
the campaign, calling first for
an end to bombing North Viet
nam.
If this were done, said David,
"International pressure from

both Communist and non-Com
munist countries could force
North Vietnam to come to
terms"
If the U.S. pulled out of South
Vietnam immediately, said
David, "maybe it would mean a
North Vietnamese takeover. But
maybe the feeling of indepond
ence in South Vietnam would be
strong enough to allow non-
Communist elements to stand
up against them.
"In my opinion we would be
strong enough. But we would
have to eliminate all these un
desirable elements. Thieu and
Ky, for example," he said.
Tldeu Charges Dzu
The criminal charges against
him by the Thieu regime are "a
power play with my father to
wipe him out," David said rec
ently. He called the three
charges fraudulent. They are for
passing a bad check, illegal
transfer of funds to the U.S. and
tax evasion.

In any case, David said he is
convinced the People's United
Front would continue without
his father's leadership. "Our
movement will still go on, no
matter what happens to him."
As for David's plans to return
to his home country, he said, "If

things continue to deteriorate on
the political front, I'm pretty
sure I'd go back next year.
"But I cannot go back as long
as Ky is in power. I would be
a political nuisance. They have

"But I cannot go back as long
as Ky is in power. I would be
a political nuisance. They have
a tendency to draft political
nuisances."
Stanford senior David Tru
ong's father is being held pris
oner in his home by the Viet
namese government.
David's home is in Saigon,
and his father is Truong Dinh
Dzu, whom the New York Times
calls "South Vietnam's No. 1
Dove" and who ran up 800,000
votes for a second place in the
recent national election.
"I got a cable from him yes
terday," David said in an inter
view with The Dally this week
end.
"He is still a bit ill, but he
said not to worry." Dzu had
spent six days incommunicado
in the national police headquar
ters jail and had lost. 17 pounds
while on a hunger strike.
"If he were not under house
arrest," David said, "he would
be leading the opposition to
Thieu and Ky. He really ex
pects more trouble."
Fraudulent Elections
Dzu ran on a white dove of
peace ticket and finished second
behind incumbent Chief of State
Nguyen Van Thieu. Later he
aligned himself with groups ac
cusing Thieu and his running
mate, former premier Nguyen
Cao Ky, of fraud in the election.
"The election was an attempt
at legitimization," David re
marked. "It was aimed at an
American audience to reduce the
critics in this country.
"The feeling is widespread (in
Vietnam) that the elections
were rigged." David continued.
"The Validation Committee (of
the National Assembly) named
38 charges of fraud. The most

serious was Ky's statement that
he would overthrow any civilian
government he didn't like.
"Out of 1,600,000 vot.-s Thieu
and Ky got," said David, "1,100,-
000 came from the military."
When the Assembly came to
vote on validating the election,
he charged, there were secret
agents in and outside the build
ing. And the chief of the secret
police was inside watching the
voting.
Impatient With Johnson
"Most Vietnamese are getting
very impatient with the (John
son) administration," David
said.
"And with the military in
power, the prospect of forming
a viable government is pretty
far away. Nothing has been
changed substantially by the
election."
Meanwhile, according to
David, his father's political
strength continues to grow. He
admits to contacts with every
party involved in Vietnam "He
has been close to American in
telligence," said David, "and he
still is. He has friends in the
top levels of the NLF. And he
also has contacts in Hanoi."
Dzu's organization, the Peo
ple's United Front, has 10,000
cadres working very effectively,
according to David, "even in
areas of Viet Cong control."
Halt Bombing
Truong Dinh Dzu is a "peace
man," his son said. He presented
a detailed peace program during
the campaign, calling first for
an end to bombing North Viet
nam.
If this were done, said David,
"International pressure from

both Communist and non-Com
munist countries could force
North Vietnam to come to
terms"
If the U.S. pulled out of South
Vietnam immediately, said
David, "maybe it would mean a
North Vietnamese takeover. But
maybe the feeling of indepond
ence in South Vietnam would be
strong enough to allow non-
Communist elements to stand
up against them.
"In my opinion we would be
strong enough. But we would
have to eliminate all these un
desirable elements. Thieu and
Ky, for example," he said.
Tldeu Charges Dzu
The criminal charges against
him by the Thieu regime are "a
power play with my father to
wipe him out," David said rec
ently. He called the three
charges fraudulent. They are for
passing a bad check, illegal
transfer of funds to the U.S. and
tax evasion.

In any case, David said he is
convinced the People's United
Front would continue without
his father's leadership. "Our
movement will still go on, no
matter what happens to him."
As for David's plans to return
to his home country, he said, "If

things continue to deteriorate on
the political front, I'm pretty
sure I'd go back next year.
"But I cannot go back as long
as Ky is in power. I would be
a political nuisance. They have
a tendency to draft political
