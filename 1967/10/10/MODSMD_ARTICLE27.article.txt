# Stanford Teachers Hear Calif. Labor Officials
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford
Chapter of the American Feder
ation of Teachers (AFT) heard
speakers from the Berkeley
local and the vice-president of
the California Federation of the
union at an open meeting last
Thursday.
The 90-odd paid chapter mem
bers and other interested grad
uate students listened to re
marks by Bob Atkins, president
of the Berkeley TA local, Gina
Candau, president of the Berke
ley library workers chapter, and
A 1 Tapson, an AFT vice-presi
dent.
Plans were also made for a
future meeting for those mem

bers interested in organizing or
collecting information for the
union.
The new group has raised
complaints against such items
as low pay scales for some
teaching and research assistants,
lack of fringe benefits, and lack
of representation in university
affairs.
Of the 90 members of the lo
cal, over half are in the depart
ments of English, history, and
political science. There are peo
ple, however, willing to act as
representatives in 10 or 11 de
partments according to Andrew
Moss, a graduate student in sta
tistics and provisional head of
the organization.
