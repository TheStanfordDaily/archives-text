# Bolshevik Revolution Split With Karl Marx' Theory
## 
### 
The Bolshevik revolution of
1917 in Russia did not follow
the pattern of revolution de
tailed by Karl Marx, according
to research fellow Bertram
Wolfe.
Delivered yesterday morning,
Wolfe's talk on the "Transfor
mation of Marxism-Leninism as
an Ideology" opened the Hoover
Institution's week-long confer
ence entitled "Fifty Years of
Communism in Russia."

Wolfe argued that because
the struggle in Russia during
the early twentieth century was
not advanced, Lenin was obliged
to substitute "the peasantry for
the bourgeoisie," and to develop
the concept of "an elite revolu
tionary vanguard."
By adapting socialist revolu
tion to an undeveloped country,
Lenin was the forerunner of
modern communist revolution
aries like Ho Chi Minh, said
Wolfe.
