# Novak Speaks Tonight
## Truong, Van Slyke Score Viet War 
### BARBARA RITZ 
A Stanford professor and a
Vietnamese student lashed out
last night at U.S. â€¢ Vietnam po
licy.
History professor Lyman Van
Slyke, and Stanford senior David
Truong spoke to an audience of
fifty at Roth House on the third
day of a six day forum on Viet
nam. Tomorrow night Religion
Professor Michael Novak will
present the fourth lecture, "A
Bucket of Worms: A Report on
Vietnam," at 8 p.m. in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
"We have to end the war one
way or another. Not at any price,
because war would break out
again. In the near future I can
not see any prospect for peace,"
said Truong, whose father ran

second in a recent Vietnamese
presidential election.
Van Slyke cited parallels be
tween those elections and the
Chinese elections in 1949 after
which the Communists took
power.
Two Billion Spent
Thus far, he noted, the United
States has spent over two bil
lion dollars and stationed 500,-
000 troops in Vietnam. He said
fewer troops and less money
could have been used effectively
against the Chinese Communists
twenty years ago.
"The picture that you get from
the newspapers," Truong said,
"is that there has been a step
forward. This stability is paper
thin."
During the past few years, he
continued, the Saigon govern

ment has been struggling for
survival. But with backing from
the United States and huge
amounts of money, its has man
aged to prevent a coup.
Rigged Election
Truong charged that the Sai
gon government got only 33 per
cent of the vote, and it had to
rig the election to get even that
much.
There exists a feud between
Chief of State Thieu and Vice
President Ky, Troung said, and
they have to jail their opponents
to try to give the Vietnamese
people the illusion of stability in
the government.
U.S. Indifference
If the United States were in
different to the Vietnam govern
ment," he said, "the military

would be able to enact a coup
immediately."
Truong and Van Slyke agreed
that the policy and the objec
tives of the Saigon government
relate directly to the amount of

backing it can expect from the
United States.
Truong said that the basic de
sire of the Vietnamese people is
to end the war and reunify Viet
nam. He said this unity is not
present even in South Vietnam.
He explained that Thicu and Ky
cannot get the support of the
other candidates as the U.S. had
hoped.
