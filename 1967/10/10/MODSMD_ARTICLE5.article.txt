# Stanford To Follow?
## Univ. Of Michigan Drops NSA Ties 
### PAT McMAHON 
The University of Michigan
last week became the second
school to drop ties with the Na
tional Student Association
(NSA) since NSA's relationship
to the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) was revealed last
February.
If A S S U Vice-President
Cesare Masserenti and LASSU
speaker Mike Weinstein prevail,
Stanford will also withdraw
from NSA to form a Bay Area
Student Union, said Masserenti
yesterday.
Weinstein explained, "NSA is
not doing enough for Stanford
to warrant our staying in and
paying the dues."
According to the Collegiate
Press Service Michigan's Stu
dent Government Council (SGC)
voted without . debate 7-3 in
favor of withdrawal. SGC had
defeated an identical motion
three weeks earlier by a 6-5
margin.
The vote to withdraw was ap

parently motivated by the rev
elation of NSA's links with the
CIA, and by reports of several
delegates from Michigan at the
National Congress. Michigan
charged that NSA was an "un
democratic, unrepresentative,
unproductive, elitist" body, ac
cording to the Collegiate Press
Service.
Weinstein who attended the
National Congress as a Stanford
delegate echoed the Michigan
delegates' reports. "The Nation
al Supervisory Board (NSB)
and the four national officers
are running the Association for
all practical purposes," he said.
"Besides, look at Stanford and
ask 'what have they done for
us' The answer is very little,"
V/einstein remarked.
Decision
Masserenti said that if Stan
ford does not withdraw from
NSA, "it will implicitly endorse
NSA-CIA ties," and pointed out
that because Stanford and 380
other schools belong to the as

sociation, "overseas students
shouldn't think it represents all
schools, like their student
groups do."
The decision on future Stan
ford-NSA ties, "to pay or not
to pay" the dues, Weinstein
said, will be made before No
vember 16 by the Legislature.
The November 16 date was set
in budget hearings last spring.
Government Pressure
The Michigan vote was taken
last Thursday evening before
the student newspaper at
Wayne State University carried
a story that NSA had cancelled
a planned anti-War march and
a Dump-Johnson campaign be
cause of pressure from the Of
fice of Economic Opportunity.
Brandeis University seceded
from the Association the day
following the revelation of the
NSA-CIA cooptation. Michigan
State University joined NSA the
same day.
NSA's overall membership
has increased since the ClA's
relationship was revealed.

Agency (CIA) was revealed last
February.
If A S S U Vice-President
Cesare Masserenti and LASSU
speaker Mike Weinstein prevail,
Stanford will also withdraw
from NSA to form a Bay Area
Student Union, said Masserenti
yesterday.
Weinstein explained, "NSA is
not doing enough for Stanford
to warrant our staying in and
paying the dues."
According to the Collegiate
Press Service Michigan's Stu
dent Government Council (SGC)
voted without . debate 7-3 in
favor of withdrawal. SGC had
defeated an identical motion
three weeks earlier by a 6-5
margin.
The vote to withdraw was ap

parently motivated by the rev
elation of NSA's links with the
CIA, and by reports of several
delegates from Michigan at the
National Congress. Michigan
charged that NSA was an "un
democratic, unrepresentative,
unproductive, elitist" body, ac
cording to the Collegiate Press
Service.
Weinstein who attended the
National Congress as a Stanford
delegate echoed the Michigan
delegates' reports. "The Nation
al Supervisory Board (NSB)
and the four national officers
are running the Association for
all practical purposes," he said.
"Besides, look at Stanford and
ask 'what have they done for
us' The answer is very little,"
V/einstein remarked.
Decision
Masserenti said that if Stan
ford does not withdraw from
NSA, "it will implicitly endorse
NSA-CIA ties," and pointed out
that because Stanford and 380
other schools belong to the as

sociation, "overseas students
shouldn't think it represents all
schools, like their student
groups do."
The decision on future Stan
ford-NSA ties, "to pay or not
to pay" the dues, Weinstein
said, will be made before No
vember 16 by the Legislature.
The November 16 date was set
in budget hearings last spring.
Government Pressure
The Michigan vote was taken
last Thursday evening before
the student newspaper at
Wayne State University carried
a story that NSA had cancelled
a planned anti-War march and
a Dump-Johnson campaign be
cause of pressure from the Of
fice of Economic Opportunity.
Brandeis University seceded
from the Association the day
following the revelation of the
NSA-CIA cooptation. Michigan
State University joined NSA the
same day.
NSA's overall membership
has increased since the ClA's
relationship was revealed.
The University of Michigan
last week became the second
school to drop ties with the Na
tional Student Association
(NSA) since NSA's relationship
to the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) was revealed last
February.
