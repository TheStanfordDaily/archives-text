# Irrelevant Education
## Grad Study Criticized 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Abolish the graduate studies
program as it now exists and
build a new one from the ground
up, a history graduate student
told the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) yesterday.
The proposal was heard at the
first of this year's SES open hear
ings. The subject was graduate
studies. The speaker was David
Mossier.
"Graduate school is a psycho
logical trauma," he said. "It's
three years of fairly irrelevant
education. You just don't get to
do what you want to do."
Mossler's remarks were heard
by three members of the SES
steering committee and tape re
corded so they could be summar
ized and distributed to the oth
ers.
Tutorial Work
His plan was basically for
three years of tutorial work.
The first year would be spent
working on a 100-page paper in
the student's field of interest. In
the second year, the student
would write another 100-page pa
per. In the third year, he would
begin research for his Ph.D. dis
sertation and prepare for his
exams.
Then the student would take
another six months to a year to
finish work on his dissertation.
Language and minor field re
quirements should be abolished,
Mossier said, and teaching prac
tice should be required. Present
ly history graduate students
must give only a single lecture
to fulfill their teaching require
ment for a degree.
He said the current system
created pressures on the student
which distracted from his field of
interest and encouraged sloppy
work. Also, a student would be
forced to learn a language on his
own to do research for a disserta
tion.
The three different years, in
Mossler's plan, would help devel
op certain skills a student needs
for an academic career.

In the first year, the emphasis
would be on bibliographical
work, in the second year on re
search, and in the third year on
teaching.
Mossier said the present sys
tem was "no good for the highly
rationalized, specialized history
profession that we have today."
Oral Exams Hit
History graduate Mark Bost
wick criticized the present sys
tem of oral examinations. "I'm
not sure what the justification is
for them," he said.
"As an initiation system, it's
very effective. It's a tremendous
psychological shock. But as a
test of knowledge, I'm not sure
it's effective at all, because the
psychological shock is so great,
a person may clam up," he said.

Bostwick suggested the oral
exams be replaced with a system
of five or six sessions in an aca
demic quarter. This, he said,
would compensate for mood fluc
tuations in both the examinee
and the examiners.
An oral exam, he said, isn't a
"precise tool for telling a student
what he has accomplished or
failed to accomplish."
Mossier added he felt the only
person who can judge a graduate
student's progress is his advisor.

tem of oral examinations. "I'm
not sure what the justification is
for them," he said.
"As an initiation system, it's
very effective. It's a tremendous
psychological shock. But as a
test of knowledge, I'm not sure
it's effective at all, because the
psychological shock is so great,
a person may clam up," he said.

Bostwick suggested the oral
exams be replaced with a system
of five or six sessions in an aca
demic quarter. This, he said,
would compensate for mood fluc
tuations in both the examinee
and the examiners.
An oral exam, he said, isn't a
"precise tool for telling a student
what he has accomplished or
failed to accomplish."
Mossier added he felt the only
person who can judge a graduate
student's progress is his advisor.

The second day of SES open
hearings on graduate education
will be held today at 4 p.m. in
Room 143 of the undergraduate
library. Ail members of the
Stanford community have been
invited to present their views to
SES.
Abolish the graduate studies
program as it now exists and
build a new one from the ground
up, a history graduate student
told the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) yesterday.
The proposal was heard at the
first of this year's SES open hear
ings. The subject was graduate
studies. The speaker was David
Mossier.
"Graduate school is a psycho
logical trauma," he said. "It's
three years of fairly irrelevant
education. You just don't get to
do what you want to do."
Mossler's remarks were heard
by three members of the SES
steering committee and tape re
corded so they could be summar
ized and distributed to the oth
ers.
Tutorial Work
His plan was basically for
three years of tutorial work.
The first year would be spent
working on a 100-page paper in
the student's field of interest. In
the second year, the student
would write another 100-page pa
per. In the third year, he would
begin research for his Ph.D. dis
sertation and prepare for his
exams.
Then the student would take
another six months to a year to
finish work on his dissertation.
Language and minor field re
quirements should be abolished,
Mossier said, and teaching prac
tice should be required. Present
ly history graduate students
must give only a single lecture
to fulfill their teaching require
ment for a degree.
He said the current system
created pressures on the student
which distracted from his field of
interest and encouraged sloppy
work. Also, a student would be
forced to learn a language on his
own to do research for a disserta
tion.
The three different years, in
Mossler's plan, would help devel
op certain skills a student needs
for an academic career.

In the first year, the emphasis
would be on bibliographical
work, in the second year on re
search, and in the third year on
teaching.
Mossier said the present sys
tem was "no good for the highly
rationalized, specialized history
profession that we have today."
