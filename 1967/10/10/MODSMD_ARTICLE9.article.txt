# From A Reader
## Hargrove's Column Is Unconvincing 
### 
All of us have had exposure
to high school newspapers, and
Lome of us have spent a few
years skimming through the
journalistic attempts of various
other universities. So we're in
clined to be tolerant. Like Vol
taire. At times even like Job.
We will understand when a
sophomore reporter obviously
lacks the objectivity of a Reston.
- We grimmace, but most of us
won't stop reading you because
of your Time-like proclivity to
manufacture quotations. Our
tolerance will even stretch to the
occasional mix-up where a ma
jor headline expresses a thought
which is almost exactly contrary
" to what the person being report
: ed on was attempting to say.
Although we don't like all
this, we're used to it and we can
take it. It's good preparation for
dealing with our parents.
But your columns are becom
ing too much to bear in silence.
* The drivel that fills most of your
: signed articles might lead one
to conclude that the reason the
new Daily is "thicker" is that
it's being stuffed with the ex
creta of thicker-headed colum
nists.
Columnists Fall Short
I don't intend a blanket gen
eralization. Most of what's writ
ten by, say, Tim Haight, com
pares favorably with most col
umns written anywhere by any
one. Witty, perceptive, and gen
erally original, he writes in such
a manner that even those who
violently disagree with his con
clusions still feel their time is
well-spent in reading him.
But the bulk of your other
signatures don't approach his
level. On the rare occasions that
they've something to say, they
" run it out on a style so stilted
that only those who really
"care" can drudge through to
the finish.
You have the only staff in
the world that could make co-ed
housing sound like a physics lec
' ture.
Chuckle, Chuckle, Chuckle
Or else, on the other hand,
they're so blatantly asinine that
most of us glance over their
righteous indignation just for
chuckle value.
Take Hargrove last Friday. If
a reasonably selective red pencil
; were wielded, that unstructured
piece of garbage would have
been edited out of any junior
high paper.
It is, I suppose, possible that
your staff is so small that your
writers, like the State Patrol,
have to do their writing on a
quota system. But surely they
know that this kind of sloppy
composition can only hurt the
cause it advocates.
Unreasoned Gibberish
If you will bear my quoting
Hargrove's first and last sen
tences:
"Why the Reserve Officer
Training Corps was ever allow
ed into the University in the
first place has never been really
clear ... I think I know why,
but let's not talk about it this
early in the morning." These two
sentences contain the author's
total message; between them
he "doesn't talk about it" for
three columns.
I cite Hargrove, not as the
worst, but only as being the
latest example of unreasoned
gibberish that Joe McCarthy at
his vaguest wouldn't have claim
ed. Worse than that, this boob

has the audacity to be patroniz
ing about it.
Have You Tried M.S. 23?
Hargrove informs us that the
Midpeninsula Free University
has a course in Counter Counter
Insurgency, apparently intend
ing to "counter" the Green
Berets with the Brown Shaggy
Locks. (Neither side has appar
ently grasped the elementary
Mao-thought — a guerilla must
not be capable of being instant
ly recognized).
Hargrove complains that these
Midpeninsula stalwarts, who
brandish the avowed aim of "eli
minating military sciences from
the Stanford campus" have been
denied access to M.S. 131 (a
course listed in the Stanford bul
letin as having M.S. 23 as a pre
requisite.)
I believe we can assume that
few members of the Brown
Shaggy Locks coterie have taken
M.S. 23 — None, to be more pre
cise — which rather effectively
castrates that particular argu
ment. Especially since a front
page story in the same issue
stated that two non-ROTC's had
successfully enrolled in M.S. 11,
for which there is no prerequi
site.
Might Have Been Good
Now for the one crucial state
ment in the story, though. The
one which upset me and concern
ing which I find myself tending
to side with the author.
The interested students were
not even allowed to audit M.S.
131.
This I think was probably a
bad decision by whoever made
it and I think Chris Hargrove
could probably have developed
this angle into a worthwhile
article had he chosen to walk
around a bit and ask some ques
tions and be a journalist.
Keep In Mind ...
There are, though, a few
points you might keep in mind,
Christopher.
1) As counter counter insur
gents you sophisticated gueril
las must learn to anticipate that
the enemy may be hostile to
your presence in their training
camp for avowed purposes of
destruction. Do the Israelites in
vite Arabs to their aerial stra
tegy bull sessions? Do the Tan
zanians ask representatives of
the BrUdersbond to their deci
sion meetings on South African
offensives? Do the Green Berets
spend much time hobnobbing
with recognized members of the
N.L.F.?
2) Chins up, gang. The Beret
less Baldies (Counter counter
counter insurgents) in the ad
ministration gored you this
round, but they're nearly as old
as Mao and most of them will
retire soon. In the meantime,
however, you may find your in
filtration attempts a bit easier if
you don't broadcast them in
your MPFU Bulletin (which is
required reading, along with
Machiavelli, for the Beretless
Baldies).
3) In spite of the partially
overlapping student bodies, I fail
to see the justification of the
MPFU, as an institution, inter
vening in the sovereign affairs
of Stanford. There are crewcut
Stanfordites (today probably
girls, even) who are violently
opposed to human experimenta
tion with LS.D. Some, no doubt,
even think it's morally wrong.
But they don't try to infiltrate

and destroy your Haight-Ash
bury field trips.
I don't belong to ROTC, I
turned down two military aca
demy appointments, I'm morally
and intellectually outraged at
Vietnam in particular and Amer
ican foreign policy south of the
Equator in general.
But I do think there are a
couple of obvious benefits to be
derived from keeping ROTC on
campus.
This way we can be sure that
there are a few fellows with at
least semi-liberal educations to
humanize the machines from
West Point. Rather than ostra
cise the ROTC'er, you should
make a special effort to include
him. We might even start a
cross-cultural series: Take a
ROTC to lunch.
Keep In Touch
Another reason: I find myself
frequently losing touch with the
military mentality even with it's
future leaders right here; think
how much more ivory towerish
we would become if this set of
opinions — which whether we
like it or not is bloody important
in the world today — were not
represented among us.
To attempt to win converts to
a dissenting view of Vietnam

without first understanding the
ROTC mind is a bit like learn
ing to swim on an ironing board:
your theory and technique are
fine, but the first time you en
counter water you sink.
Further, I think ROTC has
as much place in a university as
any other necessary vocational
training — say medical, legal,
or computer science, and I think
it has more place than has big
league football training.
And finally, I find something
frankly charming about a pic
ture of hippies dancing through
ROTC drill formations, tossing
flowers to the young soldiers.
I know there are valid argu
ments for removing ROTC from
the campus, perhaps some that
haven't occurred to me and that
might persuade me to change
my mind.
I found none, however, in
Hargrove's article. All I found
was the usual half-baked col
umn formula: Scream a popu
lar slogan; dash down a couple
emotioned phrases; and piece the
whole mess together in no par
ticular order.
This is not the quality I'd like
to expect of my college paper.
