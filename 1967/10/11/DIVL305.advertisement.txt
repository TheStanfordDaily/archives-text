"Charyn's characters are lyrical children
struggling to have adult feelings—poets left
stranded in the box of adolescence. The book is
a funny way out of the Black Humor bag." —Herbert Gold
"... an exciting departure from Jerome Charyn s earlier books. He has left the safe conquered
terrain of the New York streets for the exciting hinterland of West's and Nabokov's America,
and of Pynchon's fictional inventiveness and abandon. —Albert J. Guerard
