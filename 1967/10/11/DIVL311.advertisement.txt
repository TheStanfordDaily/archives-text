THE BUTTON-DOWN STRIPE
University Men are very fond of striped shirts.
That's the word from our on-campus shops. And
so we have prepared our famous tapered-body,
button-down collar shirt in six stripe variations.
The fabric is a durable press of colion-wiih
polyesier. The kind you machine wash and
tumble-dry! Ground colors are tan, olive and
a deep blue, available with wide or narrow
spaced stripes in contrasting colors. 14 to 16V2
neck sizes, 32 to 35-inch sleeve lengths at 8.50.
