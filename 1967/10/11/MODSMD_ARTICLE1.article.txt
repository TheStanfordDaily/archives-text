# 'Off Severs University Umbilical Cord
## 
### ROBIN KNIGHT 
This quarter sees the start of
female emancipation at Stan
ford. In case you feel that girls
already have it too good, pause
to reflect on the 76-year-old rule
which, until now, forbade wom
en to live off campus unless they
were past age 23.
Sixty senior girls took out the
option to live off campus when
it was announced, belatedly, last
May. The offer was made for up
to one hundred Senior girls, but
the lateness of the decision
meant that many girls had made
other arrangements. But the re
form, which came after months
of pressure from Janet Howell's
"OFF" movement, was wel
comed by Stanford girls as long
overdue. It is rumored, in fact,
that the new OFF policy might
even be extended another year.
As far as the University is
concerned, these girls, in op
tioning out of Stanford's anti

septic dormitory atmosphere,
have severed the umbilical cord.
No one regulates where or how
they live, and in fact no one
even knows during the initial
registration period.
Why did they leave the dormi
tories? The Senior girls who
spoke to me were reluctant to
be named, largely because they
did not wish to be thought of as
radical suffragettes. Most felt
the University life was begin
ning to pale. Many had taken
summer jobs in places like
Washington, and for the first
time discovered what it is like
leading an independent exist
ence. For three years the old
routine had been withstood, but
with increasing frustration. Pe
culiarly feminine desires, such
as the chance to cry in private
without attracting unwanted
sympathy from half-friends,
played their part too. Most often
emphasized was the wish for
privacyâ€”to escape from the
communal atmosphere, to get
away from the campus environ
ment, to express in an adult way
their maturity as persons.
Some girls I spoke to especial
ly disliked communal functions
such as house meetings and tele
phone duties. Others wanted to
be able to entertain friends in a
similar manner to any 20-year
old girl living in, say, San Fran
cisco. In answer to those read
ers with agile minds, I should
say this does not mean sleeping
with men. Apparently no one
had found on-campus regula
tions too limiting in this re
spect, and the move off-campus
was not thought to have led to
instant moral degeneration.
What was implied was the wish
to hold dinner-parties, cook for
friends and "to intensify deeper
relationships with fewer people"
as one girl put it in diction only
a Stanford education could pro
vide.
Housing shortage difficulties
experienced by men off-campus
were not experienced by the
girls. In one case two girls had
rented an apartment barred to
Stanford men. One girl lived in
East Palo Alto, and stressed fa
vorably the contrast to living in
the Row. "Students and the lo
cal people are both gaining
through this new contact," I was

told. Another girl, after sharing
a house with ten others in Wash
ington last summer, decided to
leave the splendid isolation of
her single-room in Lagunita.
Now she lives in a house with
five others, and so far the move
is a success.
Few of the girls were over 21,
but legal problems with leases
and rent agreements were
scarcely mentioned. Rents
varied widely from $70 per per
son per month down to $40 ac
cording to location and style.
Financially, the girls generally
felt they would be better-off in
the long run, balancing the mon
ey spent initially on pots and
pans against that saved on the
many uneaten meals paid for
when living on campus. Trans
port was a problem for those
more than two miles from class
rooms. But being girls, they
could usually find a lift.
As part of Stanford's reap
praisal of student living regula
tions, the decision to allow sen
ior girls this wider freedom is
significant. Basically it is a re
flection on the sophistication and

independence of girls under 21.
Not all the girls' parents ap
proved of the change, but this
being 1967 there wasn't much
they felt was worth doing about
it. Contact with friends outside
the University tends to empha
size the juvenility of much of
Stanford's approach to living
acommodations. Another rea
son for leaving campus was a
desire to meet some men who
weren't the same one's they
had seen at Stanford for three
years.
A general antipathy to com
munal life was common to most
of the exiles. These girls value
being independent, having a
place of one's own to relax in,
and work in, and living in a way
more similar to the real world
outside Stanford. Which is why
this "OFF" experiment looks
like a success.
