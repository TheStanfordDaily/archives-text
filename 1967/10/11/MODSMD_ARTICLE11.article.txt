Stanford's mood of change, of excitement, of
revolt, of challenge is all over. It looks like
this will be a quiet year.
We got apoplectic last year about unbearable
housing and godawful inequities in the treat
ment of women. We were enraged by the ir
relevance of our education.
Some ehanges have taken place, some experi
ments have begun, some studies have been
launched. But now we are bored..
Why—because it is all up in the air—all of
it—there is nothing to attack head-on.
Except the war. But the real war protestors
have left school to fight it full time, as they
should. And the war is so damned frustrating
for those of us here.
So we are frustrated and bored about what
we can really do—about anything! Is Stanford
protested out? What are we to do this year—
where are we going?
And the leaders—where are they—the
Ilowells and the Harrises and the Sapirs. Ster
ling—he advises us to take the long view—
maybe this is the year of the long view and
not the year of change. Peter Lyman—a philos

opher king to many, yet not really sure himself
where Stanford should go this year. And he is
hesitant to commit himself, and to leave his
cabin retreat.
But before we are led, we have to identify
causes and goals. Have we pushed our studied
list of causes to the end? Maybe we have much
more study to do before we can demand
changes again.
We have to know how the experimental
housing works; we have to assess other changes
made. Maybe we cannot be too critical of the
Study of Education, for we too are reassessing,
gathering data, and studying.
There is a lot of questioning to be done, as
Peter told us. And there is just as much ques
tioning to be done of the New Left and the
new answers as there is of the establishment
and the old answers.
This just might be the year of greatest change
for Stanford, for the individual can challenge
himself, his goals and answers. We may in this
way discover that mood of wonder and excite
ment so far from us now. The individual will
be touched —in spite of the institution or the
calm.
