# Academic Senate
## Arrow Replies To Lyman 
### 
(Editor's Note: Professor Ar
row yesterday sent this letter to
Peter Lyman in reply to his let
ter objecting: to the formation of
the Academic Senate. The pro
posal is now under consideration
by the Academic Council. The
text of Lyman's letter appeared
in the October 5 Daily.)
Mr. Peter Lyman,
President, ASSU
Dear Mr. Lyman:
Thank you for your thought
ful and ably reasoned letter with
regard to the proposal for a Sen
ate of the Academic Council.
You raise the possibility that
the creation of an elected Senate
to discharge the responsibility
of the Academic Council may in
fact interfere with subsequent
more fundamental reorganiza
tion of the governmental struc
ture of the University.
It is not the intent of the pro
posal to foreclose in any way
any wider reorganization. The
Academic Council is in principle
charged, as matters now stand,
with responsibility for a wide va
riety of matters concerned with
the educational and other aca
demic aspects of the University.
It is universally agreed within
the faculty that the present
mass meeting approach has
proved to be too cumbersome to
meet the needs of a changing
environment and changing val
ues. The aim of the Senate in
the first instance is simply a
greater efficiency in the dis
charge of the Academic Coun
cil's responsibilities however
these are defined.
The argument is the classical
preference for representation as
against direct democracy when
numbers are large and issues
are demanding of time and at
tention.
The authors of the present
draft proposal have indeed
sought to innovate in one re
spect. Recognizing that a uni
versity is a functionally differ

entiated system with great
asymmetry in the roles of dif
ferent members, the drafters
sought to make it easier for the
faculty to learn about varying
perspectives by introducing to
ken representation from admin
istrators and students.
There is no attempt to pretend
that the Senate is a body in
which all elements of the Uni
versity are represented accord
ing to their importance. It is a
faculty body which introduces
other elements in order to bet
ter carry out its functions and
its responsibilities to the entire
University.
I am the more emboldened to
urge the faculty to continue on
its present course because I have
not seen ever presented a viable
plan of community government.
I do not mean to exclude the
possible evolution of such plans,
but such evolution will under
the best of circumstances take
a long time.
It is very unwise, in my view,
to postpone a desirable reform
for the sake of a conceivably
better one in the absence of a
clearly defined alternative.
There is indeed an organ in
which broader notions of the
reorganization of University
government can be and are be
ing discussed; namely, the SES
Committee on the Government
of the University of which we
are both members.
Of course, I do not mean to
imply that the functioning of
this committee should in any
way inhibit simultaneous public
discussion of the issues. On the
contrary, the public discussion
may be valuable in bringing
more ideas to the attention of
the committee and the Univer
sity community.
Let me conclude with some
remarks about the opposition
which you find between defini
tion of a problem and its solu
tion.
The demand that a problem

be studied at its very roots and
in all of its ramifications may
in many situations prove to be
not the radical recommendation
it sounds, but rathor an invita
tion to total inaction. In a fun
damental philosophical sense no
problem can ever be fully de
fined. The process of solving
small elements of a problem
may actuallv be a step in the
better definition of the problem.
I am all in favor of attacking
a problem at a fundamental lev
el as is meaningful but I don't
think that discussions of prob
lems at any level can be mean
ingful except in terms of at least
reasonably well defined alterna
tive courses of action.
In the example of Mr. Pack
er's observations on criminal
law, an important point is over
looked. A general injunction to
define what a crime is before
proceeding to discussion of ap
propriate solutions to the prob
lem of criminal behavior would
actually not be very helpful in
the abstract.
What has happened is that ex
perience has shown that certain
activities legally designated as
crimes turn out to offer formida
ble problems of enforcement.
The concrete question has been
raised: Should the use of nar
cotics or adultery or homosexual
intercourse continue to be re
garded as crimes when in fact
there is no victim?
Similarly, a specific workable
proposal for community govern
ment would focus with sharp
clarity the problems involved in
the running of the university.
Generalized attempts at discov
ering the aims of the university
by consensus are apt only to
lead to vague generalities with
little consequences in general
action and improvement.

KENNETH J. ARROW,

Executive Committee of

asymmetry in the roles of dif
ferent members, the drafters
sought to make it easier for the
faculty to learn about varying
perspectives by introducing to
ken representation from admin
istrators and students.
There is no attempt to pretend
that the Senate is a body in
which all elements of the Uni
versity are represented accord
ing to their importance. It is a
faculty body which introduces
other elements in order to bet
ter carry out its functions and
its responsibilities to the entire
University.
I am the more emboldened to
urge the faculty to continue on
its present course because I have
not seen ever presented a viable

I do not mean to exclude the

a long time.
It is very unwise, in my view,
to postpone a desirable reform
for the sake of a conceivably
better one in the absence of a
clearly defined alternative.
There is indeed an organ in
which broader notions of the

Committee on the Government
of the University of which we
are both members.
Of course, I do not mean to
imply that the functioning of
this committee should in any
way inhibit simultaneous public
discussion of the issues. On the
contrary, the public discussion
may be valuable in bringing
more ideas to the attention of
the committee and the Univer

Let me conclude with some
remarks about the opposition
which you find between defini

The demand that a problem

be studied at its very roots and
in all of its ramifications may
in many situations prove to be
not the radical recommendation
it sounds, but rathor an invita
tion to total inaction. In a fun
damental philosophical sense no
problem can ever be fully de
fined. The process of solving
small elements of a problem
may actuallv be a step in the
better definition of the problem.
I am all in favor of attacking
a problem at a fundamental lev
el as is meaningful but I don't
think that discussions of prob
lems at any level can be mean
ingful except in terms of at least
reasonably well defined alterna
tive courses of action.
In the example of Mr. Pack
er's observations on criminal
law, an important point is over
looked. A general injunction to
define what a crime is before
proceeding to discussion of ap
propriate solutions to the prob
lem of criminal behavior would
actually not be very helpful in
the abstract.
What has happened is that ex
perience has shown that certain
activities legally designated as
crimes turn out to offer formida
ble problems of enforcement.
The concrete question has been
raised: Should the use of nar
cotics or adultery or homosexual
intercourse continue to be re
garded as crimes when in fact
there is no victim?
Similarly, a specific workable
proposal for community govern
ment would focus with sharp
clarity the problems involved in
the running of the university.
Generalized attempts at discov
ering the aims of the university
by consensus are apt only to
lead to vague generalities with
little consequences in general
action and improvement.

Mr. Peter Lyman,
President, ASSU
Dear Mr. Lyman:
Thank you for your thought
ful and ably reasoned letter with
regard to the proposal for a Sen
ate of the Academic Council.
You raise the possibility that
the creation of an elected Senate
to discharge the responsibility
of the Academic Council may in
fact interfere with subsequent
more fundamental reorganiza
tion of the governmental struc
ture of the University.
It is not the intent of the pro
posal to foreclose in any way
any wider reorganization. The
Academic Council is in principle
charged, as matters now stand,
with responsibility for a wide va
riety of matters concerned with
the educational and other aca
demic aspects of the University.
It is universally agreed within
the faculty that the present
mass meeting approach has
proved to be too cumbersome to
meet the needs of a changing
environment and changing val
ues. The aim of the Senate in
the first instance is simply a
greater efficiency in the dis
charge of the Academic Coun
cil's responsibilities however
these are defined.
The argument is the classical
preference for representation as
against direct democracy when
numbers are large and issues
are demanding of time and at
tention.
The authors of the present
draft proposal have indeed
sought to innovate in one re
spect. Recognizing that a uni
versity is a functionally differ

entiated system with great
asymmetry in the roles of dif
ferent members, the drafters
sought to make it easier for the
faculty to learn about varying
perspectives by introducing to

a problem at a fundamental lev

In the example of Mr. Pack

law, an important point is over

actually not be very helpful in
the abstract.
What has happened is that ex

activities legally designated as
crimes turn out to offer formida

there is no victim?
Similarly, a specific workable
proposal for community govern
ment would focus with sharp
clarity the problems involved in
the running of the university.
Generalized attempts at discov

by consensus are apt only to
lead to vague generalities with
little consequences in general
action and improvement.

(Editor's Note: Professor Ar
row yesterday sent this letter to
Peter Lyman in reply to his let
ter objecting: to the formation of
the Academic Senate. The pro
posal is now under consideration
by the Academic Council. The
text of Lyman's letter appeared
in the October 5 Daily.)
Mr. Peter Lyman,
President, ASSU
Dear Mr. Lyman:
Thank you for your thought
ful and ably reasoned letter with
regard to the proposal for a Sen
ate of the Academic Council.
You raise the possibility that
the creation of an elected Senate
to discharge the responsibility
of the Academic Council may in
fact interfere with subsequent
more fundamental reorganiza
tion of the governmental struc
ture of the University.
It is not the intent of the pro
posal to foreclose in any way
any wider reorganization. The
Academic Council is in principle
charged, as matters now stand,
with responsibility for a wide va
riety of matters concerned with
the educational and other aca
demic aspects of the University.
It is universally agreed within
the faculty that the present
mass meeting approach has
proved to be too cumbersome to
meet the needs of a changing
environment and changing val
ues. The aim of the Senate in
the first instance is simply a
greater efficiency in the dis
charge of the Academic Coun
cil's responsibilities however
these are defined.
The argument is the classical
preference for representation as
against direct democracy when
numbers are large and issues
are demanding of time and at
tention.
The authors of the present
draft proposal have indeed
sought to innovate in one re
spect. Recognizing that a uni
versity is a functionally differ

entiated system with great
asymmetry in the roles of dif
ferent members, the drafters
sought to make it easier for the
faculty to learn about varying
perspectives by introducing to
ken representation from admin
istrators and students.
There is no attempt to pretend
that the Senate is a body in
which all elements of the Uni
versity are represented accord
ing to their importance. It is a
faculty body which introduces
other elements in order to bet
ter carry out its functions and
its responsibilities to the entire
University.
I am the more emboldened to
urge the faculty to continue on
its present course because I have
not seen ever presented a viable
plan of community government.
I do not mean to exclude the
possible evolution of such plans,
but such evolution will under
the best of circumstances take
a long time.
It is very unwise, in my view,
to postpone a desirable reform
for the sake of a conceivably
better one in the absence of a
clearly defined alternative.
There is indeed an organ in
which broader notions of the
reorganization of University
government can be and are be
ing discussed; namely, the SES
Committee on the Government
of the University of which we
are both members.
Of course, I do not mean to
imply that the functioning of
this committee should in any
way inhibit simultaneous public
discussion of the issues. On the
contrary, the public discussion
may be valuable in bringing
more ideas to the attention of
the committee and the Univer
sity community.
Let me conclude with some
remarks about the opposition
which you find between defini
tion of a problem and its solu
tion.
The demand that a problem

be studied at its very roots and
in all of its ramifications may
in many situations prove to be
not the radical recommendation
it sounds, but rathor an invita
tion to total inaction. In a fun
damental philosophical sense no
