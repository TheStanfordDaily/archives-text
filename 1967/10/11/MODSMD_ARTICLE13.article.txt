## White Paternalism Flourishes, 
### Louis Knowles 
White paternalism flourishes
in institutions such as Stanford
that think of themselves as cen
ters of enlightenment and prog
ress.
It is nourished by the desire
of many students to do some
thing for humanity and particu
larly for poor people.
Once the white Stanford man
is well on his way to his degree
and a secure position in society,
he can afford the time to worry
about all the people that are
"less fortunate" than himself.
White Complicity
In many cases the student
may even recognize his own
complicity as a white man in
the oppressions of minority
groups. But when it comes to
acting on these concerns, the
university man leaves his analy
tical abilities in his briefcase.
Stanford programs to allevi
ate the problems of race and

poverty in the mid-peninsula
have shown levels of originality
and efficiency not far above those
of the Salvation Army.
Time is running out for white
liberals here and everywhere.
Upward Bound Rejected
Our War on Poverty planners
were taken aback last spring
when East Palo Alto had the
gall to reject Stanford's Up
ward Bound program. It would
have spent $60,000 on 40 chil
dren from East Palo Alto, bring
ing them to Stanford for the
summer and giving them a taste
of what it is like to be white and
encouraging them to work hard
and stay out of trouble.
But East Palo Alto didn't want
any more of its sons and daugh
ters being indoctrinated in the
virtues of white society and
they turned Upward Bound
down.
Instead they used OEO funds

to run thoir own black educa
tion and community action pro
gram at Ravenswood High
which involved 200 teenagers in
full-time activity over the sum
mer and reached hundreds of
preschool children with Head
Start-style assistance.
'P<x>r Negroes'
Stanford doesn't seem to have
learned much from the confron
tation of last spring. This year
the Ravenswood tutorial pro
gram has been revived for the
benefit of students who wish to
help the poor Negroes.
With all due respect to the
benevolent impulse behind it,
the tutorial is doomed to be yet
another project that missed the
mark.
The whole idea of introducing
white college students to the
black community as tutors for
individual high school pupils is
a relic of a time when men chose
to be blind to the social and
economic oppression that keeps
the black race in a secondary
status.
Tutorials, day camps, Christ
mas baskets, etc. were false ges
tures of concern because the
white man refused to go beyond
such tokenism and alter the
structures that gave him securi
ty and wealth but that left the
black man desolate. Now the
growing indignation of Black
America is preventing the con
tinuance of such ineffective pro
grams.
Ways of Cooperation
There may still be ways in
which Stanford can cooperate

with the black community, but
white administrators and stu
dents are not going to discover
them without assistance.
The Black Student Union has
expressed interest in assuming
control of the Ravenswood proj
ect, but so far it has been com
pletely ignored by the adminis
trators.
The BSU students not only
have the invaluable asset of be
ing black and therefore know
ing at first hand the temper of
the black community, but they
also have among their number
individuals that have extensive
experience in East Palo Alto it
self.
Black Union
Giving the BSU control of this
program, or at least establish
ing it as an advisory body,
would raise the social value of
the program immeasurably. But
Stanford must face the possi
bility that the BSU will decide
that white students have no role
in the black community.
They may very well echo the
advice of East Palo Alto organi
zers who for years have been
telling well-intentioned whites to
go home and work in their own
neighborhoods for a change.
Such an assignment is many
times more difficult than any
thing white students have ever
done in minority areas because
it means fighting with stereo
types white Americans have of
themselves. It means destroying
the myths of equalitarianism
and morality that have masked
the survival of racial hatred.

benefit of students who wish to
help the poor Negroes.
With all due respect to the
benevolent impulse behind it,
the tutorial is doomed to be yet
another project that missed the
mark.
The whole idea of introducing
white college students to the
black community as tutors for
individual high school pupils is
a relic of a time when men chose
to be blind to the social and
economic oppression that keeps
the black race in a secondary
status.
Tutorials, day camps, Christ
mas baskets, etc. were false ges
tures of concern because the
white man refused to go beyond
such tokenism and alter the
structures that gave him securi
ty and wealth but that left the
black man desolate. Now the
growing indignation of Black
America is preventing the con
tinuance of such ineffective pro
grams.
Ways of Cooperation
There may still be ways in
which Stanford can cooperate

with the black community, but
white administrators and stu
dents are not going to discover
them without assistance.
The Black Student Union has
expressed interest in assuming
control of the Ravenswood proj
ect, but so far it has been com
pletely ignored by the adminis
trators.
The BSU students not only
have the invaluable asset of be
ing black and therefore know
ing at first hand the temper of
the black community, but they
also have among their number
individuals that have extensive
experience in East Palo Alto it
self.
Black Union
Giving the BSU control of this
program, or at least establish
ing it as an advisory body,
would raise the social value of
the program immeasurably. But
Stanford must face the possi
bility that the BSU will decide
that white students have no role
in the black community.
They may very well echo the
advice of East Palo Alto organi
zers who for years have been
telling well-intentioned whites to
go home and work in their own
neighborhoods for a change.
Such an assignment is many
times more difficult than any
thing white students have ever
done in minority areas because
it means fighting with stereo
types white Americans have of
themselves. It means destroying
the myths of equalitarianism
and morality that have masked
the survival of racial hatred.
White paternalism flourishes
in institutions such as Stanford
that think of themselves as cen
ters of enlightenment and prog
ress.
It is nourished by the desire
of many students to do some
thing for humanity and particu
larly for poor people.
Once the white Stanford man
is well on his way to his degree
and a secure position in society,
he can afford the time to worry
about all the people that are
"less fortunate" than himself.
White Complicity
In many cases the student
may even recognize his own
complicity as a white man in
the oppressions of minority
groups. But when it comes to
acting on these concerns, the
university man leaves his analy
tical abilities in his briefcase.
Stanford programs to allevi
ate the problems of race and

poverty in the mid-peninsula
have shown levels of originality
and efficiency not far above those
of the Salvation Army.
Time is running out for white
liberals here and everywhere.
Upward Bound Rejected
Our War on Poverty planners
were taken aback last spring
when East Palo Alto had the
gall to reject Stanford's Up
ward Bound program. It would
have spent $60,000 on 40 chil
dren from East Palo Alto, bring
ing them to Stanford for the
summer and giving them a taste
of what it is like to be white and
encouraging them to work hard
and stay out of trouble.
But East Palo Alto didn't want
any more of its sons and daugh
ters being indoctrinated in the
virtues of white society and
they turned Upward Bound
down.
Instead they used OEO funds

to run thoir own black educa
tion and community action pro
gram at Ravenswood High
which involved 200 teenagers in
full-time activity over the sum
mer and reached hundreds of
preschool children with Head
Start-style assistance.

themselves. It means destroying
the myths of equalitarianism
and morality that have masked
the survival of racial hatred.
White paternalism flourishes
in institutions such as Stanford
that think of themselves as cen
ters of enlightenment and prog
ress.
It is nourished by the desire
of many students to do some
thing for humanity and particu
larly for poor people.
Once the white Stanford man
is well on his way to his degree
and a secure position in society,
he can afford the time to worry
about all the people that are
"less fortunate" than himself.
White Complicity
In many cases the student
may even recognize his own
complicity as a white man in
the oppressions of minority
groups. But when it comes to
acting on these concerns, the
university man leaves his analy
tical abilities in his briefcase.
Stanford programs to allevi
ate the problems of race and

poverty in the mid-peninsula
have shown levels of originality
and efficiency not far above those
of the Salvation Army.
Time is running out for white
liberals here and everywhere.
Upward Bound Rejected
Our War on Poverty planners
were taken aback last spring
when East Palo Alto had the
gall to reject Stanford's Up
ward Bound program. It would
have spent $60,000 on 40 chil
dren from East Palo Alto, bring
ing them to Stanford for the
summer and giving them a taste
of what it is like to be white and
encouraging them to work hard
and stay out of trouble.
But East Palo Alto didn't want
any more of its sons and daugh
ters being indoctrinated in the
virtues of white society and
they turned Upward Bound
down.
Instead they used OEO funds

to run thoir own black educa
tion and community action pro
gram at Ravenswood High
which involved 200 teenagers in
full-time activity over the sum
mer and reached hundreds of
preschool children with Head
Start-style assistance.
'P<x>r Negroes'
Stanford doesn't seem to have
learned much from the confron
tation of last spring. This year
the Ravenswood tutorial pro
gram has been revived for the
benefit of students who wish to
help the poor Negroes.
With all due respect to the
benevolent impulse behind it,
the tutorial is doomed to be yet
another project that missed the
mark.
The whole idea of introducing
white college students to the
black community as tutors for
individual high school pupils is
a relic of a time when men chose
to be blind to the social and
economic oppression that keeps
the black race in a secondary
status.
Tutorials, day camps, Christ
mas baskets, etc. were false ges
tures of concern because the
white man refused to go beyond
such tokenism and alter the
structures that gave him securi
ty and wealth but that left the
black man desolate. Now the
growing indignation of Black
America is preventing the con
tinuance of such ineffective pro
grams.
Ways of Cooperation
There may still be ways in
which Stanford can cooperate

with the black community, but
white administrators and stu
dents are not going to discover
them without assistance.
The Black Student Union has
expressed interest in assuming
control of the Ravenswood proj
ect, but so far it has been com
pletely ignored by the adminis
trators.
The BSU students not only
have the invaluable asset of be
ing black and therefore know
ing at first hand the temper of
the black community, but they
also have among their number
individuals that have extensive
experience in East Palo Alto it
self.
Black Union
Giving the BSU control of this
program, or at least establish
ing it as an advisory body,
would raise the social value of
the program immeasurably. But
Stanford must face the possi
bility that the BSU will decide
that white students have no role
in the black community.
They may very well echo the
advice of East Palo Alto organi
zers who for years have been
telling well-intentioned whites to
go home and work in their own
neighborhoods for a change.
Such an assignment is many
times more difficult than any
thing white students have ever
done in minority areas because
it means fighting with stereo
types white Americans have of
themselves. It means destroying
the myths of equalitarianism
and morality that have masked
the survival of racial hatred.
