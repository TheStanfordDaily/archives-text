## In-Crowd Adopts The Life Of Ideas 
### Bob Fishman 
"The In-Crowd will come to
order!"
The meeting hushed as The
Charismatic Leader rose ponder
ously from his chair.
"The barbarians are advanc
ing," he announced gravely.
"Last year — at the height
of our power — we controlled,
among other things, the Phi D It
House, The Daily, LASSU and
student government. The fame
of our scholars spread to all
the continents. We received an
Ambassador from the Soviet
Union, and a visit from the
president of Yale. Our ideology
dominated the campus.
"Our cuisine was world re
nowned; professors and admin
istrators sat in their offices wait
ing for an invitation to dinner.
Our volleyball team was unbeat
able, and Harpers magazine ex
tolled the quality of our conver
sation.
"Never have so few been so
better than so many," he com
mented.
"But, as Lao Tse once said,
Sic transit gloria mundi. We
lost the Phi Delt House after a
brief but bitter battle. On reach
ing our fortress retreat, Stern
Hall, we encountered unexpect
ed guerilla warfare from the in
habitants there. We succeeded
in occupying one of the wings,
but only after losing many com
rades and the Dean of Students.

"Even here, our enemies at
tack us. The Daily seems to have
fallen into the hands of the bar
barians, and from this citadel
they constantly harrass us. Scur
rilous cartoons, three-part ar
ticles, nasty letters to the editor
all our weapons have been
turned against us.
"We stand accused of forced
intellectualism, elitism, and tak
ing too long to eat dinner."
"What is to be done?" a young
man with a beard and worker's
cap asked.
"We must live a Life of Ideas,"
the Charismatic Leader replied.
A moment of silence followed
this verbalization of the sacred
formula.
The Charismatic Leader began
speaking again, in soft but in
spiring tones. "Only remember,"
he said, "that Thought without
Action is not enough. We must
fight barbarism whenever and
wherever it occurs.
"We will fight them in the
classrooms; we will fight them
in the dormitories. We will fight
them in the Quad or in White
Plaza, in The Daily or in the
Chronicle. We will fight them in
the Food Service. We will fight
them in the Housing Office.
"And when final victory comes,
as it inevitably must, the Uni
versity will say of us, 'This was
their finest hour.' "
