## Outlaw Seminars In Fraternities? 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
Your news article advertising
seminars to be given in Phi Psi
fraternity raises an issue that
has been virtually ignored in pub
lic debates about university pol
icy: Should courses accepted for
academic credit be taught in
fraternity houses?
Last year the Committee on
Undergraduate Education voted,
with some dissent, to allow such
courses, provided that half the
enrollment come from outside
the residence in which the class
meets. Both on principle and for
practical reasons, however, the
English Department faculty un
animously resolved not "to offer
courses under the auspices of
private clubs."
For many of us the question
is not whether fraternities ought
to exist or how they ought to
choose their membership, but
whether, functioning as they do,
they have any proper relation to
the curriculum.
The curriculum must be open
to all members of the community
who have the necessary aca
demic qualifications. So long as
fraternities and other clubs re
strict their membership on per
sonal grounds, the curriculum
ought to have nothing to do with
them.
The conflict seems to me fun
damental, and the requirement
that fraternity seminars enroll
students from "outside" does not
answer the chief objection. No
student interested in a course
taught at Stanford should be
obliged to attend classes in a club
that regards him, or his friends,
or anyone else in the community
as unfit for membership.
At least one Stanford fratern
ity now functions under an ex
plicit exemption from the "na
tional's" requirement that all
chapters exclude certain racial
groups. This admittedly extreme
example may suggest why some
students might not wish to in
vestigate the practices and the
national allegiance of a particu
lar club before enrolling in a sem
inar there.

• ISo Stern Disaster
Editor, the Daily:
James Briscoe's column on Dr.
Funk's article repeats the same
kind of outdated information
which may yet be the death of
the independent houses.
Three years ago I was little
happier than Mr. Briscoe with
the upperclass housing program.
I stayed on campus because I
had my food cooked for me, if
anyone cares to believe that.
In the past two years, some
houses have changed significant
ly. To emphasize this, I at
tempted to conduct an instant
survey of last year's freshmen in
Burbank House.
There were 23, of which 2 have
no address in the registrar's di
rectory, 4 are at overseas cam
puses this quarter, and 3 could
not be contacted for various rea
sons. The remaining 14 were giv
en the following interrogation:
"I have two questions to ask
you for a survey regarding your
freshman year in Stern. Answer
only yes or no.
1. Was your first-year reaction

to Stanford disappointment and
disillusionment?
2. Was Burbank House, as an
example of the upperclass hous
ing program, a disaster?"
Each of the questions is a close
paraphrase of a supposedly true
statement made in Mr.Briscoe's
editorial, except that he used the
words "appalling disaster." The
results are grouped according to
whether or not the respondent
returned to Burbank House this
year:
returned not returned
<N = 9) (N = 5)
# 1. Yes 2 0
No 7 5
# 2. No 9 4
Hell no 0 1
The strongly worded reply ap
pears at the insistence of the re
spondent.
I hope this may encourage
others to conduct more thorough
research into subjects relating to
the future of independent hous
ing at Stanford.

• Our Frosh —
Editor, The Daily:
I want to thank the Freshmen
but I also want to make it clear
that I am not just being polite
or routine. You were tolerant
of a variety of frustrations and
we appreciate your cooperation
during our testing program.
A "thank-you" may be appro
priate for your cooperation. The
openness and the trust you offer
ed in your response to the essay
questions require something
more.
We have had time to read

relatively few but we have been
deeply moved and feel challenged
by your searching, sensitive, and
perceptive analysis. It is at
once heartening and painful to
recognize your desire to inte
grate your quest for knowledge
with your immediate need to un
derstand yourself better.
There will be many pressures
from both yourself and others
which will work against such
an integration. You will be
tempted to believe it is neces
sary to choose one way or an
other. I want to assure you that
the questions you have and the
issues you are struggling with
are meaningful and they repre
sent what a liberal education is
all about.

Since Beta Theta Pi fraternity
is a much maligned group, (for
tunately, according to many
members of the Stanford Com
munity, unjustly so—) I wish
to take this opportunity to pub
licly praise cach member.
In twenty years of nursing, I
have never had a more reward
ing experience than running the
Infirmary at Stanford. I must
honestly state that the culmina
tion to date was the Beta Ti
Phoid epoch. On behalf of the
regular infirmary staff and the
wonderful "extra" nurses who
helped us, I cannot thank you

enough for making what could
have been a grim chore, a time
of pleasure and good feeling for
all concerned.
During twenty-eight straight
days at work, many of them
twelve or sixteen hours long, I
witnessed courage, determina
tion, patience, humor and sheer
guts I've not been privileged to
see before. I saw you face fear,
pain and anxiety both physically
and academically in a manner
many "adults" would love to
emulate. Those of you who were
not patients contributed so much
to the comfort and well being
of those who were.
Perhaps housekeepers you
were not, but men you are! A
credit to yourselves, your fami
lies and this community. I am

leave all articles outside before

• Soccer Apathy
Editor, The Daily:
Soccer is a wonderful sport.
It is played all over the world.
It requires finesse, courage, and

stamina, but a player docs not
have to he 6' 5" and weigh 230
lbs. to be good.
Overseas in Tours, France, our
group started a soccer team and
played French university varsity
teams. Most of the students in
our group had never played soc
cer, but the response was very
enthusiastic. We even gave some
of the French teams a good
battle.
It seems surprising, then, that
soccer is such an unknown sport
at Stanford. Why do Stanford
teams, despite the talent at hand,
have such losing seasons? Why
do many players quit the team
after freshman year?
Drastic changes are needed
in the way soccer is promoted
and run at Stanford. I hope the
Athletic department will consid
er what could be done with soc
cer. More important, I hope
those involved with the present
soccer program and former play
ers will do something to bring
soccer out of the grave at Stan
ford.

Your news article advertising
seminars to be given in Phi Psi
fraternity raises an issue that
has been virtually ignored in pub
lic debates about university pol
icy: Should courses accepted for
academic credit be taught in
fraternity houses?
Last year the Committee on
Undergraduate Education voted,
with some dissent, to allow such
courses, provided that half the
enrollment come from outside
the residence in which the class
meets. Both on principle and for
practical reasons, however, the
English Department faculty un
animously resolved not "to offer
courses under the auspices of
private clubs."
For many of us the question
is not whether fraternities ought
to exist or how they ought to
choose their membership, but
whether, functioning as they do,
they have any proper relation to
the curriculum.
The curriculum must be open
to all members of the community
who have the necessary aca
demic qualifications. So long as
fraternities and other clubs re
strict their membership on per
sonal grounds, the curriculum
ought to have nothing to do with
them.
The conflict seems to me fun
damental, and the requirement
that fraternity seminars enroll
students from "outside" does not
answer the chief objection. No
student interested in a course
taught at Stanford should be
obliged to attend classes in a club
that regards him, or his friends,
or anyone else in the community
as unfit for membership.
At least one Stanford fratern
ity now functions under an ex
plicit exemption from the "na
tional's" requirement that all
chapters exclude certain racial
groups. This admittedly extreme
example may suggest why some
students might not wish to in
vestigate the practices and the
national allegiance of a particu
lar club before enrolling in a sem

• ISo Stern Disaster
Editor, the Daily:
James Briscoe's column on Dr.
Funk's article repeats the same
kind of outdated information
which may yet be the death of
the independent houses.
Three years ago I was little
happier than Mr. Briscoe with
the upperclass housing program.
I stayed on campus because I
had my food cooked for me, if
anyone cares to believe that.
In the past two years, some
houses have changed significant
ly. To emphasize this, I at
tempted to conduct an instant
survey of last year's freshmen in
Burbank House.
There were 23, of which 2 have
no address in the registrar's di
rectory, 4 are at overseas cam
puses this quarter, and 3 could
not be contacted for various rea
sons. The remaining 14 were giv
en the following interrogation:
"I have two questions to ask
you for a survey regarding your
freshman year in Stern. Answer
only yes or no.
1. Was your first-year reaction

to Stanford disappointment and
disillusionment?
2. Was Burbank House, as an
example of the upperclass hous
ing program, a disaster?"
Each of the questions is a close
paraphrase of a supposedly true
statement made in Mr.Briscoe's
editorial, except that he used the
words "appalling disaster." The
results are grouped according to
whether or not the respondent
returned to Burbank House this
year:
returned not returned
<N = 9) (N = 5)
# 1. Yes 2 0
No 7 5
# 2. No 9 4
Hell no 0 1
The strongly worded reply ap

I hope this may encourage
others to conduct more thorough
research into subjects relating to
the future of independent hous

• Soccer Apathy
Editor, The Daily:
Soccer is a wonderful sport.
It is played all over the world.
It requires finesse, courage, and

stamina, but a player docs not
have to he 6' 5" and weigh 230
lbs. to be good.
Overseas in Tours, France, our
group started a soccer team and
played French university varsity
teams. Most of the students in
our group had never played soc
cer, but the response was very
enthusiastic. We even gave some
of the French teams a good
battle.
It seems surprising, then, that
soccer is such an unknown sport
at Stanford. Why do Stanford
teams, despite the talent at hand,
have such losing seasons? Why
do many players quit the team
after freshman year?
Drastic changes are needed
in the way soccer is promoted
and run at Stanford. I hope the

those involved with the present

Your news article advertising
seminars to be given in Phi Psi
fraternity raises an issue that
has been virtually ignored in pub
lic debates about university pol
icy: Should courses accepted for
academic credit be taught in
fraternity houses?
Last year the Committee on
Undergraduate Education voted,
with some dissent, to allow such
courses, provided that half the
enrollment come from outside
the residence in which the class
meets. Both on principle and for
practical reasons, however, the
English Department faculty un
animously resolved not "to offer
courses under the auspices of
private clubs."
For many of us the question
is not whether fraternities ought
to exist or how they ought to
choose their membership, but
whether, functioning as they do,
they have any proper relation to
the curriculum.
The curriculum must be open
to all members of the community
who have the necessary aca
demic qualifications. So long as
fraternities and other clubs re
strict their membership on per
sonal grounds, the curriculum
ought to have nothing to do with
them.
The conflict seems to me fun
damental, and the requirement
that fraternity seminars enroll
students from "outside" does not
answer the chief objection. No
student interested in a course
taught at Stanford should be
obliged to attend classes in a club
that regards him, or his friends,
or anyone else in the community
as unfit for membership.
At least one Stanford fratern
ity now functions under an ex
plicit exemption from the "na
tional's" requirement that all
chapters exclude certain racial
groups. This admittedly extreme
example may suggest why some
students might not wish to in
vestigate the practices and the
national allegiance of a particu
lar club before enrolling in a sem

• ISo Stern Disaster
Editor, the Daily:
James Briscoe's column on Dr.
Funk's article repeats the same
kind of outdated information
which may yet be the death of
the independent houses.
Three years ago I was little
happier than Mr. Briscoe with
the upperclass housing program.
I stayed on campus because I
had my food cooked for me, if
anyone cares to believe that.
In the past two years, some
houses have changed significant
ly. To emphasize this, I at
tempted to conduct an instant
survey of last year's freshmen in
Burbank House.
There were 23, of which 2 have
no address in the registrar's di
rectory, 4 are at overseas cam
puses this quarter, and 3 could
not be contacted for various rea
sons. The remaining 14 were giv
en the following interrogation:
"I have two questions to ask
you for a survey regarding your
freshman year in Stern. Answer
only yes or no.
1. Was your first-year reaction

to Stanford disappointment and
disillusionment?
2. Was Burbank House, as an
example of the upperclass hous
ing program, a disaster?"
Each of the questions is a close
paraphrase of a supposedly true
statement made in Mr.Briscoe's
editorial, except that he used the
words "appalling disaster." The
results are grouped according to
whether or not the respondent
returned to Burbank House this
year:
returned not returned
<N = 9) (N = 5)
# 1. Yes 2 0
No 7 5
# 2. No 9 4
Hell no 0 1
The strongly worded reply ap

I hope this may encourage

the future of independent hous

Editor, The Daily:
Soccer is a wonderful sport.
It is played all over the world.
It requires finesse, courage, and

stamina, but a player docs not
have to he 6' 5" and weigh 230
lbs. to be good.
Overseas in Tours, France, our
group started a soccer team and
played French university varsity
teams. Most of the students in
our group had never played soc
cer, but the response was very
enthusiastic. We even gave some
of the French teams a good

It seems surprising, then, that
soccer is such an unknown sport
at Stanford. Why do Stanford
teams, despite the talent at hand,
have such losing seasons? Why
do many players quit the team
after freshman year?
Drastic changes are needed
in the way soccer is promoted
and run at Stanford. I hope the

Your news article advertising
seminars to be given in Phi Psi
fraternity raises an issue that
has been virtually ignored in pub
lic debates about university pol
icy: Should courses accepted for
academic credit be taught in
fraternity houses?
Last year the Committee on
Undergraduate Education voted,
with some dissent, to allow such
courses, provided that half the
enrollment come from outside
the residence in which the class
meets. Both on principle and for
practical reasons, however, the
English Department faculty un
animously resolved not "to offer
courses under the auspices of
private clubs."
For many of us the question
is not whether fraternities ought
to exist or how they ought to
choose their membership, but
whether, functioning as they do,
they have any proper relation to
the curriculum.
The curriculum must be open
to all members of the community
who have the necessary aca
demic qualifications. So long as
fraternities and other clubs re
strict their membership on per
sonal grounds, the curriculum
ought to have nothing to do with
them.
The conflict seems to me fun
damental, and the requirement
that fraternity seminars enroll
students from "outside" does not
answer the chief objection. No
student interested in a course
taught at Stanford should be
obliged to attend classes in a club
that regards him, or his friends,
or anyone else in the community
as unfit for membership.
At least one Stanford fratern
ity now functions under an ex
plicit exemption from the "na
tional's" requirement that all
chapters exclude certain racial
groups. This admittedly extreme
example may suggest why some
students might not wish to in
vestigate the practices and the
national allegiance of a particu
lar club before enrolling in a sem

• ISo Stern Disaster
Editor, the Daily:
James Briscoe's column on Dr.
Funk's article repeats the same
kind of outdated information
which may yet be the death of
the independent houses.
Three years ago I was little
happier than Mr. Briscoe with
the upperclass housing program.
I stayed on campus because I
had my food cooked for me, if
anyone cares to believe that.
In the past two years, some
houses have changed significant
ly. To emphasize this, I at
tempted to conduct an instant
survey of last year's freshmen in
Burbank House.
There were 23, of which 2 have
no address in the registrar's di
rectory, 4 are at overseas cam
puses this quarter, and 3 could
not be contacted for various rea
sons. The remaining 14 were giv
en the following interrogation:
"I have two questions to ask
you for a survey regarding your
freshman year in Stern. Answer
only yes or no.
1. Was your first-year reaction

to Stanford disappointment and
disillusionment?
2. Was Burbank House, as an
example of the upperclass hous
ing program, a disaster?"
Each of the questions is a close
paraphrase of a supposedly true
statement made in Mr.Briscoe's
editorial, except that he used the
words "appalling disaster." The
results are grouped according to
whether or not the respondent
returned to Burbank House this
year:
returned not returned
<N = 9) (N = 5)
# 1. Yes 2 0
No 7 5
# 2. No 9 4
Hell no 0 1
The strongly worded reply ap

I hope this may encourage

the future of independent hous

Editor, The Daily:
Soccer is a wonderful sport.
It is played all over the world.
It requires finesse, courage, and

stamina, but a player docs not
have to he 6' 5" and weigh 230
lbs. to be good.
Overseas in Tours, France, our
group started a soccer team and
played French university varsity
teams. Most of the students in
our group had never played soc
cer, but the response was very
enthusiastic. We even gave some
of the French teams a good

It seems surprising, then, that
soccer is such an unknown sport
at Stanford. Why do Stanford
teams, despite the talent at hand,
have such losing seasons? Why
do many players quit the team
after freshman year?
Drastic changes are needed
in the way soccer is promoted
and run at Stanford. I hope the
