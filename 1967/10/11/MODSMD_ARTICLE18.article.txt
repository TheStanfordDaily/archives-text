# Scene and Herd
## Hoover—Liberal Intolerance 
### Fritz Schaefer 
I have been reading with in
terest the recent series of articles
on the Hoover Institution by one
of the Daily's aspiring young
leftists.
The attitudes of Stanford's "in
tellectual" hierarchy toward the
Hoover Institution bring forth
clearly an essential facet of the
academic community — intoler
ance towards those who hold
non-left wing views.
When Prof. Mancall, to cite a
recent example, gets up and
blasts forth with the usual
bushelful of naive cliches about
the immoral war in Vietnam, the
evils of anti-Communism, etc, no
one even thinks to put him down
for "using a supposedly aca
demic institution for a broadcast
ing platform."
All the good "liberals" just pat
Mancall on the back and congrat
ulate him for doing his humani
tarian duty. The same sort of
thing happens when the
esteemed Prof. Novak condemns
the entire structure of American
society.
Guardians Of Freedom
But, when Dr. Stefan Possony
of the Hoover Institution dares to
take issue with these guardians
of academic freedom on the war
in Vietnam or the anti-missile
missile, he is immediately de

nounced in unison by the left
wing academic establishment.
A Stanford History Professor
calls Dr. Possony "a great mis
fortune." Yes, indeed, he is a
great misfortune to those pro
fessors who see their calling in
life as the brainwashing of Am
erican youth with their leftist
ideology.
Dr. Possony is a serious road
block to those who envision edu
cation as a process of indoctrina
tion, rather than a confrontation
between opposing philosophies
and a searching for the truth.
The Daily writer refers to Dr.
Possony as a "professor", in
quotes, the clear implication be
ing that only those who hold the
proper left-wing views are en
titled to be called professors.
Why is it that the same stand
ards of academic freedom which
are applied to a liberal cannot
be applied to a conservative?
Professor Newleft
The real reason the academic
hierarchy doesn't like the Hoover
Institution is that the Hoover In
stitution's Researchers often pre
sent ideas which are alien to the
academe's radical goals. The "lib
erals" would rather not see these
ideas discussed seriously.
Professor Newleft says he
wants Hoover destroyed because

it "is an organ for anti-commu
nist propaganda," but what he
really means is that he doesn't
want the dangers of communism
to be discussed intelligently.
The Hoover Institution's li
brary contains a record of the
monstrous atrocities which fifty
years of communism have
brought and continue to bring
the world—millions of humans
being slaughtered and the free
doms of those allowed to live de
prived.
With this record always in the
background at Stanford, it makes
it all the more ridiculous for Pro
fessor Newleft to condemn anti
communism. No wonder the left
ists are challenging Hoover's
right to exist.
Pot And Kettle
The Daily headline reads
"Right Wing Bias Charged at

Hoover." I would venture to say
that the Stanford University Hu
manities Faculty is farther to
the left than the Hoover Institu
tion is to the right. Surely this
is a classic example of the pot
calling the kettle black.
The search for truth, which
should be the purpose of a Uni
versity, is best conducted in an
atmosphere which lends itself to
the intelligent presentation of op
posing points of view.
Without the Hoover Institu
tion, the so-called search for
truth.which is supposed to be go
ing on at Stanford, would be even
more ludicrous than it already is.
It is typical of the hypocrisy
of the academic hierarchy that it
resents the Hoover Institution, a
force which greatly contributes
to that goal which the University
pretends to aspire to —the truth.

But, when Dr. Stefan Possony
of the Hoover Institution dares to
take issue with these guardians
of academic freedom on the war
in Vietnam or the anti-missile
missile, he is immediately de

nounced in unison by the left
wing academic establishment.
A Stanford History Professor
calls Dr. Possony "a great mis
fortune." Yes, indeed, he is a
great misfortune to those pro
fessors who see their calling in
life as the brainwashing of Am
erican youth with their leftist
ideology.
Dr. Possony is a serious road
block to those who envision edu
cation as a process of indoctrina
tion, rather than a confrontation
between opposing philosophies
and a searching for the truth.
The Daily writer refers to Dr.
Possony as a "professor", in
quotes, the clear implication be
ing that only those who hold the
proper left-wing views are en
titled to be called professors.
Why is it that the same stand
ards of academic freedom which
are applied to a liberal cannot
be applied to a conservative?
Professor Newleft
The real reason the academic
hierarchy doesn't like the Hoover
Institution is that the Hoover In
stitution's Researchers often pre
sent ideas which are alien to the
academe's radical goals. The "lib
erals" would rather not see these
ideas discussed seriously.
Professor Newleft says he
wants Hoover destroyed because

it "is an organ for anti-commu
nist propaganda," but what he
really means is that he doesn't
want the dangers of communism
to be discussed intelligently.
The Hoover Institution's li
brary contains a record of the
monstrous atrocities which fifty
years of communism have
brought and continue to bring
the world—millions of humans
being slaughtered and the free
doms of those allowed to live de
prived.
With this record always in the
background at Stanford, it makes
it all the more ridiculous for Pro
fessor Newleft to condemn anti
communism. No wonder the left
ists are challenging Hoover's
right to exist.
Pot And Kettle
The Daily headline reads
"Right Wing Bias Charged at

Hoover." I would venture to say
that the Stanford University Hu
manities Faculty is farther to
the left than the Hoover Institu
tion is to the right. Surely this
is a classic example of the pot
calling the kettle black.
The search for truth, which
should be the purpose of a Uni
versity, is best conducted in an
atmosphere which lends itself to
the intelligent presentation of op
posing points of view.
Without the Hoover Institu
tion, the so-called search for
truth.which is supposed to be go
ing on at Stanford, would be even
more ludicrous than it already is.
It is typical of the hypocrisy
of the academic hierarchy that it
resents the Hoover Institution, a
force which greatly contributes
to that goal which the University
pretends to aspire to —the truth.
I have been reading with in
terest the recent series of articles
on the Hoover Institution by one
of the Daily's aspiring young
leftists.
The attitudes of Stanford's "in
tellectual" hierarchy toward the
Hoover Institution bring forth
clearly an essential facet of the
academic community — intoler
ance towards those who hold
non-left wing views.
When Prof. Mancall, to cite a
recent example, gets up and
blasts forth with the usual
bushelful of naive cliches about
the immoral war in Vietnam, the
evils of anti-Communism, etc, no
one even thinks to put him down
for "using a supposedly aca
demic institution for a broadcast
ing platform."
All the good "liberals" just pat
Mancall on the back and congrat

tarian duty. The same sort of
thing happens when the
esteemed Prof. Novak condemns
the entire structure of American
