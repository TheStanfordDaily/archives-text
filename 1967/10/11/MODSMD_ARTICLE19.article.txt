# Coach Denies Height A Passing Problem
## 
### NICK SELBY (An interview with Stanford football coach John Ralston) 
Q. A lot of people have been
saying that neither Mark Mar
quess or Chuck Williams are
tall enough to be quarterbacks.
Marquess is listed at 5' 11", and
Williams is 5' 9" tall. Does this
really make a difference in their
ability to pass the ball and his
receivers?
Coach Ralston: I don't think
their height is in any way a fac
tor. After all, you're only talk
ing about a few inches. SMU
has a 5' 4" quarterback and
they're doing OK with him. And
there's no way we can make
them grow any taller.
Q. Does this height fat-tor
have anything to do with the
use of pass plays off roll outs
by our quarterbacks?
Coach Ralston: We think that
It is easier for them to throw
from a roll out maneuver than
from a straight drop back pass.
Q. But isn't it harder to pro
vide pass blocking on a roll out
pass play? Stanford's quarter
backs were being harrassed all
night at USC by the USC line
men and never had adequate
time to set up and throw.
Coach Ralston: It is a little
harder, but we've found that we
can hold the defense from rush
ing too quickly with a fake into
the line. We're probably going
to use those running play fakes
into the line more often.
Also, our drop pass is not
really a straight drop back. Th ?
quarterback will slant to the
outside, then stop and set up be
hind the tackle.
Q. Is Williams a better passer
than Marquess? Is he the one
you go to when you need to
throw the ball?
Coach Ralston: Chuck (Wil
liams) has had more practice
than Marquess, because he was
out for spring practice last year
when Marquess was playing
baseball. Also, Williams was a
very good passer when he play
ed at Ventura J.C.
Q. Have your receivers been
getting open enough? Williams
and Marquess did amazingly
well dodging the USC rushers,
then got a second to set up,

but seemed unable to find any
one open.
Coach Ralston: There were
times we had receivers open, but
couldn't throw the ball. We call
ed 31 passes, but only got off 22.
By the time our passers got time
to set up, our receivers had been
picked up man to man by the
USC defenders.
Also, when your protection
starts breaking down, you can't
send everyone out. We send out
two or three at a time usually,
but Washington State whom we
play here Saturday sends out
five occasionally.
Q. What do you expect from
Washington State?
Coach Ralston: Bert Clark, the
WSU coach, said, "Stanford will
be the easiest team on our sche
dule." This should get our team
mad, in fact, it better get them
mad. What he meant was that
he could get his team very easi
ly "fired up" to play Stanford.
The Cougars have a very wide
open offense and their 10-7 loss
to Baylor last week is indicative
of their potential. The 49-0 loss
to USC in their first game was
not. The WSU quarterback John
Henderson is a good passer, and
he has good receivers.
Q. What is the WSU "veer"
offense?
Coach Ralston: They play their
running backs very close togeth
er behind the guards, and when
the quarterback gives the ball
to one of those backs, the back
veers off at an angle along the
line until he finds a hole. It's
really nothing new, but they're
very quick and work their plays
well.
Q. How does our team look
for the game?
Coach Ralston: The boys came
back very well after the 30-0
loss Saturday and are in good
spirits. This is too good a team
to stay down.
Broughton and Swartz are
still having knee trouble, and
we're not sure about Tom Hazel
rigg yet. But Parish and Schnei
der will play at the other de
fensive end. Kirtman should be
OK also.
