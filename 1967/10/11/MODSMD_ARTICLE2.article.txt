# Novak Says US Can't Win
## 
### JAN WELLS 
Six wars are being fought in
Vietnam today, of which the
United States is winning only
one, according to Professor Mi
chael Novak in the concluding
lecture of the Row series on
Vietnam last night.
Novak, who spent over a
month in Vietnam last summer,
chose as his title, "A Bucket of
Worms," a phrase he first heard
from the senior advisor to a
province chief. Reaching into
the bucket, it is difficult to get
hold of just one worm; Vietnam
is the same way with its am
biguities, opposites, and incon
sistencies, according to Novak.
Novak agrees with the gen
erals who say that we cannot
lose, that we are winning in
Vietnam. We are winning the
conventional large scale war.
"Even the Viet Cong admit this;
they are not fighting the same
war."
Losing: The Other Five
However, we are not winning
the other five wars: the fight for
independence and nationalism;
the fight of the peasants and
poor for economic freedom; the
Tennessee mountain feuds in
many towns; the Buddhist
struggle for the preservation of
Vietnamese customs; and the
local guerilla wars, Novak said.
Novak noticed increasing an
ti-Americanism during his stay
in Vietnam. "The United States
is almost as much feared as
China. Soon we will be more
feared than China . . . Vietna
mese often ask why we are
there. They're so certain that
we're not there for the Vietna

mese. They usually concluded
that we're there against China,
that our forces are a build-up
in preparation for a war aganist
China."
"From one standpoint the
elections were a sort of triumph,
from another a masquerade,"
Novak claimed. On the positive
side Novak counts the 30 days
of free criticism of the govern
ment and the fact that approxi
mately two-thirds of the people
who voted, voted for Peace can
didates.
Nine candidates made a cease
fire the main issue on their plat
form.
On the other hand, there are
16 million people in Vietnam,
over half of whom are of voting
age, but there were only 5.5 mil
lion registered or were allowed
to register.

Neutralists, as well as pro-
Communists, were not allowed to
register. In fact, "neutralists
can by law be shot after a sum
mary trial, without a jury trial."
As for the fairness of the elec
tion, "the Vietnamese think not
in terms of malpractice as we do,
but that the elections were unfair
in structure: There is a Consti
tutional provision stating that of
fice holders must resign before
they run. Ky was exemtped from
this requirement.
"In Vietnam being the incum
bent means more than it does
here. The government appoints
everyone with a Civil job."

the bucket, it is difficult to get
hold of just one worm; Vietnam
is the same way with its am
biguities, opposites, and incon
sistencies, according to Novak.
Novak agrees with the gen
erals who say that we cannot
lose, that we are winning in
Vietnam. We are winning the
conventional large scale war.
"Even the Viet Cong admit this;
they are not fighting the same
war."
Losing: The Other Five
However, we are not winning
the other five wars: the fight for
independence and nationalism;
the fight of the peasants and
poor for economic freedom; the
Tennessee mountain feuds in
many towns; the Buddhist
struggle for the preservation of
Vietnamese customs; and the
local guerilla wars, Novak said.
Novak noticed increasing an
ti-Americanism during his stay
in Vietnam. "The United States
is almost as much feared as
China. Soon we will be more
feared than China . . . Vietna
mese often ask why we are
there. They're so certain that
we're not there for the Vietna

mese. They usually concluded
that we're there against China,
that our forces are a build-up
in preparation for a war aganist
China."
"From one standpoint the
elections were a sort of triumph,
from another a masquerade,"
Novak claimed. On the positive
side Novak counts the 30 days
of free criticism of the govern
ment and the fact that approxi
mately two-thirds of the people
who voted, voted for Peace can
didates.
Nine candidates made a cease
fire the main issue on their plat
form.
On the other hand, there are
16 million people in Vietnam,
over half of whom are of voting
age, but there were only 5.5 mil
lion registered or were allowed
to register.

Neutralists, as well as pro-
Communists, were not allowed to
register. In fact, "neutralists
can by law be shot after a sum
mary trial, without a jury trial."
As for the fairness of the elec
tion, "the Vietnamese think not
in terms of malpractice as we do,
but that the elections were unfair
in structure: There is a Consti
tutional provision stating that of
fice holders must resign before
they run. Ky was exemtped from
this requirement.
"In Vietnam being the incum
bent means more than it does
here. The government appoints
everyone with a Civil job."
Six wars are being fought in
Vietnam today, of which the
United States is winning only
one, according to Professor Mi
chael Novak in the concluding
lecture of the Row series on
Vietnam last night.
Novak, who spent over a
month in Vietnam last summer,
chose as his title, "A Bucket of
Worms," a phrase he first heard
from the senior advisor to a
province chief. Reaching into
the bucket, it is difficult to get
hold of just one worm; Vietnam
is the same way with its am
biguities, opposites, and incon
sistencies, according to Novak.
