WHERE'S THE HOLE?: Two USC blockers reveal the reason for
O. J. Simpson's great success as a runner this year. Tackle Jack
O'Malley (73) and fullback Mike Hull (23) drive Stanford defensive
men to the side, leaving a hole for Simpson (32). Lurking' in the
background for Stanford is defensive end Don Parish (82), who
watched Simpson receive the handolT from Trojan quarterback
Steve Sogge and moved into the hole to tackle Simpson.


A LEAP OVER THE HEAP: Here Simpson's way is blocked by a
USC blocker on the ground. So the fleet sprinter merely takes' to
the air and sails for more yardage. John Ralston says of Simpson,
"He is going to be one of the greatest who ever wore a uniform.
His entire future lies in front of him." Simpson leads the PAC-8
in total ofYense with 618 yards and is also first in rushing with a
6.0 average.
