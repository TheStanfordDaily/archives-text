# Graduates Complain To SES: 'Too Much For Too Little Pay'
## 
### 
Too much work and not
enough money were two of the
graduate students' problems pre
sented yesterday to the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) in
the second day of open hearings
on graduate studies.
One student complained that in
his department a research assis
tant could expect to earn no more
than $235 a month and yet work
five, six or seven years before
getting his degree.
He suggested that no graduate
program take more than five
years to complete, because a stu
dent now can be drafted if he
takes longer.
Several of the 14 others at
tending the hearings pointed out
most Ph.D. programs now take
about four years to finish.
Specialization in graduate
school was another topic of dis
cussion. Archie Duncanson, grad
uate in Engineering Economic
Systems, remarked that grad
uate students now face "too
much course work and not
enough chance to do individual
work."

"There's too much pressure
from problem sets, exams and so
on to get off and work on your
own," Duncanson said, but added,
"I can see the problem is that
there aren't enough professors
to go around."
Physics graduate Peter Zim
merman disagreed. "It would be
nice to have more interdisciplin
ary programs," he said, "but this
is kind of impractical as the pro
grams are set up now."
He continued,-"By the time you
get to graduate school, you've
done your broadening as an un
dergraduate. Or if you haven't,
you should have." In graduate
school, he said, "It's time to spec
ialize."
Eric Bredo, graduate in Engi
neering Economic Systems, took
graduate education to task for
being "very out of touch with
the world outside. You can name
all kinds of problems that the
University doesn't work on."
"I think graduate education
should be what you want it to
be," he went on. "Today there's
a distinction made between the

student as an academician and as
a person. I don't think there
should be that kind of distinc
tion."
Bredo asked rhetorically,
"Why not specialize in generali
zation?"
Zimmerman later replied,
"Graduate education as it exists
is specialization. If you want
another kind (generalized) de
gree or program, that's fine. But
then we're talking about two dif
ferent things."
Political Science graduate Bob
Phillips proposed that part of
every student's graduate pro
gram should be a period of out
side time spent in social or com
munity service or work con
nected with his field.
Thus students would be, he
said "taking a year and actually
practicing the kind of field they
are studying." Many students do
this outside work now, he said,
but more should be encouraged
and they should receive support
from the University, in extended
scholarships and academic credit.
"All disciplines should maxi
mize individual creativity and
the relevance of this to the area
a person is studying," Phillips
said, "and they should minimize
artificial tensions and anxieties."
One professor lamented, "We
academicians tend to see the dis
cipline as having the most value,
and the student is expected to
fit into it."
