# Campus Resigned To Traffic Change
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Resistance to the changes in
Lomita and Galvez Streets is
lessening, according to Dwight
Adams, University business
manager.
It was Adams who imple
mented the decision at the end
of the summer to begin con
struction on the planned Lomita
Mall and to block off Galvez.
Since then he has received sev
eral complaints and a good deal
of kidding from members of the
community.
"I haven't had a complaint
call in the last week," Adams
said, "and the needling at the
Faculty Club has considerably
diminished. I think people are
getting used to the situation."
Adams feels it is a good situa
tion to get used to. He said he

carried out the closing of Gal
vez because there was a threat
of accidents resulting from cars
accelerating after the stop sign
at Escondido and Galvez. There
had been several accidents there
and several near misses.
Central Cul De-Saes
Besides making passage to the
Quad easier for students who
live in the residences across Gal
vez, the street closing also helps
implement the University's long
range traffic plan, according to
the business manager. Adams
explained that the plan envi
sioned Campus Drive as a "peri
pheral road" with cul-de-sacs
running into the center of the
campus.
"Whenever you want to go
anywhere on campus, you just
get on the peripheral road un
til you reach the cul-de-sac that

is closest to whore you want to
be," Adams said. "I've timed my
self many times, and the peri
pheral road route is just as
quick as the old way and some
times quicker."
Adams points out that the pe
ripheral road takes traffic noise
away from the "heartland" of
the campus and also protects
bicyclists and pedestrians. He
admits that for another month
the section of Campus Drive
that runs past the Maples Pavil
lion project will not be finished.
"But when it's done," he said
of the $244,300 strip, "we'll have
a double-barreled road all the
way around the campus except
for the southwest portion which
will be built later."
Why The Delay?
Construction behind the Quad
and on Lomita is also Adams's

concern. The Daily asked why
construction on this project
could not have been finished dur
ing the summer.
"It's a question of financing,"
Adams replied, "we didn't have
the money at the beginning of
the summer; we have it now.
We couldn't wait until next sum
mer because labor and material
costs will certainly rise."
Adams said "Everything hu
manlv possible" was done to get
the $517,000 job bid and start
ed before construction could in
terrupt classes as it is now do
ing. Though the University may
seem to have vast amounts of
money, all of it is strictly allo
cated.
"Gold Drain"
"You try to do the best you
can with what you've got,"
Adams said. "You've got to get
a job started as soon as possible
to avoid wasting money."
Lecturers and instructors are
"very, very considerate" by be
ing patient in spite of the con
struction noises that sometimes
interrupt classes, Adams said.
Though the lengthening of Due
na Street at a cost of $129,000
should be done within a month,
the Lomita Mall will take till

April, excluding some landscap
ing.
Engineering Dean Alfred Kirk
land told The Daily that the con
struction back of the Quad was
merely "something we have to
live with." He said he felt the
finished mall would be more
beautiful than the "Chinese
wall' that used to run by Engi
neering corner.
Gigantic Mud Bath
"We're really very dependent
on the weather," Adams cau
tioned. "If it should rain early
this year, all that area behind
and beside the Quad would be
come one big mud bath. We
couldn't get going again on con
struction for some time."
Adams said he was convinced
the closing of Galvez was "100
percent right." "We were living
on borrowed time till we got a
serious accident there. I
wouldn't want to have had that
on my shoulders."
One Stern resident questioned
by The Daily said, "I never
thought the traffic problem on
Galvez was too bad. And they
only closed the part of Galvez
in front of Crothers; a lot of
people just go through the li
brary parking lot anyway."

the closing of Galvez was "100
percent right." "We were living
on borrowed time till we got a
serious accident there. I
wouldn't want to have had that
on my shoulders."
One Stern resident questioned
by The Daily said, "I never
thought the traffic problem on
Galvez was too bad. And they
only closed the part of Galvez
in front of Crothers; a lot of
people just go through the li
brary parking lot anyway."
Resistance to the changes in
Lomita and Galvez Streets is
lessening, according to Dwight
Adams, University business
manager.
It was Adams who imple
mented the decision at the end
of the summer to begin con
struction on the planned Lomita
Mall and to block off Galvez.
Since then he has received sev
eral complaints and a good deal
of kidding from members of the
community.
"I haven't had a complaint
call in the last week," Adams
said, "and the needling at the
Faculty Club has considerably
diminished. I think people are
getting used to the situation."
Adams feels it is a good situa
tion to get used to. He said he

carried out the closing of Gal
vez because there was a threat
of accidents resulting from cars
accelerating after the stop sign
at Escondido and Galvez. There
had been several accidents there
and several near misses.
Central Cul De-Saes
Besides making passage to the
Quad easier for students who
live in the residences across Gal
vez, the street closing also helps
implement the University's long
range traffic plan, according to
the business manager. Adams
explained that the plan envi
sioned Campus Drive as a "peri
pheral road" with cul-de-sacs
running into the center of the
campus.
"Whenever you want to go
anywhere on campus, you just
get on the peripheral road un
til you reach the cul-de-sac that

is closest to whore you want to
be," Adams said. "I've timed my
self many times, and the peri
pheral road route is just as
quick as the old way and some
times quicker."
Adams points out that the pe
ripheral road takes traffic noise
away from the "heartland" of
the campus and also protects
bicyclists and pedestrians. He
admits that for another month
the section of Campus Drive
that runs past the Maples Pavil
lion project will not be finished.
"But when it's done," he said
of the $244,300 strip, "we'll have
a double-barreled road all the
way around the campus except
for the southwest portion which
will be built later."
Why The Delay?
Construction behind the Quad
and on Lomita is also Adams's

concern. The Daily asked why
construction on this project
could not have been finished dur
ing the summer.
"It's a question of financing,"
Adams replied, "we didn't have
the money at the beginning of
the summer; we have it now.
We couldn't wait until next sum
mer because labor and material
costs will certainly rise."
Adams said "Everything hu
manlv possible" was done to get
the $517,000 job bid and start
ed before construction could in
terrupt classes as it is now do
ing. Though the University may
seem to have vast amounts of
money, all of it is strictly allo
cated.
"Gold Drain"
"You try to do the best you
can with what you've got,"
Adams said. "You've got to get
a job started as soon as possible
to avoid wasting money."
Lecturers and instructors are
"very, very considerate" by be
ing patient in spite of the con
struction noises that sometimes
interrupt classes, Adams said.
Though the lengthening of Due
na Street at a cost of $129,000
should be done within a month,
the Lomita Mall will take till

April, excluding some landscap
ing.
Engineering Dean Alfred Kirk
land told The Daily that the con
struction back of the Quad was
merely "something we have to
live with." He said he felt the
finished mall would be more
beautiful than the "Chinese
wall' that used to run by Engi
neering corner.
Gigantic Mud Bath
"We're really very dependent
on the weather," Adams cau
tioned. "If it should rain early
this year, all that area behind
and beside the Quad would be
come one big mud bath. We
couldn't get going again on con
struction for some time."

the closing of Galvez was "100

on borrowed time till we got a

wouldn't want to have had that

finished mall would be more
beautiful than the "Chinese
wall' that used to run by Engi
neering corner.
Gigantic Mud Bath
"We're really very dependent
on the weather," Adams cau
tioned. "If it should rain early
this year, all that area behind
and beside the Quad would be
come one big mud bath. We
couldn't get going again on con
struction for some time."
Adams said he was convinced
the closing of Galvez was "100
percent right." "We were living
on borrowed time till we got a
serious accident there. I
wouldn't want to have had that
on my shoulders."
One Stern resident questioned
by The Daily said, "I never
thought the traffic problem on
Galvez was too bad. And they
only closed the part of Galvez
in front of Crothers; a lot of
people just go through the li
brary parking lot anyway."
Resistance to the changes in
Lomita and Galvez Streets is
lessening, according to Dwight
Adams, University business
manager.
It was Adams who imple
mented the decision at the end
of the summer to begin con
struction on the planned Lomita
Mall and to block off Galvez.
Since then he has received sev
eral complaints and a good deal
of kidding from members of the
community.
"I haven't had a complaint
call in the last week," Adams
said, "and the needling at the
Faculty Club has considerably
diminished. I think people are
getting used to the situation."
Adams feels it is a good situa
tion to get used to. He said he

carried out the closing of Gal
vez because there was a threat
of accidents resulting from cars
accelerating after the stop sign
at Escondido and Galvez. There
had been several accidents there
and several near misses.
Central Cul De-Saes
Besides making passage to the
Quad easier for students who
live in the residences across Gal
vez, the street closing also helps
implement the University's long
range traffic plan, according to
the business manager. Adams
explained that the plan envi
sioned Campus Drive as a "peri
pheral road" with cul-de-sacs
running into the center of the
campus.
"Whenever you want to go
anywhere on campus, you just
get on the peripheral road un
til you reach the cul-de-sac that

is closest to whore you want to
be," Adams said. "I've timed my
self many times, and the peri
pheral road route is just as
quick as the old way and some
times quicker."
Adams points out that the pe
ripheral road takes traffic noise
away from the "heartland" of
the campus and also protects
bicyclists and pedestrians. He
admits that for another month
the section of Campus Drive
that runs past the Maples Pavil
lion project will not be finished.
"But when it's done," he said
of the $244,300 strip, "we'll have
a double-barreled road all the
way around the campus except
for the southwest portion which
will be built later."
Why The Delay?
Construction behind the Quad
and on Lomita is also Adams's

concern. The Daily asked why
construction on this project
could not have been finished dur
ing the summer.
"It's a question of financing,"
Adams replied, "we didn't have
the money at the beginning of
the summer; we have it now.
We couldn't wait until next sum
mer because labor and material
costs will certainly rise."
Adams said "Everything hu
manlv possible" was done to get
the $517,000 job bid and start
ed before construction could in
terrupt classes as it is now do
ing. Though the University may
seem to have vast amounts of
money, all of it is strictly allo
cated.
"Gold Drain"
"You try to do the best you
can with what you've got,"
Adams said. "You've got to get
a job started as soon as possible
to avoid wasting money."
Lecturers and instructors are
"very, very considerate" by be
ing patient in spite of the con
struction noises that sometimes
interrupt classes, Adams said.
Though the lengthening of Due
na Street at a cost of $129,000
should be done within a month,
the Lomita Mall will take till

April, excluding some landscap
ing.
Engineering Dean Alfred Kirk
land told The Daily that the con
struction back of the Quad was
merely "something we have to
live with." He said he felt the
finished mall would be more
beautiful than the "Chinese
wall' that used to run by Engi
neering corner.
