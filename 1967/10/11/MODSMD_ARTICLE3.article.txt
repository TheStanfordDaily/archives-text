# Bundy: NFL Weak, Defections Growing
## 
### SUE DONNELLY 
The National Liberation Front
(NLF) is having increasing dif
ficulties recruiting in South Viet
nam and major defections from
its ranks may be in the offing,
William P. Bundy, Assistant Sec
retary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs said here yes
terday afternoon.
Bundy spoke at Cubberley Au
ditorium as part of the two-day
Foreign Service Workshop spon
sored by the Institute for Inter
national Relations. The work
shop will end tomorrow with
two talks at Tresidder Union by
Ambassador George V. Allen,
director of the Foreign Service
Institute in Washington, D.C.
Allen will speak informally
about the Foreign Service as
a career at 4:15 p.m. His main
address, "American Diplomacy
Today," will be at 7:30 p.m.
Front For Hanoi
"As an organization it (the
NLF) is under Hanoi's thumb,"

Bundy asserted. "This has been
proven conclusively by captured
documents."
However, many individuals in
it — and perhaps at substantial
levels — are subjectively south
erners, he said.
And these individuals may be
prepared to say at some time
that they see more chance of
achieving something through po
litical means in the South, Bundy
said. "It is a question of the
position of individuals in the
Front."
Ho Unlike Tito
Asked if Ho Chi Minh might
become a "Tito-like leader" if
the U.S. pulled its forces out
now, Bundy said there was one
big difference between the lead
ers. While Tito has no territorial
ambitions, Ho Chi Minh' has am
bitions for Laos and Cambodia.
And he might work in parallel
with the Chinese Communists
to seek domination of Southeast
Asia — as long as his own ter
ritory was left alone," Bundy
added.
In an interview earlier yester
day Bundy was asked about the
possibility of the U.S. blockad
ing Haiphong Harbor, impairing
the southward flow of military
supplies and forcing the issue
of Russia's involvement.
He replied that in spite of the
strong military case for the
blockade, President Johnson and
his advisors fear to risk its pos
sible wider consequences.
Much of the material now be
ing shipped in through Haiphong
might be transported through
Communist China, he said, "in
creasing China's leverage on the
situation."

And captured documents and
other evidence show China's
leadership is "200 per cent
against peace," he said.
Russia Uncertain
Also, we cannot assume that
Russia will simply "get out" if
challenged with a blockade, he
said.
Bundy termed the bombing of
North Vietnam "an indispens
able additional pressure" on Ha
noi. But bombing alone will not
end the war, he said. A combi
nation of factors is required.
Bundy feels Hanoi is already
persuaded it cannot win the war
militarily. But they need to be
persuaded that the whole situa
tion — social, economic, and po
litical — is moving against them,
he said.

Also, we cannot assume that
Russia will simply "get out" if
challenged with a blockade, he
said.
Bundy termed the bombing of
North Vietnam "an indispens

end the war, he said. A combi
nation of factors is required.
Bundy feels Hanoi is already
persuaded it cannot win the war
militarily. But they need to be
persuaded that the whole situa

to seek domination of Southeast
Asia — as long as his own ter
ritory was left alone," Bundy
added.
In an interview earlier yester
day Bundy was asked about the
possibility of the U.S. blockad
ing Haiphong Harbor, impairing
the southward flow of military
supplies and forcing the issue
of Russia's involvement.
He replied that in spite of the
strong military case for the
blockade, President Johnson and
his advisors fear to risk its pos
sible wider consequences.
Much of the material now be
ing shipped in through Haiphong
might be transported through
Communist China, he said, "in
creasing China's leverage on the
situation."

And captured documents and
other evidence show China's
leadership is "200 per cent
against peace," he said.

The National Liberation Front
(NLF) is having increasing dif
ficulties recruiting in South Viet
nam and major defections from
its ranks may be in the offing,
William P. Bundy, Assistant Sec
retary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs said here yes
terday afternoon.
Bundy spoke at Cubberley Au
ditorium as part of the two-day
Foreign Service Workshop spon
sored by the Institute for Inter
national Relations. The work
shop will end tomorrow with
two talks at Tresidder Union by
Ambassador George V. Allen,
director of the Foreign Service
Institute in Washington, D.C.
Allen will speak informally
about the Foreign Service as
a career at 4:15 p.m. His main
address, "American Diplomacy
Today," will be at 7:30 p.m.
Front For Hanoi
"As an organization it (the
NLF) is under Hanoi's thumb,"

Bundy asserted. "This has been
proven conclusively by captured
documents."
However, many individuals in
it — and perhaps at substantial
levels — are subjectively south
erners, he said.
And these individuals may be
prepared to say at some time
that they see more chance of
achieving something through po
litical means in the South, Bundy
said. "It is a question of the
position of individuals in the
Front."
Ho Unlike Tito
Asked if Ho Chi Minh might
become a "Tito-like leader" if
the U.S. pulled its forces out
now, Bundy said there was one
big difference between the lead
ers. While Tito has no territorial
ambitions, Ho Chi Minh' has am
bitions for Laos and Cambodia.
And he might work in parallel
with the Chinese Communists
to seek domination of Southeast
Asia — as long as his own ter
ritory was left alone," Bundy
added.
