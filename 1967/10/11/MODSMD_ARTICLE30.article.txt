# Survey Seeks Cultural Tastes
## 
### 
During this week members of
the Tresidder Union social divis
ion are passing out question
naires which will give an indi
cation of the cultural preferences
of the student body.
"I think it will be fairly help
ful for us to find out where the
interests of the Stanford com
munity lie," commented John
Kaufman, chairman of the social
division. These interests will be
taken into consideration when
planning the Tresidder Enter
tainment Casuals.
These performances are musi
cally oriented and recently have
dealt mostly with jazz, folk, and
blues, according to Kaufman.
The survey, however, is asking
for a broader range of interests
which may result in a variety of
entertainment. Kaufman urges
all students who have taken a
survey sheet to return it to a
TMU social division member or
to the information desk on the
second floor of TMU.
