# Candidates Primed For 'Lollipop' Election
## 
### ROBIN KNIGHT 
San Mateo's lollipop election
campaign got under way formal
ly last week when candidates
took out nomination papers for
congress. To date there are 13
candidates; six Republican, six
Democrat, and one Independent.
The special election for the 11th
Congressional District was
caused by the death in June of
Republican J. Arthur Younger.
Heading the list of contestants
is Mrs. Charles Black. For ob
vious reasons Mrs. Black prefers
to campaign as Shirley Temple
Black. Running as a "concerned
housewife and mother," Mrs.
Black embodies the great im
ponderable: is California to be
represented by another product
of the celluloid dreamland that
made Mickey Mouse and the
Bubble Bath?
Are the voters in San Mateo
as concerned as Mrs. Black
about "the moral decline" of the
U.S.A.? Do they wish to "re
dedicate themselves to the
thoughts that made this coun

try great?" Do they feel, as one
critic has contended, that "Mrs.
Black's view of the Negroes was
apparently fixed when tap-danc
ing at the knees of 'Bojangles'
Robinson?"
In short, how seriously are
the voters of San Mateo taking
this election?
Shirley Ahead
At this stage in the race
polling takes place on Nov. 14th
—Mrs. Black is the one all the
others have to worry about.
Sheriff Earl B. Whitmore, a Re
publican like Mrs. Black, has
headed one local opinion poll,
but that was some weeks ago.
Mrs. Black's most serious rivals
are probably Pete McCloskey. a
Republican attorney, and Ed
ward Keating, former publisher
of Ramparts magazine and a
Democrat.
Under the special election
rules, if no candidate wins an
overall majority on the first bal
lot, a runoff between the two
top finishers will be scheduled
for Dec. 12th.
The basic issue at stake in the
election is Vietnam. All the can
didates agree on that. Other im
portant issues appear to be ra
cial integration, narcotics, in
creased Federal spending in San
Mateo County, and the conser
vation of local landmarks.
Two Doves
On Vietnam, Keating and Mc-
Closkey are standing on a
straight peace ticket. For many
years Keating has publicly main
tained that the war should be
stopped. McCloskey, who won
the Silver Star and Navy Cross
in the Korean War, is a recent
convert to the Dove's nest. Ac
cording to Keating, this change
will "confuse a public that is
cynical about political candi
dates who suddenly switch posi
tions on the key issue of the
campaign."
Mrs. Black and Sheriff Whit
more adopt the opposite, 'Rea
gan line.' Mrs. Black advocates

the mining of Haiphong harbor,
cutting down the advisory
powers of Defense Secretary
McNamara and President John
son's increased reliance on his
Chiefs of Staff for advice —and
we all know what that means.
She expects these oppressive
policies to bring the war to a
quick, victorious conclusion. Her
knowledge of the Vietnam situa
tion is based on "newspapers,
U.S. News and World Report"
and various briefings "with
maps, pointers and the whole
business."
Stop Aid
Sheriff Whitmore throws in a
red herring by stating th*t "We
must stop squandering our tax
dollars on aid to countries that
are trading with North Viet
nam" (namely Great Britain,
U.S.A.'s most constant ally in
the Vietnam war).
Of the other candidates who

have declared their position on
Vietnam, Will Slocum, Gregory
Simms and Daniel Monaco are
all opposed to the continuation
of the war. Slocum, 4 ft. 10 in.
and an ex-jockey, is campaign
ing with the slogan, "Send a lit
tle man to Congress." His 18
year old son "will not be draft
ed." and Slocum states that the
Selective Service Act should be
investigated by the House on
Un-American Activities Commit
tee.
Simms, a school-teacher for
merly attached to Stanford's Re
ligious Studies Department, has
been having trouble getting his
campaign off the ground. A bal
loon trip (hot air) from Laurel
wood to East Palo Alto, was ex
pected to overcome this prob
lem.
On The Spot
Monaco is one of two candi
dates who have recently visited

Vietnam; William Draper, a
young Republican attorney, is
the other. A lawyer and veteran
Democratic party leader, Mon
aco told a press conference re
cently that the bombing of
North Vietnam should be ended
immediately.
Concerning racial integration,
Mrs. Black "thinks she knows
how the citizens who are rioting
feel," according to Monaco. De
spite her background as a white
millionairess before the age of
ten, Mrs. Black is obviously con
fident that her theories about
social unrest will find favor
among the predominantly mid
dle-class voters of the 11th Dis
trict.
Riots Or Tantrums?
Her ideas are based on a com
parison "to that of a child who
has a tantrum. You give the
child some candy to stop it, and
the tantrum will stop. But then
the child, seeing he got away
with it, determines to have
another." (Dr. Martin Luther
King and Stokely Carmichael
please note.) In any case Mrs.

Black would "prefer to read
about our heroes, like the astro
nauts," Monaco said.
Edward Keating, running for
Congress for the second time,
links his peace stand to a plea
for the billions being "poured in
to Vietnam to be spent to better j
advantage in solving this coun
try's and San Mateo's problems."
He has said that the outbreak of
violence at Menlo-Atherton High j
School brought comfortable
white surburbanites "eyeball to
eyeball with the realities in this
country."
Reapportl onme nt
Reapportionment of Califor
nia's 38 congressional districts,
ordered by the State Supreme
Court last Friday, has introduced
an air of confusion into an al
ready uncertain contest.
The high court order is due to
be implemented by Dec. 7th. It
could well affect Southern San
Mateo, which might be incorpor
ated into the 10th District. The
homes of Mrs. Black, Draper,
Keating and McCloskey all fall
within the named areas.
