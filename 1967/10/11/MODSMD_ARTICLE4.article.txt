# Associate Provost Named; Duties Include Civil Rights
## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling
yesterday named a new associ
ate provost whose job will in
clude matters affecting the em
ployment of minority group
members here and related civil
rights matters.
Dr. Robert M. Rosenzweig,
who is presently on the East
Coast, will continue as director
of Stanford's Center for Re
search in International Studies.
He has served as an associate
dean of the graduate division
and lecturer in the depart
ment of political science since
coming to Stanford in 1962.
Vice-Provost E. Howard
Brooks denied any relation be
tween the appointment and a
particular event or racial situa

tion on campus. He also denied
that pressure from minority
group organizations, such as the
Black Student Union, had influ
enced the appointment.
"Civil rights will be only one
facet of Dr. Rosenzweig's job,"
said Brooks. "He has been here
for six years and was due for a
promotion."
Rosenzweig's office quoted a
letter from Provost Richard Ly
man describing the appointment
as concerning "disadvantaged
minorities as they affect and are
affected by the University." The
letter also emphasized the great
er involvement between the
provost's office and the Inter
national Studies Center which
will result from the appoint
ment.
Raymond Bachetti, Assistant

Provost to Dr. Lyman, described
the new provost as "a natural"
for the job. "It's taken a long
time to find some one to admin
istratively cope with the respon
sibility of coordinating univer
sity-wide efforts in the field of
civil rights," he said.
The appointment was not
prompted by any particular
problem, emphasized Bacchetti.
"Stanford's 'problem" is one
which it shares with American
society as a whole. The appoint
ment will facilitate the Univer
sity's moving to participate in a
remedy."
Rosenzweig, who now lives at
1462 Dana Street, Palo Alto, is
a native of Detroit. He earned
his bachelor's and master's de
grees at the University of Mich
igan and his doctorate in politi

cal science at Yale. He has
taught at Amherst College and
served as a Congressional Fel
low under the auspices of the
American Political Science As
sociation. He is also a former
special assistant to the U.S.
Commissioner of Education.
Also announced was the ap
pointment of Alan Grundmann
as assistant to the provost re
placing James P. Thurber Jr.,
who resigned to enter the For
eign Service.
Grundmann has served as ad
ministrative assistant in the
Physics Department since com
ing to Stanford in 1960. He has
served as director of a volun
teer Stanford program which
encouraged Mexican American
high school students to seek
careers in science.
