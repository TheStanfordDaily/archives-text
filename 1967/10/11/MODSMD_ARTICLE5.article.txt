# Napier Joins Dis-Jointers
## 
### 
Dis-Joint, formerly Mem
What?, formerly nothing at
all, is alive and well in Tresid
der, where it has been throb
bing for over a week.
To celebrate the reincarna
tion of Stanford's first and
only coffee house, the Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
returns tonight to the Dis
joints piano bar, his pro
gramme a closely guarded
secret.
The Lost Cause Jug Band
will play tomorrow night. A
dance, "Island in a Sea of
Barbarians," will be held Fri
day in front of Memorial
Church. Like last week's
dance, admission and refresh
ments are free, but contribu
tions will be accepted to fi
nance the weekly dance pro
gram.
On October 18 Dis-Joint
will present a full nioon cham
ber music concert in front of
Memorial Church.
Dis-Joint Director Greg
Yahna emphasizes the centri
fugal spirit of the place and
says, "We'll put on anything
the people want to put on."
