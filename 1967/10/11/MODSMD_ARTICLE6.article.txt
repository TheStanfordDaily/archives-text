# In Hoover Tower
## Politics And Money Allied? 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN (Third of Four Parts) 
Do politics and money walk hand in hand with
the administration of the Hoover Institution?
In 1964 Glenn Campbell, Director of Hoover,
took a two month leave-of-absence to "run Barry
Goldwater's advisory task force."
The Allen-Bradley Co., which donates $50,000 a
year to the Institution, is quoted in the Wall
Street Journal: "One of our basic policies is to
support anti-communist and conservative organi
zations. The Institution falls right in with this
policy."
Allan H. Belmont was appointed executive as
sistant to the director of the Institution after 29
years with the FBI, where he was chief assistant
for investigations to J. Edgar Hoover.
A member of the Hoover Institution Advisory
Board, which oversees operations at Hoover but
has no decision-making power, donated a half
million dollars last year.
Lack of Objectivity
Many scholars claim this evidence indicates a
conservative, money-oriented core runs through
the Advisory Board and administration of Hoover
instilling a bias in the Institution unsuitable for
objective scholarship.
Glenn Campbell suggests such claims are "un
informed criticism." He adds, "Look at the bal
ance on our staff."
Such conflict of opinion arises partly from
differing interpretations of the role an administra

tion should play in a library and center for re
search and publication.
One Man Rule
Most scholars question whether one man or
group should control the administration of Hoover
Institution. They point out that such a situation
could lead to perpetuation of a consistent ideo
logy whether liberal or conservative, in staff
appointments and publishing practices.
From interviews with 13 key people at Hoover
and numerous talks with Stanford administrators
and professors, several facts emerge.
Glenn Campbell, and only Glenn Campbell,
runs the operations at Hoover. Various ties exist
with the University administration — (these will
be examined tomorrow), but past resolutions and
agreements leave Campbell with great autonomy.
Goldwater Association
His political philosophy is conservative, as in
dicated by his association with Goldwater. His
two top administrative aides, the Associate Di
rector Swarakowski, and the Executive Assistant
to the Director, Belmont, concur with that gen
eral philosophy.
Sworakowski is a Polish refugee who be
came a naturalized citizen of the United States.
He has been with the Institution for 21 years.
During a tour of the library he described his con
tempt for communism and those who support
it. He considers it a form of support not to speak
