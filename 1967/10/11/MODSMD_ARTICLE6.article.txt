# In Hoover Tower
## Politics And Money Allied? 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN (Third of Four Parts) 
Do politics and money walk hand in hand with
the administration of the Hoover Institution?
In 1964 Glenn Campbell, Director of Hoover,
took a two month leave-of-absence to "run Barry
Goldwater's advisory task force."
The Allen-Bradley Co., which donates $50,000 a
year to the Institution, is quoted in the Wall
Street Journal: "One of our basic policies is to
support anti-communist and conservative organi
zations. The Institution falls right in with this
policy."
Allan H. Belmont was appointed executive as
sistant to the director of the Institution after 29
years with the FBI, where he was chief assistant
for investigations to J. Edgar Hoover.
A member of the Hoover Institution Advisory
Board, which oversees operations at Hoover but
has no decision-making power, donated a half
million dollars last year.
Lack of Objectivity
Many scholars claim this evidence indicates a
conservative, money-oriented core runs through
the Advisory Board and administration of Hoover
instilling a bias in the Institution unsuitable for
objective scholarship.
Glenn Campbell suggests such claims are "un
informed criticism." He adds, "Look at the bal
ance on our staff."
Such conflict of opinion arises partly from
differing interpretations of the role an administra

tion should play in a library and center for re
search and publication.
One Man Rule
Most scholars question whether one man or
group should control the administration of Hoover
Institution. They point out that such a situation
could lead to perpetuation of a consistent ideo
logy whether liberal or conservative, in staff
appointments and publishing practices.
From interviews with 13 key people at Hoover
and numerous talks with Stanford administrators
and professors, several facts emerge.
Glenn Campbell, and only Glenn Campbell,
runs the operations at Hoover. Various ties exist
with the University administration — (these will
be examined tomorrow), but past resolutions and
agreements leave Campbell with great autonomy.
Goldwater Association
His political philosophy is conservative, as in
dicated by his association with Goldwater. His
two top administrative aides, the Associate Di
rector Swarakowski, and the Executive Assistant
to the Director, Belmont, concur with that gen
eral philosophy.
Sworakowski is a Polish refugee who be
came a naturalized citizen of the United States.
He has been with the Institution for 21 years.
During a tour of the library he described his con
tempt for communism and those who support
it. He considers it a form of support not to speak
r»ut aoainst rnmmnnism
He added, when asked about
dealings with the CIA, "I am an
American and I must answer
any questions my country asks.
If the CIA comes to me asking
about people I know around the
world, I will answer."
Bias Eliminator
Belmont came to Hoover in
1966 having retired from the
third ranking position in the FBI
for "personal and family rea
sons." He describes his position
at Hoover as "a trouble shooter
for the Director." He adds, "One
of my jobs is to eliminate bias
in the Institution."
In a recent interview Belmont
spoke about the FBI. "The FBI
is a fine organization. Its ideals
are admirable and the people
there are very fine. It has good
tight discipline, the type that
produces good results."
Belmont also talked about his
present relationship with the
FBI. "I have no associations.
People do come around once
in a while to ask about parts
of my testimony before the War
ren Commission. But the things
I learned at the FBI were for
the organization and not for
me. I can't divulge it unless, of

course, J. Edgar Hoover gives
me permission."
Belmont acts as chairman of
the Hoover committee for re
search and publications.
Fund-Raisers
These three men are the core
of the administration and as
such one of their major jobs is
fund raising. They get some help
on this job from the University
but more comes through their
own efforts. The Hoover Advi
sory Board is crucial to this task.
The majority of its members
represent huge money interests.
For example, the director of
Gulf Oil, chairman of the board
of IBM, the executive vice presi
dent of Union Carbide, to name
only a few.
Richard M. Schaife, vice presi
dent and governor of Mellon and
Sons, is a member of the family
that gave the Institution $500,-
000 this year.
Million Dollar Budget
The Board, in fact, does such
a successful job of fund raising
that the Institution took in more
this year than it will spend. Ac
cording to the budget for 1966-67,
the Institution will spend $1,128,-
000. It has raised over $1.6 mil
lion and will receive another
$297,000 from University general
funds.
The discrepancy arises because
a large chunk of the money
Hoover raises is earmarked for
its endowment fund and does not
go toward any specfic budget ex
penditures.
The breakdown of the Hoover
budget this year is: administra

tion, $87,300; library, $580,000;
research and publications, $406,-
000; and the Herbert Hoover
archives, $55,000.
Trustees Lead Drive
Seeing the need for a stable
source of income, Campbell in
augrated a drive in 1964 to in
crease the Hoover endowment by
$5 million. This drive is being
directed by two members of the
Advisory Board, David Packard,
chairman uf the board of Hew
lett-Packard Co. and Thomas P.
Pike, chairman of the board of
the Pike Co. of America. Both are
Stanford trustees.
The growth of endowment,
fund raising, and budget, gener
ates questions crucial to the fu
ture of the Hoover Institution.
In 1959-60 the total Hoover bud
get was $389,000. Of that, 38 per
cent came from University gen
eral funds. Today, 23 per cent
comes from the University.
Hoover is thus becoming more
financially independent. It
already has more administrative
independence than many Stan
ford faculty members and ad
ministrators think justifiable.
These facts inspire criticism
that Hoover will increasingly
move away from the domain of
the University, carrying with it
its peculiar approach to scholar
ship.
Such a possibility depends to a
great extent on the relationship,
both official and understood, be
tween the University and the In
stitution. This relationship will
be examined tomorrow in the
final article of this series.

Pike, chairman of the board of
the Pike Co. of America. Both are
Stanford trustees.
The growth of endowment,
fund raising, and budget, gener
ates questions crucial to the fu
ture of the Hoover Institution.
In 1959-60 the total Hoover bud
get was $389,000. Of that, 38 per
cent came from University gen
eral funds. Today, 23 per cent
comes from the University.
Hoover is thus becoming more
financially independent. It
already has more administrative
independence than many Stan
ford faculty members and ad
ministrators think justifiable.
These facts inspire criticism
that Hoover will increasingly
move away from the domain of
the University, carrying with it
its peculiar approach to scholar
ship.
Such a possibility depends to a
great extent on the relationship,
both official and understood, be
tween the University and the In
stitution. This relationship will
be examined tomorrow in the
final article of this series.
Do politics and money walk hand in hand with
the administration of the Hoover Institution?
In 1964 Glenn Campbell, Director of Hoover,
took a two month leave-of-absence to "run Barry
Goldwater's advisory task force."
The Allen-Bradley Co., which donates $50,000 a
year to the Institution, is quoted in the Wall
Street Journal: "One of our basic policies is to
support anti-communist and conservative organi
zations. The Institution falls right in with this
policy."
Allan H. Belmont was appointed executive as
sistant to the director of the Institution after 29
years with the FBI, where he was chief assistant
for investigations to J. Edgar Hoover.
A member of the Hoover Institution Advisory
Board, which oversees operations at Hoover but
has no decision-making power, donated a half
million dollars last year.
Lack of Objectivity
Many scholars claim this evidence indicates a
conservative, money-oriented core runs through
the Advisory Board and administration of Hoover
instilling a bias in the Institution unsuitable for
objective scholarship.
Glenn Campbell suggests such claims are "un
informed criticism." He adds, "Look at the bal
ance on our staff."
Such conflict of opinion arises partly from
differing interpretations of the role an administra

tion should play in a library and center for re
search and publication.
One Man Rule
Most scholars question whether one man or
group should control the administration of Hoover
Institution. They point out that such a situation
could lead to perpetuation of a consistent ideo
logy whether liberal or conservative, in staff
appointments and publishing practices.
From interviews with 13 key people at Hoover
and numerous talks with Stanford administrators
and professors, several facts emerge.
Glenn Campbell, and only Glenn Campbell,
runs the operations at Hoover. Various ties exist
with the University administration — (these will
be examined tomorrow), but past resolutions and
agreements leave Campbell with great autonomy.
Goldwater Association
His political philosophy is conservative, as in
dicated by his association with Goldwater. His
two top administrative aides, the Associate Di
rector Swarakowski, and the Executive Assistant
to the Director, Belmont, concur with that gen
eral philosophy.
Sworakowski is a Polish refugee who be
came a naturalized citizen of the United States.
He has been with the Institution for 21 years.
During a tour of the library he described his con
tempt for communism and those who support
it. He considers it a form of support not to speak
r»ut aoainst rnmmnnism
He added, when asked about
dealings with the CIA, "I am an
American and I must answer
any questions my country asks.
If the CIA comes to me asking
about people I know around the
world, I will answer."
Bias Eliminator
Belmont came to Hoover in
1966 having retired from the
third ranking position in the FBI
for "personal and family rea
sons." He describes his position
at Hoover as "a trouble shooter
for the Director." He adds, "One
of my jobs is to eliminate bias
in the Institution."
In a recent interview Belmont
spoke about the FBI. "The FBI
is a fine organization. Its ideals
are admirable and the people
there are very fine. It has good
tight discipline, the type that
produces good results."
Belmont also talked about his
present relationship with the
FBI. "I have no associations.
People do come around once
in a while to ask about parts
of my testimony before the War
ren Commission. But the things
I learned at the FBI were for
the organization and not for
me. I can't divulge it unless, of

course, J. Edgar Hoover gives
me permission."
Belmont acts as chairman of
the Hoover committee for re
search and publications.
Fund-Raisers
These three men are the core
of the administration and as
such one of their major jobs is
fund raising. They get some help
on this job from the University
but more comes through their
own efforts. The Hoover Advi
sory Board is crucial to this task.
The majority of its members
represent huge money interests.
For example, the director of
Gulf Oil, chairman of the board
of IBM, the executive vice presi
dent of Union Carbide, to name
only a few.
Richard M. Schaife, vice presi
dent and governor of Mellon and
Sons, is a member of the family
that gave the Institution $500,-
000 this year.
Million Dollar Budget
The Board, in fact, does such
a successful job of fund raising
that the Institution took in more
this year than it will spend. Ac
cording to the budget for 1966-67,
the Institution will spend $1,128,-
000. It has raised over $1.6 mil
lion and will receive another
$297,000 from University general
funds.
The discrepancy arises because
a large chunk of the money
Hoover raises is earmarked for
its endowment fund and does not
go toward any specfic budget ex
penditures.
The breakdown of the Hoover
budget this year is: administra

tion, $87,300; library, $580,000;
research and publications, $406,-
000; and the Herbert Hoover
archives, $55,000.
Trustees Lead Drive
Seeing the need for a stable
source of income, Campbell in
augrated a drive in 1964 to in
crease the Hoover endowment by
$5 million. This drive is being
directed by two members of the
Advisory Board, David Packard,
chairman uf the board of Hew
lett-Packard Co. and Thomas P.
Pike, chairman of the board of
the Pike Co. of America. Both are
Stanford trustees.
The growth of endowment,
fund raising, and budget, gener

Bias Eliminator
Belmont came to Hoover in
1966 having retired from the
third ranking position in the FBI
for "personal and family rea
sons." He describes his position
at Hoover as "a trouble shooter
for the Director." He adds, "One
of my jobs is to eliminate bias
in the Institution."
In a recent interview Belmont
spoke about the FBI. "The FBI
is a fine organization. Its ideals
are admirable and the people
there are very fine. It has good
tight discipline, the type that
produces good results."
Belmont also talked about his
present relationship with the
FBI. "I have no associations.
People do come around once
in a while to ask about parts
of my testimony before the War
ren Commission. But the things
I learned at the FBI were for
the organization and not for
me. I can't divulge it unless, of

course, J. Edgar Hoover gives
me permission."
Belmont acts as chairman of
the Hoover committee for re
search and publications.
Fund-Raisers
These three men are the core
of the administration and as
such one of their major jobs is
fund raising. They get some help
on this job from the University
but more comes through their
own efforts. The Hoover Advi
sory Board is crucial to this task.
The majority of its members
represent huge money interests.
For example, the director of
Gulf Oil, chairman of the board
of IBM, the executive vice presi
dent of Union Carbide, to name
only a few.
Richard M. Schaife, vice presi
dent and governor of Mellon and
Sons, is a member of the family
that gave the Institution $500,-
000 this year.
Million Dollar Budget
The Board, in fact, does such
a successful job of fund raising
that the Institution took in more
this year than it will spend. Ac
cording to the budget for 1966-67,
the Institution will spend $1,128,-
000. It has raised over $1.6 mil
lion and will receive another
$297,000 from University general
funds.
The discrepancy arises because
a large chunk of the money
Hoover raises is earmarked for
its endowment fund and does not
go toward any specfic budget ex
penditures.
The breakdown of the Hoover
budget this year is: administra

tion, $87,300; library, $580,000;
research and publications, $406,-
000; and the Herbert Hoover
archives, $55,000.
Trustees Lead Drive
Seeing the need for a stable
source of income, Campbell in
augrated a drive in 1964 to in
crease the Hoover endowment by
$5 million. This drive is being
directed by two members of the
Advisory Board, David Packard,
chairman uf the board of Hew
lett-Packard Co. and Thomas P.
Pike, chairman of the board of
the Pike Co. of America. Both are
Stanford trustees.
The growth of endowment,
fund raising, and budget, gener
ates questions crucial to the fu
ture of the Hoover Institution.
In 1959-60 the total Hoover bud
get was $389,000. Of that, 38 per
cent came from University gen
eral funds. Today, 23 per cent
comes from the University.
Hoover is thus becoming more
financially independent. It
already has more administrative
independence than many Stan
ford faculty members and ad
ministrators think justifiable.
These facts inspire criticism
that Hoover will increasingly
move away from the domain of
the University, carrying with it
its peculiar approach to scholar
ship.
Such a possibility depends to a
great extent on the relationship,
both official and understood, be
tween the University and the In
stitution. This relationship will
be examined tomorrow in the
final article of this series.

Do politics and money walk hand in hand with
the administration of the Hoover Institution?
In 1964 Glenn Campbell, Director of Hoover,
took a two month leave-of-absence to "run Barry
Goldwater's advisory task force."
The Allen-Bradley Co., which donates $50,000 a
year to the Institution, is quoted in the Wall
Street Journal: "One of our basic policies is to
support anti-communist and conservative organi
zations. The Institution falls right in with this
policy."
Allan H. Belmont was appointed executive as
sistant to the director of the Institution after 29
years with the FBI, where he was chief assistant
for investigations to J. Edgar Hoover.
A member of the Hoover Institution Advisory
Board, which oversees operations at Hoover but
has no decision-making power, donated a half
million dollars last year.
Lack of Objectivity
Many scholars claim this evidence indicates a
conservative, money-oriented core runs through
the Advisory Board and administration of Hoover
instilling a bias in the Institution unsuitable for
objective scholarship.
Glenn Campbell suggests such claims are "un
informed criticism." He adds, "Look at the bal
ance on our staff."
Such conflict of opinion arises partly from
differing interpretations of the role an administra

tion should play in a library and center for re
search and publication.
One Man Rule
Most scholars question whether one man or
group should control the administration of Hoover
Institution. They point out that such a situation
could lead to perpetuation of a consistent ideo
logy whether liberal or conservative, in staff
appointments and publishing practices.
From interviews with 13 key people at Hoover
and numerous talks with Stanford administrators
and professors, several facts emerge.
Glenn Campbell, and only Glenn Campbell,
runs the operations at Hoover. Various ties exist
with the University administration — (these will
be examined tomorrow), but past resolutions and
agreements leave Campbell with great autonomy.
Goldwater Association
His political philosophy is conservative, as in
dicated by his association with Goldwater. His
two top administrative aides, the Associate Di
rector Swarakowski, and the Executive Assistant
to the Director, Belmont, concur with that gen
eral philosophy.
Sworakowski is a Polish refugee who be
came a naturalized citizen of the United States.
He has been with the Institution for 21 years.

Fund-Raisers
These three men are the core
of the administration and as
such one of their major jobs is
fund raising. They get some help
on this job from the University
but more comes through their
own efforts. The Hoover Advi
sory Board is crucial to this task.
The majority of its members
represent huge money interests.
For example, the director of
Gulf Oil, chairman of the board
of IBM, the executive vice presi
dent of Union Carbide, to name
only a few.
Richard M. Schaife, vice presi
dent and governor of Mellon and
Sons, is a member of the family
that gave the Institution $500,-
000 this year.
Million Dollar Budget
The Board, in fact, does such
a successful job of fund raising
that the Institution took in more
this year than it will spend. Ac
cording to the budget for 1966-67,
the Institution will spend $1,128,-
000. It has raised over $1.6 mil
lion and will receive another
$297,000 from University general
funds.
The discrepancy arises because
a large chunk of the money
Hoover raises is earmarked for
its endowment fund and does not
go toward any specfic budget ex
penditures.
The breakdown of the Hoover
budget this year is: administra

tion, $87,300; library, $580,000;
research and publications, $406,-
000; and the Herbert Hoover
archives, $55,000.
Trustees Lead Drive
Seeing the need for a stable
source of income, Campbell in
augrated a drive in 1964 to in
crease the Hoover endowment by
$5 million. This drive is being
directed by two members of the
Advisory Board, David Packard,
chairman uf the board of Hew
lett-Packard Co. and Thomas P.
Pike, chairman of the board of
the Pike Co. of America. Both are
Stanford trustees.
The growth of endowment,
fund raising, and budget, gener
ates questions crucial to the fu
ture of the Hoover Institution.
In 1959-60 the total Hoover bud
get was $389,000. Of that, 38 per
cent came from University gen
eral funds. Today, 23 per cent
comes from the University.
Hoover is thus becoming more
financially independent. It
already has more administrative
independence than many Stan
ford faculty members and ad
ministrators think justifiable.
These facts inspire criticism
that Hoover will increasingly
move away from the domain of
the University, carrying with it
its peculiar approach to scholar
ship.
Such a possibility depends to a
great extent on the relationship,
both official and understood, be
tween the University and the In
stitution. This relationship will
be examined tomorrow in the
final article of this series.
Do politics and money walk hand in hand with
the administration of the Hoover Institution?
In 1964 Glenn Campbell, Director of Hoover,
took a two month leave-of-absence to "run Barry
Goldwater's advisory task force."
The Allen-Bradley Co., which donates $50,000 a
year to the Institution, is quoted in the Wall
Street Journal: "One of our basic policies is to
support anti-communist and conservative organi
zations. The Institution falls right in with this
policy."
Allan H. Belmont was appointed executive as
sistant to the director of the Institution after 29
years with the FBI, where he was chief assistant
for investigations to J. Edgar Hoover.
A member of the Hoover Institution Advisory
Board, which oversees operations at Hoover but
has no decision-making power, donated a half
million dollars last year.
Lack of Objectivity
Many scholars claim this evidence indicates a
conservative, money-oriented core runs through
the Advisory Board and administration of Hoover
instilling a bias in the Institution unsuitable for
objective scholarship.
Glenn Campbell suggests such claims are "un
informed criticism." He adds, "Look at the bal
ance on our staff."
Such conflict of opinion arises partly from
differing interpretations of the role an administra

tion should play in a library and center for re
search and publication.
One Man Rule
Most scholars question whether one man or
group should control the administration of Hoover
Institution. They point out that such a situation
could lead to perpetuation of a consistent ideo
logy whether liberal or conservative, in staff
appointments and publishing practices.
From interviews with 13 key people at Hoover
and numerous talks with Stanford administrators
and professors, several facts emerge.
Glenn Campbell, and only Glenn Campbell,
runs the operations at Hoover. Various ties exist
with the University administration — (these will
be examined tomorrow), but past resolutions and
agreements leave Campbell with great autonomy.
Goldwater Association
His political philosophy is conservative, as in
dicated by his association with Goldwater. His
two top administrative aides, the Associate Di
rector Swarakowski, and the Executive Assistant
to the Director, Belmont, concur with that gen
eral philosophy.
Sworakowski is a Polish refugee who be
came a naturalized citizen of the United States.
He has been with the Institution for 21 years.
During a tour of the library he described his con
tempt for communism and those who support
it. He considers it a form of support not to speak
r»ut aoainst rnmmnnism
He added, when asked about
dealings with the CIA, "I am an
American and I must answer
any questions my country asks.
If the CIA comes to me asking
about people I know around the
world, I will answer."
Bias Eliminator
Belmont came to Hoover in
1966 having retired from the
third ranking position in the FBI
for "personal and family rea
sons." He describes his position
at Hoover as "a trouble shooter
for the Director." He adds, "One
of my jobs is to eliminate bias
in the Institution."
In a recent interview Belmont
spoke about the FBI. "The FBI
is a fine organization. Its ideals
are admirable and the people
there are very fine. It has good
tight discipline, the type that
produces good results."
Belmont also talked about his
present relationship with the
FBI. "I have no associations.
People do come around once
in a while to ask about parts
of my testimony before the War
ren Commission. But the things
I learned at the FBI were for
the organization and not for
me. I can't divulge it unless, of

course, J. Edgar Hoover gives
me permission."
Belmont acts as chairman of
the Hoover committee for re
search and publications.
