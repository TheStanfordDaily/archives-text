# Conference Continues To Examine Communism
## Nutter: Slackened Economy 
### 
"Despite unbending efforts to
outpace the record of the past,
the growth of (Russian) indus
try, agriculture and transporta
tion has been slower in the half
century of Soviet rule than in
the last half-century of tsar
dom," a University of Virginia
economist said yesterday here.
This is not to deny, added Prof.
G. Warren Nutter, that "the com
munist regime has raised a
backward, rural, uneducated
country to a position of emi
nence as an industrialized, ur
banized and scientific power to
be reckoned with in world af
fairs."
But before these forward steps
came backward ones, Nutter
notes. The substantial economic
progress visible in pre-1917 Rus
sia was "thrown in reverse" by
Lenin and his conspirators as
they "destroyed money, markets
and mobility, replacing them

J
with rations, requisitions and
regimentation."
Myth Lives On
The "myth" that these rigid
controls were necessitated by
the exigencies of world war and
civil strife from 1917 to 1921 is
a party-line fabrication which
"many Western historians con
tinue to echo," he said.
In remarks yesterday after
noon to the campus conference
on "Fifty Years of Communism
in Russia" sponsored by the
Hoover Institution, Prof. Nutter
pointed out that:
"The average (Soviet) rate
of growth — around 3 per cent
a year — matches the long-run
performance of such countries
as the U.S., if no account is
taken of the accompanying
trend in leisure and living con-

in the annals of advancing eco
nomies . . .
"Of course, in its best years
the rate of economic growth in
the Soviet Union has exceeded
the long-run average at times by
a wide margin, and it exceeds
that average today. Hence the
long-run rate is gradually be
ing pulled upward. At the same
time, the short-run rate is draft
ing steadily downward . . .
Power Is The Key
"It is important to keep in
mind that Soviet economic
growth has been the product of
a system dedicated to enhance
ment of power, in effect the
power of the ruling elite . . .
"The basic objective has been
to grow in military and political
strength as quickly as possible
while generating a rapid mea
sured rate of economic growth,
/for its propaganda value as
much as anything else."

Research on "Growth of Indus

"Despite unbending efforts to
outpace the record of the past,
the growth of (Russian) indus
try, agriculture and transporta
tion has been slower in the half
century of Soviet rule than in
the last half-century of tsar
dom," a University of Virginia
economist said yesterday here.
This is not to deny, added Prof.
G. Warren Nutter, that "the com
munist regime has raised a
backward, rural, uneducated
country to a position of emi
nence as an industrialized, ur
banized and scientific power to
be reckoned with in world af
fairs."
But before these forward steps
came backward ones, Nutter
notes. The substantial economic
progress visible in pre-1917 Rus
sia was "thrown in reverse" by
Lenin and his conspirators as
they "destroyed money, markets
and mobility, replacing them

J
with rations, requisitions and
regimentation."
Myth Lives On
The "myth" that these rigid
controls were necessitated by
the exigencies of world war and
civil strife from 1917 to 1921 is
a party-line fabrication which
"many Western historians con
tinue to echo," he said.
In remarks yesterday after
noon to the campus conference
on "Fifty Years of Communism
in Russia" sponsored by the
Hoover Institution, Prof. Nutter
pointed out that:
"The average (Soviet) rate
of growth — around 3 per cent
a year — matches the long-run
performance of such countries
as the U.S., if no account is
taken of the accompanying
trend in leisure and living con-
Hitmnc Knf \ nv/>nnf mnol
in the annals of advancing eco
nomies . . .
"Of course, in its best years
the rate of economic growth in
the Soviet Union has exceeded
the long-run average at times by
a wide margin, and it exceeds
that average today. Hence the
long-run rate is gradually be
ing pulled upward. At the same
time, the short-run rate is draft
ing steadily downward . . .
Power Is The Key
"It is important to keep in
mind that Soviet economic
growth has been the product of
a system dedicated to enhance
ment of power, in effect the
power of the ruling elite . . .
"The basic objective has been
to grow in military and political
strength as quickly as possible
while generating a rapid mea
sured rate of economic growth,
/for its propaganda value as
much as anything else."
