Alexander Kerensky, former
head of the Provisional govern
ment in Russia and a former
member of the staff of the
Hoover Institution, returned to
Stanford yesterday to deliver an
address to the Institution's sym
posium on Fifty Years of Com
munism in Russia.
The violence which overthrew
his government "was not a revo
lution, but a coup d'etat," accord
ing to the former Prime Min
ister. The purpose of this coup
d'etat was merely to place a
willful group of men at the head
of the Russian state, in his opi
nion.
Mr. Kerensky was adamant
in asserting that this "totalitar
ian terrorist regime" was the
precursor of the dictatorship
which spread through Europe in

the 1930'5. "Regimes like that
in Russia governed Europe from
the Urals to Madrid, with the ex
ception of England and Scandi
navia by 1938."
The Prime Minister continued
by contrasting the regime of
the Provisional government with
the Soviet Regime in that his
was a government of and for
all the people while that of the
Soviets was for the benefit of a
few leaders.
This dictatorship has contin
ued to the present day with no
participation from the people, he
stated. Above all, he emphasized,
it is certainly not a communist
state. Rather it is "a very ele
mentary" form of state capital
ism, under which the majority
of the people live "in misery,"

Kerensky, who is 86, was born
in Russian Central Asia and
received his law degree in St.
Petersburg. He reached promi
nence through his defenses of
Czarist political prisoners. He
actively participated in the 1905
revolution and the Duma (Rus
sian Parliament) which was its
result. He held several minister
level posts in the Russian cabi
nets before the October Revolu
tion, and was named Prime Min
ister of the Provisional govern
ment in June of 1917, and re
mained in that post until the
October Revolution of 1917.
Kerensky felt that his succes
sor Lenin was a man "Mache
vallian in his policies," whose
main interest was spreading
communism to the capitalist
countries. Lenin's mistake was
in Kerensky's opinion to try
and apply Marxist theory to an
agricultural nation."
Kerensky said that his pers
onal mission in life "is to see
that Westerners will understand
the realities of Russia." He sees
as these realities the fact the
government in Russia now is
not a communist state but rath
er a brutal dictatorship.
