Citing the withering of state
atheism and the resurgence of
public polls as valid indicators of
opinion, University of Toronto
sociologist Lewis Feuer yester
day said the Soviet Union is now
beset by a "new individualistic
spirit—the return of the re
pressed individual."
Feuer, speaking on "The Socio
psychological Transformation of
Soviet Society" as part of the
Hoover Institution's conference
on "Fifty Years of Communism
in Russia," traced the sociologi
cal and psychological develop
ment of Russia since the Revolu
tion.
He explained how the current
conditions, in which Russian in
dividualism is re-e merging
amidst a still-dominant philoso
phy of "socialistic pessimism"
grew out of a progression of
"ego-ideal" systems.

According to Feuer the Octo
ber 1917 revolution had as a goal
the development of "a wonder
ful new human being," as Trot
sky put it" . . . the average
human type will rise to the
heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe,
a Marx."
Feuer, however, claimed these
were only "the dreams." The
realities, he said, were that Rus
sia began to enter the "anti
masochist period," an era when
the Soviet regime "carried
through a psychological revolu
tion against the traditional maso
chist psyche of the Russian peo
ple.' '
"The anti-masochist vector in
the Soviet psychology brought a
liberation of energies and crea
tivity; something like a Soviet
Renaissance seemed to be in the
making," said Feuer.
