Citing the withering of state
atheism and the resurgence of
public polls as valid indicators of
opinion, University of Toronto
sociologist Lewis Feuer yester
day said the Soviet Union is now
beset by a "new individualistic
spirit—the return of the re
pressed individual."
Feuer, speaking on "The Socio
psychological Transformation of
Soviet Society" as part of the
Hoover Institution's conference
on "Fifty Years of Communism
in Russia," traced the sociologi
cal and psychological develop
ment of Russia since the Revolu
tion.
He explained how the current
conditions, in which Russian in
dividualism is re-e merging
amidst a still-dominant philoso
phy of "socialistic pessimism"
grew out of a progression of
"ego-ideal" systems.

According to Feuer the Octo
ber 1917 revolution had as a goal
the development of "a wonder
ful new human being," as Trot
sky put it" . . . the average
human type will rise to the
heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe,
a Marx."
Feuer, however, claimed these
were only "the dreams." The
realities, he said, were that Rus
sia began to enter the "anti
masochist period," an era when
the Soviet regime "carried
through a psychological revolu
tion against the traditional maso
chist psyche of the Russian peo
ple.' '
"The anti-masochist vector in
the Soviet psychology brought a
liberation of energies and crea
tivity; something like a Soviet
Renaissance seemed to be in the
making," said Feuer.

LEWIS FEUER
he said, was cut short in the
1930's when a second socio-psy
chological stage, the "Bolshevi
zation of the personality" ap
peared. This, he said, was a
period when the Russian ego
idea changed to the exaltation of
cruelty—it became sadistic.
"To have a Bolshevized person
ality was ... to absorb into one's
ego-ideal all the traits of histori
cal self-mutilation, self-sacrifice,
and historical sadism. It was to
be dedicated to the Party, to
make its will yours ... to write
in a style that was as de-person
alized as possible, to avoid sub
jectivism," said Feuer.
Feuer stressed that the sadistic
ego-ideal emphasized man's con
sciousness as the director of hu
man behavior and feared the un
conscious. This, he said ex
plained the Soviet's rejection of
Freud's ideas of the subconcious.
Struggle Between Selves
"The Bolshevized personality
evolved into a structure of de

fense-mechanisms against one's
inner self and the perception of
external reality," he explained.
Feuer said the struggle within
the individual between the "of
ficial self" and the "real self" was
in part responsible for the "mas
sive self-repression which made
possible the acquiescence of the
Soviet people to the large-scale
purges and liquidations of the
thirties."
With the end of the Stalinist
era in 1953 two deep blows had
been dealt Soviet personality
structure. First the Soviet in
telligentsia had received a psy
chological blow to the sense of
their sincerity. Second, he said,
"there came to pervade Soviet
society what we might . . . call
a 'Cain-Abel' complex."
"The new society, the new
elect of activists and Marxists,
the new working class, had
shown itself like Cain unable to
guard its brothers . . . Each Sov
iet person had to come to terms
with his share in the collective
guilt."

Feuer stressed that the sadistic
ego-ideal emphasized man's con
sciousness as the director of hu
man behavior and feared the un
conscious. This, he said ex
plained the Soviet's rejection of
Freud's ideas of the subconcious.
Struggle Between Selves
"The Bolshevized personality
evolved into a structure of de

fense-mechanisms against one's
inner self and the perception of
external reality," he explained.
Feuer said the struggle within
the individual between the "of
ficial self" and the "real self" was
in part responsible for the "mas
sive self-repression which made
possible the acquiescence of the
Soviet people to the large-scale
purges and liquidations of the
thirties."
With the end of the Stalinist
era in 1953 two deep blows had
been dealt Soviet personality
structure. First the Soviet in
telligentsia had received a psy
chological blow to the sense of
their sincerity. Second, he said,
"there came to pervade Soviet
society what we might . . . call
a 'Cain-Abel' complex."
"The new society, the new
elect of activists and Marxists,
the new working class, had
shown itself like Cain unable to
guard its brothers . . . Each Sov
iet person had to come to terms
with his share in the collective
guilt."

Citing the withering of state
atheism and the resurgence of
public polls as valid indicators of
opinion, University of Toronto
sociologist Lewis Feuer yester
day said the Soviet Union is now
beset by a "new individualistic
spirit—the return of the re
pressed individual."
Feuer, speaking on "The Socio
psychological Transformation of
Soviet Society" as part of the
Hoover Institution's conference
on "Fifty Years of Communism
in Russia," traced the sociologi
cal and psychological develop
ment of Russia since the Revolu
tion.
He explained how the current
conditions, in which Russian in
dividualism is re-e merging
amidst a still-dominant philoso
phy of "socialistic pessimism"
grew out of a progression of
"ego-ideal" systems.

According to Feuer the Octo
ber 1917 revolution had as a goal
the development of "a wonder
ful new human being," as Trot
sky put it" . . . the average
human type will rise to the
heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe,
a Marx."
Feuer, however, claimed these
were only "the dreams." The
realities, he said, were that Rus
sia began to enter the "anti
masochist period," an era when
the Soviet regime "carried
through a psychological revolu
tion against the traditional maso
chist psyche of the Russian peo
ple.' '
"The anti-masochist vector in
the Soviet psychology brought a
liberation of energies and crea
tivity; something like a Soviet
Renaissance seemed to be in the
making," said Feuer.
