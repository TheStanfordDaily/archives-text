# Dean Arbuckle Will Resign July 1
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Ernest C. Arbuckle will resign
July 1 as dean of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business for
the good of "both the school and
me," he announced yesterday to
business faculty, students and
alumni.
Today the 55-year-old Arbuckle
will be elected to the board of
directors of a San Francisco
business firm, and will become
an officer in the firm at the end
of this academic year.
"A school needs a change of
leadership periodically," Ar
buckle said yesterday."I feel
sincerely that a new face will
give the school a new thrust."
Arbuckle said also that he told
President Wallace Sterling when
he accepted the deanship in 1958
that "I thought I would use up
what I had to contribute in
about 10 years."
Arbuckle will also resign as
board chairman of the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) as soon
as his successor there is ap
pointed, and not later than July
1, 1968.
Sterling appointed yesterday
an eight-member selection com
mittee to search for Arbuckle's
successor as business school
dean. Sterling will be chairman.
George L. Bach, a business
school professor, will be vice
chairman.
Sterling announced at a meet
ing of business school faculty
yesterday that Samuel A. Pond,
associate dean of the school,
will serve as acting dean if Ar

buckle's successor is not appoint
ed by July 1.
Business school alumni and
students learned of Arbuckle's
plans to resign in letters mailed
yesterday.
Arbuckle will continue to be
closely associated with Stanford
after his retirement from the
business school. He will remain
a director of SRI and assist in
the business school fund raising
drive each year. "I might even
get inside some of our class
rooms more," he said. Arbuckle
will continue to live with his
family in the Stanford area.
Arbuckle, a Stanford trustee
from 1954-58, will resign some
of his seven corporation director
ships to avoid conflict with his
new business job, which will be
announced tomorrow.
Arbuckle served as an execu
tive of Standard Oil of Califor
nia, the Golden State Company,
and finally W. R. Grace & Co.
before his appointment as busi
ness school dean.
He is a long time friend of
Sterling, whom he met during
his student days at Stanford
when Sterling was in instructor
in history.
Surprise to Some
Arbuckle's plans to resign,
which came as a surprise to
many members of the business
faculty, brought forth both ex
pressions of regret, and high
praise for his accomplishments.
Sterling said "with my regret
is mingled great admiration and
gratitude for his manifestly

splendid leadership of the
school. .
Associate Dean Pond said "his
resignation will be a tremendous
loss to the University, although
I understand why he's doing it
. . . he has taken the school to
a position of preeminence in a
very short space of time."
Arbuckle is widely credited
with having improved Stanford's
business school at an even fast
er pace than Stanford in general
has gained in excellence. Since
he became dean in 1958, the fac
ulty has more than doubled and
the school's annual budget has
increased six-fold. A year ago
the school moved into a new,
$5.5 million building on Serra
street.
"We've worked 40 years for
this building," Arbuckle said
yesterday in his office there. He
graduated from Stanford in

1933 and received his master's
degree in business (MBA) here
in 1936.
Many New Faculty
Among Arbuckle's greatest
achievements have been hiring
new faculty and fund raising
from alumni and corporations.
While steadily increasing facul
ty salaries, he has persuaded
many business professors to
leave such schools as Harvard
and the Carnegie Institute of
Technology to join Stanford,
George L. Bach, the faculty
member who will lead the search
for Arbuckle's successor, was
hired by Arbuckle last year
from Carnegie Tech where he
was founding dean of the Grad
uate School of Industrial Ad
ministration.
Arbuckle reflected yesterday
that "we pretty well support
ourselves in the business school.

Our total expenditures run
about $3.8 million, and our tui
tion income is $1.2 million. All
the rest we raise ourselves."
But Arbuckle thinks less of
his success at fund raising than
the changes he has brought in
the teaching of business at Stan
ford. A long-range plan was pre
pared this year for changing the
MBA program, and Arbuckle
hopes it will "give the student
an opportunity for more inde
pendent research and study â€”
more learning on his own."
In moving on from his in
volvement with the business
school and SRI to a new career
in private business, Arbuckle
had this to say:
"I think I can go into a new
environment now with complete
ly new ideas, and with the same
energy to do the job that I had
in this one, ten years ago."
