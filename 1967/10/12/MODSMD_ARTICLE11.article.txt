## Better Try A New Choice Of Epithets 
### Mike Couzens 
"We are an island." said Mark
Mancall, "surrounded by a sea
of barbarians." There is candor
here, and truth. But it was a
poor choice of epithets.
Matthew Arnold found much
to praise in the barbarians who
shaped and ran his England.
There was not, he wrote, the
same aversion to them that exist
ed in the Latin countries which
partook less of their influence.
Barbarians brought wit!', them
"that staunch individualism, as
the modern phrase is, and that
passion for doing as one likes,
for the assertion of personal lib
erty."
Arnold lauded their chivalry,
their breeding, politeness and
other undoubted virtues which
one came to associate with the
aristocratic ruling class.
Sweetness And Light
They were, it is true, outward
virtues, like self-confidence. Gen
uine culture was to teach one to
seek sweetness and light, and
they suffered only in their insuf
ficiency of light.
But as an example to their
countrymen, they were greatly
to be admired. "And when I
go through the country, and see
this and that imposing seat of
theirs dotting the landscape,
'There,' I say to myself, 'is a
great fortified post of the bar
barians.' "
Prof. Mancall might better
have put it, "We are an island
of barbarians surrounded by a
sea of philistines."
Incapable Of Though*
Arnold was voluble about the
Philistines, too. "Philistia has
come to be thought of as the
true land of promise, and it is

anything but that: tho born lover
of ideas, the burn hater of com
monplace, must leel in this coun
try, that the sky over his head
is of brass and iron."
He pictured the philistine as
one who, by resorting to the let
ter, the precedent, the form for
justification, gradually blunted
and then eliminated his capacity
to think conceptually.
"They have thus become, in
a certain sense, of all people the
most inaccessible to ideas and
the most impatient of them; in
accessible to them, because of
their want of familiarity with
them; and impatient of them be
cause they have got on so well
without them, that they despise
those who, not having got on as
well as themselves, still make a
fuss over what they themselves
have done so well without."
Dv n't Condescend
It would seem finally that
Prof. Mancall might best have
said nothing. The philistine hat
red of men with ideas is not to
be countered by condescension.
Two more labels should make
the point clear. The first one is
provincialism, and its cosmopol
itan forms would seem to be its
most destructive, in New York
or in any residence with a quar
antining mystique.
"Community," being in vogue,
will not do for its converse. We
might choose instead Matthew
Arnold's old-fashioned "Civiliza
tion," which he defined as "the
humanization of man in society."
He asked of his barbarians
whether he could expect "that in
these charming gifts there
should perhaps be, for ideal per
fection, a shade more soul?"
