## Search For Truth 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In the last few days the lib
erals and conservatives have
once again made the Daily their
battleground. The liberals de
mand that the conservatives be
"objective"; the conservatives de
mand toleration of their view
point.
Fritz Schaefer is to be com
mended for„£ecommending that
opposing viewpoints be present
ed, and for keeping in mind
the search for truth. But he
overlooks the problem that mere
presentation of opposing view
points leads not to the search
for truth, but to war. In the two
years I have been at Stanford
confrontations between liberals
and conservatives have taken
place, but I have seen no at
tempt to clarify their disagree
ment, much less any attempt at
mediation.
Given that the fundamental
disagreement has been made
clear, how can the truth be
found? Stanford's answer seems
to be, by rhetorical skill and by
the amassing of facts which sup
port unquestioned dogmatism.
Is the search for truth really
the goal of the university? And
when can that search be found
at Stanford?

Editor, The Daily:
In your coverage of last
night's discussion led by Dave
Truong and me, your reporter
attributes to me a statement
exactly opposite to what I ac
tually said: "He [i.e., I] said few
er troops and less money could
have been used effectively
against the Chinese Communists
twenty years ago." The point I

was trying to make was that
twenty years ago the clouded
crystal ball persuaded some peo
ple that a few more dollars for
a couple of years to Chiang Kai
shek would have ended in the
defeat of Mao Tse-tung. Secre
tary of State George C. Mar
shall, with President Truman's
backing, saw clearly where this
first step would lead and refused
to take it. In the early 1960'5,
however, that first step was
taken, followed now by who
knows how many later steps.
In short, I was not saying that
if we had hit them then, we
wouldn't be threatened now. In
stead, I was saying that we have
now reversed the correct, though
difficult, decision we made then
to disengage from Asian civil
wars and the Asian mainland.

Fritz Schaefer is to be com
mended for„£ecommending that
opposing viewpoints be present
ed, and for keeping in mind
the search for truth. But he
overlooks the problem that mere
presentation of opposing view
points leads not to the search
for truth, but to war. In the two
years I have been at Stanford
confrontations between liberals
and conservatives have taken
place, but I have seen no at
tempt to clarify their disagree
ment, much less any attempt at
mediation.
Given that the fundamental
disagreement has been made
clear, how can the truth be
found? Stanford's answer seems
to be, by rhetorical skill and by
the amassing of facts which sup
port unquestioned dogmatism.
Is the search for truth really
the goal of the university? And
when can that search be found
at Stanford?

Editor, The Daily:
In your coverage of last
night's discussion led by Dave
Truong and me, your reporter
attributes to me a statement
exactly opposite to what I ac
tually said: "He [i.e., I] said few
er troops and less money could
have been used effectively
against the Chinese Communists
twenty years ago." The point I

was trying to make was that
twenty years ago the clouded
crystal ball persuaded some peo
ple that a few more dollars for
a couple of years to Chiang Kai
shek would have ended in the
defeat of Mao Tse-tung. Secre
tary of State George C. Mar
shall, with President Truman's
backing, saw clearly where this
first step would lead and refused
to take it. In the early 1960'5,
however, that first step was
taken, followed now by who
knows how many later steps.
In short, I was not saying that
if we had hit them then, we
wouldn't be threatened now. In
stead, I was saying that we have
now reversed the correct, though
difficult, decision we made then
to disengage from Asian civil
wars and the Asian mainland.
