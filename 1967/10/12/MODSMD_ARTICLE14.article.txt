## Computer Replaces Russian Teacher 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
As a unique attempt to speed
the learning process in the Rus
sian language, 30 first-year
students have substituted a
computer-taught session for the
regular classroom situation.
The program was begun, ac
cording to Professor Joseph
VanCampen, to further student
participation and provide an op
portunity for more individual at
ention. In a classroom, he em
phasized, a student may have, at
maximum, five minutes for in
dividual response.
The computer program, how
over, provides "a larger number
of opportunities to respond and
allows the student to take part
in the language-learning process
in a meaningful way."

The learning system was de
vised by VanCampen under a
$100,000 one-year grant from the
U.S. Office of Education and has
been initiated at Stanford under
the auspices of the Institute for
Mathematical Studies in the
Social Sciences and the Slavic
Division of the Department of
Modern European Languages.
Computer-Student Dialogue
The computer sessions cannot
really be called a "class", accord
ing to VanCampen, in that the
students in the room have no con
nection with one another. "They
participate in a dialogue with the
computer."
Their study room in Ventura is
equipped with six teletypwriter
terminals and sets of earphones.
The typewriter terminals, which
connect to a PDP-8 computer in
Pine Hall at the Stanford Labor
atory for Computer-Based In
struction, can print messages in
both the English and Russian
alphabets from a single type box.
The student, however, can only
type in Russian.
Two Chances
The questions presented by the
computer require either oral or
written responses. In the former
case, the answer is repeated for
the student to correct his pro
nunciation. In the latter instance,
the student is immediately made
aware of any mistake and given
a second chance. If he still does
not answer correctly, the answer
is automatically printed for him.
In this way, VanCampen feels,
"mistaken ideas are nipped in the
bud."
"On the basis of an early
check," he said, "I believe that
these students are making more
rapid progress than those who
are taking Russian I in the class
room program." This fast pro
gress is facilitated by the fact
that it is possible to have 150
typed responses per session,
much more than a student can
do in a classroom period.
The Personal Touch
Personal contact has not, how
ever, been completely eliminated,
for each student has a "proctor,"
someone who has taught or is
teaching Russian, to correct his
homework and answer any ques
tions the student may have.
VanCampen plans to use the
midterm and the final exams to
compare the progress of the com

puter section with that of the reg
ular sections. About 60-70 per
cent of the two exams will be the
same, he explained. If signifi
cant differences are discovered,
he hopes to expand the program.
So far, VanCampen is pleased

with the positive response of the
students in these classes. This is
shown, he stated, by the fact that
whereas many have dropped out
of the regular Russian classes,
no one has left the computer
group."

Computer-Student Dialogue
The computer sessions cannot
really be called a "class", accord
ing to VanCampen, in that the
students in the room have no con
nection with one another. "They
participate in a dialogue with the
computer."
Their study room in Ventura is
equipped with six teletypwriter
terminals and sets of earphones.
The typewriter terminals, which
connect to a PDP-8 computer in
Pine Hall at the Stanford Labor
atory for Computer-Based In
struction, can print messages in
both the English and Russian
alphabets from a single type box.
The student, however, can only
type in Russian.
Two Chances
The questions presented by the
computer require either oral or
written responses. In the former
case, the answer is repeated for
the student to correct his pro
nunciation. In the latter instance,
the student is immediately made
aware of any mistake and given
a second chance. If he still does
not answer correctly, the answer
is automatically printed for him.
In this way, VanCampen feels,
"mistaken ideas are nipped in the
bud."
"On the basis of an early
check," he said, "I believe that
these students are making more
rapid progress than those who
are taking Russian I in the class
room program." This fast pro
gress is facilitated by the fact
that it is possible to have 150
typed responses per session,
much more than a student can
do in a classroom period.
The Personal Touch
Personal contact has not, how
ever, been completely eliminated,
for each student has a "proctor,"
someone who has taught or is
teaching Russian, to correct his
homework and answer any ques
tions the student may have.
VanCampen plans to use the
midterm and the final exams to
compare the progress of the com

puter section with that of the reg
ular sections. About 60-70 per
cent of the two exams will be the
same, he explained. If signifi
cant differences are discovered,
he hopes to expand the program.
So far, VanCampen is pleased

with the positive response of the
students in these classes. This is
shown, he stated, by the fact that
whereas many have dropped out
of the regular Russian classes,
no one has left the computer
group."


STUDENTS LEARN RUSSIAN by computer as Professor Joseph
VanCampen and Mrs. Elise Belenky, research associate, watch
their progress.
As a unique attempt to speed
the learning process in the Rus
sian language, 30 first-year
students have substituted a
computer-taught session for the
regular classroom situation.
The program was begun, ac
cording to Professor Joseph
VanCampen, to further student
participation and provide an op
portunity for more individual at
ention. In a classroom, he em
phasized, a student may have, at
maximum, five minutes for in
dividual response.
The computer program, how
over, provides "a larger number
of opportunities to respond and
allows the student to take part
in the language-learning process
in a meaningful way."

The learning system was de
vised by VanCampen under a
$100,000 one-year grant from the
U.S. Office of Education and has
been initiated at Stanford under
the auspices of the Institute for
Mathematical Studies in the
Social Sciences and the Slavic
Division of the Department of
Modern European Languages.
