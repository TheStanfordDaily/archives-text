# Record Sign-Ups In IM Tennis
## IM Office Imposes Rematch 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
Enthusiasm in Stanford's in
tramural program continues
even stronger than ever this
autumn.
Touch football swings into its
second full week of action to
day with a seven-game schedule.
Meanwhile record sign ups for
tennis doubles, two-man volley
ball, and golf indicate those
sports should have successful
tournaments.
Big Game Today
Out on the intramural fields
this afternoon, two undefeated
teams will be battling on field
two.
The Alpha Sigs, behind the
strong arm of Norm Boone, meet
the Betas, whose 6-0 win over the
Delts last week was nullified,
forcing a rematch.
Betas Rematch
Two former lettermen, Bob
Conrad for the Betas, and Tim
Abena for the Delts, played in
last week's contest. However, as
earlier reported in the Daily, the

intramural office does not honor
"gentlemen's agreements."
Because of the rules spelled
out in the new handbook, both
teams violated intramural regu
lations and will have to play
the game all over again, prob
ably tomorrow afternoon.
Alpha Si£ Heroes
The Alpha Sigs crumped the
DU's last week, 13-0, as Boone
threw touchdown bombs to Mai
Taylor and Nick Farwell.
• The Alpha Sig defensive sec
ondary will meet a much stiffer
test today, though, assuming
the Betas can find someone to
take over quarterback for the
ineligible Conrad.
If Jayson Smith is capable of
filling that job, then the Betas
could have a potent oflensive at
tack to challenge the Alpha Sigs.

tack to challenge the Alpha Sigs.
Other IM Action
In other IM football action,

ATO (1-0) tangles with the

Psi.
Theta Chi and KA also see ac
tion today, somewhere in the
vicinity of field seven.

autumn.

Big Game Today
Out on the intramural fields
this afternoon, two undefeated
teams will be battling on field
two.
The Alpha Sigs, behind the
strong arm of Norm Boone, meet
the Betas, whose 6-0 win over the
Delts last week was nullified,
forcing a rematch.
Betas Rematch
Two former lettermen, Bob
Conrad for the Betas, and Tim
Abena for the Delts, played in
last week's contest. However, as
earlier reported in the Daily, the

intramural office does not honor
"gentlemen's agreements."
Because of the rules spelled
out in the new handbook, both
teams violated intramural regu
lations and will have to play
the game all over again, prob
ably tomorrow afternoon.
Alpha Si£ Heroes
The Alpha Sigs crumped the
DU's last week, 13-0, as Boone
threw touchdown bombs to Mai
Taylor and Nick Farwell.
• The Alpha Sig defensive sec
ondary will meet a much stiffer
test today, though, assuming
the Betas can find someone to
take over quarterback for the
ineligible Conrad.
If Jayson Smith is capable of
filling that job, then the Betas
could have a potent oflensive at
tack to challenge the Alpha Sigs.
