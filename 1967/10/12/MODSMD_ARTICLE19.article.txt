# Card Poloists Face Owls
## 
### 
Stanford water poloists go af
ter their third win of the sea
son as the Indians host Foothill
College today at 3:30 p.m. in the
Encina Pool.
Last weekend, Stanford knock
ed ofi national title contender
Cal by a decisive 8-4 count. The
Cards used a balanced offense
sparked by Pan Am star Gary
Sheerer, John Parker, and Mark
Parmely.
Foothill appears to lack some
of the punch the Owls have
had in previous years, but no
body pretends to take Foothill
lightly. The Owsl' well-oiled of
fensive coordination and aggre
sive defense have left many "su
perior" opponents on the bottom
of the scoreboard.
