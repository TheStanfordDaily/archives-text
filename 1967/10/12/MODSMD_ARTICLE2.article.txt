# Lower Liquor Age Commission Says
## 
### 
Lowering the legal age to 18
for purchase and public con
sumption of alcohol is one of
the many suggestions published
today in a report by the Coop
erative Commission on the Study
of Alcoholism. Dr. R. Nevitt San
ford, director of the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems
at Stanford, served as scientific
director of the Commission and
Benjamin D. Paul, professor of
anthropology, was also a mem
ber of it.
The study, begun in 1961, is
the first comprehensive, nation
al, government-financed study of
alcohol problems. The Commis
sion was established and financ
ed by a grant from the National
Institute of Mental Health of the
Federal Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
The report covers the prob
lems of alcoholism, drunkenness,
drinking and driving, regulation
of the liquor industry, alcoholic
beverage advertising, and alco
hol education. Advance copies of
the report, "Alcohol Problems,
A Report to the Nation," have
been sent to key legislative offi
cials.
Create New Climate
The Commission, an indepen
dent group of 17 national ex
perts, presents the first eflort
since before Prohibition to create
a new American climate for dis
cussion and action on alcohol
problems. It attempts to bring
public drinking policy closer to
contemporary practices and atti
tudes about drinking.
In the area of care and treat
ment of problem drinkers, the
Commission states that "Public
drunkenness should be approach
ed as a medical-social rather
than as a legal-criminal prob
lem" and it feels that the tradi
tional handling of the problem
is "inhuman as well as ineffec
tive." The Commission also feels
that Federal aid programs for
states and communities should
pay attention to problem drink
ers.

Since the Commission believes
an alteration of social attitudes
and policies is required before
the problem can be adequately
handled, it recommends that "a
national 'organization should be
established to bring about
changes in American drinking
patterns." This organization, the
Commission asserts, should have
a quasi-governmental status,
with some members appointed
by the President and with an an
nual federal appropriation. The
members would be leaders in
several fields: "government,
sports, entertainment, industries,
labor, religion, communications,
public relations, medicine, wel
fare, and education."

Create New Climate
The Commission, an indepen
dent group of 17 national ex
perts, presents the first eflort
since before Prohibition to create
a new American climate for dis
cussion and action on alcohol
problems. It attempts to bring
public drinking policy closer to
contemporary practices and atti
tudes about drinking.
In the area of care and treat
ment of problem drinkers, the
Commission states that "Public
drunkenness should be approach
ed as a medical-social rather
than as a legal-criminal prob
lem" and it feels that the tradi
tional handling of the problem
is "inhuman as well as ineffec
tive." The Commission also feels
that Federal aid programs for
states and communities should
pay attention to problem drink
ers.

Since the Commission believes
an alteration of social attitudes
and policies is required before
the problem can be adequately
handled, it recommends that "a
national 'organization should be
established to bring about
changes in American drinking
patterns." This organization, the
Commission asserts, should have
a quasi-governmental status,
with some members appointed
by the President and with an an
nual federal appropriation. The
members would be leaders in
several fields: "government,
sports, entertainment, industries,
labor, religion, communications,
public relations, medicine, wel
fare, and education."
Lowering the legal age to 18
for purchase and public con
sumption of alcohol is one of
the many suggestions published
today in a report by the Coop
erative Commission on the Study
of Alcoholism. Dr. R. Nevitt San
ford, director of the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems
at Stanford, served as scientific
director of the Commission and
Benjamin D. Paul, professor of
anthropology, was also a mem
ber of it.
The study, begun in 1961, is
the first comprehensive, nation
al, government-financed study of
alcohol problems. The Commis
sion was established and financ
ed by a grant from the National
Institute of Mental Health of the
Federal Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
The report covers the prob
lems of alcoholism, drunkenness,
drinking and driving, regulation
of the liquor industry, alcoholic
beverage advertising, and alco
hol education. Advance copies of
the report, "Alcohol Problems,
A Report to the Nation," have
been sent to key legislative offi
cials.
