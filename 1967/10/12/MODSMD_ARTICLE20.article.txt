## Red Sox Partisans Go Wild In The Tresidder Bleachers 
### Nick Selby 
You would not have believed
it.
Inside Tresidder Union yester
day, there was a mob of close to
300 people, screaming and cheer
ing in the most unrestrained
manner.
Riding past on my bicycle, I
heard the screams and decided
to investigate. The noise was
so jubilant that I suspected the
price of cheeseburgers had just
dropped ten cents.
What a scene inside! A huge
crowd had gathered to watch the
World Series game between the
Boston Red and the St. Louis
Cardinals on the TV suspended
from the ceiling.
Cheerleader, Too
The people had moved many
of Tresidder's chairs into the
small dining alcove beneath the
TV, and those who couldn't find
any room for their chairs had
packed into several rows outside
the alcove.
It happened that the Red Sox
had just tied the game on a
home run by Carl Yastrezemski.
A Boston fan leaped up and
down on his chair at the front,
waving his arms in the manner
of a cheerleader.
This continued with every key
hit or defensive play by the Red
Sox.
Then Reggie Smith and Rico
Petrocelli homered to give the
Red Sox a 4-2 lead. The fans
were ecstatic. The noise rattled
the coffee cups.
In the top of the seventh, Lou
Brock tied the score with a long

home run off Boston reliever
John Wyatt. There were two peo
ple clapping, and I worried for
their safety when I saw the
numerical advantage of the Red
Sox fans.
But the Red Sox regained the
lead with a four run explosion
in their half of the inning. Joe
Foy's double off the left field
wall scored pinch hitter Dalton
Jones for what turned out to be
the winning run.
"Stop Smiling"
The final innings were tense
for the Red Sox fans, who felt
their heroes might blow the lead.
The camera showed a close-up
of Gary Bell, Boston reliefer,
who had been tagged for some
long but harmless fly balls.
Bell's Ultra Bright teeth
gleemed on the screen as he
smiled. The Red Sox cheerleader
commanded "Stop Smiling!"
from the Tresidder pit to warn
him of the dangers ahead. The
fans agreed.
He's Got It
In the top of the ninth, BrocK

hit a long fly to the right field
bull pen. Red Sox outfielder Geo
rge Thomas drifted back and
put his glove over the bull pen
fence.
A second before the ball came
down, a Red Sox fan stood up
before the crowd, raised his
arms, and confidently announced
to all, "He's got it." Thomas
gloved the ball for the out and
an 8-4 Sox win.
Hot Dog Vendors
Tresidder has the chance to
morrow to remedy a gross blun
der. Former Stanford pitcher
Jim Lonborg faces the Cards'
Bob Gibson in the deciding sev
enth game.
The hashers can become ven
dors to take advantage of the
captive audience.
"Hotdogs! Popcorn!" they'll
call. The Tresidder bleachers
fans might buy if the food is
brought to them. Yesterday most
of them were afraid to move for
fear of losing their seats.
You would not have believed

put his glove over the bull pen
fence.
A second before the ball came
down, a Red Sox fan stood up
before the crowd, raised his
arms, and confidently announced
to all, "He's got it." Thomas
gloved the ball for the out and
an 8-4 Sox win.

Tresidder has the chance to
morrow to remedy a gross blun
der. Former Stanford pitcher
Jim Lonborg faces the Cards'
Bob Gibson in the deciding sev
enth game.
The hashers can become ven
dors to take advantage of the
captive audience.
"Hotdogs! Popcorn!" they'll
call. The Tresidder bleachers
fans might buy if the food is
brought to them. Yesterday most
of them were afraid to move for
fear of losing their seats.
You would not have believed
it.
Inside Tresidder Union yester
day, there was a mob of close to
300 people, screaming and cheer
ing in the most unrestrained
manner.
Riding past on my bicycle, I
heard the screams and decided
to investigate. The noise was
so jubilant that I suspected the
price of cheeseburgers had just
dropped ten cents.
What a scene inside! A huge
crowd had gathered to watch the
World Series game between the
Boston Red and the St. Louis
Cardinals on the TV suspended
from the ceiling.
Cheerleader, Too
The people had moved many
of Tresidder's chairs into the
small dining alcove beneath the
TV, and those who couldn't find
any room for their chairs had
packed into several rows outside
the alcove.
It happened that the Red Sox
had just tied the game on a
home run by Carl Yastrezemski.
A Boston fan leaped up and
down on his chair at the front,
waving his arms in the manner
of a cheerleader.
This continued with every key
hit or defensive play by the Red
Sox.
Then Reggie Smith and Rico
Petrocelli homered to give the
Red Sox a 4-2 lead. The fans
were ecstatic. The noise rattled
the coffee cups.
In the top of the seventh, Lou
Brock tied the score with a long

home run off Boston reliever
John Wyatt. There were two peo
ple clapping, and I worried for
their safety when I saw the
numerical advantage of the Red
Sox fans.
But the Red Sox regained the
lead with a four run explosion
in their half of the inning. Joe
Foy's double off the left field
wall scored pinch hitter Dalton
Jones for what turned out to be
the winning run.
"Stop Smiling"
The final innings were tense
for the Red Sox fans, who felt
their heroes might blow the lead.
The camera showed a close-up
of Gary Bell, Boston reliefer,
who had been tagged for some
long but harmless fly balls.
Bell's Ultra Bright teeth
gleemed on the screen as he
smiled. The Red Sox cheerleader
commanded "Stop Smiling!"
from the Tresidder pit to warn
him of the dangers ahead. The
fans agreed.
He's Got It
In the top of the ninth, BrocK

hit a long fly to the right field
bull pen. Red Sox outfielder Geo
rge Thomas drifted back and
put his glove over the bull pen
fence.
