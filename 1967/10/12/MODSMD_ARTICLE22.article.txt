Boasting a 9-1-1 record from
last year, the Stanford women's
hockey team is looking hopefully
toward another winning season.
Most action will be seen in
intercollegiate games, the Bay
Area Sports Day in November,
and the "Big Game" with Cal
Berkeley to end the season.
This year's schedule will in
clude games with Cal Berkeley,
Cal Hayward, Mills, San Jose
and San Francisco State, with
the toughest competition coming
from Cal Berkeley and San Jose.
The Spartan women were the
only team to beat Stanford last
year, doing so by one goal.
Mommie Games
To keep in practice for inter
collegiate games, the women's
team plays the "Mommies" every
Wednesday afternoon. This team
consists of members of the Ju
nior League, all of whom are
mothers, and one of whom has
been on an international tour
ing team.
For the uninformed, hockey is
much like soccer. There are 11
players on a team, which is

divided into a forward, offensive
line, halfbacks, who are both
offensive and defensive players,
fullbacks, and a goalie.
Co-Captains
Mrs. Book, the women's hock
ey coach, says that even though
most of last years winning team
graduated, this year's team un
der co-captains Tina Shapleigh
and Barbara Robins, should
equal last year's record.
Another returning veteran
who will aid the new turn-outs
is track star Ginger Smith.
