tory, succeeds David Robertson
who resigned suddenly "for pers
onal reasons."
In an interview wilh The

Despite tho now president's
feeling that "We are starting
late and from scratch," Vidal
predicted a full and well-round
ed program for the Stanford

ent state of disorganization.
Plans at the moment are in
definite, but potential speakers
already include most of the 1968
Presidential hopefuls, Senator
Wayne Morse, and Mayor Sam
Yorty of Los Angeles. More con
cretely, George Wallace has been

do la Gauche in France has

Asked about the possibility of
innovations in tho program, Vi
dal envis.oned "special talks" by

Stanford administrators and in
terested students, closer coordi
nation of activities with the Cen
tury 21 Program, and a joint
speaker project with Bolivar
House.
As with past Political Union
groups, Vidal expects to assist
smaller political organizations
