# Noon Peace Rally
## Brown, Keating Blast Draft And Viet War 
### 
Religion professor Robert Mc-
Afee Brown publicly defied the
1967 Selective Service Act yes
terday by encouraging the men
at a White Plaza rally who had
decided to "resist induction."
Brown was speaking at a ral
ly for congressional candidate
Edward Keating. The govern
ment-defying speech came be
fore Keating told students he
felt the Vietnam war would lead
to holocaust if it is not stopped.
Brown said he was no longer
"content to encourage from the
sidelines. . . . The escalation of
military power demands an es
calation of moral protest. ... We
must take more risks on behalf
of peace and give some kind of
witness to our belief."

Though he supported the An
ti-draft Week project, Brown
also said he encouraged every
one to "step up his level of pro
test" and do more of whatever
he could.
Referring to the war, Brown
concluded, "The most evil thing
to do is not to do bestial things
but to do bestial things and call
them genteel."
Keating, who is running for
San Mateo County's Congres
sional seat for the second time,
called for a world peace confer
ence to arbitrate the war in
Vietnam. Included in the con
ference would be all nations con
cerned in the conflict and all
parties to it, including the Na

tional Liberation Front (V ie t-
Cong).
Halt Aggression First
The United States should con
vene such a conference but first
halt "all aggressive acts" in
Vietnam, agree to abide by the
decisions of the conference, and
pledge at least $1 billion to aid
the people of North and South
Vietnam, he said.
The candidate, formerly editor
of Ramparts magazine, said his
first act as Congressman would
be to introduce a resolution call
ing for the world peace confer
ence. But Keating, who spoke
under a large pink banner with
a flower and the words "The
feeling for peace is growing" on
it, said his election would be
more significant than anything
he might do once elected.
"My election will show that to
run as an unadulterated peace
candidate is not to commit po
litical suicide," Keating said.
The "Ducks" in the Congress
who are privately opposed to the
war but who publicly vote ap
propriations for it then will feel
freer to express their real views,
he said.
Mandate To The President
Stanford graduate Keating
called his election "a mandate
to the President, a mandate for
peace." The candidate told the
students that the U.S. is spend
ing $30 billion a year to "anni
hilate the Vietnamese."
The money could be much bet
ter spent to save the cities and
help the underprivileged in this
country, he said. In local terms
Keating said San Mateo County
voters are paying about $450
apiece each year for the war.
Keating deplored the rise of
militarism in the United States
and said military actions fright
en him. "It is time we did some
thing for peace," he said.
Supports CDC
Professor George L e p p e r t,
president of the local Democrat
ic Council, who introduced Keat
ing, advocated support of the
California Democratic Council's
plan to elect a slate of delegates
committed to de-escalation to the
national convention next sum
mer.


FOLLOWING ROBERT McAFEE BROWN'S remarks yesterday at
White Plaza, congressional candidate Edward Keating expresses
his opinions on Vietnam and the upcoming election.
