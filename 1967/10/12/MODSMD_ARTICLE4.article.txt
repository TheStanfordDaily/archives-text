# Jackson Defends U.S. Arms Buildup
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
Senator Henry Jackson de
fended the national arms build
up last night in a speech spon
sored by the Hoover Institution.
"As I see things," he com
mented, "international peace and
security depend not on a parity
of power but on a preponderance
of power in the peace-keepers
over the peace-upsetters."
Soviet Threat
Jackson, a Democrat from the
state of Washington, warned
that despite increasing Sino-So
viet disagreement Russia must
be considered the primary threat
to U.S. security. He cited Cuban
and Berlin crises, Soviet support
of the Viet Cong, recent efforts
to scuttle NATO, and growing
Russian involvement in the Mid
dle East as evidence of this
threat.
In a press conference earlier
yesterday, the 20-year member
of a congressional committee on

atomic warfare commented that
if the Russians had invented the
A-bomb first "they wouldn't have
hesitated to destroy the U.S.
if they hadn't gotten what they
wanted.
"I'm just a realist on this," he
added.
According to Jackson there is
a strong correlation between So
viet restraint and American firm
ness. "If we settled for paiity
we'd be through," he said.
'Strength Not Weakness'
"We should have learned by
now that the way to encourage
a reasonable response from Mos
cow is not through weakness
but through strength. The way
to negotiate successfully with So
viet leaders is to maintain the
strength to make negotiated
agreements more attractive to
them than continued disagree
ments.
"I have tried," he went on, "to
counteract the siren song that
goes: 'if we trust the Commu
nists they will trust us.' He also

quoted Reinhold Niebuhr's com
ment: "If the democratic nations
fail, their failure must be partly
attributed to the falty strategy
of idealists who have too many
illusions when they face realists
who have too little conscience."
The senator criticized those
who see the arms buildup as a
"tit-for-tat, action-reaction" ar
rangement. "Implicit (and some
times explicit) in this view," he
said, is the belief that if the U.S.
did not act the Soviet Union
would not act.
"Sometimes," he continued,
"the argument is taken even fur
ther: if the U.S. acted to reduce
its military programs, the Soviet
Union would reciprocate in what
could be called a policy of minus
tit for minus-tat.
"Moscow, however, is going
about its business, not ours,"
he added.
Jackson, who is chairman of
the committee on natural secur
ity, stated that Moscow has, in
the past year, increased the

number of its operational bal
listic missiles by 50 percent.
He told the conference audi
ence that America still has three
times more ICBM's and Polaris
missiles than Russia, and said
U.S. technology would allow un
limited buildup in order to main
tain the ratio.
He said the entire science ad
visory committee concerned
with thermonuclear weapons
recommended in 1952 that the
U.S. not go ahead with plans
for the hydrogen bomb.
"Those scientists thought the
bomb would just be provocative
and unnecessary. Many of them
had guilt complexes of some
kind.
"I don't understand this," he
added.
In a noon rally in White Plaza
f/esterday, Edward Keating
called Jackson "the senator from
Boeing." (The Boeing company
operates a large aircraft indus
try in Washington.) "Jackson,"
Keating said, will say all the
things the militarists want to
hear."
Jackson called Keating's com
ment a "shop-worn cliche." He

said that the military industrial
complex is the "modern scape
goat, just as Marx is the capital
ist scapegoat and the Jews were
Hitler's scapegoat.
"There was a similar line of
discussion thirty years ago," he
said, "when one group tried to
prove all wars were started by
munitions makers."

In a noon rally in White Plaza
f/esterday, Edward Keating
called Jackson "the senator from

Keating said, will say all the

Jackson called Keating's com

said that the military industrial

SENATOR HENRY JACKSON
Senator Henry Jackson de
fended the national arms build
up last night in a speech spon
sored by the Hoover Institution.
"As I see things," he com
mented, "international peace and
security depend not on a parity
of power but on a preponderance
of power in the peace-keepers
over the peace-upsetters."
Soviet Threat
Jackson, a Democrat from the
state of Washington, warned
that despite increasing Sino-So
viet disagreement Russia must
be considered the primary threat
to U.S. security. He cited Cuban
and Berlin crises, Soviet support
of the Viet Cong, recent efforts
to scuttle NATO, and growing
Russian involvement in the Mid
dle East as evidence of this
threat.
In a press conference earlier
yesterday, the 20-year member
of a congressional committee on

atomic warfare commented that
if the Russians had invented the
A-bomb first "they wouldn't have
hesitated to destroy the U.S.
if they hadn't gotten what they
wanted.
"I'm just a realist on this," he
added.
According to Jackson there is
a strong correlation between So
viet restraint and American firm
ness. "If we settled for paiity
we'd be through," he said.
'Strength Not Weakness'
"We should have learned by
now that the way to encourage
a reasonable response from Mos
cow is not through weakness
but through strength. The way
to negotiate successfully with So
viet leaders is to maintain the
strength to make negotiated
agreements more attractive to
them than continued disagree
ments.
"I have tried," he went on, "to
counteract the siren song that
goes: 'if we trust the Commu
nists they will trust us.' He also

quoted Reinhold Niebuhr's com
ment: "If the democratic nations
fail, their failure must be partly
attributed to the falty strategy
of idealists who have too many
illusions when they face realists
who have too little conscience."
The senator criticized those
who see the arms buildup as a
"tit-for-tat, action-reaction" ar
rangement. "Implicit (and some
times explicit) in this view," he
said, is the belief that if the U.S.
did not act the Soviet Union
would not act.
"Sometimes," he continued,
"the argument is taken even fur
ther: if the U.S. acted to reduce
its military programs, the Soviet
Union would reciprocate in what
could be called a policy of minus
tit for minus-tat.
"Moscow, however, is going
about its business, not ours,"
he added.
Jackson, who is chairman of
the committee on natural secur
ity, stated that Moscow has, in
the past year, increased the

number of its operational bal
listic missiles by 50 percent.
He told the conference audi
ence that America still has three
times more ICBM's and Polaris
missiles than Russia, and said
U.S. technology would allow un
limited buildup in order to main
tain the ratio.
He said the entire science ad
visory committee concerned
with thermonuclear weapons
recommended in 1952 that the
U.S. not go ahead with plans
for the hydrogen bomb.

would not act.
"Sometimes," he continued,
"the argument is taken even fur
ther: if the U.S. acted to reduce
its military programs, the Soviet
Union would reciprocate in what
could be called a policy of minus
tit for minus-tat.
"Moscow, however, is going
about its business, not ours,"
he added.
Jackson, who is chairman of
the committee on natural secur
ity, stated that Moscow has, in
the past year, increased the

number of its operational bal
listic missiles by 50 percent.
He told the conference audi
ence that America still has three
times more ICBM's and Polaris
missiles than Russia, and said
U.S. technology would allow un
limited buildup in order to main
tain the ratio.
He said the entire science ad
visory committee concerned
with thermonuclear weapons
recommended in 1952 that the
U.S. not go ahead with plans
for the hydrogen bomb.
"Those scientists thought the
bomb would just be provocative
and unnecessary. Many of them
had guilt complexes of some
kind.
"I don't understand this," he
added.
In a noon rally in White Plaza
f/esterday, Edward Keating
called Jackson "the senator from
Boeing." (The Boeing company
operates a large aircraft indus
try in Washington.) "Jackson,"
Keating said, will say all the
things the militarists want to
hear."
Jackson called Keating's com
ment a "shop-worn cliche." He

said that the military industrial
complex is the "modern scape
goat, just as Marx is the capital
ist scapegoat and the Jews were
Hitler's scapegoat.
"There was a similar line of
discussion thirty years ago," he
said, "when one group tried to
prove all wars were started by
munitions makers."
