# Hoover – Stanford In Conflict
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN (Last in a series) 
Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, graphically
illustrated the tenor of the relationship between the University
and the Institution recently.
When asked about faculty requests for consultation on Hoover
appointments, he replied: "I wish the faculty would keep their
noses cut of my business."

Talks with numerous profes
sors indicate they feel equally
adament that the University
should forcefully get into the
Institution's business, and es
pecially Campbell's business.
This conflict stems directly
from the official University rules
that govern the relationship. The
most sensitive and controver
sial conflicts arise over the meth
od for stafl and director appoint
ments at Hoover.
Make Things Official
After many years of function
ing on the basis of understood
agreements, the University and
Herbert Hoover decided to make
things official in 1959. The Stan
ford Board of Trustees passed
a resolution incorporating many
requirements that seemed un
usual, but Herbert Hoover in
sisted they be included.
The relationship is outlined in
Paragraph 3 of that resolution.
"The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an in

dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University.
"Its relation to the University
is that the President of the Uni
versity will propose all appoint
ments, promotions and the bud
get of the Institution directly to
the Board of Trustees. There
will be no reference to any fac
ulty committees between the
President and the Trustees."
Special Privileges
The phrase, "No reference to
any faculty committees," is what
raises the ire of professors. Why,
they ask, is the Hoover Insti
tution allowed to appoint its
own staff when University de
partments are not granted the
same privilege?
The specific issues involved
in such a question are complex
and have often thrown the whole
inquiry into a quagmire of am
biguity.
The faculty members feel, in
neneral, that the autonomy given

to the Institution allows the di
rector to create a staff in his
own image. The trustee resolu
tion declares: "The Director
shall be responsible through the
President of the University to
the Trustees for: (a) recom
mending appointments to and
supervising the staff of the In
stitution."
Centralized Power
Combined with the rule not
allowing the President to con
sult with faculty committees on
such appointments, it is clear
that the power resides with the
director of Hoover and the Pres
ident. The faculty is not even
consulted.
Professors feel this system
gives almost complete appoint
ment power to Campbell since
President Sterling can't spend
time combing the country for
Institution personnel.
They explain, for comparison,
the system all faculty depart
ments follow. If a position is
vacant, all members of the de
partment with the rank of that
position or higher, may form a
search committee.
When they have a list of pos
sibilities, they pass it on to the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council, pressing for the ap
pointment of one individual on

the list. A complete dossier on
all possibilities must be included.
The whole faculty, represent
ed by the Advisory Board, has a
crucial voice in individual de
partment appointments. If they
turn down a person, he is out
of the picture.
Board Limited
The Advisory Board, however,
is limited in a very important
direction. It cannot appoint any
one without acceptance by the
department involved.
At Hoover the staff does not
have power to suggest nor to re
ject appointments. The director
thus is able to act alone in the
vacuum if he desires.
This is exactly what profes
sors claim Campbell does, filling
the vacuum by effectively mak
ing all appointments himself.
Activities Questioned
They point to people such as
Stefan Possony and Richard Al
len, saying they carry on acti
vities that can hardly be called
academic and thus reflect very
badly on the University.
Campbell, they claim, is able
to perpetuate his own political
views to such an extent that the
whole Institution becomes in
fected with his unscholarly dog
matism.
