# Hoover â€“ Stanford In Conflict
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN (Last in a series) 
Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, graphically
illustrated the tenor of the relationship between the University
and the Institution recently.
When asked about faculty requests for consultation on Hoover
appointments, he replied: "I wish the faculty would keep their
noses cut of my business."

Talks with numerous profes
sors indicate they feel equally
adament that the University
should forcefully get into the
Institution's business, and es
pecially Campbell's business.
This conflict stems directly
from the official University rules
that govern the relationship. The
most sensitive and controver
sial conflicts arise over the meth
od for stafl and director appoint
ments at Hoover.
Make Things Official
After many years of function
ing on the basis of understood
agreements, the University and
Herbert Hoover decided to make
things official in 1959. The Stan
ford Board of Trustees passed
a resolution incorporating many
requirements that seemed un
usual, but Herbert Hoover in
sisted they be included.
The relationship is outlined in
Paragraph 3 of that resolution.
"The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an in

dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University.
"Its relation to the University
is that the President of the Uni
versity will propose all appoint
ments, promotions and the bud
get of the Institution directly to
the Board of Trustees. There
will be no reference to any fac
ulty committees between the
President and the Trustees."
Special Privileges
The phrase, "No reference to
any faculty committees," is what
raises the ire of professors. Why,
they ask, is the Hoover Insti
tution allowed to appoint its
own staff when University de
partments are not granted the
same privilege?
The specific issues involved
in such a question are complex
and have often thrown the whole
inquiry into a quagmire of am
biguity.
The faculty members feel, in
neneral, that the autonomy given

to the Institution allows the di
rector to create a staff in his
own image. The trustee resolu
tion declares: "The Director
shall be responsible through the
President of the University to
the Trustees for: (a) recom
mending appointments to and
supervising the staff of the In
stitution."
Centralized Power
Combined with the rule not
allowing the President to con
sult with faculty committees on
such appointments, it is clear
that the power resides with the
director of Hoover and the Pres
ident. The faculty is not even
consulted.
Professors feel this system
gives almost complete appoint
ment power to Campbell since
President Sterling can't spend
time combing the country for
Institution personnel.
They explain, for comparison,
the system all faculty depart
ments follow. If a position is
vacant, all members of the de
partment with the rank of that
position or higher, may form a
search committee.
When they have a list of pos
sibilities, they pass it on to the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council, pressing for the ap
pointment of one individual on

the list. A complete dossier on
all possibilities must be included.
The whole faculty, represent
ed by the Advisory Board, has a
crucial voice in individual de
partment appointments. If they
turn down a person, he is out
of the picture.
Board Limited
The Advisory Board, however,
is limited in a very important
direction. It cannot appoint any
one without acceptance by the
department involved.
At Hoover the staff does not
have power to suggest nor to re
ject appointments. The director
thus is able to act alone in the
vacuum if he desires.
This is exactly what profes
sors claim Campbell does, filling
the vacuum by effectively mak
ing all appointments himself.
Activities Questioned
They point to people such as
Stefan Possony and Richard Al
len, saying they carry on acti
vities that can hardly be called
academic and thus reflect very
badly on the University.
Campbell, they claim, is able
to perpetuate his own political
views to such an extent that the
whole Institution becomes in
fected with his unscholarly dog
matism.
Some Hoover people suggest
such faculty criticism is un
warranted and out of place be
cause Hoover employees are not
part of the University faculty
and thus do not necessarily have
to incorporate every ideal of the
Stanford faculty.
Many Ways To Contribute
Professors reply that there are
many ways to contribute to a
university. If you are part of
the university then whatever you
do reflects on the whole univer
sity, whether it be publishing, re
searching, traveling or teaching.
As an example, one professor
of History complained that Hoov
er employees always parade
around academic conferences
wearing Stanford tags, without

telling anyone they come from
Hoover.
Several Stanford professors
noted that the problem might
have been slightly relieved if the
Trustee resolution hadn't com
pletely tied everyone's hands, in
cluding the President's, on the
matter of Director appointment.
President Recommends
The resolution reads: "The Di
rector of the Institution shall be
recommended to the Board of
Trustees by the President of the
University for appointment by
the Trustees. He shall have been
previously approved by Mr.
Hoover."
Since Mr. Hoover founded the
Institution and supplied it with
personal funds, the stage was set

for appointment of anyone he
wanted, even if others thought
the choice unqualified or unsuit
able.
It is known that many mem
bers of the University commu
nity were not happy with the
choice of Campbell, but Mr.
Hoover had his way neverthe
less.
Power To Be Limited
It is the University's under
standing that in the choice of
future directors, Mr. Hoover's
estate and two sons, Herbert Jr.
and Allen, will not have the same
powers of approval.
Not as controversial, though
important to both the Institution
and the University, are the fi
nancial ties that bind them.
It was agreed in the 1959 reso
lution that not less than $125,000
per annum would be given to the
Institution from Stanford gen
eral funds. The understanding at
both Hoover and in the Univer
sity budget office is that this
money will go only into the li
brary. The Institution must pro
vide its own funds for research
and publication.
The University is also closely
involved in gifts given to the
Institution. All gifts and dona
tions to Hoover must be given
to Stanford for the Hoover In
stitution.
Check On Funding
This gives the University a
check on Hoover funding. Stan
ford will not accept gifts that
have any strings attached or
that will lead to a diversifying
venture the University wants to
avoid.
As part of this arrangement,
the Hoover Institution gets the
tax-exempt status which the Uni
versity enjoys. Without it, fund
raising would be greatly cur
tailed.
Such tax-exemption is granted
to only non-political organiza
tions.

warranted and out of place be
cause Hoover employees are not
part of the University faculty
and thus do not necessarily have
to incorporate every ideal of the
Stanford faculty.
Many Ways To Contribute
Professors reply that there are
many ways to contribute to a
university. If you are part of
the university then whatever you
do reflects on the whole univer
sity, whether it be publishing, re
searching, traveling or teaching.
As an example, one professor
of History complained that Hoov
er employees always parade
around academic conferences
wearing Stanford tags, without

telling anyone they come from
Hoover.
Several Stanford professors
noted that the problem might
have been slightly relieved if the
Trustee resolution hadn't com
pletely tied everyone's hands, in
cluding the President's, on the
matter of Director appointment.
President Recommends
The resolution reads: "The Di
rector of the Institution shall be
recommended to the Board of
Trustees by the President of the
University for appointment by
the Trustees. He shall have been
previously approved by Mr.
Hoover."
Since Mr. Hoover founded the
Institution and supplied it with
personal funds, the stage was set

for appointment of anyone he
wanted, even if others thought
the choice unqualified or unsuit
able.
It is known that many mem
bers of the University commu
nity were not happy with the
choice of Campbell, but Mr.
Hoover had his way neverthe
less.
Power To Be Limited
It is the University's under
standing that in the choice of
future directors, Mr. Hoover's
estate and two sons, Herbert Jr.
and Allen, will not have the same
powers of approval.
Not as controversial, though
important to both the Institution
and the University, are the fi
nancial ties that bind them.
It was agreed in the 1959 reso
lution that not less than $125,000
per annum would be given to the
Institution from Stanford gen
eral funds. The understanding at
both Hoover and in the Univer
sity budget office is that this
money will go only into the li
brary. The Institution must pro
vide its own funds for research
and publication.
The University is also closely
involved in gifts given to the
Institution. All gifts and dona
tions to Hoover must be given
to Stanford for the Hoover In
stitution.
Check On Funding
This gives the University a
check on Hoover funding. Stan
ford will not accept gifts that
have any strings attached or
that will lead to a diversifying
venture the University wants to
avoid.
As part of this arrangement,
the Hoover Institution gets the
tax-exempt status which the Uni
versity enjoys. Without it, fund
raising would be greatly cur
tailed.
Such tax-exemption is granted
to only non-political organiza
tions.
Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, graphically
illustrated the tenor of the relationship between the University
and the Institution recently.
When asked about faculty requests for consultation on Hoover
appointments, he replied: "I wish the faculty would keep their
noses cut of my business."

Talks with numerous profes
sors indicate they feel equally
adament that the University
should forcefully get into the
Institution's business, and es
pecially Campbell's business.
This conflict stems directly
from the official University rules
that govern the relationship. The
most sensitive and controver
sial conflicts arise over the meth
od for stafl and director appoint
ments at Hoover.
Make Things Official
After many years of function
ing on the basis of understood
agreements, the University and
Herbert Hoover decided to make
things official in 1959. The Stan
ford Board of Trustees passed
a resolution incorporating many
requirements that seemed un
usual, but Herbert Hoover in
sisted they be included.
The relationship is outlined in
Paragraph 3 of that resolution.
"The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an in

dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University.
"Its relation to the University
is that the President of the Uni
versity will propose all appoint
ments, promotions and the bud
get of the Institution directly to
the Board of Trustees. There
will be no reference to any fac
ulty committees between the
President and the Trustees."
Special Privileges
The phrase, "No reference to
any faculty committees," is what
raises the ire of professors. Why,
they ask, is the Hoover Insti
tution allowed to appoint its
own staff when University de
partments are not granted the
same privilege?
The specific issues involved
in such a question are complex
and have often thrown the whole
inquiry into a quagmire of am
biguity.
The faculty members feel, in
neneral, that the autonomy given

to the Institution allows the di
rector to create a staff in his
own image. The trustee resolu
tion declares: "The Director
shall be responsible through the
President of the University to
the Trustees for: (a) recom
mending appointments to and
supervising the staff of the In
stitution."
Centralized Power
Combined with the rule not
allowing the President to con
sult with faculty committees on
such appointments, it is clear
that the power resides with the
director of Hoover and the Pres
ident. The faculty is not even
consulted.
Professors feel this system
gives almost complete appoint
ment power to Campbell since
President Sterling can't spend
time combing the country for
Institution personnel.
They explain, for comparison,
the system all faculty depart
ments follow. If a position is
vacant, all members of the de
partment with the rank of that
position or higher, may form a
search committee.
When they have a list of pos
sibilities, they pass it on to the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council, pressing for the ap
pointment of one individual on

the list. A complete dossier on
all possibilities must be included.
The whole faculty, represent
ed by the Advisory Board, has a
crucial voice in individual de
partment appointments. If they
turn down a person, he is out
of the picture.
Board Limited
The Advisory Board, however,
is limited in a very important
direction. It cannot appoint any
one without acceptance by the
department involved.
At Hoover the staff does not
have power to suggest nor to re
ject appointments. The director
thus is able to act alone in the
vacuum if he desires.
This is exactly what profes
sors claim Campbell does, filling
the vacuum by effectively mak
ing all appointments himself.
Activities Questioned
They point to people such as
Stefan Possony and Richard Al
len, saying they carry on acti
vities that can hardly be called
academic and thus reflect very
badly on the University.
Campbell, they claim, is able
to perpetuate his own political
views to such an extent that the
whole Institution becomes in
fected with his unscholarly dog
matism.
Some Hoover people suggest
such faculty criticism is un
warranted and out of place be
cause Hoover employees are not
part of the University faculty
and thus do not necessarily have

will be no reference to any fac
ulty committees between the
President and the Trustees."
Special Privileges
The phrase, "No reference to
any faculty committees," is what
raises the ire of professors. Why,
they ask, is the Hoover Insti
tution allowed to appoint its
own staff when University de
partments are not granted the
same privilege?
The specific issues involved
in such a question are complex
and have often thrown the whole
inquiry into a quagmire of am
biguity.
The faculty members feel, in
neneral, that the autonomy given

to the Institution allows the di
rector to create a staff in his
own image. The trustee resolu
tion declares: "The Director
shall be responsible through the
President of the University to
the Trustees for: (a) recom
mending appointments to and
supervising the staff of the In
stitution."
Centralized Power
Combined with the rule not
allowing the President to con
sult with faculty committees on
such appointments, it is clear
that the power resides with the
director of Hoover and the Pres
ident. The faculty is not even
consulted.
Professors feel this system
gives almost complete appoint
ment power to Campbell since
President Sterling can't spend
time combing the country for
Institution personnel.
They explain, for comparison,
the system all faculty depart
ments follow. If a position is
vacant, all members of the de
partment with the rank of that
position or higher, may form a
search committee.
When they have a list of pos
sibilities, they pass it on to the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council, pressing for the ap
pointment of one individual on

the list. A complete dossier on
all possibilities must be included.
The whole faculty, represent
ed by the Advisory Board, has a
crucial voice in individual de
partment appointments. If they
turn down a person, he is out
of the picture.
Board Limited
The Advisory Board, however,
is limited in a very important
direction. It cannot appoint any
one without acceptance by the
department involved.
At Hoover the staff does not
have power to suggest nor to re
ject appointments. The director
thus is able to act alone in the
vacuum if he desires.
This is exactly what profes
sors claim Campbell does, filling
the vacuum by effectively mak
ing all appointments himself.
Activities Questioned
They point to people such as
Stefan Possony and Richard Al
len, saying they carry on acti
vities that can hardly be called
academic and thus reflect very
badly on the University.
Campbell, they claim, is able
to perpetuate his own political
views to such an extent that the
whole Institution becomes in
fected with his unscholarly dog
matism.
Some Hoover people suggest
Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, graphically
illustrated the tenor of the relationship between the University
and the Institution recently.
When asked about faculty requests for consultation on Hoover
appointments, he replied: "I wish the faculty would keep their
noses cut of my business."

Talks with numerous profes
sors indicate they feel equally
adament that the University
should forcefully get into the
Institution's business, and es
pecially Campbell's business.
This conflict stems directly
from the official University rules
that govern the relationship. The
most sensitive and controver
sial conflicts arise over the meth
od for stafl and director appoint
ments at Hoover.
Make Things Official
After many years of function
ing on the basis of understood
agreements, the University and
Herbert Hoover decided to make
things official in 1959. The Stan
ford Board of Trustees passed
a resolution incorporating many
requirements that seemed un
usual, but Herbert Hoover in
sisted they be included.
The relationship is outlined in
Paragraph 3 of that resolution.
"The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an in

dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University.
"Its relation to the University
is that the President of the Uni
versity will propose all appoint
ments, promotions and the bud
get of the Institution directly to
the Board of Trustees. There
will be no reference to any fac
ulty committees between the
President and the Trustees."

Some Hoover people suggest
such faculty criticism is un
warranted and out of place be
cause Hoover employees are not
part of the University faculty
and thus do not necessarily have
to incorporate every ideal of the
Stanford faculty.
Many Ways To Contribute
Professors reply that there are
many ways to contribute to a
university. If you are part of
the university then whatever you
do reflects on the whole univer
sity, whether it be publishing, re
searching, traveling or teaching.
As an example, one professor
of History complained that Hoov
er employees always parade
around academic conferences
wearing Stanford tags, without

telling anyone they come from
Hoover.
Several Stanford professors
noted that the problem might
have been slightly relieved if the
Trustee resolution hadn't com
pletely tied everyone's hands, in
cluding the President's, on the
matter of Director appointment.
President Recommends
The resolution reads: "The Di
rector of the Institution shall be
recommended to the Board of
Trustees by the President of the
University for appointment by
the Trustees. He shall have been
previously approved by Mr.
Hoover."
Since Mr. Hoover founded the
Institution and supplied it with
personal funds, the stage was set

for appointment of anyone he
wanted, even if others thought
the choice unqualified or unsuit
able.
It is known that many mem
bers of the University commu
nity were not happy with the
choice of Campbell, but Mr.
Hoover had his way neverthe
less.
Power To Be Limited
It is the University's under
standing that in the choice of
future directors, Mr. Hoover's
estate and two sons, Herbert Jr.
and Allen, will not have the same
powers of approval.
Not as controversial, though
important to both the Institution
and the University, are the fi
nancial ties that bind them.
It was agreed in the 1959 reso
lution that not less than $125,000
per annum would be given to the
Institution from Stanford gen
eral funds. The understanding at
both Hoover and in the Univer
sity budget office is that this
money will go only into the li
brary. The Institution must pro
vide its own funds for research
and publication.
The University is also closely
involved in gifts given to the
Institution. All gifts and dona
tions to Hoover must be given
to Stanford for the Hoover In
stitution.
Check On Funding
This gives the University a
check on Hoover funding. Stan
ford will not accept gifts that
have any strings attached or
that will lead to a diversifying
venture the University wants to
avoid.
As part of this arrangement,
the Hoover Institution gets the
tax-exempt status which the Uni
versity enjoys. Without it, fund
raising would be greatly cur
tailed.
Such tax-exemption is granted
to only non-political organiza
tions.
such faculty criticism is un
warranted and out of place be

nity were not happy with the
choice of Campbell, but Mr.
Hoover had his way neverthe
less.
Power To Be Limited
It is the University's under
standing that in the choice of
future directors, Mr. Hoover's
estate and two sons, Herbert Jr.
and Allen, will not have the same
powers of approval.
Not as controversial, though
important to both the Institution
and the University, are the fi
nancial ties that bind them.
It was agreed in the 1959 reso
lution that not less than $125,000
per annum would be given to the
Institution from Stanford gen
eral funds. The understanding at
both Hoover and in the Univer
sity budget office is that this
money will go only into the li
brary. The Institution must pro
vide its own funds for research
and publication.
The University is also closely
involved in gifts given to the
Institution. All gifts and dona
tions to Hoover must be given
to Stanford for the Hoover In
stitution.
Check On Funding
This gives the University a
check on Hoover funding. Stan
ford will not accept gifts that
have any strings attached or
that will lead to a diversifying
venture the University wants to
avoid.
As part of this arrangement,
the Hoover Institution gets the
tax-exempt status which the Uni
versity enjoys. Without it, fund
raising would be greatly cur
tailed.
Such tax-exemption is granted
to only non-political organiza
tions.
Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, graphically
illustrated the tenor of the relationship between the University
and the Institution recently.
When asked about faculty requests for consultation on Hoover
appointments, he replied: "I wish the faculty would keep their
noses cut of my business."

Talks with numerous profes
sors indicate they feel equally
adament that the University
should forcefully get into the
Institution's business, and es
pecially Campbell's business.
This conflict stems directly
from the official University rules
that govern the relationship. The
most sensitive and controver
sial conflicts arise over the meth
od for stafl and director appoint
ments at Hoover.
Make Things Official
After many years of function
ing on the basis of understood
agreements, the University and
Herbert Hoover decided to make
things official in 1959. The Stan
ford Board of Trustees passed
a resolution incorporating many
requirements that seemed un
usual, but Herbert Hoover in
sisted they be included.
The relationship is outlined in
Paragraph 3 of that resolution.
"The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an in

dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University.
"Its relation to the University
is that the President of the Uni
versity will propose all appoint
ments, promotions and the bud
get of the Institution directly to
the Board of Trustees. There
will be no reference to any fac
ulty committees between the
President and the Trustees."
Special Privileges
The phrase, "No reference to
any faculty committees," is what
raises the ire of professors. Why,
they ask, is the Hoover Insti
tution allowed to appoint its
own staff when University de
partments are not granted the
same privilege?
The specific issues involved
in such a question are complex
and have often thrown the whole
inquiry into a quagmire of am
biguity.
The faculty members feel, in
neneral, that the autonomy given

to the Institution allows the di
rector to create a staff in his
own image. The trustee resolu
tion declares: "The Director
shall be responsible through the
President of the University to
the Trustees for: (a) recom
mending appointments to and
supervising the staff of the In
stitution."
Centralized Power
Combined with the rule not
allowing the President to con
sult with faculty committees on
such appointments, it is clear
that the power resides with the
director of Hoover and the Pres
ident. The faculty is not even
consulted.
Professors feel this system
gives almost complete appoint
ment power to Campbell since
President Sterling can't spend
time combing the country for
Institution personnel.
They explain, for comparison,
the system all faculty depart
ments follow. If a position is
vacant, all members of the de
partment with the rank of that
position or higher, may form a
search committee.
When they have a list of pos
sibilities, they pass it on to the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council, pressing for the ap
pointment of one individual on

the list. A complete dossier on
all possibilities must be included.
The whole faculty, represent
ed by the Advisory Board, has a
crucial voice in individual de
partment appointments. If they
turn down a person, he is out
of the picture.
Board Limited
The Advisory Board, however,
is limited in a very important
direction. It cannot appoint any
one without acceptance by the
department involved.
At Hoover the staff does not
have power to suggest nor to re
ject appointments. The director
thus is able to act alone in the
vacuum if he desires.
This is exactly what profes
sors claim Campbell does, filling
the vacuum by effectively mak
ing all appointments himself.
Activities Questioned
They point to people such as
Stefan Possony and Richard Al
len, saying they carry on acti
vities that can hardly be called
academic and thus reflect very
badly on the University.
Campbell, they claim, is able
to perpetuate his own political
views to such an extent that the
whole Institution becomes in
fected with his unscholarly dog
matism.
Some Hoover people suggest
such faculty criticism is un
warranted and out of place be
cause Hoover employees are not
part of the University faculty
and thus do not necessarily have
to incorporate every ideal of the
Stanford faculty.
Many Ways To Contribute
Professors reply that there are
many ways to contribute to a
university. If you are part of
the university then whatever you
do reflects on the whole univer
sity, whether it be publishing, re
searching, traveling or teaching.
As an example, one professor
of History complained that Hoov
er employees always parade
around academic conferences
wearing Stanford tags, without

telling anyone they come from
Hoover.
Several Stanford professors
noted that the problem might
have been slightly relieved if the
Trustee resolution hadn't com
pletely tied everyone's hands, in
cluding the President's, on the
matter of Director appointment.
President Recommends
The resolution reads: "The Di
rector of the Institution shall be
recommended to the Board of
Trustees by the President of the
University for appointment by
the Trustees. He shall have been
previously approved by Mr.
Hoover."
Since Mr. Hoover founded the
Institution and supplied it with
personal funds, the stage was set

for appointment of anyone he
wanted, even if others thought
the choice unqualified or unsuit
able.
It is known that many mem
bers of the University commu
nity were not happy with the
choice of Campbell, but Mr.
Hoover had his way neverthe
less.
