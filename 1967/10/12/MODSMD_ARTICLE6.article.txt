# Hoover Symposium:
## USSR Changes Highlighted 
### JAMES PERLOFF MARGIE WOLF 
Discussions of Soviet science,
law and diplomacy highlighted
yesterday's sessions of the Hoo
ver Institution symposium on
Fifty Years of Communism in
.Russia.
The day's speakers were John
Turkevich of Princeton, John
Hazard of Columbia, and Ivo
Lederer of Stanford.
John Turkevich, former sci
entific attache at the American
Embassy in Moscow, outlined
the growth of Soviet science
since the Great October Revolu
tion.
"We would not worry about
the USSR if Soviet science had
not been so effective in making
Russia one of two major powers
of the world," declared Turke
vich. He added that the Soviets
have built the second strongest
scientific power in the world.
Soviets Lead
Turkevich said the Soviets
probably even led their Ameri
can counterparts in several
fields, though their technology

is less advanced in most others.
He cited chemistry and biology,
as weaknesses of Russian sci
ence.
"The overall effect of the fifty
years has been for Soviet leader
ship to base their plans more on
science and technology than on
communism. The Soviet Union
is not a communist state —it is a
technocracy."
According to the Princeton
professor, the Soviets were for
tunate enough to have a solid
Czarist base on which to build
their own science. They took
good advantage of the existing
base during the pre-World War
II period and built the Soviet
Union into the center of all
mathematics study.
Immediately after the war,
scientists in certain fields, nota
bly biology and genetics, were
severely hampered in their work
if their theories did not conform
to Marxist doctrine.
New Freedom
With Stalin's death however,
a new freedom of scientific in

quiry was instituted. This in
cluded expanded scientific con
tact with the West and increased
efforts at translation and distri
bution of scientific papers.
Turkevich warned that Soviet
scientists have had in the past
"an uncanny way of determin
ing what's going to happen in
their fields." He cited as an ex
ample early Soviet research in
areas such as solid state physics,
cryogenics, nuclear physics, and
rocket development which are
