# Hoover Symposium:
## USSR Changes Highlighted 
### JAMES PERLOFF MARGIE WOLF 
Discussions of Soviet science,
law and diplomacy highlighted
yesterday's sessions of the Hoo
ver Institution symposium on
Fifty Years of Communism in
.Russia.
The day's speakers were John
Turkevich of Princeton, John
Hazard of Columbia, and Ivo
Lederer of Stanford.
John Turkevich, former sci
entific attache at the American
Embassy in Moscow, outlined
the growth of Soviet science
since the Great October Revolu
tion.
"We would not worry about
the USSR if Soviet science had
not been so effective in making
Russia one of two major powers
of the world," declared Turke
vich. He added that the Soviets
have built the second strongest
scientific power in the world.
Soviets Lead
Turkevich said the Soviets
probably even led their Ameri
can counterparts in several
fields, though their technology

is less advanced in most others.
He cited chemistry and biology,
as weaknesses of Russian sci
ence.
"The overall effect of the fifty
years has been for Soviet leader
ship to base their plans more on
science and technology than on
communism. The Soviet Union
is not a communist state —it is a
technocracy."
According to the Princeton
professor, the Soviets were for
tunate enough to have a solid
Czarist base on which to build
their own science. They took
good advantage of the existing
base during the pre-World War
II period and built the Soviet
Union into the center of all
mathematics study.
Immediately after the war,
scientists in certain fields, nota
bly biology and genetics, were
severely hampered in their work
if their theories did not conform
to Marxist doctrine.
New Freedom
With Stalin's death however,
a new freedom of scientific in

quiry was instituted. This in
cluded expanded scientific con
tact with the West and increased
efforts at translation and distri
bution of scientific papers.
Turkevich warned that Soviet
scientists have had in the past
"an uncanny way of determin
ing what's going to happen in
their fields." He cited as an ex
ample early Soviet research in
areas such as solid state physics,
cryogenics, nuclear physics, and
rocket development which are
all now vital parts of modern
technology.
Turkevich concluded his talk
with the assertion that Russian
science has "replaced Marxist
doctrine as the weapon of So
viet leadership for world domi
nation and as the hope of the
Russian people for a happy life
of the nation.
Russian Law
Russian law of the past fifty
years was discussed by John
Hazard of Columbia University.
Hazard traced its development
to two crucial areas: property
and inheritance law, and crimi
nal law. He stated that immedi
ately after the revolution the
courts of law adopted and ad
ministered with "professional
ism" the doctrine of "analogy".
This doctrine holds that in Haz
ard's words "the courts began
to emphasize the factor of
'guilt' ".
According to Hazard this guilt
was measured as a factor of the
degree of danger to community.
The doctrine was expanded in
the Stalinist purges as an ex
cuse to deny people their funda
mental rights. Hazard stated
that since the Stalinist period,
civil procedure has been re
formed so as to include the
right to a counsel well before
judicial proceedings start.
Property procedure has also
been greatly reformed. Now,
says Hazard, "He who earns
may spend, and pass to his heirs
or his friends, but he may not
enjoy his property to gain a re
turn on his investment."
Soviet Diplomacy Changes
Ivo Lederer, Stanford profes
sor of history, continued the con
ference by discussing "Soviet
Diplomacy, Continuity and
Change." He feels a limited de
tente presently governs U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Soviet foreign policy, says
Lederer, does and usually has
given highest priority to defense
of the Soviet system at home
and in Europe.
Present trends are greatly in
fluenced by China and other
problems within the Communist
block. These trends include the
development of an "alliance"
rather than a strict Soviet dic
tatorship in Eastern Europe and
the "remarkable" absence of di
rect Soviet involvement in Viet
nam.

Lederer traces Soviet diplo
macy through several stages. Im
mediately following the Bolshe
vik revolution, the Soviets were
almost exclusively concerned
with protecting the gains of the
revolution. They faced other
states with traditional suspicion,
although they felt that revolu
tion would soon occur in these
countries.
Domestic problems and the ab
sence of revolution elsewhere
spawned a more realistic policy
in which the Russians tried to
fulfill their revolutionary aims
by directly supporting Commu
nist parties in other countries.
The 1930 Munich diplomatic
"quarantine" of Russia re-con
firmed Soviet suspicion of the
West and allowed the USSR to
scrupulously proceed regarding
previous agreements. Treaties
with Hitler later brought Mos
cow back into the political are
na.
The Soviets, who profited from
World War II victory and post
war confusion in Europe, sought
to establish influence in all
states surrounding Russia. Fail
ure to participate in the Marshall
Plan, Lederer says, is Russia's
"grossest error in post-War
years."
Advancement and Frustration
He characterizes the last two
decades with technological ad
vancement but frustration of
many diplomatic and political
aims. Global conquest, exempli
fied by the Cuban missile at
tempt, has been tempered. Leder
er notes, however, that Com
munist doctrine can never sanc
tify the peaceful co-existence of
opposing ideologies.
Lederer concludes that apart
from the basic aims of Soviet
survival and leadership of the
Communist block Russia's
course for the future is unclear.

Soviet Diplomacy Changes
Ivo Lederer, Stanford profes
sor of history, continued the con
ference by discussing "Soviet
Diplomacy, Continuity and
Change." He feels a limited de
tente presently governs U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Soviet foreign policy, says
Lederer, does and usually has
given highest priority to defense
of the Soviet system at home
and in Europe.
Present trends are greatly in
fluenced by China and other
problems within the Communist
block. These trends include the
development of an "alliance"
rather than a strict Soviet dic
tatorship in Eastern Europe and
the "remarkable" absence of di
rect Soviet involvement in Viet
nam.

Lederer traces Soviet diplo
macy through several stages. Im
mediately following the Bolshe
vik revolution, the Soviets were
almost exclusively concerned
with protecting the gains of the
revolution. They faced other
states with traditional suspicion,
although they felt that revolu
tion would soon occur in these
countries.
Domestic problems and the ab
sence of revolution elsewhere
spawned a more realistic policy
in which the Russians tried to
fulfill their revolutionary aims
by directly supporting Commu
nist parties in other countries.
The 1930 Munich diplomatic
"quarantine" of Russia re-con
firmed Soviet suspicion of the
West and allowed the USSR to
scrupulously proceed regarding
previous agreements. Treaties
with Hitler later brought Mos
cow back into the political are
na.
The Soviets, who profited from
World War II victory and post
war confusion in Europe, sought
to establish influence in all
states surrounding Russia. Fail
ure to participate in the Marshall
Plan, Lederer says, is Russia's
"grossest error in post-War
years."
Advancement and Frustration
He characterizes the last two
decades with technological ad
vancement but frustration of
many diplomatic and political
aims. Global conquest, exempli
fied by the Cuban missile at
tempt, has been tempered. Leder
er notes, however, that Com
munist doctrine can never sanc
tify the peaceful co-existence of
opposing ideologies.
Lederer concludes that apart
from the basic aims of Soviet
survival and leadership of the
Communist block Russia's
course for the future is unclear.
Discussions of Soviet science,
law and diplomacy highlighted
yesterday's sessions of the Hoo
ver Institution symposium on
Fifty Years of Communism in
.Russia.
The day's speakers were John
Turkevich of Princeton, John
Hazard of Columbia, and Ivo
Lederer of Stanford.
John Turkevich, former sci
entific attache at the American
Embassy in Moscow, outlined
the growth of Soviet science
since the Great October Revolu
tion.
"We would not worry about
the USSR if Soviet science had
not been so effective in making
Russia one of two major powers
of the world," declared Turke
vich. He added that the Soviets
have built the second strongest
scientific power in the world.
Soviets Lead
Turkevich said the Soviets
probably even led their Ameri
can counterparts in several
fields, though their technology

is less advanced in most others.
He cited chemistry and biology,
as weaknesses of Russian sci
ence.
"The overall effect of the fifty
years has been for Soviet leader
ship to base their plans more on
science and technology than on
communism. The Soviet Union
is not a communist state —it is a
technocracy."
According to the Princeton
professor, the Soviets were for
tunate enough to have a solid
Czarist base on which to build
their own science. They took
good advantage of the existing
base during the pre-World War
II period and built the Soviet
Union into the center of all
mathematics study.
Immediately after the war,
scientists in certain fields, nota
bly biology and genetics, were
severely hampered in their work
if their theories did not conform
to Marxist doctrine.
New Freedom
With Stalin's death however,
a new freedom of scientific in

quiry was instituted. This in
cluded expanded scientific con
tact with the West and increased
efforts at translation and distri
bution of scientific papers.
Turkevich warned that Soviet
scientists have had in the past
"an uncanny way of determin
ing what's going to happen in
their fields." He cited as an ex
ample early Soviet research in
areas such as solid state physics,
cryogenics, nuclear physics, and
rocket development which are
all now vital parts of modern
technology.
Turkevich concluded his talk
with the assertion that Russian
science has "replaced Marxist
doctrine as the weapon of So
viet leadership for world domi
nation and as the hope of the
Russian people for a happy life
of the nation.
Russian Law
Russian law of the past fifty
years was discussed by John
Hazard of Columbia University.
Hazard traced its development
to two crucial areas: property
and inheritance law, and crimi
nal law. He stated that immedi
ately after the revolution the
courts of law adopted and ad
ministered with "professional
ism" the doctrine of "analogy".
This doctrine holds that in Haz
ard's words "the courts began
to emphasize the factor of
'guilt' ".
According to Hazard this guilt
was measured as a factor of the
degree of danger to community.
The doctrine was expanded in
the Stalinist purges as an ex
cuse to deny people their funda
mental rights. Hazard stated
that since the Stalinist period,
civil procedure has been re
formed so as to include the
right to a counsel well before
judicial proceedings start.
Property procedure has also

John Turkevich, former sci
entific attache at the American
Embassy in Moscow, outlined
the growth of Soviet science
since the Great October Revolu
tion.
"We would not worry about
the USSR if Soviet science had
not been so effective in making
Russia one of two major powers
of the world," declared Turke
vich. He added that the Soviets
have built the second strongest
scientific power in the world.
Soviets Lead
Turkevich said the Soviets
probably even led their Ameri
can counterparts in several
fields, though their technology

is less advanced in most others.
He cited chemistry and biology,
as weaknesses of Russian sci
ence.
"The overall effect of the fifty
years has been for Soviet leader
ship to base their plans more on
science and technology than on
communism. The Soviet Union
is not a communist state —it is a
technocracy."
According to the Princeton
professor, the Soviets were for
tunate enough to have a solid
Czarist base on which to build
their own science. They took
good advantage of the existing
base during the pre-World War
II period and built the Soviet
Union into the center of all
mathematics study.
Immediately after the war,
scientists in certain fields, nota
bly biology and genetics, were
severely hampered in their work
if their theories did not conform
to Marxist doctrine.
New Freedom
With Stalin's death however,
a new freedom of scientific in

quiry was instituted. This in
cluded expanded scientific con
tact with the West and increased
efforts at translation and distri
bution of scientific papers.
Turkevich warned that Soviet
scientists have had in the past
"an uncanny way of determin
ing what's going to happen in
their fields." He cited as an ex
ample early Soviet research in
areas such as solid state physics,
cryogenics, nuclear physics, and
rocket development which are
all now vital parts of modern
technology.
Turkevich concluded his talk
with the assertion that Russian
science has "replaced Marxist
doctrine as the weapon of So
viet leadership for world domi
nation and as the hope of the
Russian people for a happy life
of the nation.
Russian Law
Russian law of the past fifty
years was discussed by John
Hazard of Columbia University.
Hazard traced its development
to two crucial areas: property
and inheritance law, and crimi
nal law. He stated that immedi
ately after the revolution the
courts of law adopted and ad
ministered with "professional
ism" the doctrine of "analogy".
This doctrine holds that in Haz
ard's words "the courts began
to emphasize the factor of
'guilt' ".
According to Hazard this guilt
was measured as a factor of the
degree of danger to community.
The doctrine was expanded in
the Stalinist purges as an ex
cuse to deny people their funda
mental rights. Hazard stated
that since the Stalinist period,
civil procedure has been re
formed so as to include the
right to a counsel well before
judicial proceedings start.
Property procedure has also
been greatly reformed. Now,
says Hazard, "He who earns
may spend, and pass to his heirs
or his friends, but he may not
enjoy his property to gain a re
turn on his investment."
Soviet Diplomacy Changes
Ivo Lederer, Stanford profes
sor of history, continued the con
ference by discussing "Soviet
Diplomacy, Continuity and
Change." He feels a limited de
tente presently governs U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Soviet foreign policy, says
Lederer, does and usually has
given highest priority to defense
of the Soviet system at home
and in Europe.
Present trends are greatly in
fluenced by China and other
problems within the Communist
block. These trends include the
development of an "alliance"
rather than a strict Soviet dic
tatorship in Eastern Europe and
the "remarkable" absence of di
rect Soviet involvement in Viet
nam.

Lederer traces Soviet diplo
macy through several stages. Im
mediately following the Bolshe
vik revolution, the Soviets were
almost exclusively concerned
with protecting the gains of the
revolution. They faced other
states with traditional suspicion,
although they felt that revolu
tion would soon occur in these
countries.
Domestic problems and the ab
sence of revolution elsewhere
spawned a more realistic policy
in which the Russians tried to
fulfill their revolutionary aims
by directly supporting Commu
nist parties in other countries.
The 1930 Munich diplomatic
"quarantine" of Russia re-con
firmed Soviet suspicion of the
West and allowed the USSR to
scrupulously proceed regarding
previous agreements. Treaties
with Hitler later brought Mos
cow back into the political are
na.
The Soviets, who profited from
World War II victory and post
war confusion in Europe, sought
to establish influence in all
states surrounding Russia. Fail
ure to participate in the Marshall
Plan, Lederer says, is Russia's
"grossest error in post-War
years."
Advancement and Frustration
He characterizes the last two
decades with technological ad
vancement but frustration of
many diplomatic and political
aims. Global conquest, exempli
fied by the Cuban missile at
tempt, has been tempered. Leder
er notes, however, that Com
munist doctrine can never sanc
tify the peaceful co-existence of
opposing ideologies.
Lederer concludes that apart
from the basic aims of Soviet
survival and leadership of the
Communist block Russia's
course for the future is unclear.
