# Hoover Institution

### 
Is an Institute unscholarly if it holds a right
wing bias?
The obvious answer is no. However, if that
right-wing or even left-wing bias leads to ac
tive political affiliation and narrowly, defined
goals for research and publications, then it does
become unscholarly.
The Hoover Institution is at once the pride
and scandal of Stanford. The library resources
on war, revolution, and peace are among the
finest in the world. Scholars who visit the
Hoover receive great cooperation in their re
search. The conference now going on is a
broadly-based and scholarly gathering of the
highest rank.
However, the internal workings and most re
search of the Institution are colored by a closed
mindedness which can hardly be considered
scholarly.
It would be permissable for an independent
institution to have any goals it wished. But for
two reasons, fighting communism is improper
as a goal for the Hoover.
The obligation for the Institution to be open
minded, scholarly, and non-political arises from
its staggering stockpile of vital documents and
from its affiliation with Stanford.
First there is a heavy responsibility to em
ploy the documents for objective research. Sec
ond Hoover's affiliation with Stanford calls for
it to be at least as scholarly as the rest of the
University. The tax-exempt status requires it to
be non-political.
As the Hoover has grown from preeminence
as a library to become a major center for re
search and publication, its right-wing political
activities have become more apparent.

The statements of the director and the atti
tudes of the staff can hardly be considered open
minded. The pattern of appointments to the
staff of Hoover, the publication of some works
and the rejection of others, and the narrow
viewpoint expressed in some research projects
clearly indicates the tenor and spirit of the
Institution.
It seems ridiculous to suggest that the un
scholarly definition Herbert Hoover gave to
the Institution should continue to dominate
its operatioon. However, the director has con
curred with that definition and has built upon
it.
We would recommend drastic changes in the
operation of the Hoover Institution. The fun
damental change must take place in its rela
tion to the University.
If proper controls were established, no direc
tor or founder would be able to create an in
stitution in his own image. The Stanford Trus
tees Resolution of 1959, granting Hoover its
near autonomy, must be altered to give the
faculty and the administration of the Univer
sity and the rest of the staff at Hoover some
voice in what goes on there.
The appointment of the director now reverts
solely to the President and the Trustees after
the death of Mr. Hoover. The appointment of
the staff, however, still remains in the hands of
the director. These must be made by a broader
group, including the University faculty.
Finally the University and maybe the Inter
nal Revenue Service ought to give a close look
at the tax-exempt status which the Institution
enjoys as a part of Stanford. We have difficulty
viewing the Hoover Institution as non-political.

group, including the University faculty.
Finally the University and maybe the Inter
nal Revenue Service ought to give a close look
at the tax-exempt status which the Institution
enjoys as a part of Stanford. We have difficulty
viewing the Hoover Institution as non-political.
Is an Institute unscholarly if it holds a right
wing bias?
The obvious answer is no. However, if that
right-wing or even left-wing bias leads to ac
tive political affiliation and narrowly, defined
goals for research and publications, then it does
become unscholarly.
The Hoover Institution is at once the pride
and scandal of Stanford. The library resources
on war, revolution, and peace are among the
finest in the world. Scholars who visit the
Hoover receive great cooperation in their re
search. The conference now going on is a
broadly-based and scholarly gathering of the
highest rank.
However, the internal workings and most re
search of the Institution are colored by a closed
mindedness which can hardly be considered
scholarly.
It would be permissable for an independent
institution to have any goals it wished. But for
two reasons, fighting communism is improper
as a goal for the Hoover.
The obligation for the Institution to be open
minded, scholarly, and non-political arises from
its staggering stockpile of vital documents and
from its affiliation with Stanford.
First there is a heavy responsibility to em
ploy the documents for objective research. Sec
ond Hoover's affiliation with Stanford calls for
it to be at least as scholarly as the rest of the
University. The tax-exempt status requires it to
be non-political.
As the Hoover has grown from preeminence
as a library to become a major center for re
search and publication, its right-wing political
activities have become more apparent.

The statements of the director and the atti
tudes of the staff can hardly be considered open
minded. The pattern of appointments to the
staff of Hoover, the publication of some works
and the rejection of others, and the narrow
viewpoint expressed in some research projects
clearly indicates the tenor and spirit of the
Institution.
It seems ridiculous to suggest that the un
scholarly definition Herbert Hoover gave to
the Institution should continue to dominate
its operatioon. However, the director has con
curred with that definition and has built upon
it.
We would recommend drastic changes in the
operation of the Hoover Institution. The fun
damental change must take place in its rela
tion to the University.
If proper controls were established, no direc
tor or founder would be able to create an in
stitution in his own image. The Stanford Trus
tees Resolution of 1959, granting Hoover its
near autonomy, must be altered to give the
faculty and the administration of the Univer
sity and the rest of the staff at Hoover some
voice in what goes on there.
The appointment of the director now reverts
solely to the President and the Trustees after
the death of Mr. Hoover. The appointment of
the staff, however, still remains in the hands of
the director. These must be made by a broader
group, including the University faculty.
