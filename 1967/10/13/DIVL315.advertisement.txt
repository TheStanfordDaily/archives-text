And Avco Everett's that sort of laboratory ... a laboratory that doesn't
have a mold ... a laboratory run by research scientists. The type of
people we are looking for are Ph.D.s who like the academic life . . .
its freedom, its pace, its vast research facilities and its interchanges
with the foremost scientists in the country. Avco Everett is looking for
the man who appreciates those benefits, but who also wants all the
personal advantages of working for a private firm. That sort of man
will be happy working with Avco Everett, and Avco Everett will be
happy working with him.
Interested? Our investigations range from high temperature gas
dynamics, plasma dynamics, aerophysics, atomic physics, reentry
physics, magnetohydrodynamics to low temperature physics including
superconductivity. If you're in any one of these fields, write Mr.
Louis Rudzinsky, Industrial Relations Director. He'll be glad to send
you bibliographies and abstracts of our recent publications. Then
you'll have a better basis to judge us. We think you' II see what
