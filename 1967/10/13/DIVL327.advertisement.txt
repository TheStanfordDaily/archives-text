Campus-Cut to
Campus Fashion.
Solids! Checks! Plaids! They are Jaymar's way of giving you that
unmistakable look of traditional fashion. Because each group of
Jaymar Slacks is color-cued to coordinate with your favorite
blazer, shirt or sweater. What's more, with every Jaymar Slack you
get features like Ban-Rol®, to keep your waistband from curling.
So tomorrow, instead of looking at one pair of brown slacks to
match your bla«er, look at a pair of brown plaids and a brown
check, as well. Try two . . . you'll be glad to buy two! And you'll
look twice as good, to boot! Slim into a pair of pairs today!
