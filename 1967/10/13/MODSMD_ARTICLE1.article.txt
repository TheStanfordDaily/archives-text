individual and unofficial support
of the 46 faculty and staff mem
bers who called for massive,

Vietnam.
Support For Resistance
'They are expected to give
their support as individuals to
the Resistance, to state that they

meeting in Cubberley that 100 -
200 persons will participate. He
said that 60 persons are prepar
ed to sit-in and possibly be ar
rested in waves of 20.

Rick Bogard, speaking for
Stop the Draft Week at last
night's meeting emphasized that
the demonstrations were to be
strictly non-violent, but that an
individual might defend himself
if he were attacked. "We are not
committed to violence, but we

are not committed to non-vio

Participants in Tuesday's dem
onstration will spend the night
in the Fruitvale United Church
of Christ in Oakland and arrive
at the Induction center at 4:30
a.m., the object being to get in
behind the police before they set
up a cordon.
Participants will attempt to
block the way of busses and in
ductees. They will point out to
the inductees that if they are
willing to walk over bodies in
Vietnam, they must also be will
ing to walk over bodies to reach
the induction center.
The briefing for local partici
pants in the demonstrations was
called by Leonard Seigel, chair
man of the Stanford Anti-Draft
Union. It included information
about arrest, jail conditions, and
bail arrangements. Participants
were urged to hold off on getting
bail for as long as possible and
to fill up the Oakland jails.

The Stop the Draft Week Com

Rick Bogard, speaking for
Stop the Draft Week at last
night's meeting emphasized that
the demonstrations were to be
strictly non-violent, but that an
individual might defend himself
if he were attacked. "We are not
committed to violence, but we

are not committed to non-vio
lence," he said.
Participants in Tuesday's dem

of Christ in Oakland and arrive
at the Induction center at 4:30
a.m., the object being to get in
behind the police before they set

willing to walk over bodies in
Vietnam, they must also be will
ing to walk over bodies to reach
the induction center.
The briefing for local partici
pants in the demonstrations was

man of the Stanford Anti-Draft
Union. It included information

bail arrangements. Participants
were urged to hold off on getting
bail for as long as possible and
to fill up the Oakland jails.

should protect themselves from
dogs, tear gas, hoses, herding by
cars, and right wing extremists.
The Resistance will hold a
noon rally today in White Plaza
to discuss plans for Monday's
nation-wide anti-draft activities.
Eighteen members of the Stan
ford community have either al
ready turned in their draft cards
or will do so on Monday.
Speakers at today's rally will
include Dean Napier; Dennis
Sweeney, a former Stanford stu
dent who recently spoke with
the Viet Cong in Prague; and
Mark Silverman, campus repre
sentative of the Resistance.
Stanford students will also
commit acts of civil disobedience
by sitting in at the Oakland In
