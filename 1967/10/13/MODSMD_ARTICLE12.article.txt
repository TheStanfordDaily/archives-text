# Prepare For Europe
## 
### 
Stanford's Overseas Campus program is the
most extensive of any American university. More
than 60 per cent of undergraduates go over
seas to study.
More than 800 students board chartered
planes each year to begin their six-month over
seas experience. Many of them could never
have gone any other way, because of the draft
or financial problems.
The Stanford program is a mass program de
signed to let the maximum number of students
study in Europe. It is not an intense study pro
gram to give each student the maximum under
standing of the language and culture of the
host country.
Often this understanding comes despite the
Stanford program. More often, it never comes
at all. A very large number of students return
from overseas totally untouched by the ex
perience.
What happens overseas is left entirely to
each student. But too often he is unprepared.
He has no knowledge of the country where he
will study. He knows only a few phrases of the
language and goes skeptical of an unfamiliar
group.

The paternal attitude of the Overseas Campus
office has in the past caused students to give
up all individual responsibilities for making the
experience valuable.
Disciplined study before going overseas and
after getting there is necessary to make the most
of the experience. If students feel they are go
ing to be provided for and ttubjected to the
overseas experience, they will see no need for
personal effort.
Liberalizing social regulations and moving the
Austrian campus from Semmering to Vienna
are evidence of a changing attitude in the
Overseas Campus Office.
Students now have more freedom to pursue
their diverse interests. In Austria they can now
get involved in a much wider range of activities
offered by the capital city. Curriculum reform
is also vitally important.
A different image of the program must be
broadcasted to the students now applying and
preparing to go overseas. Preparatory courses
might be strongly recommended or pre-depar
ture exams required. Overseas the social regu
lations and curriculum requirements shoijjd be
as free as possible, to allow independent work
and involvement with the host country.
