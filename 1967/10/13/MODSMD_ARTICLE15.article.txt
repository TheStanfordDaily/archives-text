# Two Minutes of Haight
## The 						Haves And The Have-nots 
### Tim Haight 
President Johnson thinks he is
making an heroic stand in Viet
nam. He is sincere in this. No
liar, no matter how devious,
could defend his policies on one
hand and speak of man's "fight
ing like animals" on the other
unless he had a special faith in
the justice of this war.
Johnson is, in a way, quite
the heroic figure. Facing an in
credible entanglement abroad
and diminishing support at
home, watching old supporters
desert him and the polls reflect
more and more disfavor, he
stands firm, Horatius at the
bridge. "Though his heart be
torn and streaming like a flag
of battle, it must be onward to
the end."
And like so many heroic fig
ures, he is tragic. He is tragic
because he is obsessed. He is a
powerful figure, yet he is in
chains—chains of myth. We
cannot ridicule him; his position
is too archetypal. But we can
free ourselves from the same
chains and attempt to free our
country.
Rattled Chain
WTiat are these chains of
myth? There are so many. Per
haps the one most often noticed
is the fear of the "International
Communist Conspiracy." But
this chain has been rattled so
often that doing so here again
would only summon the old
ghosts of predisposition. Per
haps less obivous and more im
portant is the myth of the haves
and the have-nots.
The myth goes like this: Most
wars are the results of some
body who does not have some
thing trying to take it from
somebody who has it. The starv
ing man (or, more fashionably,
the just-better-than-starving man
with "rising expectations") will
go to war to take from the over
weight man.
The corollary of this myth is
that if everybody were over
weight—if each country could be
brought through its "stages of
economic growth" — then there
would be no more reason to
fight. Put another way, when
China develops some more she
will have something to lose and
will therefore abandon her rev
olutionary aspirations.
We Are The Haves
This myth is very strong.
Somehow it is "common sense."
But the real reason for its prev
alance in our folklore may sim
ply be because we are the haves.

It gives us a beautiful ration
alization for war—since every
war becomes the prevention of
war—but it may not reflect real
ity at all.
Look at history. Have not the
most culturally advanced coun
tries always been the most war
like? The Egyptian cradle of
Civilization fostered an empire.
The Greeks were mighty war
riors. Alexander was educated
by Aristotle.
The next great civilization was
the Roman. Again, the highest
civilization of the time sent its
legions to conquer the world.
But perhaps the greatest exam
ples come after the Renaissance,
with the voyages of discovery
and the slave trade.
The Sun, Rain, and Moon
Although the New World and
Black Africa might have seemed
to the Europeans as the moon
seems to us, there was a differ
ence.
Unlike the moon, Africa and
America were already inhabited.
True, these inhabitants did not
have the level of civilization of
the conquerors. They did not
have the blessings of technology
and religion that had allowed
the bastions of Western Culture,
Christianity and Islam, to cru
sade against each other.
But, to paraphrase St. Mat
thew, the sun rose on them and
the rain fell on them pretty
much the way it did on the Con
querors. The aborigines were
human. This, however, did not
stop the haves of that epoch.
They went on planting flags and
making speeches about how this
real estate the savages thought
they had owned now belonged
to some European king.
Plug In People
And, worse, they began to
treat these people like commodi
ties. They could be stacked like
pieces of machinery and shipped
to factories — plantations —
where they would be plugged in
to a starvation diet and run, if
properly oiled with the whip.
In Huckleberry Finn, Jim, the
slave, runs away. Huck thinks
Jim must be worried, not hav
ing anything and running away,
but Jim replies that as a slave
he cost $800, so he's got $800 in
having himself.
All you've got to be to be a
have, it seems, is a potential
servant or the occupant of a
piece of real estate. That will
be enough to attract the interest
of some more Civilized guy who

has better weapons, religion, and
the gall to call your subjagation
"Manifest Destiny." For what
were the Indian reservations
but strategic hamlets?
Today, while we are busy
keeping the have-nots from be
ing warlike, our six per cent of
the world's population owns six
ty per cent of the world's wealth.
We have troops in dozens of
countries. We are bombing and
napalming poor peasants be
cause of a fight we really have
with another have, another coun
try with a religion, a technology,
and an idea of "Manifest Des
tiny."
Buying Time
Yet here we stand, firm in the
belief that if we buy time
through war, economic develop
ment will bring peace.
But how can this be? Consid
er on final example. What
country has started two world
wars in this century, has burned
and gassed millions and killed
untold millions more?
None other than the country
of Kant, of Beethoven, of Bach,

Handel, Wagner, Nietsche, Marx,
Engels, Luther, Humboldt,
Schoenberg, Heine, and so many
more. None other than a coun
try with one of the higher rela
tive standards of living (espe
cially before the wars). None
other than a country with a sci
ence and technology so great
that when she lost the war the
victors scuffled for her talent.
Who then makes war, if not
the have-nots? The haves? But
that's impossible! We're the
haves! And we are the guardians
of the world.

chains and attempt to free our
country.
Rattled Chain
WTiat are these chains of
myth? There are so many. Per
haps the one most often noticed
is the fear of the "International
Communist Conspiracy." But
this chain has been rattled so
often that doing so here again
would only summon the old
ghosts of predisposition. Per
haps less obivous and more im
portant is the myth of the haves
and the have-nots.
The myth goes like this: Most
wars are the results of some
body who does not have some
thing trying to take it from
somebody who has it. The starv
ing man (or, more fashionably,
the just-better-than-starving man
with "rising expectations") will
go to war to take from the over
weight man.
The corollary of this myth is
that if everybody were over
weight—if each country could be
brought through its "stages of
economic growth" — then there
would be no more reason to
fight. Put another way, when
China develops some more she
will have something to lose and
will therefore abandon her rev
olutionary aspirations.
We Are The Haves
This myth is very strong.
Somehow it is "common sense."
But the real reason for its prev
alance in our folklore may sim
ply be because we are the haves.

It gives us a beautiful ration
alization for war—since every
war becomes the prevention of
war—but it may not reflect real
ity at all.
Look at history. Have not the
most culturally advanced coun
tries always been the most war
like? The Egyptian cradle of
Civilization fostered an empire.
The Greeks were mighty war
riors. Alexander was educated
by Aristotle.
The next great civilization was
the Roman. Again, the highest
civilization of the time sent its
legions to conquer the world.
But perhaps the greatest exam
ples come after the Renaissance,
with the voyages of discovery
and the slave trade.
The Sun, Rain, and Moon
Although the New World and
Black Africa might have seemed
to the Europeans as the moon
seems to us, there was a differ
ence.
Unlike the moon, Africa and
America were already inhabited.
True, these inhabitants did not
have the level of civilization of
the conquerors. They did not
have the blessings of technology
and religion that had allowed
the bastions of Western Culture,
Christianity and Islam, to cru
sade against each other.
But, to paraphrase St. Mat
thew, the sun rose on them and
the rain fell on them pretty
much the way it did on the Con
querors. The aborigines were
human. This, however, did not
stop the haves of that epoch.
They went on planting flags and
making speeches about how this
real estate the savages thought
they had owned now belonged
to some European king.
Plug In People
And, worse, they began to
treat these people like commodi
ties. They could be stacked like
pieces of machinery and shipped
to factories — plantations —
where they would be plugged in
to a starvation diet and run, if
properly oiled with the whip.
In Huckleberry Finn, Jim, the
slave, runs away. Huck thinks
Jim must be worried, not hav
ing anything and running away,
but Jim replies that as a slave
he cost $800, so he's got $800 in
having himself.
All you've got to be to be a
have, it seems, is a potential
servant or the occupant of a
piece of real estate. That will
be enough to attract the interest
of some more Civilized guy who

has better weapons, religion, and
the gall to call your subjagation
"Manifest Destiny." For what
were the Indian reservations
but strategic hamlets?
Today, while we are busy
keeping the have-nots from be
ing warlike, our six per cent of
the world's population owns six
ty per cent of the world's wealth.
We have troops in dozens of
countries. We are bombing and
napalming poor peasants be
cause of a fight we really have
with another have, another coun
try with a religion, a technology,
and an idea of "Manifest Des
tiny."
Buying Time
Yet here we stand, firm in the
belief that if we buy time
through war, economic develop
ment will bring peace.
But how can this be? Consid
er on final example. What
country has started two world
wars in this century, has burned
and gassed millions and killed
untold millions more?
None other than the country
of Kant, of Beethoven, of Bach,

Handel, Wagner, Nietsche, Marx,
Engels, Luther, Humboldt,
Schoenberg, Heine, and so many
more. None other than a coun
try with one of the higher rela
tive standards of living (espe
cially before the wars). None
other than a country with a sci
ence and technology so great
that when she lost the war the
victors scuffled for her talent.
Who then makes war, if not
the have-nots? The haves? But
that's impossible! We're the
haves! And we are the guardians
of the world.
President Johnson thinks he is
making an heroic stand in Viet
nam. He is sincere in this. No
liar, no matter how devious,
could defend his policies on one
hand and speak of man's "fight
ing like animals" on the other
unless he had a special faith in
the justice of this war.
Johnson is, in a way, quite
the heroic figure. Facing an in
credible entanglement abroad
and diminishing support at
home, watching old supporters
desert him and the polls reflect
more and more disfavor, he
stands firm, Horatius at the
bridge. "Though his heart be
torn and streaming like a flag
of battle, it must be onward to
the end."
And like so many heroic fig
ures, he is tragic. He is tragic
because he is obsessed. He is a
powerful figure, yet he is in
chains—chains of myth. We
cannot ridicule him; his position
is too archetypal. But we can

We Are The Haves
This myth is very strong.
Somehow it is "common sense."
But the real reason for its prev
alance in our folklore may sim
ply be because we are the haves.

It gives us a beautiful ration
alization for war—since every
war becomes the prevention of
war—but it may not reflect real
ity at all.
Look at history. Have not the
most culturally advanced coun
tries always been the most war
like? The Egyptian cradle of
Civilization fostered an empire.
The Greeks were mighty war
riors. Alexander was educated
by Aristotle.
The next great civilization was
the Roman. Again, the highest
civilization of the time sent its
legions to conquer the world.
But perhaps the greatest exam
ples come after the Renaissance,
with the voyages of discovery
and the slave trade.
The Sun, Rain, and Moon
Although the New World and
Black Africa might have seemed
to the Europeans as the moon
seems to us, there was a differ
ence.
Unlike the moon, Africa and
America were already inhabited.
True, these inhabitants did not
have the level of civilization of
the conquerors. They did not
have the blessings of technology
and religion that had allowed
the bastions of Western Culture,
Christianity and Islam, to cru
sade against each other.
But, to paraphrase St. Mat
thew, the sun rose on them and
the rain fell on them pretty
much the way it did on the Con
querors. The aborigines were
human. This, however, did not
stop the haves of that epoch.
They went on planting flags and
making speeches about how this
real estate the savages thought
they had owned now belonged
to some European king.
Plug In People
And, worse, they began to
treat these people like commodi
ties. They could be stacked like
pieces of machinery and shipped
to factories — plantations —
where they would be plugged in
to a starvation diet and run, if
properly oiled with the whip.
In Huckleberry Finn, Jim, the
slave, runs away. Huck thinks
Jim must be worried, not hav
ing anything and running away,
but Jim replies that as a slave
he cost $800, so he's got $800 in
having himself.
All you've got to be to be a
have, it seems, is a potential
servant or the occupant of a
piece of real estate. That will
be enough to attract the interest
of some more Civilized guy who

has better weapons, religion, and
the gall to call your subjagation
"Manifest Destiny." For what
were the Indian reservations
but strategic hamlets?
Today, while we are busy
keeping the have-nots from be
ing warlike, our six per cent of
the world's population owns six
ty per cent of the world's wealth.
We have troops in dozens of
countries. We are bombing and
napalming poor peasants be
cause of a fight we really have
with another have, another coun
try with a religion, a technology,
and an idea of "Manifest Des
tiny."
Buying Time
Yet here we stand, firm in the
belief that if we buy time
through war, economic develop
ment will bring peace.
But how can this be? Consid
er on final example. What
country has started two world
wars in this century, has burned
and gassed millions and killed
untold millions more?
None other than the country
of Kant, of Beethoven, of Bach,

Handel, Wagner, Nietsche, Marx,
Engels, Luther, Humboldt,
Schoenberg, Heine, and so many
more. None other than a coun
try with one of the higher rela
tive standards of living (espe
cially before the wars). None
other than a country with a sci
ence and technology so great
that when she lost the war the
victors scuffled for her talent.
Who then makes war, if not
the have-nots? The haves? But
that's impossible! We're the
haves! And we are the guardians
of the world.
President Johnson thinks he is
making an heroic stand in Viet
nam. He is sincere in this. No
liar, no matter how devious,
could defend his policies on one
hand and speak of man's "fight
ing like animals" on the other
unless he had a special faith in
the justice of this war.
Johnson is, in a way, quite
the heroic figure. Facing an in
credible entanglement abroad
and diminishing support at
home, watching old supporters
desert him and the polls reflect
more and more disfavor, he
stands firm, Horatius at the
bridge. "Though his heart be
torn and streaming like a flag
of battle, it must be onward to
the end."
And like so many heroic fig
ures, he is tragic. He is tragic
because he is obsessed. He is a
powerful figure, yet he is in
chains—chains of myth. We
cannot ridicule him; his position
is too archetypal. But we can
free ourselves from the same
chains and attempt to free our
country.
Rattled Chain
WTiat are these chains of
myth? There are so many. Per
haps the one most often noticed
is the fear of the "International
Communist Conspiracy." But
this chain has been rattled so
often that doing so here again
would only summon the old
ghosts of predisposition. Per
haps less obivous and more im
portant is the myth of the haves
and the have-nots.
The myth goes like this: Most
wars are the results of some
body who does not have some
thing trying to take it from
somebody who has it. The starv
ing man (or, more fashionably,
the just-better-than-starving man
with "rising expectations") will
go to war to take from the over
weight man.
The corollary of this myth is
that if everybody were over
weight—if each country could be
brought through its "stages of
economic growth" — then there
would be no more reason to
fight. Put another way, when
China develops some more she
will have something to lose and
will therefore abandon her rev
olutionary aspirations.

to the Europeans as the moon
seems to us, there was a differ
ence.
Unlike the moon, Africa and
America were already inhabited.
True, these inhabitants did not
have the level of civilization of
the conquerors. They did not
have the blessings of technology
and religion that had allowed
the bastions of Western Culture,
Christianity and Islam, to cru
sade against each other.
But, to paraphrase St. Mat
thew, the sun rose on them and
the rain fell on them pretty
much the way it did on the Con
querors. The aborigines were
human. This, however, did not
stop the haves of that epoch.
They went on planting flags and
making speeches about how this
real estate the savages thought
they had owned now belonged
to some European king.
Plug In People
And, worse, they began to
treat these people like commodi
ties. They could be stacked like
pieces of machinery and shipped
to factories — plantations —
where they would be plugged in
to a starvation diet and run, if
properly oiled with the whip.
In Huckleberry Finn, Jim, the
slave, runs away. Huck thinks
Jim must be worried, not hav
ing anything and running away,
but Jim replies that as a slave
he cost $800, so he's got $800 in
having himself.
All you've got to be to be a
have, it seems, is a potential
servant or the occupant of a
piece of real estate. That will
be enough to attract the interest
of some more Civilized guy who

has better weapons, religion, and
the gall to call your subjagation
"Manifest Destiny." For what
were the Indian reservations
but strategic hamlets?
Today, while we are busy
keeping the have-nots from be
ing warlike, our six per cent of
the world's population owns six
ty per cent of the world's wealth.
We have troops in dozens of
countries. We are bombing and
napalming poor peasants be
cause of a fight we really have
with another have, another coun
try with a religion, a technology,
and an idea of "Manifest Des
tiny."
Buying Time
Yet here we stand, firm in the
belief that if we buy time
through war, economic develop
ment will bring peace.
But how can this be? Consid
er on final example. What
country has started two world
wars in this century, has burned
and gassed millions and killed
untold millions more?
None other than the country
of Kant, of Beethoven, of Bach,

Handel, Wagner, Nietsche, Marx,
Engels, Luther, Humboldt,
Schoenberg, Heine, and so many
more. None other than a coun
try with one of the higher rela
tive standards of living (espe
cially before the wars). None
other than a country with a sci
ence and technology so great
that when she lost the war the
victors scuffled for her talent.
Who then makes war, if not
the have-nots? The haves? But
that's impossible! We're the
haves! And we are the guardians
of the world.
