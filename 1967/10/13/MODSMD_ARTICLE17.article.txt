# Cougars Try Razzle-Dazzle
## Tribe Seeks First Pac-8 Win 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Both the Indians and the
Washington State Cougars will
be seeking their first conference
win of the 1967 season when
they face each other at Stanford
Stadium at 2:05 Saturday after
noon.
" Hoping to bounce back from
the shellacking suffered at the
hands of USC last weekend,
Coach Ralston has planned a
little juggling of his starting
lineup.
Tom Massey will start at safe
ty in place of Bob Rinker in an
attempt to tighten the Cards
pass defense.
Pat Preston will again see
duty at linebacker. Preston, who
subbed for the injured Andy Car
rigan, has done such a fine job
that Coach Ralston has decided
to keep him in.
«■ Ralston is still undecided on
„ the flanker position. Either Gene
Washington or Bill Shoemaker
will see action at that spot.
Surprise!
Surprise will be the keynote
in the Cougar offense. The WSU
squad uses a formation alterna
tely called the Veer-T and the
Cougar Veer.
Washington State coach Bill
Clark says the offense is basical
ly the same as the old Oklahoma
split-T.
The Cougars are troubled by
lack of size in their backfield;
and, as a result must rely on
their speed. The generally used
I-formation requires big backs
to move ahead of the ball car
rier to knock down the lineback
ers; WSU's inability to adequate
ly perform this type of play
has resulted in their new of
. fense.
Guess Who
The two running backs line
up close together near the quar
terback. As the ball is snapped
... the quarterback knows who
is going to carry it, if a running
play was called.
The quarterback is supposed
* 'to read the defense as the play
« unfolds. He either will hand
>* it to one of the running backs as
> they speed past him or will keep
■I it himself depending on where
> the holes are.
£ This explosive type of offense
'* is designed to make maximum
■* use of the Cougar fleetness and
'« agility. In their first four games
* WSU has lost by scores of 49-0
* (USC), 21-0 Oklahoma), 51-23
£ (UCLA), and 10-7 (Baylor).
Passing Expected
/- Despite this elaborate ground
'offense Coach Ralston has said

that he expects Washington
State to concentrate on a pass
ing attack.
Cougar quarterback Jerry
Henderson was the leading pas
ser in the PAC-8 last year, throw
ing for nearly 1,000 yards. Five
interceptions in his last game,
however, have caused some
doubt as to whether he or sec
ond-string quarterback Hank
Grenda will start.
Starting at split-end for the
Cougars will be Doug Flansburg,
leading pass-receiver in the con
ference last year, and fifth in
the standings for the current
season.
Light Backs
Other probable backfield start
ers for the Cougars are Mark
Williams at halfback (s'B", 170
lb.), who runs a 9.7 hundred and
flankerback Johnny Davis (5'10",
170 lb.), wha has also turned in
a 9.7 hundred arid who led the
JC team from Henderson, Texas
to the Little Rose Bowl last year.
Fullback will be hard-hitting Del
Charmichael, who is also a fa
vorite target for WSU aerials.
Kirtnian OK
The Indians have been hamp
ered by injuries this year, and
Don Swartz and Greg Broughton
are doubtful starters at center
and fullback for Saturday.
Fortunately for the Cards,
though, Nate Kirtman who was
forced to sit out the second half
of the USC game with a slight
concussion is expected to resume
his duties against Washington
State.
Despite missing the last 30
minutes of play down at the
Coliseum, Kirtman's 346 net

yards gained for the season
places him third in the confer
ence and makes him the six
teenth leading rusher in the
country.

Fortunately for the Cards,
though, Nate Kirtman who was
forced to sit out the second half
of the USC game with a slight
concussion is expected to resume
his duties against Washington
State.
Despite missing the last 30
minutes of play down at the
Coliseum, Kirtman's 346 net

yards gained for the season
places him third in the confer
ence and makes him the six
teenth leading rusher in the
country.

BREAKING THE TACKLE: Stanford halfback Howard Williams (30) carries a USC tackier during
the football game last Saturday night. Williams had to come into the game after Nate Kirtman suf
fered a concussion. Kirtman, however, will be able to play this Saturday against Washington State.
Both the Indians and the
Washington State Cougars will
be seeking their first conference
win of the 1967 season when
they face each other at Stanford
Stadium at 2:05 Saturday after
noon.
" Hoping to bounce back from
the shellacking suffered at the
hands of USC last weekend,
Coach Ralston has planned a
little juggling of his starting
lineup.
Tom Massey will start at safe
ty in place of Bob Rinker in an
attempt to tighten the Cards
pass defense.
Pat Preston will again see
duty at linebacker. Preston, who
subbed for the injured Andy Car
rigan, has done such a fine job
that Coach Ralston has decided
to keep him in.
«■ Ralston is still undecided on
„ the flanker position. Either Gene
Washington or Bill Shoemaker
will see action at that spot.
Surprise!
Surprise will be the keynote
in the Cougar offense. The WSU
squad uses a formation alterna
tely called the Veer-T and the
Cougar Veer.
Washington State coach Bill
Clark says the offense is basical
ly the same as the old Oklahoma
split-T.
The Cougars are troubled by
lack of size in their backfield;
and, as a result must rely on
their speed. The generally used
I-formation requires big backs
to move ahead of the ball car
rier to knock down the lineback
ers; WSU's inability to adequate
ly perform this type of play
has resulted in their new of
. fense.
Guess Who
The two running backs line
up close together near the quar
terback. As the ball is snapped
... the quarterback knows who
is going to carry it, if a running
play was called.
The quarterback is supposed
* 'to read the defense as the play
« unfolds. He either will hand
>* it to one of the running backs as
> they speed past him or will keep
■I it himself depending on where
> the holes are.
£ This explosive type of offense
'* is designed to make maximum
■* use of the Cougar fleetness and
'« agility. In their first four games
* WSU has lost by scores of 49-0
* (USC), 21-0 Oklahoma), 51-23
£ (UCLA), and 10-7 (Baylor).
Passing Expected
/- Despite this elaborate ground
'offense Coach Ralston has said

that he expects Washington
State to concentrate on a pass
ing attack.
Cougar quarterback Jerry
Henderson was the leading pas
ser in the PAC-8 last year, throw
ing for nearly 1,000 yards. Five
interceptions in his last game,
however, have caused some
doubt as to whether he or sec
ond-string quarterback Hank
Grenda will start.
Starting at split-end for the
Cougars will be Doug Flansburg,
leading pass-receiver in the con
ference last year, and fifth in
the standings for the current
season.
Light Backs
Other probable backfield start
ers for the Cougars are Mark
Williams at halfback (s'B", 170
lb.), who runs a 9.7 hundred and
flankerback Johnny Davis (5'10",
170 lb.), wha has also turned in
a 9.7 hundred arid who led the
JC team from Henderson, Texas
to the Little Rose Bowl last year.
Fullback will be hard-hitting Del
Charmichael, who is also a fa
vorite target for WSU aerials.
Kirtnian OK
The Indians have been hamp
ered by injuries this year, and
Don Swartz and Greg Broughton
are doubtful starters at center
and fullback for Saturday.

however, have caused some
doubt as to whether he or sec
ond-string quarterback Hank
Grenda will start.
Starting at split-end for the
Cougars will be Doug Flansburg,
leading pass-receiver in the con
ference last year, and fifth in
the standings for the current
season.
Light Backs
Other probable backfield start
ers for the Cougars are Mark
Williams at halfback (s'B", 170
lb.), who runs a 9.7 hundred and
flankerback Johnny Davis (5'10",
170 lb.), wha has also turned in
a 9.7 hundred arid who led the
JC team from Henderson, Texas
to the Little Rose Bowl last year.
Fullback will be hard-hitting Del
Charmichael, who is also a fa
vorite target for WSU aerials.
Kirtnian OK
The Indians have been hamp
ered by injuries this year, and
Don Swartz and Greg Broughton
are doubtful starters at center
and fullback for Saturday.
Fortunately for the Cards,
though, Nate Kirtman who was
forced to sit out the second half
of the USC game with a slight
concussion is expected to resume
his duties against Washington
State.
Despite missing the last 30
minutes of play down at the
Coliseum, Kirtman's 346 net

yards gained for the season
places him third in the confer
ence and makes him the six
teenth leading rusher in the
country.

SATURDAY DANCE: Still debating about going to the football
game this Saturday? The Stanford-WSU game features the annual
Band Day, when 35 to 40 high school bands and over 400 musicians
will play In the Stadium. Dancing to all the noise will be Prince

BREAKING THE TACKLE: Stanford halfback Howard Williams (30) carries a USC tackier during
the football game last Saturday night. Williams had to come into the game after Nate Kirtman suf
fered a concussion. Kirtman, however, will be able to play this Saturday against Washington State.
Both the Indians and the
Washington State Cougars will
be seeking their first conference
win of the 1967 season when
they face each other at Stanford
Stadium at 2:05 Saturday after
noon.
" Hoping to bounce back from
the shellacking suffered at the
hands of USC last weekend,
Coach Ralston has planned a
little juggling of his starting
lineup.
Tom Massey will start at safe
ty in place of Bob Rinker in an
attempt to tighten the Cards
pass defense.
Pat Preston will again see
duty at linebacker. Preston, who
subbed for the injured Andy Car
rigan, has done such a fine job
that Coach Ralston has decided
to keep him in.
«■ Ralston is still undecided on
„ the flanker position. Either Gene
Washington or Bill Shoemaker
will see action at that spot.
Surprise!
Surprise will be the keynote
in the Cougar offense. The WSU
squad uses a formation alterna
tely called the Veer-T and the
Cougar Veer.
Washington State coach Bill
Clark says the offense is basical
ly the same as the old Oklahoma
split-T.
The Cougars are troubled by
lack of size in their backfield;
and, as a result must rely on
their speed. The generally used
I-formation requires big backs
to move ahead of the ball car
rier to knock down the lineback
ers; WSU's inability to adequate
ly perform this type of play
has resulted in their new of
. fense.
Guess Who
The two running backs line
up close together near the quar
terback. As the ball is snapped
... the quarterback knows who
is going to carry it, if a running
play was called.
The quarterback is supposed
* 'to read the defense as the play
« unfolds. He either will hand
>* it to one of the running backs as
> they speed past him or will keep
■I it himself depending on where
> the holes are.
£ This explosive type of offense
'* is designed to make maximum
■* use of the Cougar fleetness and
'« agility. In their first four games
* WSU has lost by scores of 49-0
* (USC), 21-0 Oklahoma), 51-23
£ (UCLA), and 10-7 (Baylor).
Passing Expected
/- Despite this elaborate ground
'offense Coach Ralston has said

that he expects Washington
State to concentrate on a pass
ing attack.

Henderson was the leading pas
ser in the PAC-8 last year, throw
