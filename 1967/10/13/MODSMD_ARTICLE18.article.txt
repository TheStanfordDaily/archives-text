Stanford Athletic Director

despite a strike against ABC by
the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Tech

A four-man picket line ap
peared at Stanford Stadium yes

employees arriving to set up au

cross it.
The union said, however, that
it's intention was not to stop
the broadcast.
The cameras for the game will
be handled by "volunteer" ABC
executives.
