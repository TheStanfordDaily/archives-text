# Tresidder Lanes Sizzle Tonight
## Bowlers To Roll Santa Clara 
### J. Q. WRIGHT 
Stanford's men's and women's
bowling teams roll into action
tonight at 7 in the Tresidder
Union Games Area.
Santa Clara provides the op
position in the first Northern
California Intercollegiate Mas
ters League match of the sea
son.
During the past ten days,
junior Doug Pirnie of Theta Chi
earned the honor of acting team
captain by blasting out a 199
average in the nine-game rolloff
Coach Jack McKenna used to
determine tonight's starting line
up.
Masters' Second Year
The Masters League moves
into its second year of existence
this autumn with five teams,
one more than last year.
UC at Davis joins Santa Clara,
Chico State, UC at Berkeley, and
Stanford, the four teams who
comprised last year's league.
The Indians finished second
last season, five games behind
first-place UC at Berkeley.
Santa Clara finished fourth,
but were hard to beat on their
own lanes.

Behind Pirnie are two other
veterans, soph John Steele and
senior Bruce Everet.
Steele came through with a
great clutch performance dur
ing the three-game team block
of last year's regional tourna
ment at Santa Barbara.
The Sigma Chi pledge mowed
down 22 strikes, including, a cru
cial double in the final frame,
to roll up a 647 total on games
of 197-230-220.
4th In the U.S.
Stanford tied UCLA for the
regional team title and came
out fourth in the country based
on comparative scores.
In singles competition, Pirnie
rolled a 579 for fourth place, and
his 1700 all events total (189
average for nine games) barely
missed the top ten regional
scores.
Kimball Challenges
Another member of last year's
regional team for Stanford, grad
student Ralph Kimball of El
Toro, currently ranks eighth on
the team ladder.
Kimball will soon be chal
lenging the top five on the lad
der if a 236 game and 598 series

in this week's intramural com
petition is an indication that he
is back in form.
Brown To Bowl
Bill Brown, a grad student
who recently transferred from
the University of New Mexico
at Albuquerque, averaged 186 in
the nine-game rolloff to earn a
spot in tonight's lineup.
Kappa Sigma's Jeff Bonzon

accumulated a 177 average to
place fifth behind Pirnie, Brown,
Steele, and Everett.
John Wright and Chris Mar
tin stand sixth and seventh on
the ladder, with Wright acting
as alternate for the Santa Clara
match.
Mrs. Shirley Schoof's women's
team will also swing into action
tonight against Santa Clara.

Junior Sandy Boddum, who
qualified for the team with a
strong 155 nine-game average,
will be bowling leadoff, while
freshman Diane DePaolis holds
down the anchor position.
Rounding out the women's
lineup are soph Kathy Coolidge,
and seniors Nancy Norberg and
Liz Blackford.
