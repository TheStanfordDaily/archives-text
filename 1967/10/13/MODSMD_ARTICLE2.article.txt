# 92 Med Students Sign 'We Won't Go' Pledge
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
Sixteen Stanford medical stu
dents and interns have added
their names to last spring's "We
Won't Go" pledge, bringing the
total to 92.
Altogether there are some 350
medical students, interns and
residents across the country who
have pledged they will not serve
in the Armed Forces in Viet
nam.
According to one of the move
ment's organizers, letters have
just been sent out to 800 medi
cal students nationwide, asking
them to add their names to the
growing list.
The temptation not to sign
such a pledge is great, according
to second-year student Robert
Ilia.
"I was told by many not to
concern myself, not to get 'in
volved' he said. "After all, I had
it made. I am deferred as a med
ical student in a five-year medi
cal school, during which time
the war might very well
end. . .
Motives Vary
Why, then, did 350 students
and interns sign it? The reasons
vary greatly. At the mildly dis
approving end of the spectrum
is Dudley Kriegbaum.
He believes "our people should
stay in Vietnam—even in the
face of sabotage ... I would go
to Vietnam if I could heal civili
ans, without helping to main
tain the effectiveness of our
military effort."
Kenneth Rand, a fourth-year
student, protests on a more gen
eral principle. "I am opposed to
all wars which seek to effect po
litical settlements by military
force. War is morally indefensi
ble, except where the threat to
survival is clear.
Rand added, "I do not believe
that war in the name of peace

is a tenet upon which this coun
try was founded ... it was de
mocracy and self-determination
for all nations."
Total Rejection
Finally, some refuse to serve
out of complete rejection of war
fare. Ronald Rubin commented,
"I see war, all war, as irrational
and immoral."
Fred Burbank takes the stand
of the C.O. "I have signed the
Pledge of Non-Participation be

cause induction into the Armed
Forces is wholly incompatible
with my religious beliefs, he
said. I am a conscientious objec
tor to war. My ultimate com
mitment is to God as Love."
The full statement reads:
"In the name of freedom, the
United States is waging an un
justifiable war in Vietnam and
is causing incalculable suffering.
It is the goal of the medical
profession to prevent and relieve
human suffering. My effort to
pursue this goal is meaningless
in the context of the war.
"Therefore, I refuse to serve
in the Armed Forces in Vietnam.
So that I may exercise my pro
fession with conscience and dig
nity, I intend to seek means to
serve my country and humanity
which are compatible with the
preservation and enrichment of
life.
"(The signers of this state
ment are medical students who
do not necessarily hold in com
mon any political or religious
ideology.)"
Alternatives Exist
As the draft law now stands,
a physician need not serve in
the Armed Forces: several al
ternatives are available. For ex
ample, as an ordinary citizen he
can file as a conscientious ob
jector.
After his physical examina
tion, he may be classified IV-F
permanently for physical rea
sons or as I-Y on a temporarily.
The criteria for I-Y are still not
completely clear.
Because of his special train
ing, however, he is eligible for
two government programs in
place of military service. In the
Public Health Service, a doctor
receives a commission to work
in clinical medicine, preventive
