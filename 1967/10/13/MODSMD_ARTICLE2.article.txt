# 92 Med Students Sign 'We Won't Go' Pledge
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
Sixteen Stanford medical stu
dents and interns have added
their names to last spring's "We
Won't Go" pledge, bringing the
total to 92.
Altogether there are some 350
medical students, interns and
residents across the country who
have pledged they will not serve
in the Armed Forces in Viet
nam.
According to one of the move
ment's organizers, letters have
just been sent out to 800 medi
cal students nationwide, asking
them to add their names to the
growing list.
The temptation not to sign
such a pledge is great, according
to second-year student Robert
Ilia.
"I was told by many not to
concern myself, not to get 'in
volved' he said. "After all, I had
it made. I am deferred as a med
ical student in a five-year medi
cal school, during which time
the war might very well
end. . .
Motives Vary
Why, then, did 350 students
and interns sign it? The reasons
vary greatly. At the mildly dis
approving end of the spectrum
is Dudley Kriegbaum.
He believes "our people should
stay in Vietnam—even in the
face of sabotage ... I would go
to Vietnam if I could heal civili
ans, without helping to main
tain the effectiveness of our
military effort."
Kenneth Rand, a fourth-year
student, protests on a more gen
eral principle. "I am opposed to
all wars which seek to effect po
litical settlements by military
force. War is morally indefensi
ble, except where the threat to
survival is clear.
Rand added, "I do not believe
that war in the name of peace

is a tenet upon which this coun
try was founded ... it was de
mocracy and self-determination
for all nations."
Total Rejection
Finally, some refuse to serve
out of complete rejection of war
fare. Ronald Rubin commented,
"I see war, all war, as irrational
and immoral."
Fred Burbank takes the stand
of the C.O. "I have signed the
Pledge of Non-Participation be

cause induction into the Armed
Forces is wholly incompatible
with my religious beliefs, he
said. I am a conscientious objec
tor to war. My ultimate com
mitment is to God as Love."
The full statement reads:
"In the name of freedom, the
United States is waging an un
justifiable war in Vietnam and
is causing incalculable suffering.
It is the goal of the medical
profession to prevent and relieve
human suffering. My effort to
pursue this goal is meaningless
in the context of the war.
"Therefore, I refuse to serve
in the Armed Forces in Vietnam.
So that I may exercise my pro
fession with conscience and dig
nity, I intend to seek means to
serve my country and humanity
which are compatible with the
preservation and enrichment of
life.
"(The signers of this state
ment are medical students who
do not necessarily hold in com
mon any political or religious
ideology.)"
Alternatives Exist
As the draft law now stands,
a physician need not serve in
the Armed Forces: several al
ternatives are available. For ex
ample, as an ordinary citizen he
can file as a conscientious ob
jector.
After his physical examina
tion, he may be classified IV-F
permanently for physical rea
sons or as I-Y on a temporarily.
The criteria for I-Y are still not
completely clear.
Because of his special train
ing, however, he is eligible for
two government programs in
place of military service. In the
Public Health Service, a doctor
receives a commission to work
in clinical medicine, preventive

examinations as well as get a
security clearance.
However, there is a report
that the Administration will ask
Congress to abolish the PHS in
favor of a civilian health service
and to remove the military as
pect of the PHS. This means
doctors would no longer receive
commissions for serving civili
ans.
An official in the Department

of Health, Education and Wel
fare said he doubted the PHS
would accept students who
signed this petition. He stated
the PHS is under pressure from
higher government officials to
keep it from becoming a haven
for "draft dodgers".
Reactions to the pledge sign
ers has varied. The support of
the Stanford Medical School fac
ulty has been overwhelming.

The two faculty statements,
with a total of 84 signatures, dif
fer only in that one goes beyond
supporting the students and ex
presses the professors' position
on the Vietnamese conflict. Both
petitions include the following
remarks.
"We . . . wish to express our
support for a group of medical
students who have stated their
unwillingness to participate in
the war in Vietnam ... We in
tend to support them and their
position in whatever way be
comes necessary and appropri
ate."
11-s Or Not n-S?
The status of the students with
their draft boards is not cer
tain. Since medical students are
never drafted out of school, the
students still hold their 11-S de
ferments. Interns are usually
granted 11-A occupational defer
ment.
In three cases, however, in
terns who have signed the

pledge have been reclassified I-
A. In none of the cases, how
ever, has any connection been
shown between the signing and
the reclassification.
Dr. David Netboy, who had
been classified I-Y and then 111-
A upon the birth of a child, was
recently reclassified as I-A and
ordered to report for his physi
cal. In a show of solidarity
among the pledge signers, 20 to
30 other medical students dem
onstrated outside of the induc
tion center when the bus of in
ductees arrived.
Netboy printed up a leaflet for
the occasion, urging others to
refuse to serve and listing alter
natives. He was surprised at the
sympathetic response which he
received as he distributed copies
on the bus enroute to the center.
Some of his fellow inductees vol
unteered to distribute the litera
ture at the induction center.
Although a hostile group of
enlistees arrived shortly there
after, there were no incidents.

supporting the students and ex
presses the professors' position
on the Vietnamese conflict. Both
petitions include the following
remarks.
"We . . . wish to express our
support for a group of medical
students who have stated their
unwillingness to participate in
the war in Vietnam ... We in
tend to support them and their
position in whatever way be
comes necessary and appropri
ate."
11-s Or Not n-S?
The status of the students with
their draft boards is not cer
tain. Since medical students are
never drafted out of school, the
students still hold their 11-S de
ferments. Interns are usually
granted 11-A occupational defer
ment.
In three cases, however, in
terns who have signed the

pledge have been reclassified I-
A. In none of the cases, how
ever, has any connection been
shown between the signing and
the reclassification.
Dr. David Netboy, who had
been classified I-Y and then 111-
A upon the birth of a child, was
recently reclassified as I-A and
ordered to report for his physi
cal. In a show of solidarity
among the pledge signers, 20 to
30 other medical students dem
onstrated outside of the induc
tion center when the bus of in
ductees arrived.
Netboy printed up a leaflet for
the occasion, urging others to
refuse to serve and listing alter
natives. He was surprised at the
sympathetic response which he
received as he distributed copies
on the bus enroute to the center.
Some of his fellow inductees vol
unteered to distribute the litera
ture at the induction center.
Although a hostile group of
enlistees arrived shortly there
after, there were no incidents.
Sixteen Stanford medical stu
dents and interns have added
their names to last spring's "We
Won't Go" pledge, bringing the
total to 92.
Altogether there are some 350
medical students, interns and
residents across the country who
have pledged they will not serve
in the Armed Forces in Viet
nam.
According to one of the move
ment's organizers, letters have
just been sent out to 800 medi
cal students nationwide, asking
them to add their names to the
growing list.
The temptation not to sign
such a pledge is great, according
to second-year student Robert
Ilia.
"I was told by many not to
concern myself, not to get 'in
volved' he said. "After all, I had
it made. I am deferred as a med
ical student in a five-year medi
cal school, during which time
the war might very well
end. . .
Motives Vary
Why, then, did 350 students
and interns sign it? The reasons
vary greatly. At the mildly dis
approving end of the spectrum
is Dudley Kriegbaum.
He believes "our people should
stay in Vietnam—even in the
face of sabotage ... I would go
to Vietnam if I could heal civili
ans, without helping to main
tain the effectiveness of our
military effort."
Kenneth Rand, a fourth-year
student, protests on a more gen
eral principle. "I am opposed to
all wars which seek to effect po
litical settlements by military
force. War is morally indefensi
ble, except where the threat to
survival is clear.
Rand added, "I do not believe
that war in the name of peace

is a tenet upon which this coun
try was founded ... it was de
mocracy and self-determination
for all nations."
Total Rejection
Finally, some refuse to serve
out of complete rejection of war
fare. Ronald Rubin commented,
"I see war, all war, as irrational
and immoral."
Fred Burbank takes the stand
of the C.O. "I have signed the
Pledge of Non-Participation be

cause induction into the Armed
Forces is wholly incompatible
with my religious beliefs, he
said. I am a conscientious objec
tor to war. My ultimate com
mitment is to God as Love."
The full statement reads:
"In the name of freedom, the
United States is waging an un
justifiable war in Vietnam and
is causing incalculable suffering.
It is the goal of the medical
profession to prevent and relieve
human suffering. My effort to
pursue this goal is meaningless
in the context of the war.
"Therefore, I refuse to serve
in the Armed Forces in Vietnam.
So that I may exercise my pro
fession with conscience and dig
nity, I intend to seek means to
serve my country and humanity
which are compatible with the
preservation and enrichment of
life.
"(The signers of this state
ment are medical students who
do not necessarily hold in com
mon any political or religious
ideology.)"
Alternatives Exist
As the draft law now stands,
a physician need not serve in
the Armed Forces: several al
ternatives are available. For ex
ample, as an ordinary citizen he
can file as a conscientious ob
jector.
After his physical examina
tion, he may be classified IV-F
permanently for physical rea
sons or as I-Y on a temporarily.
The criteria for I-Y are still not
completely clear.
Because of his special train
ing, however, he is eligible for
two government programs in
place of military service. In the
Public Health Service, a doctor
receives a commission to work
in clinical medicine, preventive

Won't Go Petition" signers, with

Sixteen Stanford medical stu
dents and interns have added
their names to last spring's "We
Won't Go" pledge, bringing the
total to 92.
Altogether there are some 350
medical students, interns and
residents across the country who
have pledged they will not serve
in the Armed Forces in Viet
nam.
According to one of the move
ment's organizers, letters have
just been sent out to 800 medi
cal students nationwide, asking
them to add their names to the
growing list.
The temptation not to sign
such a pledge is great, according
to second-year student Robert
Ilia.
"I was told by many not to
concern myself, not to get 'in
volved' he said. "After all, I had
it made. I am deferred as a med
ical student in a five-year medi
cal school, during which time
the war might very well
end. . .
Motives Vary
Why, then, did 350 students
and interns sign it? The reasons
vary greatly. At the mildly dis
approving end of the spectrum
is Dudley Kriegbaum.
He believes "our people should
stay in Vietnam—even in the
face of sabotage ... I would go
to Vietnam if I could heal civili
ans, without helping to main
tain the effectiveness of our
military effort."
Kenneth Rand, a fourth-year
student, protests on a more gen
eral principle. "I am opposed to
all wars which seek to effect po
litical settlements by military
force. War is morally indefensi
ble, except where the threat to
survival is clear.
Rand added, "I do not believe
that war in the name of peace

is a tenet upon which this coun
try was founded ... it was de
mocracy and self-determination
for all nations."
Total Rejection
Finally, some refuse to serve
out of complete rejection of war
fare. Ronald Rubin commented,
"I see war, all war, as irrational
and immoral."
Fred Burbank takes the stand
of the C.O. "I have signed the
Pledge of Non-Participation be

cause induction into the Armed
Forces is wholly incompatible
with my religious beliefs, he
said. I am a conscientious objec
tor to war. My ultimate com
mitment is to God as Love."
The full statement reads:
"In the name of freedom, the
United States is waging an un
justifiable war in Vietnam and
is causing incalculable suffering.
It is the goal of the medical
profession to prevent and relieve
human suffering. My effort to
pursue this goal is meaningless
in the context of the war.
"Therefore, I refuse to serve
in the Armed Forces in Vietnam.
So that I may exercise my pro
fession with conscience and dig
nity, I intend to seek means to
serve my country and humanity
which are compatible with the
preservation and enrichment of
life.
"(The signers of this state
ment are medical students who
do not necessarily hold in com
mon any political or religious
ideology.)"

As the draft law now stands,
a physician need not serve in
the Armed Forces: several al
ternatives are available. For ex

doctors would no longer receive

An official in the Department

of Health, Education and Wel
fare said he doubted the PHS
would accept students who
signed this petition. He stated
the PHS is under pressure from
higher government officials to
keep it from becoming a haven
for "draft dodgers".
Reactions to the pledge sign
ers has varied. The support of
the Stanford Medical School fac
ulty has been overwhelming.

The two faculty statements,
with a total of 84 signatures, dif
fer only in that one goes beyond
supporting the students and ex
presses the professors' position
on the Vietnamese conflict. Both
petitions include the following
remarks.
"We . . . wish to express our

students who have stated their
unwillingness to participate in
the war in Vietnam ... We in

11-s Or Not n-S?
The status of the students with
their draft boards is not cer
tain. Since medical students are
never drafted out of school, the
students still hold their 11-S de
ferments. Interns are usually
granted 11-A occupational defer
ment.
In three cases, however, in
terns who have signed the

pledge have been reclassified I-
A. In none of the cases, how
ever, has any connection been
shown between the signing and
the reclassification.
Dr. David Netboy, who had
been classified I-Y and then 111-
A upon the birth of a child, was
recently reclassified as I-A and
ordered to report for his physi
cal. In a show of solidarity
among the pledge signers, 20 to
30 other medical students dem

Netboy printed up a leaflet for
the occasion, urging others to
refuse to serve and listing alter

sympathetic response which he
received as he distributed copies

litical settlements by military
force. War is morally indefensi
ble, except where the threat to
survival is clear.
Rand added, "I do not believe
that war in the name of peace

is a tenet upon which this coun
try was founded ... it was de
mocracy and self-determination
for all nations."
Total Rejection
Finally, some refuse to serve
out of complete rejection of war
fare. Ronald Rubin commented,
"I see war, all war, as irrational
and immoral."
Fred Burbank takes the stand
of the C.O. "I have signed the
Pledge of Non-Participation be

cause induction into the Armed
Forces is wholly incompatible
with my religious beliefs, he
said. I am a conscientious objec
tor to war. My ultimate com
mitment is to God as Love."
The full statement reads:
"In the name of freedom, the
United States is waging an un
justifiable war in Vietnam and
is causing incalculable suffering.
It is the goal of the medical
profession to prevent and relieve
human suffering. My effort to
pursue this goal is meaningless
in the context of the war.
"Therefore, I refuse to serve
in the Armed Forces in Vietnam.
So that I may exercise my pro
fession with conscience and dig
nity, I intend to seek means to
serve my country and humanity
which are compatible with the
preservation and enrichment of
life.
"(The signers of this state
ment are medical students who
do not necessarily hold in com
mon any political or religious
ideology.)"
Alternatives Exist
As the draft law now stands,
a physician need not serve in
the Armed Forces: several al
ternatives are available. For ex
ample, as an ordinary citizen he
can file as a conscientious ob
jector.
After his physical examina
tion, he may be classified IV-F
permanently for physical rea
sons or as I-Y on a temporarily.
The criteria for I-Y are still not
completely clear.
Because of his special train
ing, however, he is eligible for
two government programs in
place of military service. In the
Public Health Service, a doctor
receives a commission to work
in clinical medicine, preventive

However, there is a report
that the Administration will ask
Congress to abolish the PHS in
favor of a civilian health service
and to remove the military as
pect of the PHS. This means
doctors would no longer receive
commissions for serving civili
ans.
An official in the Department

of Health, Education and Wel
fare said he doubted the PHS
would accept students who
signed this petition. He stated
the PHS is under pressure from
higher government officials to
keep it from becoming a haven
for "draft dodgers".
Reactions to the pledge sign
ers has varied. The support of
the Stanford Medical School fac
ulty has been overwhelming.

The two faculty statements,
with a total of 84 signatures, dif
fer only in that one goes beyond
supporting the students and ex
presses the professors' position
on the Vietnamese conflict. Both
petitions include the following
remarks.
"We . . . wish to express our
support for a group of medical
students who have stated their
unwillingness to participate in
the war in Vietnam ... We in
tend to support them and their
position in whatever way be
comes necessary and appropri
ate."
11-s Or Not n-S?
The status of the students with
their draft boards is not cer
tain. Since medical students are
never drafted out of school, the
students still hold their 11-S de
ferments. Interns are usually
granted 11-A occupational defer
ment.
In three cases, however, in
terns who have signed the

pledge have been reclassified I-
A. In none of the cases, how
ever, has any connection been
shown between the signing and
the reclassification.
Dr. David Netboy, who had
been classified I-Y and then 111-
A upon the birth of a child, was
recently reclassified as I-A and
ordered to report for his physi
cal. In a show of solidarity
among the pledge signers, 20 to
30 other medical students dem
onstrated outside of the induc
tion center when the bus of in
ductees arrived.
Netboy printed up a leaflet for
the occasion, urging others to
refuse to serve and listing alter
natives. He was surprised at the
sympathetic response which he
received as he distributed copies
on the bus enroute to the center.
Some of his fellow inductees vol
unteered to distribute the litera
ture at the induction center.
Although a hostile group of
enlistees arrived shortly there
after, there were no incidents.
Sixteen Stanford medical stu
dents and interns have added
their names to last spring's "We
Won't Go" pledge, bringing the
total to 92.
Altogether there are some 350
medical students, interns and
residents across the country who
have pledged they will not serve
in the Armed Forces in Viet
nam.
According to one of the move
ment's organizers, letters have
just been sent out to 800 medi
cal students nationwide, asking
them to add their names to the
growing list.
The temptation not to sign
such a pledge is great, according
to second-year student Robert
Ilia.
"I was told by many not to
concern myself, not to get 'in
volved' he said. "After all, I had
it made. I am deferred as a med
ical student in a five-year medi
cal school, during which time
the war might very well
end. . .
Motives Vary
Why, then, did 350 students
and interns sign it? The reasons
vary greatly. At the mildly dis
approving end of the spectrum
is Dudley Kriegbaum.
He believes "our people should
stay in Vietnam—even in the
face of sabotage ... I would go
to Vietnam if I could heal civili
ans, without helping to main
tain the effectiveness of our
military effort."
Kenneth Rand, a fourth-year
student, protests on a more gen
eral principle. "I am opposed to
all wars which seek to effect po
litical settlements by military
force. War is morally indefensi
ble, except where the threat to
survival is clear.
Rand added, "I do not believe
that war in the name of peace

is a tenet upon which this coun
try was founded ... it was de
mocracy and self-determination
