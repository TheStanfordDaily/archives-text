# Spirited; Speedy Frosh Debut Against Spartans
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
The Stanford frosh football
team, boasting an impressive
list of speedsters everywhere on
the field, faces its first test to
morrow at 10 in the Stanford
Stadium against the San Jose
State frosh.
"We've got a lot of speed and
the defensive line is probably
the best I've seen on a fresh
man squad," said coach Terry
DeSylvia, a former Stanford var
sity quarterback and a freshman
himself in the coaching ranks.
The defensive line consists of
Larry Butler, Bill Alexander,
Phil Slate, Mack Herrero, Tom
Jones, and Dennis Moore.
None is of the Ernie Ladd pro
totype, but DeSylvia says they
have adequate size and more
than adequate speed.
Offensive Glow
DeSylvia glows when he talks
of the speed of his offensive line.
He has two guards, Charlie
Sable and Pete Crosby, who can
streak the hundred in 9.9 and
10.0 respectively.

These guards will be clearing
the way for 195 lb. halfback Jack
Schultz, whom all the football
coaches are very high on.
Who Is QB?
Coach DeSylvia hasn't decided
who will start at quarterback,
but he has narrowed the field
to two. Both Don Bunce and
Greg Edwards are vying for the
play-calling honors.
Jim Kaufman, a 9.8 sprinter,
and tight end Rod Hadyiel will
handle the receiving chores.
DeSylvia knows little about
the San Jose team, but the Spar
tan frosh have always been a
tough game for the Papooses.
Last year the San Jose team
romped to a 40-0 shutout of the
luckless Stanford squad.

He plans to have his team try
to control the ball on the ground,
with an adequate mixture of
pass plays for a balanced of
fense.
The jump from high school
football to college competition
is always a big one. However, the
frosh are well seasoned, having
spent most of their practice ses
sions scrimmaging the varsity.
The offense and defense have
been working as separate units,
simulating varsity opponents'
configurations.
DeSylvia said the frosh had
excellent spirit, and were very
eager for their first game. He
expects this enthusiasm to lead
to an "anything â€¢ can - happen"
game.
