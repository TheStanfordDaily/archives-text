The Mendicants, Stanford's 12-
.an singing group, will perform
' > sday night at 7:15 in Soto
mg \ Wilbur Hall.
An entirely new program of
nr.'6 will be featured at this
ii ft, according to "pitchpipe"
. Grant, the Mendicant's di
rector. The group will perform
weekly at different dormitories,
with Branner and Roble halls
'■'>ming up.
Grant will be plugging the
oup's new stereo album, "The
indicant's 1967," which was re
•orded by the group last spring.
"Tt> a conglomeration of every
;»i g you can think of," said
r 't "Jazz, old standard, folk

songs, sacred works and old
college songs."
"Our main bag is undated ar
rangements of old standards,"
Grant said.
The group has been warbling
at Stanford for six years. Most
of its arrangements have been
done by the Mendicants them
selves.
Grant has been holding try
outs for the group which needs
a high first tenor and a low sec
ond bass.
"We could also use some re
hearsal space," Grant said. The
Mendicants rehearsed in the Old
Union until the Registrar's of
fice moved in, and now practices
in the space in the Quad va
cated by the Registrar.
