# Biology Building Draws Complaints
## 
### 
A new, two-building, $5.5 mil
lion biological sciences complex
on Serra Street at the corner
of Lomita was supposedly com
pleted this summer.
But Hilberto Morales, Assis
tant to the Executive Head of
the Biology Department, "would
like to destroy the concept that
this building is complete."
The buildings, Herrin Hall and
Herrin Laboratories, were con
structed to provide more space
and modern facilities for the bio
logy department. For years, bio
logy has been housed in anti
quated Jordan Hall, whose labs
and classrooms are relics in a
turn - of - the - century edifice.
Herrin Hall, a windowless
structure facing Serra Street
has 25,000 square feet of teach
ing and lecture facilities, the bio
logy library, and several roof
top greenhouses.
Breezways Connect Buildings
Across three breezeways,
which connect the multistory
buildings on all levels, is Herrin
Laboratories. Research and de
partmental offices occupy this
building's 55,000 square feet.
The M & K Construction Com
pany began building the Milton
T. Pflueger-designed buildings in
May, 1965.
Herrin Labs appears complet
ed. But its interior is misleading.

More than a million dollars of
work remains to be done. Rows
of numbered doors open to un
finished, concrete room shells,
with plumbing and electrical
work exposed.
Mr. Morales cites lack of mon
ey as the cause of the unfinish
ed state of the buildings. He feels
biology is not funded as well as
other sciences.
Biology Not Glorious
Biology, he remarks, is not a
"glory science," like physics, nu
clear sciences, or space sciences.

Furthermore, he believes bio
logical problems, such as smog
and sewage disposal, not only
baffle the public, but tend to be
ignored by it."The public, not
understanding these problems,
does not fund them."
The American public has mad"
a choice, he said. "It would rather
fund war than peace."
This decision, Morales feels,
has severely reduced govern
mental educational expenditures.
One-third of the total cost of the
new buildings was paid for by

the National Science Founda
tion.
Morales concludes that to get
financial help for biology or bio
logical research is a "slow and
hard" process.

"I'm not criticizing the Uni
versity," he said. "Where money
was spent, it was spent well."
Morales simply wishes more
money could haxe been expend
ed.

The American public has mad"
a choice, he said. "It would rather
fund war than peace."
This decision, Morales feels,
has severely reduced govern
mental educational expenditures.
One-third of the total cost of the
new buildings was paid for by

the National Science Founda
tion.
Morales concludes that to get
financial help for biology or bio
logical research is a "slow and
hard" process.

"I'm not criticizing the Uni
versity," he said. "Where money
was spent, it was spent well."
Morales simply wishes more
money could haxe been expend
ed.


NEW' BIOLOGY BUILDING, consisting of Herrin Hall teaching
facilities and Herrin Laboratories, stands on Serra Street at the
end of Lomita.
A new, two-building, $5.5 mil
lion biological sciences complex
on Serra Street at the corner
of Lomita was supposedly com
pleted this summer.
But Hilberto Morales, Assis
tant to the Executive Head of
the Biology Department, "would
like to destroy the concept that
this building is complete."
The buildings, Herrin Hall and
Herrin Laboratories, were con
structed to provide more space
and modern facilities for the bio
logy department. For years, bio
logy has been housed in anti
quated Jordan Hall, whose labs
and classrooms are relics in a
turn - of - the - century edifice.
Herrin Hall, a windowless
structure facing Serra Street
has 25,000 square feet of teach
ing and lecture facilities, the bio
logy library, and several roof
top greenhouses.
Breezways Connect Buildings
Across three breezeways,
which connect the multistory
buildings on all levels, is Herrin
Laboratories. Research and de
partmental offices occupy this
building's 55,000 square feet.
The M & K Construction Com
pany began building the Milton
T. Pflueger-designed buildings in
May, 1965.
Herrin Labs appears complet
ed. But its interior is misleading.

More than a million dollars of
work remains to be done. Rows
of numbered doors open to un
finished, concrete room shells,
with plumbing and electrical
work exposed.
Mr. Morales cites lack of mon
ey as the cause of the unfinish
ed state of the buildings. He feels
biology is not funded as well as
other sciences.
Biology Not Glorious
Biology, he remarks, is not a
"glory science," like physics, nu
clear sciences, or space sciences.

Furthermore, he believes bio
logical problems, such as smog
and sewage disposal, not only
baffle the public, but tend to be
ignored by it."The public, not
understanding these problems,
does not fund them."
The American public has mad"
a choice, he said. "It would rather
fund war than peace."
