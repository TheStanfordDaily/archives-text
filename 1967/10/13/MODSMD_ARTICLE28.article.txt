# Birth Control and Grass
## Students Work For Reforms 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Reform, both educational and
social, have been the focus of
recent student activities in both
the United States and Canada.
The student administrative
council of the UNIVERSITY OF
TORONTO has endorsed a stu
dent-run program of distributing
birth control information. The
information has been distributed
to members of the student body
by a student group of senior
women.
The group has also been re
ferring further inquiries for in
formation to the local Planned
Parenthood Association, and to
Toronto doctors who have agreed
to cooperate in the program.
Such clubs have been started
on other campuses in both the
United States and Canada. A re
cent survey of 315 university
health services revealed that
only 1 in 25 of them would dis
tribute birth control pills to un
married students.
Major revisions in TRINITY
COLLEGE'S equivalent of the
General Studies program have
been accomplished recently. The
greatest reform was to institute
a program of 50 "Honor Schol
ars", designated by the admis
sions committee, who would be
excused from most, if not all,
of their General Studies require
ments. The college also reduced
the normal course load for
freshmen and sophomores from
five to four courses, and in
creased the course load for jun
iors and seniors from four to
five courses.
The UNIVERSITY OF MICH
IGAN student government coun
cil has declared itself indepen

dent of the school's administra
tion, from which it receives $18,-
000 a year. It also unilaterally
declared the university's code of
conduct no longer binding on the
students and has substituted its
own.
The council declared that stu
dents over 21 years old would
be permitted to have alcohol in
their dormitory rooms. Previous
ly, no students were allowed
liquor in their rooms. The stu
dent government also announced
that the University's open house
rules were no longer in effect,
and that each dorm could deter
mine its own open house hours.
The council also ordered a
student referendum on late
hours for freshman women. Up
to now freshmen women have
been required to be in their
dorms by midnight on week
nights and 1:30 a.m. on week
ends.
The UNIVERSITY OF WEST
FLORIDA opened with a unique
three - college - in - one structure.
The entire 1600 member student
body has been divided up into
three living-learning units. Each
one of these units will have its
own faculty and physical facili
ties, but will share academic fa
cilities.
The idea is to give the stu
dents the atmosphere of a small
liberal arts college with the aca
demic facilities of a large uni
versity.
At the CITY COLLEGE OF
NEW YORK, the administration
has decided to allow the students
and faculty a say in the plan
ning of new buildings. This ac
tion was the result of a student
led demonstration lasting 11 Va

months to halt the destruction
of grassy lawns. The university
had planned to put up pre-fab
ricated classrooms and a black
top faculty parking lot on the
green areas.

Major revisions in TRINITY
COLLEGE'S equivalent of the
General Studies program have
been accomplished recently. The
greatest reform was to institute
a program of 50 "Honor Schol
ars", designated by the admis
sions committee, who would be
excused from most, if not all,
of their General Studies require
ments. The college also reduced
the normal course load for
freshmen and sophomores from
five to four courses, and in
creased the course load for jun
iors and seniors from four to
five courses.
The UNIVERSITY OF MICH
IGAN student government coun
cil has declared itself indepen

dent of the school's administra
tion, from which it receives $18,-
000 a year. It also unilaterally
declared the university's code of
conduct no longer binding on the
students and has substituted its
own.
The council declared that stu
dents over 21 years old would
be permitted to have alcohol in
their dormitory rooms. Previous
ly, no students were allowed
liquor in their rooms. The stu
dent government also announced
that the University's open house
rules were no longer in effect,
and that each dorm could deter
mine its own open house hours.
The council also ordered a
student referendum on late
hours for freshman women. Up
to now freshmen women have
been required to be in their
dorms by midnight on week
nights and 1:30 a.m. on week
ends.
The UNIVERSITY OF WEST
FLORIDA opened with a unique
three - college - in - one structure.
The entire 1600 member student
body has been divided up into
three living-learning units. Each
one of these units will have its
own faculty and physical facili
ties, but will share academic fa
cilities.
The idea is to give the stu
dents the atmosphere of a small
liberal arts college with the aca
demic facilities of a large uni
versity.
At the CITY COLLEGE OF
NEW YORK, the administration
has decided to allow the students
and faculty a say in the plan
ning of new buildings. This ac
tion was the result of a student
led demonstration lasting 11 Va

months to halt the destruction
of grassy lawns. The university
had planned to put up pre-fab
ricated classrooms and a black
top faculty parking lot on the
green areas.
Reform, both educational and
social, have been the focus of
recent student activities in both
the United States and Canada.
The student administrative
council of the UNIVERSITY OF
TORONTO has endorsed a stu
dent-run program of distributing
birth control information. The
information has been distributed
to members of the student body
by a student group of senior
women.
The group has also been re
ferring further inquiries for in
formation to the local Planned
Parenthood Association, and to
Toronto doctors who have agreed
to cooperate in the program.
Such clubs have been started
on other campuses in both the
United States and Canada. A re
cent survey of 315 university
health services revealed that
only 1 in 25 of them would dis
tribute birth control pills to un
married students.
