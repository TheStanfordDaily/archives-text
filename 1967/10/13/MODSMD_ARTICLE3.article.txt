## Experts Analyze USSR 
### 
The Soviet Union is develop
ing into a more pluralistic so
ciety, according to Leonard Scha
piro, London University political
scientist, who spoke yesterday
afternoon at the Hoover sympo
sium on Fifty Years of Commu
nism in Russia.

At the root of the soviet shift
towards a more ecentralized so
ciety, Schapiro saw not a love
for freedom, but "the hard ma
terialist desire for an increase in
production."
A modern technological state
cannot thrive under the "arbi
trariness" of total party control,
he said. "Variety of opinion, free
dom to dissent, and freedom
to discuss, are an essential part
of efficient political and economic
planning."
Schapiro noted the increasing
frequency with which soviet in
tellectuals and students are
forming independent groups, and
the increasing frequency with
which these groups are being
consulted by the government.
Persons Speak Freely
He emphasized, however, that
there is "no evidence whatever"
to suggest that other groups
"such as managers or generals
or economists" are able to in
fluence decision making "on
their own accord." Rather, in
dividuals are allowed to speak
more freely than before, and
their opinions are often incor
porated in government decisions.
In addition to the growing in
dependents of various sectors of
soviet society, Schapiro noted a
"genuine separation" between
the party machine and the gov
ernment.
In his view much of this de
centralization is a reaction
against Khrushchev's doctrine
that all aspects of soviet life be
under the jurisdiction of the
Communist Party.
Garthoff Speaks
In another program disagree
ment over the seriousness of the
Soviet threat to the United
States enlivened yesterday mor
ning's session of the Hoover In
stitution symposium on "Fifty
Years of Communism in Rus
sia."
Raymond Garthoff, the State
Department man and a lectur
er at John Hopkins University,
presented a chronicle of trends
in Russian tactical thought and
listened to the critical comments
of Dr. Stefan Possony, a Hoover
researcher, and Hanson Baldwin,
the military editor of the New
York Times.
Both Garthoff and Possony
have been advisors to the U.S.
armed forces. Garthoff has work
ed for the Army as well as for
the RAND Corporation which

does considerable government
intelligence research; Possony
has been a consultant with the
Air Force.
Red Army Changes
As well as briefly reviewing
the ascendancy and structuring
of the Red Army and its changes
in numbers and composition,
Garthoff outlined four "politico
military world crises" of the
past decade.
He remarked, "There is no evi
dence to indicate, and much rea
son to doubt, that Moscow in
stigated or even favored the
turn to guerilla warfare in South'
Vietnam." "Khrushchev had, in
fact, virtually washed his hands
of Vietnam by 1964," Garthoff
said, "but his successors believed
the communist insurgents would
win and wanted to attract them
and the North Vietnamese to the
Soviet side in the split in the
communist movement."
Garthoff concluded his point
by saying: "It is, therefore, high
ly incumbent on others to take
the necessary measures to in
sure that the Soviet leaders will
continue to regard any aggres
sive military action as inexpe
dient."

centralization is a reaction
against Khrushchev's doctrine
that all aspects of soviet life be
under the jurisdiction of the
Communist Party.
Garthoff Speaks
In another program disagree
ment over the seriousness of the
Soviet threat to the United
States enlivened yesterday mor
ning's session of the Hoover In
stitution symposium on "Fifty
Years of Communism in Rus
sia."
Raymond Garthoff, the State
Department man and a lectur
er at John Hopkins University,
presented a chronicle of trends
in Russian tactical thought and
listened to the critical comments
of Dr. Stefan Possony, a Hoover
researcher, and Hanson Baldwin,
the military editor of the New
York Times.
Both Garthoff and Possony
have been advisors to the U.S.
armed forces. Garthoff has work
ed for the Army as well as for
the RAND Corporation which

does considerable government
intelligence research; Possony
has been a consultant with the
Air Force.
Red Army Changes
As well as briefly reviewing
the ascendancy and structuring
of the Red Army and its changes
in numbers and composition,
Garthoff outlined four "politico
military world crises" of the
past decade.
He remarked, "There is no evi
dence to indicate, and much rea
son to doubt, that Moscow in
stigated or even favored the
turn to guerilla warfare in South'
Vietnam." "Khrushchev had, in
fact, virtually washed his hands
of Vietnam by 1964," Garthoff
said, "but his successors believed
the communist insurgents would
win and wanted to attract them
and the North Vietnamese to the
Soviet side in the split in the
communist movement."
Garthoff concluded his point
by saying: "It is, therefore, high
ly incumbent on others to take
the necessary measures to in
sure that the Soviet leaders will
continue to regard any aggres
sive military action as inexpe
dient."
The Soviet Union is develop
ing into a more pluralistic so
ciety, according to Leonard Scha
piro, London University political
scientist, who spoke yesterday
afternoon at the Hoover sympo
sium on Fifty Years of Commu
nism in Russia.

At the root of the soviet shift
towards a more ecentralized so
ciety, Schapiro saw not a love
for freedom, but "the hard ma
terialist desire for an increase in
production."
A modern technological state
cannot thrive under the "arbi
trariness" of total party control,
he said. "Variety of opinion, free
dom to dissent, and freedom
to discuss, are an essential part
of efficient political and economic
planning."
Schapiro noted the increasing
frequency with which soviet in
tellectuals and students are
forming independent groups, and
the increasing frequency with
which these groups are being
consulted by the government.
Persons Speak Freely
He emphasized, however, that
there is "no evidence whatever"
to suggest that other groups
"such as managers or generals
or economists" are able to in
fluence decision making "on
their own accord." Rather, in
dividuals are allowed to speak
more freely than before, and
their opinions are often incor
porated in government decisions.
In addition to the growing in
dependents of various sectors of
soviet society, Schapiro noted a
"genuine separation" between
the party machine and the gov
ernment.
In his view much of this de
centralization is a reaction
against Khrushchev's doctrine
that all aspects of soviet life be
under the jurisdiction of the
Communist Party.
