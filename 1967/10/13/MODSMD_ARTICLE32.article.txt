# Meeting Series To Investigate Stanford Overseas Campuses
## 
### 
The Overseas Campus Office
is sponsoring a series of evening
meetings on the overseas cam
puses starting Sunday and run
ning through Thursday.
The first session will be held
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in the Tre
sidder large lounge for students
who are interested in learning
more about the program. Geo
rge Hamrdla, assistant to the
director of the overseas cam

puses, and Dave Hakken, student
chairman of the Overseas Cam
puses Board, will speak briefly
on general aspects of Stanford's
program.
Hakken will explain generally
the format of the campuses.
Hamrdla told The Daily he will
speak on "what the overseas
campuses are not." He pointed
out that the program may not
be the best for many Stanford

students, and he hopes this series
will help students evaluate the
overseas campuses in relation
ship to what they want from a
foreign experience.
In the Sunday meeting there
will be ample time for questions
from the floor and informal con
versation. Students who have
returned from each campus have
been working with Barbara
Dodge, chairman of the series,
to present five meetings, one for
each campus.
