# Weinstein Pushes Plan For Student Association
## 
### 
Michael Weinstein, the sopho
more speaker of Stanford's stu
dent legislature, has taken the
first steps in his ambitious plan
to organize a Bay Area Student
Association (BASA) with thou
sands of members.
"A collective bargaining agent
for students" is his goal.
Tuesday he mailed letters to
student leaders at 21 colleges
outlining three proposals for an
association drawing all members
from all of these campuses.
On Sunday he will discuss his
scheme with these student gov
ernment representatives at the
University of Santa Clara. Wein
stein is taking advantage of a
previously scheduled conference
there to win support for the
BASA idea.
Wants Independence
Weinstein envisions an orga
nization collecting dues from "a
potential membership of 400,-
000," completely independent of
existing student governments
and university officials. Its ac
tivities would include arranging
discounts for members, cutting
costs of entertainers by bring
ing them on a tour to all Bay
Area campuses, and lobbying in
Sacramento for student inter
ests.
A realistic goal for BASA
would be 90,000 card-carrying
members, each paying $1 to $5
dues, Weinstein said.
It would be a "student union"
on the European model. Cesare
Massarenti, the ASSU vice presi
dent who was president of a
student union in Milan, Italy,
has strongly supported Wein
stein's plan.
NSA Attacked
Weinstein would like to see
Stanford withdraw from the Na
tional Student Association
(NSA) before a Bay Area stu
dent association is founded. He
thinks NSA is "irrelevant" to
Stanford.

At a legislature meeting Oct.
19, Weinstein will propose that
Stanford cut its ties with NSA
by transferring the $1,400 NSA
appropriation to the LASSU gen
eral contingency fund.
In his letter proposing BASA
to student leaders, Weinstein
said "communication among the
campuses" and "coordination of
activities" are "vitally needed."
He suggested three possible
kinds of organization for BASA.
The first would simply facilitate
communication between "orga
nizations of similar interests" at
the 21 campuses. The second
plan calls for an association of
student governments.
The third plan, which Wein
stein favors and will try to im
plement within a year, would
bypass student governments and
enlist students directly. A sense
of "participation" would be cre
ated by a democratically-orga
nized association.
According to this plan, "BASA
would be individually based. Any
member of a Bay Area school
could join by paying the appro
priate dues. . .
Weinstein envisions the mem
bers of BASA at each campus
organizing a local chapter which
would elect members to a board
of governors, which "would
make no policy decisions with
out a referendum. The board's
sole function would be "coordina
tion."
"Demagoguery would be a
problem," Weinstein admitted.
"That's why the board alone
would have no power." He re
alizes that student radicals might
predominate in BASA's leader
ship, and thinks that vigorous
efforts will be necessary to in
terest a "cross-section" of stu
dents in the association.
He would prefer a BASA plan
which would be entirely sepa
rate from existing student gov
ernments, because they are "fi
nancially dependent on college

officials" and "passive" in their
actions.
Stanford's ASSU is no excep
tion, the 19-year-old Weinstein
believes. "It would be refreshing
to have an independent group
here fighting for student rights,"
he said.
Stanford Needed
"Stanford is going to be fun
damental to getting this thing
going," Weinstein said. He may
request financial support from
LASSU for his organizing ef
forts.
The most immediate benefits
from BASA would be in bringing
member campuses at lower cost,
Weinstein said. He used Stan
ford's experience with "Century
21" as an example.
"We're spending $2,000 to
bring people here for a day—
21 schools should split the cost
for a tour of all the campuses."
Weinstein also plans a "huge
discount program" with BASA
arranging cut-rate prices for its
members. "We could really put
the screws to people and get 15-
25% discounts on clothes, rec
ords, everything."
Cooperatives, especially book

stores, could also be sponsored
by BASA.
Politics Stressed
More important than these
functions would be BASA's po
litical role, Weinstein feels.
He wrote the student leaders
that "Significant social reform
would be possible . . . racial dis
crimination can be fought by a
joint effort of boycotts and simi
lar actions.
"Students' rights is a major
concern ... an area organiza
tion could lobby in Sacramento.
Such would be most useful if
tuition becomes a political issue
again," he said.
Weinstein cites the protests
against Governor Ronald Rea
gan's tuition demands for the
University of California as show
ing the need for stronger col
lective action by students. "If we
can get students from every col
lege in the Bay Area to march
on Sacramento, instead of just
scattered groups, we can exert
real influence," he said.
Among the 21 colleges invited
to discuss BASA Sunday are
Berkeley, San Jose State, San
Francisco State, Santa Clara, and
Mills.

Weinstein said. He used Stan
ford's experience with "Century
21" as an example.
"We're spending $2,000 to
bring people here for a day—
21 schools should split the cost
for a tour of all the campuses."
Weinstein also plans a "huge
discount program" with BASA
arranging cut-rate prices for its
members. "We could really put
the screws to people and get 15-
25% discounts on clothes, rec
ords, everything."
Cooperatives, especially book

stores, could also be sponsored
by BASA.
Politics Stressed
More important than these
functions would be BASA's po
litical role, Weinstein feels.
He wrote the student leaders
that "Significant social reform
would be possible . . . racial dis
crimination can be fought by a
joint effort of boycotts and simi
lar actions.
"Students' rights is a major
concern ... an area organiza
tion could lobby in Sacramento.
Such would be most useful if
tuition becomes a political issue
again," he said.
Weinstein cites the protests
against Governor Ronald Rea
gan's tuition demands for the
University of California as show
ing the need for stronger col
lective action by students. "If we
can get students from every col
lege in the Bay Area to march
on Sacramento, instead of just
scattered groups, we can exert
real influence," he said.
Among the 21 colleges invited
to discuss BASA Sunday are
Berkeley, San Jose State, San
Francisco State, Santa Clara, and
Mills.
Michael Weinstein, the sopho
more speaker of Stanford's stu
dent legislature, has taken the
first steps in his ambitious plan
to organize a Bay Area Student
Association (BASA) with thou
sands of members.
"A collective bargaining agent
for students" is his goal.
Tuesday he mailed letters to
student leaders at 21 colleges
outlining three proposals for an
association drawing all members
from all of these campuses.
On Sunday he will discuss his
scheme with these student gov
ernment representatives at the
University of Santa Clara. Wein
stein is taking advantage of a
previously scheduled conference
there to win support for the
BASA idea.
Wants Independence
Weinstein envisions an orga
nization collecting dues from "a
potential membership of 400,-
000," completely independent of
existing student governments
and university officials. Its ac
tivities would include arranging
discounts for members, cutting
costs of entertainers by bring
ing them on a tour to all Bay
Area campuses, and lobbying in
Sacramento for student inter
ests.
A realistic goal for BASA
would be 90,000 card-carrying
members, each paying $1 to $5
dues, Weinstein said.
It would be a "student union"
on the European model. Cesare
Massarenti, the ASSU vice presi
dent who was president of a
student union in Milan, Italy,
has strongly supported Wein
stein's plan.
NSA Attacked
Weinstein would like to see
Stanford withdraw from the Na
tional Student Association
(NSA) before a Bay Area stu
dent association is founded. He
thinks NSA is "irrelevant" to
Stanford.

At a legislature meeting Oct.
19, Weinstein will propose that
Stanford cut its ties with NSA
by transferring the $1,400 NSA
appropriation to the LASSU gen
eral contingency fund.
In his letter proposing BASA
to student leaders, Weinstein
said "communication among the
campuses" and "coordination of
activities" are "vitally needed."
He suggested three possible
kinds of organization for BASA.
The first would simply facilitate
communication between "orga
nizations of similar interests" at
the 21 campuses. The second
plan calls for an association of
student governments.
The third plan, which Wein
stein favors and will try to im
plement within a year, would
bypass student governments and
enlist students directly. A sense
of "participation" would be cre
ated by a democratically-orga
nized association.
According to this plan, "BASA
would be individually based. Any
member of a Bay Area school
could join by paying the appro
priate dues. . .
Weinstein envisions the mem
bers of BASA at each campus
organizing a local chapter which
would elect members to a board
of governors, which "would
make no policy decisions with
out a referendum. The board's
sole function would be "coordina
tion."
"Demagoguery would be a
problem," Weinstein admitted.
"That's why the board alone
would have no power." He re
alizes that student radicals might
predominate in BASA's leader
ship, and thinks that vigorous
efforts will be necessary to in
terest a "cross-section" of stu
dents in the association.
He would prefer a BASA plan
which would be entirely sepa
rate from existing student gov
ernments, because they are "fi
nancially dependent on college

officials" and "passive" in their
actions.
Stanford's ASSU is no excep
tion, the 19-year-old Weinstein
believes. "It would be refreshing
to have an independent group
here fighting for student rights,"
he said.

"Stanford is going to be fun
damental to getting this thing
going," Weinstein said. He may
request financial support from
LASSU for his organizing ef
forts.

from BASA would be in bringing

of "participation" would be cre
ated by a democratically-orga
nized association.
According to this plan, "BASA
would be individually based. Any
member of a Bay Area school
could join by paying the appro
priate dues. . .
Weinstein envisions the mem
bers of BASA at each campus
organizing a local chapter which
would elect members to a board
of governors, which "would
make no policy decisions with
out a referendum. The board's
sole function would be "coordina
tion."
"Demagoguery would be a
problem," Weinstein admitted.
"That's why the board alone
would have no power." He re
alizes that student radicals might
predominate in BASA's leader
ship, and thinks that vigorous
efforts will be necessary to in
terest a "cross-section" of stu
dents in the association.
He would prefer a BASA plan
which would be entirely sepa
rate from existing student gov
ernments, because they are "fi
nancially dependent on college

officials" and "passive" in their
actions.
Stanford's ASSU is no excep
tion, the 19-year-old Weinstein
believes. "It would be refreshing
to have an independent group
here fighting for student rights,"
he said.
Stanford Needed
"Stanford is going to be fun
damental to getting this thing
going," Weinstein said. He may
request financial support from
LASSU for his organizing ef
forts.
The most immediate benefits
from BASA would be in bringing
member campuses at lower cost,
Weinstein said. He used Stan
ford's experience with "Century
21" as an example.
"We're spending $2,000 to
bring people here for a day—
21 schools should split the cost
for a tour of all the campuses."
Weinstein also plans a "huge
discount program" with BASA
arranging cut-rate prices for its
members. "We could really put
the screws to people and get 15-
25% discounts on clothes, rec
ords, everything."
Cooperatives, especially book

stores, could also be sponsored
by BASA.
Politics Stressed
More important than these
functions would be BASA's po
litical role, Weinstein feels.
He wrote the student leaders
that "Significant social reform
would be possible . . . racial dis
crimination can be fought by a
joint effort of boycotts and simi
lar actions.
"Students' rights is a major
concern ... an area organiza
tion could lobby in Sacramento.
Such would be most useful if
tuition becomes a political issue
again," he said.
Weinstein cites the protests
against Governor Ronald Rea
gan's tuition demands for the
University of California as show
ing the need for stronger col
lective action by students. "If we
can get students from every col
lege in the Bay Area to march
on Sacramento, instead of just
scattered groups, we can exert
real influence," he said.
Among the 21 colleges invited
to discuss BASA Sunday are
Berkeley, San Jose State, San
Francisco State, Santa Clara, and
Mills.
Michael Weinstein, the sopho
more speaker of Stanford's stu
dent legislature, has taken the
first steps in his ambitious plan
to organize a Bay Area Student
Association (BASA) with thou
sands of members.
"A collective bargaining agent
for students" is his goal.
Tuesday he mailed letters to
student leaders at 21 colleges
outlining three proposals for an
association drawing all members
from all of these campuses.
On Sunday he will discuss his
scheme with these student gov
ernment representatives at the
University of Santa Clara. Wein
stein is taking advantage of a
previously scheduled conference
there to win support for the
BASA idea.
Wants Independence
Weinstein envisions an orga
nization collecting dues from "a
potential membership of 400,-
000," completely independent of
existing student governments
and university officials. Its ac
tivities would include arranging
discounts for members, cutting
costs of entertainers by bring
ing them on a tour to all Bay
Area campuses, and lobbying in
Sacramento for student inter
ests.
A realistic goal for BASA
would be 90,000 card-carrying
members, each paying $1 to $5
dues, Weinstein said.
It would be a "student union"
on the European model. Cesare
Massarenti, the ASSU vice presi
dent who was president of a
student union in Milan, Italy,
has strongly supported Wein
stein's plan.
NSA Attacked
Weinstein would like to see
Stanford withdraw from the Na
tional Student Association
(NSA) before a Bay Area stu
dent association is founded. He
thinks NSA is "irrelevant" to
Stanford.

At a legislature meeting Oct.
19, Weinstein will propose that
Stanford cut its ties with NSA
by transferring the $1,400 NSA
appropriation to the LASSU gen
eral contingency fund.
In his letter proposing BASA
to student leaders, Weinstein
said "communication among the
campuses" and "coordination of
activities" are "vitally needed."
He suggested three possible
kinds of organization for BASA.
The first would simply facilitate
communication between "orga
nizations of similar interests" at
the 21 campuses. The second
plan calls for an association of
student governments.
The third plan, which Wein
stein favors and will try to im
plement within a year, would
bypass student governments and
enlist students directly. A sense
of "participation" would be cre
ated by a democratically-orga
nized association.
