# Arbuckle Hired By Wells Fargo Bank
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
The board of directors of the
Wells Fargo Bank yesterday
designated Ernest C. Arbuckle,
Dean of the Graduate School of
Business, a director of the bank
board.
Arbuckle has announced his
retirement as Dean of the Grad
uate School of Business by July,
1968. At that time, speculates
the San Francisco Examiner, he
will probably succeed Stephen
Chase as Wells Fargo board
chairman. Chase, a Stanford
graduate, will reach retirement
age 65 in May of next year.
If, as expected, Arbuckle be
comes board chairman, he will
not be a "figurehead," but will
actively work with Wells Fargo
President Richard Cooley in a
"team" effort to manage the $4.5
billion financial giant.
Cooley would handle the finan
cial arrangements, while Ar
buckle would consider manage
ment problems in the new team
effort at the San Francisco-based
bank.
Deep Personal Commitment
"I have a deep personal com
mitment to Stanford," Arbuckle
said, "My new job is not the end
of my relationship with the Uni
versity. I will become a volun
teer without pay."
Arbuckle sees the banking in
dustry as a "vital function"
which is now "highly competi
tive." Banking, in recent years,
has been revolutionized, both in
technique and function.
For example, computers have
speeded the handling of transac
tions. Banking has also expand
ed into new areas with charge
cards,, such as the "Bankameri
card".
Arbuckle, long-time friend of
President Wallace Sterling, ex
plained, "he was one main rea
sons I came to Stanford." How
ever, the Dean said it was only
a coincidence that Sterling was
retiring at about the same time
that he would be leaving.
"I've enjoyed working with

President Sterling," said Ar
buckle, who added, "When I first
came to Stanford I made sure
that he was going to stay."
Arbuckle is currently serving
on the board of directors of sev
eral large corporations, includ
ing Safeway stores, the Kern
County Land Company, and
Aetna Life Insurance.
He became Dean of the Grad
uate Business School in 1958.
Prior to that, he served as a
vice-president of W. R. Grace
and Co., a concern with diversi
fied interests on the West Coast
and in Central America.
The Dean will also resign as
board chairman of the Stanford
Research Institute. He explained
that a committee had been look
ing for a successor for some
months, and "we're making
progress."

Chase as Wells Fargo board
chairman. Chase, a Stanford
graduate, will reach retirement
age 65 in May of next year.
If, as expected, Arbuckle be
comes board chairman, he will
not be a "figurehead," but will
actively work with Wells Fargo
President Richard Cooley in a
"team" effort to manage the $4.5
billion financial giant.
Cooley would handle the finan
cial arrangements, while Ar
buckle would consider manage
ment problems in the new team
effort at the San Francisco-based
bank.
Deep Personal Commitment
"I have a deep personal com
mitment to Stanford," Arbuckle
said, "My new job is not the end
of my relationship with the Uni
versity. I will become a volun
teer without pay."
Arbuckle sees the banking in
dustry as a "vital function"
which is now "highly competi
tive." Banking, in recent years,
has been revolutionized, both in
technique and function.
For example, computers have
speeded the handling of transac
tions. Banking has also expand
ed into new areas with charge
cards,, such as the "Bankameri
card".
Arbuckle, long-time friend of
President Wallace Sterling, ex
plained, "he was one main rea
sons I came to Stanford." How
ever, the Dean said it was only
a coincidence that Sterling was
retiring at about the same time
that he would be leaving.
"I've enjoyed working with

President Sterling," said Ar
buckle, who added, "When I first
came to Stanford I made sure
that he was going to stay."
Arbuckle is currently serving
on the board of directors of sev
eral large corporations, includ
ing Safeway stores, the Kern
County Land Company, and
Aetna Life Insurance.
He became Dean of the Grad
uate Business School in 1958.
Prior to that, he served as a
vice-president of W. R. Grace
and Co., a concern with diversi
fied interests on the West Coast
and in Central America.
The Dean will also resign as
board chairman of the Stanford
Research Institute. He explained
that a committee had been look
ing for a successor for some
months, and "we're making
progress."
The board of directors of the
Wells Fargo Bank yesterday
designated Ernest C. Arbuckle,
Dean of the Graduate School of
Business, a director of the bank
board.
Arbuckle has announced his
retirement as Dean of the Grad
uate School of Business by July,
1968. At that time, speculates
the San Francisco Examiner, he
will probably succeed Stephen
Chase as Wells Fargo board
chairman. Chase, a Stanford
graduate, will reach retirement
age 65 in May of next year.
