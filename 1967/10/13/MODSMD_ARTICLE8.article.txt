## Whose Nose Is In Hoo's Business? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's Daily Philip
Taubman attributed the follow
ing statement to me: "I wish
the faculty would keep their
noses out of my business."
What I actually said was that
my colleagues and I do not stick
our noses into the legitimate
business of other departments of
the University and that I am
Sometimes sorely tempted to

ask for reciprocity. Furthermore,
this was a general statement and
not one made in the context of
"faculty requests for consulta
tion on Hoover appointments."
My colleagues and I always
stand ready to co-operate with
the faculty of Stanford Univer
sity.

• Starve Fraternities?
Editor, The Daily:
Though I probably share Pro
fessor Levin's basic view of the
Stanford fraternity system, I
feel that he either did not follow
last year's dialogue on fraterni
ties or did not learn the lessons
there to be learned.
His proposal to squelch aca
demic input in fraternity houses
disregards the first priority
(ahead of integration by class
and coeducation) of the Report
of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion. His proposal invites the
same incensed, non-productive
debate that was generated by
the Fraternity Subcommittee Re
port.
Further, no clear thought ap
pears to have been given to the
relationship between his implicit
goals and explicit means.
Levin proposes that the Uni
versity withhold its stamp of
academic approval from house
seminars for past and present
sins of commission and omis
sion. The seminars will pre
sumably mirror the homogeneity
and lack of challenge produced
by the selective system. His con
clusion seems to be that the
only way to make the living
unit conducive to free, creative
discussion must be to jettison
the selection system beforehand.
But last year's lesson was that
aggressive demands result in lit
tle but equally aggressive and
negative replies. Professor Lev
in does not seem to understand
that the introduction of all-cam
pus seminars may in part dem
onstrate to the house that the
selective system is a major bar-

rier to education, which seems
to be his implicit contention.
He appears to think that if fra
ternities went draw, they would
spontaneously possess the sense
of community commonly said to
spark the process of education.
So, he proposes that the univer
sitys starve fraternities until
they have no sense of communi
ty, and after a magical trans
formation education will become
possible in the fraternity houses.
Though the numerical value
of a seminar does not corre
spond to its educational value,
and may in fact detract from its
educational value, the accredita
tion of seminars is important in
getting people outside the par
ticular house to come up to a
place where they might never
otherwise think of going.
It has not been merely coin
cidental that fraternity seminars
have been offered at rush time
in the past, but enough houses
are serious enough about the
concept of residence education
for Professor Levin to seriously
reconsider a stand that will only
guarantee him the chance and
possibly the necessity of taking
the same potshots next year.

• Resistance
Editor, The Daily:
On October 16 members of the
Resistance throughout the coun
try will return their draft cards
to the Selective Service System.
We, the undersigned members
of the Steering Committee of the
University Christian Movement,

recognize this as a courageous
act of conviction by men who
believe that military conscription
is unjust and inhuman.
We share their anguish over
both the war in Vietnam that
is needlessly persecuting the
people of that country and the
system of military conscription
which supports that war.
We realize that the decision
to reject all forms of coopera
tion with the Selective Service
System is only one of many ave
nues of protest and that not all
can follow this particular stra
tegy. but we agree with Profes
sor Robert McAfee Brown that
"When an individual takes a
stand against war on the basis
of conscience the religious com
munity has an absolute obliga
tion to support him in that
stand."
We believe this support ex
tends to the members of the Re
sistance although they have
placed themselves outside the
traditional legal definition of
conscientious objector.
