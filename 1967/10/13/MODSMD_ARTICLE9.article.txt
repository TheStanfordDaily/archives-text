## The 						Compleat Party Name Tag 
### Christopher Hargrove 
All of us at one time or an
other have to face the Cocktail
Party. And many other "mixing"
social occasions will, for our
purposes today, fall into that
category.
The Cocktail Party is marked
by nothing so much as the kind
of conversations people have at
them. As one talks to different
people, the topics get repetitive.
And so, in our never-ending
quest for ways to make life less

complicated, we have devised the
compleate name tag.
For instant social success,
simply cut out the two sections
below and paste them upside
down back to back. The fill in
the blanks and pin the card
on a prominent part of your
person. (For greater ease in
flipping to side two, we suggest
using a hinged piece of card
board. )
Bon chance!
