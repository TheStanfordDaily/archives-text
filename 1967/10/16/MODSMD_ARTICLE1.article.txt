# 200 Expected To Defy Draft, Week Of Resistance Begins
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Seventeen members of the
Stanford community have
pledged to turn their draft cards
in to the U.S. Attorney this
afternoon as an act of resistance
to the draft.
The seventeen include stu
dents Dick Baxstresser, Jeff
Browning, Tom Grissom, Barry
Kast, Chris Ledgerwood, Dick
Lee, Mark Riley and Mark
Silverman: former students
Doug Baty, Tim English, Dave
Harris, Jeff and Bill Shurtleff,
Stuart McCrae and Dennis
Sweeney; and Palo Alto resi

dents Rodney Gage and Bob
Stege.
They will turn their draft
cards in at the Federal Office
Building in San Francisco, as
a part of the nationwide stop
the-draft week. About 200 other
Bay Area men will turn in their
draft cards simultaneously. A
total of one thousand cards are
expected to be turned in across
the nation.
The protest is a symbolic be
ginning to the stop-the-draft
week, according to Mark Silver
man, one of the leaders of The
Resistance, a Palo Alto anti-draft
group.
Mass demonstrations Tuesday
will attempt to close the Oak
land Induction Center. This,
Silverman says, is the physical
portion of the protest.
Stanford Involved
About 120 to 200 Stanford stu
dents are expected to participate
in Tuesday's demonstration. A
few will be members of an ad

vance group, who will sleep
Monday night in an Oakland
church and start demonstrating
at 4:30 a.m. and start a sit-in
as soon as the doors of the cen
ter open.
Support groups of 200 people
will be used to block the center
to buses containing inductees
and to take the place of any sit
in demonstrators arrested by
the police.
Tuesday's effort has appar
ently been closely coordinated.
The coordination includes the
use of walkie-talkies and exten
sive training sessions for all the
leaders. More than 2000 people
are expected from the Bay Area.
Leonard Siegal, Stanford lead
er of the demonstrations, an
nounced buses will leave from
El Camino Park at 5:00 a.m.
Tuesday to transport members
of the Stanford community to
the induction center. Bus tic
kets will cost two dollars and
will be sold in White Plaza to
day at noon.

Leaders of the demonstrations
expect massive police opposi
tion, including privately hired
detectives.
The police are expected, for
instance, to jam the group's
walkie-talkies. Alternative
means of communication are be
ing arranged.
U.S. Attorney Cecil Poole
said, "We intend to keep the in
duction center open and the in
duction process proceeding." He
also announced he will not ac
cept the draft cards to be turned
in today.
He explained that although
there is no law against turning
in one's draft card, it is a viola
tiifh of the law for a draft age
person not to have it on his per
son.
Physicals For Two
Leonard Siegal, in a telephone
interview with The Daily, re
vealed two Stanford students
will be among the people at

tempting to enter the center to
take physicals.
He refused to reveal their
names in order to prevent any
reprisals against them.
Folk singer Joan Baez an
nounced in a press conference
she will lead a lie-in at the in
duction center today. She will
be leading a group of pacifists.
A demonstration will occur
simultaneously with the induc
tion center demonstration at
the Oakland draft board.
Silverman told The Daily
another week of demonstrations
is planned for December 4. "We
