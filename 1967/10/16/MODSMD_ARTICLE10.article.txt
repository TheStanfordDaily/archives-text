# Draft Resistance
## 
### 
America's patience is growing thin. Today one
voice of opposition to the Vietnam war moves
from dissent to resistance. "Stop the Draft"
week begins with almost one thousand men na
tionwide turning in their draft cards, refusing
to cooperate in anyway with the draft.
For some, resistance to the draft is opposition
to all conscription, while for others it is oppo
sition only to the Vietnam war or opposition to
all wars. For the two hundred men who will
turn their draft cards in at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco today, it is a day of deci
sion and far-reaching commitment.
We support these men in their act of con
science, in what they feel is the only means to
stop the Vietnam war. However, we cannot give
support to those who turn in their cards to op
pose all conscription or all wars. We must ack
nowledge the possibility of a defensive military
action. In such times conscription may be nec
essary to protect the national security by provid
ing the needed manpower for the defensive ac
tion.
The Vietnam war is not a defensive action
and can, in the terms used by the Resistance,
be called a "criminal activity."
We must first stop this war and then work for
a redefinition of America's questioned right and/
or responsibility to impose its judgments upon
nations around the world.
To refuse to serve in Vietnam is the first
step and to refuse to cooperate in any way with
the draft is the second. This is to profess that
the war is an immoral action for everyone. How
ever, it is not to force others to accept our judge
ment concerning the war.
The nation has the right to conscript men
in a defensive action of national emergency.

By accepting a prison term if that is judged
the legal penalty for non-cooperation with the
draft, these men are acknowledging that right.
Escape to Canada is a much more effective
way to avoid fighting in Vietnam, but that ne
gates the pressure non-cooperation today may
bring to bear on the administration.
Is non-cooperation with the draft the most
effective and perhaps the last means of in
fluencing the military and civilian leaders who
continue American involvement in Vietnam?
For those who firmly believe this, today is a
day of personal sacrifice unmatched in their
lives.
For those of us who cannot make the affirma
tion that this is the final or most effective pro
test open to us, the anguish of how to oppose
the war continues.

the war is an immoral action for everyone. How
ever, it is not to force others to accept our judge
ment concerning the war.
The nation has the right to conscript men
in a defensive action of national emergency.

By accepting a prison term if that is judged
the legal penalty for non-cooperation with the
draft, these men are acknowledging that right.
Escape to Canada is a much more effective
way to avoid fighting in Vietnam, but that ne
gates the pressure non-cooperation today may
bring to bear on the administration.
Is non-cooperation with the draft the most
effective and perhaps the last means of in
fluencing the military and civilian leaders who
continue American involvement in Vietnam?
For those who firmly believe this, today is a
day of personal sacrifice unmatched in their
lives.
For those of us who cannot make the affirma
tion that this is the final or most effective pro
test open to us, the anguish of how to oppose
the war continues.
America's patience is growing thin. Today one
voice of opposition to the Vietnam war moves
from dissent to resistance. "Stop the Draft"
week begins with almost one thousand men na
tionwide turning in their draft cards, refusing
to cooperate in anyway with the draft.
For some, resistance to the draft is opposition
to all conscription, while for others it is oppo
sition only to the Vietnam war or opposition to
all wars. For the two hundred men who will
turn their draft cards in at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco today, it is a day of deci
sion and far-reaching commitment.
We support these men in their act of con
science, in what they feel is the only means to
stop the Vietnam war. However, we cannot give
support to those who turn in their cards to op
pose all conscription or all wars. We must ack
nowledge the possibility of a defensive military
action. In such times conscription may be nec
essary to protect the national security by provid
ing the needed manpower for the defensive ac
tion.
The Vietnam war is not a defensive action
and can, in the terms used by the Resistance,
be called a "criminal activity."
We must first stop this war and then work for
a redefinition of America's questioned right and/
or responsibility to impose its judgments upon
nations around the world.
To refuse to serve in Vietnam is the first
step and to refuse to cooperate in any way with
the draft is the second. This is to profess that
the war is an immoral action for everyone. How
ever, it is not to force others to accept our judge
ment concerning the war.
