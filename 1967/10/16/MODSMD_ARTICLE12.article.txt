## Ban Or Burn Conservatives? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
While attending the Hoover
conference on "Fifty Years of
Communism in Russia," I had
the opportunity to read the in
teresting series of articles on the
Hoover Institution by Mr Philip
Taubman and the editorial of
October 12 Unfortunately the ar
ticles and editorial are better ex
amples of propaganda than jour
nalism: quotations from un
named professors, loaded
phrases: "no pressure for ob
jectivity at Hoover," "peculiar
approach to scholarship," "un
scholarly dogmatism," "scandal
of Stanford," "closed minded
ness which can hardly be con
sidered scholarly" (but no spe
cific criticism of Hoover scholar
ship).
The thought that views con
trary to their own can be pub
lished with impunity must be
rather painful for certain "lib
eral" members of the academic
community. At Stanford they
also have to rub shoulders with
conservatives who argue (unlike
Orwell's sheep) that four feet
are not necessarily good and two
feet not necesarily bad.
The answer the "liberals" pro
pose is to get rid of the con
servatives- in this case allow
the faculty to veto appointments
to the Hoover staff. Unfortunate
ly this would not solve the prob
lem: All that nasty old Hoover
Institution money would simply
go elsewhere. And even in the
Soviet Union authors can pub
lish through the samolzdate*

l'stvo, i.e., type and circulate
their manuscripts privately.
There really isn't very much
the "liberals" can do about the
whole thing. If it would make
them feel better, however, they
might purchase copies of th e
works embodying this "unschol
arly dogmatism" and burn them
in front of the Tresidder Union.
At the conclusion of the cere
mony, the participants should
give a smart Nazi salute and
shout, "Heil Hitler!" Instead of
the Nazi "one people, one Reich,
and one Fuhrer," they could also
demand a single "Wort, Wahr
heit, und Wahnsinn."

• Error In Names
Editor, The Daily:
My attention has been drawn
to the fact that my name ap
peared in the Oct. 10th issue of
the Stanford Daily amongst a
list of signatories of an adver
tisement expressing intent to
help resist the Draft.
I wish to make it known that
my name appeared in error and
without my permission having
been sought or given.

• President Mancall?
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Mr Mancall's state
ment calling members of the
government either fools or
knaves: If we have elected a
government of fools and knaves,

it sure says a lot for our intelli
gence, doesn't it.
It is pretty easy, I imagine,
for Mr. Mancall to condemn the
government. He doesn't have to
bear any responsibility for his
policies, as those in the govern
ment do.
It also seems to me that those
who have devoted the greater
part of their adult lives to the
study and practice of foreign
policy would know a little more
than Mr. Mancall gives them
credit for, but then I suppose
Mr. Mancall has been to Viet
nam, and accurately appraised
the situation, has confered with
all of the prominent world lead
ers, and has a backlog of experi
ence in foreign aflairs easily su
perior to that of the seasoned
"fools and knaves" in the state
department who have been deep
ly involved in the Vietnam situa
tion for nearly a decade, in
which case he no doubt has the
perfect solution to the whole
thing.
Why then is there any hesita
tion? Let the cry "Mancall for
President!" ring throughout the
land.

• Don't Isolate
Editor, The Daily:
Re: Professor David Levin's
Letter to the Editor of October
11, 1967. I write because I think
there is interest in hearing the
other side of the story and be
cause it was I who requested ac
creditation from the English de

partment for a proposed semi
nar in my house (Phi Sigma
Kappa) for this Autumn Quar
ter.
The stand made by the En
glish department, as I remember
it, was that they could accredit
only those courses that might
be taught in those living groups
whose memberships were select
ed by the university. For all oth
er living groups they could not.
Yet, in making this decision
they either ignore or regard as
unimportant one large fact. One
half or more of those students
living on campus live in fraterni
ties or operate in eating club"
Besides which, most of
students living off campus mus*
be regarded as belonging to "pri
vate clubs" because rarely does
the university choose the mem
bership of off-campus housing.
What Mr. Levin and comrades
are trying to do is to deny about
two-thirds of Stanford males the
right to participate in experi
ments in integrating education
and the living group.
They must believe that the
"private clubs" have nothing to
offer the general university in
this area. Or maybe they want
to use their positions to punish
these "clubs".
Finally it appears Mr. Levin
would isolate further the fra
ternities and other "private
clubs" from the academic com
munity. Lord knows they don't
need his help.
