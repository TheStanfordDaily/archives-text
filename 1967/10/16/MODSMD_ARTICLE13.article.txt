# Another Attempt
## Coach 'Dog' Ciao Wins But Loses 
### Herbie Hinckes 
Coach Knute "Dog" Ciao sur
veyed the sweating footballers
before him.
He turned suddenly and barked
at the players, "I thought I told
you bastards to lose."
Quarterback Gene Oregon
spoke for the team, "We did our
best, Coach."
"You did your best?" Dog
Ciao screamed. "You mean to
sit there and tell me you tried
to lose? Who do you think you
are. Notre Dame?"
"But I fumbled seven times,"
Oregon said.
"And I clipped a dozen men,
including the referee," end Jim
Crucifix volunteered.
"OK, OK, so you tried, but we
still won. Now we've won 60
per cent of our games and lost
only 40 per cent," Coach Ciao
said. "You know that we're
never supposed to win more
than 50 per cent."
"Sorry, Coach," Oregon an
swered. "We'll lose next week."
"Just remember that. If you
don't, I'll probably get fired,"
Ciao said as he nervously
fumbled with his dog tags.
"What's going to happen now,
Coach?
"For one thing, the alumni
will be excited about us going
to the Toilet Bowl on New Year's
Day.
"But if we get their hopes
up," Ciao reminded them, "and
we don't come through . .
A sleek blue Cadillac drove
up. "Take an alumnus to lunch,"
was painted on its hood. "Make
all checks payable to Stanford
University," was carefully in
scribed on the roof. A bumper
sticker read "Eat at Tresidder."
The driver got out and leaped
through a locker room window.
"It's President Tarnished," a
player shouted as the team
snapped to attention.
"Relax, boys," the president
said. "This isn't ROTC.
"Dog, you won," Tarnished ac
cused Ciao.
"Sorry, chief."
"Not only did you win, but the
score was 31-10. Now I'll be get
ting calls all week demanding
that the team go to the Toilet
Bowl in Pasadena.
"Remember our agreement,

Dog, you're supposed to win be
tween 33 and 50 percent of your
games every season. Win any
fewer and the alumni will be on
our backs to hire a new team."
Tarnished shuddered. "And to do
that we would have to lower our
admission standards.
"Win any more than 50 percent
and they'll expect to win all the
time." Tarnished shuddered
again. "And that means we will
have to admit a gang of hairy
apes to have a constantly win
ning team."
"It's a problem, Chief," Ciao
said.
"It certainly is. What we need
is an exceptionally mediocre
team. I wish I knew the an
swer," Tarnished said.
Suddenly the trunk of the Cad
illac flew open and a small man
in a dark suit alighted. Across
his breast were the initials A-M
and under his arm was a book
entitled "Answers."
He ran to the locker room
window and climbed in.
"Who areyou?" the players
asked.
He brushed himself off. "I'm
Herbert Stuffer, head of the
Study of Anything at Stanford
(SAS), and I have the answer."
He proudly pointed to the A-M
initials on his shirt, "That stands
for Answer-Man."
"Tell me, Stuffer, how can we
have a consistently mediocre
team?" Tarnished queried.
"There's a simple answer to
to the problem. Let me use the
war in Vietnam as an example."
"Herbert, what does Vietnam
have to do with football?"
"There are two teams, the U.S.
and the Viet Cong. The U.S.
team wants very much to win,
but it's a little out of its ele
ment. If they were back in Nor
mandy or Iwo Jima, they'd be
cleaning up.
"But they're not trained for
hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. So
they win only 33 to 50 per cent
of the time."
"Well, Herbert, our goal is to
win between 33 and 50 per cent
of the games, so what do we do
with the football team?"
"Train them for/ a different
sport Make them the best base
ball players in the world"
"Brilliant, Stuffer, brilliant!
We'll be out there every Satur
day trying our hardest to win
and no one can complain that
we don't train our players well,"
Tarnished beamed "Thanks
Stuffer"
Stuffer jumped out the win
dow and scrambled back into the
Cadillac's trunk.
"Wonder if he ever played in
the Little League," Tarnished
mused.

that we would have to lower our
admission standards.
"Win any more than 50 percent
and they'll expect to win all the
time." Tarnished shuddered
again. "And that means we will
have to admit a gang of hairy
apes to have a constantly win
ning team."
"It's a problem, Chief," Ciao
said.
"It certainly is. What we need
is an exceptionally mediocre
team. I wish I knew the an
swer," Tarnished said.
Suddenly the trunk of the Cad
illac flew open and a small man
in a dark suit alighted. Across
his breast were the initials A-M
and under his arm was a book
entitled "Answers."
He ran to the locker room
window and climbed in.
"Who areyou?" the players
asked.
He brushed himself off. "I'm
Herbert Stuffer, head of the
Study of Anything at Stanford
(SAS), and I have the answer."
He proudly pointed to the A-M
initials on his shirt, "That stands
for Answer-Man."
"Tell me, Stuffer, how can we
have a consistently mediocre
team?" Tarnished queried.
"There's a simple answer to
to the problem. Let me use the
war in Vietnam as an example."
"Herbert, what does Vietnam
have to do with football?"
"There are two teams, the U.S.
and the Viet Cong. The U.S.
team wants very much to win,
but it's a little out of its ele
ment. If they were back in Nor
mandy or Iwo Jima, they'd be
cleaning up.
"But they're not trained for
hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. So
they win only 33 to 50 per cent
of the time."
"Well, Herbert, our goal is to
win between 33 and 50 per cent
of the games, so what do we do
with the football team?"
"Train them for/ a different
sport Make them the best base
ball players in the world"
"Brilliant, Stuffer, brilliant!
We'll be out there every Satur
day trying our hardest to win
and no one can complain that
we don't train our players well,"
Tarnished beamed "Thanks
Stuffer"
Stuffer jumped out the win
dow and scrambled back into the
Cadillac's trunk.
"Wonder if he ever played in
the Little League," Tarnished
mused.
Coach Knute "Dog" Ciao sur
veyed the sweating footballers
before him.
He turned suddenly and barked
at the players, "I thought I told
you bastards to lose."
Quarterback Gene Oregon
spoke for the team, "We did our
best, Coach."
"You did your best?" Dog
Ciao screamed. "You mean to
sit there and tell me you tried
to lose? Who do you think you
are. Notre Dame?"
"But I fumbled seven times,"
Oregon said.
"And I clipped a dozen men,
including the referee," end Jim
Crucifix volunteered.
"OK, OK, so you tried, but we
still won. Now we've won 60
per cent of our games and lost
only 40 per cent," Coach Ciao
said. "You know that we're
never supposed to win more
than 50 per cent."
"Sorry, Coach," Oregon an
swered. "We'll lose next week."
"Just remember that. If you
don't, I'll probably get fired,"
Ciao said as he nervously
fumbled with his dog tags.
"What's going to happen now,
Coach?
"For one thing, the alumni
will be excited about us going
to the Toilet Bowl on New Year's
Day.
"But if we get their hopes
up," Ciao reminded them, "and
we don't come through . .
A sleek blue Cadillac drove
up. "Take an alumnus to lunch,"
was painted on its hood. "Make
all checks payable to Stanford
University," was carefully in
scribed on the roof. A bumper
sticker read "Eat at Tresidder."
The driver got out and leaped
through a locker room window.
"It's President Tarnished," a
player shouted as the team
snapped to attention.
"Relax, boys," the president
said. "This isn't ROTC.
"Dog, you won," Tarnished ac
cused Ciao.
"Sorry, chief."
"Not only did you win, but the
score was 31-10. Now I'll be get

that the team go to the Toilet
Bowl in Pasadena.
"Remember our agreement,

Dog, you're supposed to win be

games every season. Win any
fewer and the alumni will be on

Tarnished shuddered. "And to do

Coach Knute "Dog" Ciao sur
veyed the sweating footballers
before him.
He turned suddenly and barked
at the players, "I thought I told
you bastards to lose."
Quarterback Gene Oregon
spoke for the team, "We did our
best, Coach."
"You did your best?" Dog
Ciao screamed. "You mean to
sit there and tell me you tried
to lose? Who do you think you
are. Notre Dame?"
"But I fumbled seven times,"
Oregon said.
"And I clipped a dozen men,
including the referee," end Jim
Crucifix volunteered.
"OK, OK, so you tried, but we
still won. Now we've won 60
per cent of our games and lost
only 40 per cent," Coach Ciao
said. "You know that we're
never supposed to win more
than 50 per cent."
"Sorry, Coach," Oregon an
swered. "We'll lose next week."
"Just remember that. If you
don't, I'll probably get fired,"
Ciao said as he nervously
fumbled with his dog tags.
"What's going to happen now,
Coach?
"For one thing, the alumni
will be excited about us going
to the Toilet Bowl on New Year's
Day.
"But if we get their hopes
up," Ciao reminded them, "and
we don't come through . .
A sleek blue Cadillac drove
up. "Take an alumnus to lunch,"
was painted on its hood. "Make
all checks payable to Stanford
University," was carefully in
scribed on the roof. A bumper
sticker read "Eat at Tresidder."
The driver got out and leaped
through a locker room window.
"It's President Tarnished," a
player shouted as the team
snapped to attention.
"Relax, boys," the president
said. "This isn't ROTC.
"Dog, you won," Tarnished ac
cused Ciao.
"Sorry, chief."
"Not only did you win, but the
score was 31-10. Now I'll be get
ting calls all week demanding
that the team go to the Toilet
Bowl in Pasadena.
"Remember our agreement,

Dog, you're supposed to win be
tween 33 and 50 percent of your
games every season. Win any
fewer and the alumni will be on
our backs to hire a new team."
Tarnished shuddered. "And to do
that we would have to lower our
admission standards.
"Win any more than 50 percent
and they'll expect to win all the
time." Tarnished shuddered
again. "And that means we will
have to admit a gang of hairy
apes to have a constantly win
ning team."
"It's a problem, Chief," Ciao
said.
"It certainly is. What we need
is an exceptionally mediocre
team. I wish I knew the an
swer," Tarnished said.
Suddenly the trunk of the Cad
illac flew open and a small man
in a dark suit alighted. Across
his breast were the initials A-M
and under his arm was a book
entitled "Answers."
He ran to the locker room
window and climbed in.
"Who areyou?" the players
asked.
He brushed himself off. "I'm
Herbert Stuffer, head of the
Study of Anything at Stanford
(SAS), and I have the answer."
He proudly pointed to the A-M
initials on his shirt, "That stands
for Answer-Man."
"Tell me, Stuffer, how can we
have a consistently mediocre
team?" Tarnished queried.
"There's a simple answer to
to the problem. Let me use the
war in Vietnam as an example."
"Herbert, what does Vietnam
have to do with football?"
"There are two teams, the U.S.
and the Viet Cong. The U.S.
team wants very much to win,
but it's a little out of its ele
ment. If they were back in Nor
mandy or Iwo Jima, they'd be
cleaning up.
"But they're not trained for
hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. So
they win only 33 to 50 per cent
of the time."
"Well, Herbert, our goal is to
win between 33 and 50 per cent
of the games, so what do we do
with the football team?"
"Train them for/ a different
sport Make them the best base
ball players in the world"
"Brilliant, Stuffer, brilliant!
We'll be out there every Satur
day trying our hardest to win
and no one can complain that
we don't train our players well,"
Tarnished beamed "Thanks
Stuffer"
Stuffer jumped out the win
dow and scrambled back into the
Cadillac's trunk.
"Wonder if he ever played in
the Little League," Tarnished
mused.
