# Chappie Staff Plans Change In Format

### 
Is humor dead at Stanford?
And maybe sex too?
The editor of Stanford's
humor magazine is afraid it is
and plans to drastically alter the
format and makeup of the Chap
arral to make it a combination
of the New Yorker, Ramparts,
and Esquire.
The Chaparral sold out only
their first of four issues last
year. "Chapparral as the old
campus humor magazine is just
not appreciated now,' says Mike
Rugg, Editor.
Layboy Success
"Three years ago Layboy was
a great success and having
Carol Doda (centerfold) come
on campus to autograph the
copies was a big hit. But this
kind of thing doesn't go over
now," he continued.
Last year's final editions
(Groin, late winter quarter, and

Crash Comics, late spring quar
ter) now lay substantially un
sold in the Chappie office in the
Storke Publications Building.
The "new look" for the Chap
pie will involve "better humor,
straight essays, art work" and
whatever else anyone wishes to
contribute, according to Rugg.
"And we wouldn't mind being
a sort of political forum for
people either."
The new Chappie is being de
signed to take over some of the
functions of the Sequoia, Stan

ford's defunct literary maga
zine, but not conflict with the
Daily or the Workshop.
Rugg states that the Chappie
would like to publish one issue
a quarter this year with the
first coming out late in Novem
ber.
He is looking for an editorial
board and particularly for con
tributors who will define what
type of magazine Chappie is to
be. Contributions are being
taken by the bookkeeper in the
Storke Building.
