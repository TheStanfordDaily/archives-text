# Sophomore Shoots Self
## 
### 
A Stanford sophomore died
early yesterday morning from
head wounds apparently self-in
flicted.
John E. Meyer, 18, of Des
Moines, lowa, was found shortly
after midnight in Beta Chi house,
where he lived. He was rushed to
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital, but
died at about 5:30 a.m. without
regaining consciousness.
The death was ruled an ap
parent suicide by the County
Coroner's office, after an investi
gation by Santa Clara County
sheriff's deputies.
Meyer's weapon was a .38 cali
ber revolver. University policy
prohibits keeping firearms in res
idences.
Meyer was a German major
and had planned to attend Stan
ford in Germany next year. He
spent last summer here.
According to one acquaintance,
Meyer wrote a long paper deal
ing with suicide shortly before
his death.
He was described as a quiet
student with few close friends.
The funeral is to take place in
Des Moines. No date has been set.
He is survived by his mother and
two sisters.
