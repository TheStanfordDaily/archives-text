# GI Today Bigger, Younger, Smarter

WASHINGTON (AP) — A
former U.S. commander in Viet
nam said recently the modern
soldier is younger, bigger, better
educated and more likely to sur
vive in combat than his prede
cessors.
Maj. Gen. W. E. DePuy, who
headed the Ist Infantry Division
in Vietnam until assuming a
Pentagon assignment this year,
drew a statistical picture of to
day's serviceman for the Asso
ciation of the United States
Army.
DePuy said the average U.S.
draftee or enlistee serving in
Vietnam is 20 years and four
months old — four to five years
younger than those serving in
previous wars.
Men in Vietnam also have a
high school education and per
haps college experience, he said.
In Korea the average U.S.
serviceman was a high school
graduate; in World War II he
had one or more years high
school; in World War I he had
finished the eighth grade.

The most obvious advantage
of this higher level of education,
DePuy said, is that "these sol
diers can absorb adequate train
ing in less time, or more import
antly, they can be given more
training in the same time as
was afforded to their prede
cessors."
