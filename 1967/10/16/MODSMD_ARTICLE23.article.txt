## San Jose Drowns Indian Poloists 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
San Jose State handed Stan
ford water poloists their first
loss of the season, 8-4, Friday
night in the Spartans' shallow
end pool. The Indians beat Foot
hill 18-G and UOP 8-2, in other
games last weekend.
Stanford faces yet-undefeated
UCLA Saturday at Stanford, in
a must game to stay in the race
for the national championship.
San Jose used a sloughing de
fense perfectly adapted to San
Jose's tank—slightly over half
the size of Stanford's pool. In
the cramped quarters, a guard
can "slough" or double team the
ball handler without leaving his
own man wide open for a pass.
Clog Up Fast Break
The Spartans effectively jam
med the narrow pool, clogging
up the Cards' fast break and
forcing the Indians into a delib
erate game, particularly suscep
tible to the slough.
The Indians, who usually
shoot 40 to 50 per cent, could
get only four shots out of 23
past Spartan goalie Bob Likins.

Captain Gary Sheerer scored all
four Stanford goals.
Greg Buckingham stood out
on defense for the Indians, steal
ing the ball from Spartan ball
carriers 7 times.
San Jose's front line contains
Greg Hind, a teammate of
Sheerer on the Pan Am team,
and five other players with sum
mer water polo experience.
No Dice
San Jose's pool has earned a
reputation that has led USC,
Cal, and Foothill to adopt a
policy not to play the Spartans
at home.
Stanford faces UC at Irvine
Friday at 3:30, here. Irvine beat
USC early in the season. UCLA
barely scraped by USC, 7-6, in
the last minute of play. The
Bruins, undefeated last year, hit
Stanford at 10 a.m. Saturday.
Frosh Victorious
The Stanford frosh racked up
two more wins, downing Foot
hill's JV's 15-5 and San Jose's
frosh, 13-10. Mitch Ivey and
Rick Eagleston teammates in
high school, hit five goals apiece
in each of the two games.


GET THAT BALL!: Greg Buckingham, Stanford water pololst, approaches the ball during the game
with San Jose State Friday night The Spartans handed the Cardinal team their first loss of the 1967
season. Buckingham contributed an outstanding defensive effort, stealing the ball from State water
poloists 7 times during the evening, but the Indians found themselves too hampered by the small size
of the Spartan pool. The Stanford squad will face undefeated UCLA next Saturday in a game crucial
for national standing.

UCLA Saturday at Stanford, in
a must game to stay in the race
for the national championship.
San Jose used a sloughing de
fense perfectly adapted to San
Jose's tank—slightly over half
the size of Stanford's pool. In
the cramped quarters, a guard
can "slough" or double team the
ball handler without leaving his
own man wide open for a pass.
Clog Up Fast Break
The Spartans effectively jam
med the narrow pool, clogging
up the Cards' fast break and
forcing the Indians into a delib
erate game, particularly suscep
tible to the slough.
The Indians, who usually
shoot 40 to 50 per cent, could
get only four shots out of 23
past Spartan goalie Bob Likins.

Captain Gary Sheerer scored all
four Stanford goals.
Greg Buckingham stood out
on defense for the Indians, steal
ing the ball from Spartan ball
carriers 7 times.
San Jose's front line contains
Greg Hind, a teammate of
Sheerer on the Pan Am team,
and five other players with sum
mer water polo experience.
No Dice
San Jose's pool has earned a
reputation that has led USC,
Cal, and Foothill to adopt a
policy not to play the Spartans
at home.
Stanford faces UC at Irvine
Friday at 3:30, here. Irvine beat
USC early in the season. UCLA
barely scraped by USC, 7-6, in
the last minute of play. The
Bruins, undefeated last year, hit
Stanford at 10 a.m. Saturday.
Frosh Victorious
The Stanford frosh racked up
two more wins, downing Foot
hill's JV's 15-5 and San Jose's
frosh, 13-10. Mitch Ivey and
Rick Eagleston teammates in
high school, hit five goals apiece
in each of the two games.


GET THAT BALL!: Greg Buckingham, Stanford water pololst, approaches the ball during the game
with San Jose State Friday night The Spartans handed the Cardinal team their first loss of the 1967
season. Buckingham contributed an outstanding defensive effort, stealing the ball from State water
poloists 7 times during the evening, but the Indians found themselves too hampered by the small size
of the Spartan pool. The Stanford squad will face undefeated UCLA next Saturday in a game crucial
for national standing.
San Jose State handed Stan
ford water poloists their first
loss of the season, 8-4, Friday
night in the Spartans' shallow
end pool. The Indians beat Foot
hill 18-G and UOP 8-2, in other
games last weekend.
