# Williams Aerials Stun Cougars
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Led by the pinpoint passing
of Chuck Williams, Stanford
bounced back from a 10-0 first
quarter deficit to win its first
conference game of the year
over Washington State, 31-10,
Saturday.
Williams, who was unani
mously named the Back-of-the-
Game, entered the game at the
onset of the second quarter and
drove the Indians to a half-time
tie, 1010, completing 8 for 11 in
the one quarter.
First Quarter Fiasco
The first quarter had been all
Washington State, with the
Cougars scoring twice, largely
due to the fumbling Indians.
There were five ball handling
errors, with WSU getting the
ball twice.
WSU Gets There First
WSU garnered their first
touchdown from a drive
started on the Stanford
when Del Carmichael burst two
yards up the Stanford middle
for the score.
Hank Grenda converted for
WSU and three minutes later
gave the crowd another look
at®his soccer-style kicking, as
he booted a 27 yard field goat
Stanford fumbled on it own 28.
The ball had been marked for
play only twice during the en
tire first quarter in WSU ter
ritory, on the last two plays of
the period; but this was enough
to set the pattern for the second
quarter.
The usual game plan of Nate
Kirtman to the outside and
Jack Root to the inside was
bottled up by an eight-man de
fensive line.
"If You've Got Two ..
At this point, Coach John
Ralston commented after the
game, "When one quarterback
doesn't work, you try the other,
and Chuck Williams really
sparked us home."
The first Stanford drive of the
game stalled when a fumble
gave the Indians a fourth down

situation on the Cougar 17. Bill
Shoemaker salvaged three
points from this drive with a
32 yard field goal.
The next time Stanford got
the ball was a different story.
The Indians drove 76 yards in
17 plays, four of them being
Williams to Gene Washington
pass completions.

The Tie-Maker

The TD was a Williams-Wash
ington combination for seven
yards, and Shoemaker tied the
game with a conversion kick.
Sophomore Pat Preston picked
off a WSU pass and returned
the ball to the Cougar 31, set
ting up the Stanford go-ahead
score early in the third quarter.
Jim Cross came within inches
of getting the score taking a
Williams pass to the one yard
line.
With inches to go, Stanford
gave the ball to Root, as usual;
and the plunging fullback put
Stanford ahead to stay. The con
version made it 17-10.

WSU was forced to punt on
its next series, and a good re
turn by Tom Massey gave the
Indians excellent field position
at the WSU 36.
Enter Cass, Stage Left
Two minutes later it was Wil
liams hitting Bruce Cass on a
slant-in pattern. Coach Ralston
commented after the game that
Cass has been "hiding in the
wings" until this game, behind
Bob Conrad last year and Jim
Cross this year.
The Stanford defense, after a
first quarter lapse that was
sadly reminiscent of the USC
game, really iced the game in
the final period.
Don Parish and Marty Brill,
respectively Lineman • of - the *
Game and runner-up for the
honor, had a hand in almost
everything the Cougars tried to
do.
Phil Schneider, 'who also re

ceived votes for Lineman-of-the-
Game, dumped Cougar QB
Jerry Henderson three times in
the closing part of the game,
twice causing incomplete passes
and once nearly getting a safety.
With 40 seconds to go, Wil
liams capped the victory with
his third TD pass of the day.
Bill Shoemaker caught it and
the conversion made the final
score 31-10.
Improvements
The victory left the Indians'
record at 3-2, with the UCLA
Bruins to be faced next week.
This week, for the first time,
the improvement of many indi
viduals sparked the Cards to a
victory.
The kicking game of Bill
Shoemaker and Bob Reilnhard
was at its best yet; the passing
game shown; and the defense
dug in to stop the Cougars cold
in the last three quarters.


WASHINGTON TELLS STORY: Flanker Back Gene Washington goes high In the air to pull down this
pans from Stanford quarterback Chuck Williams. Readying hlmseH to tackle Washington when he
cor ties down with the ball is Cougar safety Mike Cadigan. This scene was repeated throughout the
dav with Washington snagging five of Williams' fourteen completions. This revitalized Cardinal pass
ing attack was largely responsible for the 31-10 victory over Washington State. The win was the first
favorable conference decision for Stanford this year.
