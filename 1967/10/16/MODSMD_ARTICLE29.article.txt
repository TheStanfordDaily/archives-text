# Washington State's Coach Clark Expresses Bitterness In Defeat
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The locker room of a losing
coach is seldom the scene of
anything more gleeful than se
d ate speculating about "what
n light-have-happened."
Last Saturday, the Washing
ton State visiting locker room
devoid of speculation, in
fact it was strictly bitter-city.
In fact Cougar mentor Bert
Clark had some very positive,
riegative answers for the ques
tioning reporters. "As it looks
now, we shouldn't even be play
ing in this conference."
A Big Problem
In effect stating, "Who wants

to go to school in Pullman,"
Clark said, "Our biggest prob
lem is not having one good, out
standing, offensive ballplayer.
"Washington State has the
hardest recruiting problems in
the conference because of our
location; and, thus, our program
has not progressed to the extent
that others have."
Clark concurred with the re
porters that Stanford had in
deed "worked" on the side of
Cougar defensive back Gerry
Herron. He then added that in
the third quarter "we were ob
viously out-fought and what

was even more discouraging,
out-couraged as well."
"I don't know what offense or
defense to call to stop Stanford
when it has a guy like Wash
ington do what he did today,"
Clark pondered.
Actually he might have tried
what Stanford tried in vain to
do when the Cougars had a man
named Clancy Williams, who
really kind of liked Pullman.
Clark was so busy lambasting
his players that no one dared
ask what league Stanford
should usually be in, seeing as
how this was the first Indian
victory over the Cougars since
1956.
