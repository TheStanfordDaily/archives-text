# Century 21 Seeks Student Support
## 
### 
Century 21, the lecture series
on modern society has called a
meeting today at 4 p.m. in Tres
idder to enlist students to work
on the program.
Spokesmen for Century 21 ex
plained Friday that the program
has done little so far besides
sponsor lectures because of the
lack of student participation.
The year-long series, directed
by history instructor C. S. Wal
lia, will present its third lecture
Wednesday with Prof. Paul R.
Ehrlich speaking on "Trends in
Population and Food Resources."
Earlier speeches were by Buck
minster Fuller and L. L. Whyte.
But none of the ambitious
plans to organize seminars to
supplement the lectures have
materialized. Other plans, such
as film series and elaborate ex
hibits in Tresidder on the Cen
tury 21 themes, have not yet
been started.
A proposed geodesic dome in
the patio behind Tresidder has
encountered planning difficulties.
The University Public Exer
cises Committee has given Wal
lia $18,000 to finance Century 21.
Wallia has projected a budget

of $60,000, and hopes to raise
the rest of the money from Tres
idder Union corporations foun
dations.
Student Ideas Sought
The meeting today will "bring
the ideas and suggestions of stu
dents to bear on the context of
Century 21 activities," according
to Ewa K. Kujawski, chairman
of the Tresidder Union Board,
which supervises Century 21.

"The broadest possible student
involvement" is required to "ex
pand the format," according to
Century 21.
After an "orientation" talk, the
meeting will break up into com
mittees to "begin working on
various aspects of expansion of
the program."
This is the second organiza
tional meeting of Century 21.
The first was Oct. 2.

Another difficulty cited was
the coverage of Century 21
events by The Dally. On Oct. 4,
The Daily's account of Buckmin
ster Fuller's address allegedly
contained several factual errors.
Century 21's use of its large
budget has been critcized by sev
eral student government officials.

They have expressed the opinion
privately that money spent to
bring well known speakers to
Stanford could be used better in
other ways.
Buckminster Fuller, who
spoke twice here Oct. 3-4 and at
tended several meals at student
residences, cost Century 21 about
$2,000 in fees and expenses.
