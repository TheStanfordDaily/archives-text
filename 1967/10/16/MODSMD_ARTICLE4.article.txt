# Nonstudents Okayed

BERKELEY (AP) — The Uni
versity of California authorized
attendance of nonstudents at a
Monday night "teach-in" in the
Student Union. The gathering is
billed as preliminary to an at
tempt by anti-draft advocates to
shut down the Oakland Induction
Center Tuesday.
Administration approval of ad
mission of nonstudents to the
Monday night meeting — set to
start at 11 p.m.—was announced
by Jan Blais, assistant dean of
students. The university on
Wednesday had granted permis
sion for the rally on condition
only students attend.
But Blais said the administra
tion's stand was modified after
the Assocated Students of the
University of California (ASUC)
took over sponsorship of the
"teach-in." The original sponsor

was the Students for a Democrat
ic Society, in effect acting for the
Committee for Draft Resistance.
Responsible
Blais noted that the ASUC is
the official student bodv organi
zation and thus enjoys rights and
responsibilities not accorded oth
er groups. He said he was confi
dent the ASUC would see that the
meeting is properly conducted.
Earlier the Senate of the Asso
ciated Students of the University
of California approved 12-7, a
resolution encouraging students
to participate "as they see fit" in
a proposed Stop the Draft Week
program.
The resolution condemned the
draft saying "draftees are being
forced to fight in a war which
neither we nor the draftees can
indorse, condone, or accept."
Alameda County supervisors
said they would seek a court or
der Monday restraining the uni
versity from permitting an all
night antidraft teach-in on the
Berkeley campus.
Stop The Draft Week
The teach-in, scheduled to start
midnight Monday, is part of an
announced nationwide "Stop the
Draft Week." Organizers planned
a march from the teach-in on the
campus, where draft cards have
ber>n publicly burned twice in the
last two weeks, to Oakland for a
sit-in designed to shut down the
induction center, site of repeated
picketing and demonstrations for
months.
In a letter Mayor John H. Read
ing called on the people of Oak
land to help authorities "mini
mize any disturbance caused by
outside elements . . . some of
whom are openly committed to
law violations."
"Leaders of the movement have
announced plans to bring several
thousand people into Oakland to
stage a concerted effort to close
the Armed Forces Induction Cen

ter which happens to be located
in our city," the mayor said.
"These people are coming from
as far away as Oregon, Washing
ton and Nevada."
Mayor Reading alerted the en
tire Oakland police department
and said he had pledges of help,
if needed, from the Alameda
County sheriff's office and state
agencies.
No Police
No special police precautions
were announced for Berkeley or
the University of California cam
pus which became the center of a
hullabaloo reminiscent of the
Free Speech Movement days of
1964.
