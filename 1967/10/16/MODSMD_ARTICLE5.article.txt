# Downtown Traffic Pattern Changed
## 
### 
University Avenue will be
closed to traffic between High
St.and Webster St. beginning
this morning.
The move is one of several
designed to test the concentra
tion and patience of local driv
ers, as Palo Alto begins a trial
one-way traffic loop in the down
town area.
The new counter-clockwise
traffic pattern will involve Ham
ilton Ave., Webster St., Lytton
Ave. and High St.
Downtown merchants, who
urged City Council to try the
system, believe people will find
shopping more congenial with
out the through traffic.
The major benefit will be the
avoidance of eight traffic
lights on University between
Webster and High Sts., accord

ing to City Traffic Engineer Ted
Noguchi.
Drivers will still be allowed
to use University Ave., but they
must enter it from side streets.
Exits will be permitted at either
end.
Drivers heading for points
north of Stanford via the Uni
versity Avenue underpass may
want to make the turn at Alma
Street instead of having to go
right on High, then left on Ham
ilton, and then left on Emerson
to get across University.
Parking meters on the
"wrong" side of the major
streets, such as Hamilton's
north side and Lytton's south
side, will not be in use until
revised parking stalls can be
painted on these streets some
time next week.
