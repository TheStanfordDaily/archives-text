# Lyman Seeks Students For Committee Work
## 
### 
Associated Students President
Peter Lyman soon will nomin
ate students for 31 positions on
advisory committees to Presi
dent Sterling and six places on
Academic Council committees.
Applications Today
Applications for the positions
are available today in the ASSU
office. Interviews will be sched
uled later this week.
Lyman has not yet decided
whether he will nominate one
or two students for each open
ing on the 11 "presidential" com
mittees and subcommittee.
Sterling has asked Lyman to
nominate two students for each
opening, in line with long-stand
ing practice. Sterling would then
select the committee members
from the nominees.
Last year ASSU President
David Harris nominated only
one student for each position,
claiming the student govern

ment should have sole power to
appoint student members of
such committees.
At that time Frederic O. Glov
er, Sterling's executive assis
tant, said Harris had disre
garded "presidential ground
rules" for the selection. Sterling
chose some student members
for the committees who were
not among Harris's nominees,
touching off a long controversy.
The basic issue of who selects
the student members remains un
resolved .Lyman has expressed
agreement with Harris's view
that students should have com
plete power to appoint student
members.
But Glover wrote Lyman Oct.
5 that "As has been the case in
past years, the President expects
to receive twice as many nomi
nations as there are places to be
filled on committees . .
Glover also said, "... the Presi
dent reserves the right to name
students to the committees other
than those nominated by the
President of the student body."
No Dispute Expected
No dispute is expected over the
faculty's Academic Council com
mittees on undergraduate educa
tion and general studies. Lyman
has been invited to name three
non-voting student members to
each. He is seeking to place stu
dents on other Academic Council
committees as well.
The presidential committees of
faculty, administrators and stu
dents "advise" Sterling and some
times assume an active policy
making role. Sterling will name
students to eight of the 16 presi
dential committees.
Lyman wants applications for
the following committees:
• Athletics, three student
members, advises on "intramural
and intercollegiate athletics."
• Editorial advisory of Stan
ford Today, one, "guiding edi
torial content of a publication
which goes to Stanford alumni."
• Foreign visitors and stu
dents, three.
• Public exercises, three "con

trols public University exerci
ses, lectures, assembles."
Its sub-committees are: public
ceremonies, two students; film
programs, two; special events,
two, university lecture series,
six.
• Public health, one.
• Student affairs and services,
three, "advises the Dean of Stu
dents and other officers concern
ed with student personnel in
matters relating to student life.
»»
• Financial aid, five.
Open To All
Lyman says he is open to ap
plications from graduates and
undergraduates, including fresh
men. "We don't want passive rep
resentation," he said. "We want
students serving on these com
mittees not because they want
to play the committee game, but
because they have ideas to put
forth."

The presidential committees of
faculty, administrators and stu
dents "advise" Sterling and some
times assume an active policy
making role. Sterling will name
students to eight of the 16 presi
dential committees.
Lyman wants applications for
the following committees:
• Athletics, three student
members, advises on "intramural
and intercollegiate athletics."
• Editorial advisory of Stan
ford Today, one, "guiding edi
torial content of a publication
which goes to Stanford alumni."
• Foreign visitors and stu
dents, three.
• Public exercises, three "con

trols public University exerci
ses, lectures, assembles."
Its sub-committees are: public
ceremonies, two students; film
programs, two; special events,
two, university lecture series,
six.
• Public health, one.
• Student affairs and services,
three, "advises the Dean of Stu
dents and other officers concern
ed with student personnel in
matters relating to student life.
»»
• Financial aid, five.
Open To All
Lyman says he is open to ap
plications from graduates and
undergraduates, including fresh
men. "We don't want passive rep
resentation," he said. "We want
students serving on these com
mittees not because they want
to play the committee game, but
because they have ideas to put
forth."
Associated Students President
Peter Lyman soon will nomin
ate students for 31 positions on
advisory committees to Presi
dent Sterling and six places on
Academic Council committees.
Applications Today
Applications for the positions
are available today in the ASSU
office. Interviews will be sched
uled later this week.
Lyman has not yet decided
whether he will nominate one
or two students for each open
ing on the 11 "presidential" com
mittees and subcommittee.
Sterling has asked Lyman to
nominate two students for each
opening, in line with long-stand
ing practice. Sterling would then
select the committee members
from the nominees.
Last year ASSU President
David Harris nominated only
one student for each position,
claiming the student govern

ment should have sole power to
appoint student members of
such committees.
At that time Frederic O. Glov
er, Sterling's executive assis
tant, said Harris had disre
garded "presidential ground
rules" for the selection. Sterling
chose some student members
for the committees who were
not among Harris's nominees,
touching off a long controversy.
The basic issue of who selects
the student members remains un
resolved .Lyman has expressed
agreement with Harris's view
that students should have com
plete power to appoint student
members.
But Glover wrote Lyman Oct.
5 that "As has been the case in
past years, the President expects
to receive twice as many nomi
nations as there are places to be
filled on committees . .
Glover also said, "... the Presi
dent reserves the right to name
students to the committees other
than those nominated by the
President of the student body."
No Dispute Expected
No dispute is expected over the
faculty's Academic Council com
mittees on undergraduate educa
tion and general studies. Lyman
has been invited to name three
non-voting student members to
each. He is seeking to place stu
dents on other Academic Council
committees as well.
