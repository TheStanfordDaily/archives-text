# Renovation Delayed
## HEW Holds Up Funds For Jordan Hall 
### DAN SNELL 
Jordan Hall on Outer Quad
is being slowly emptied of the
biologists, but the psychologists
have not yet moved in, largely
because of the federal govern
ment's refusal to release funds
for remodeling.
The $4.7 million renovation of
the building for the Department
of Psychology is being funded
mostly from University money.
But roughly $1.7 million has
been applied for and granted
from three branches of the fed
eral government.
The problem, according to Bill
McCammon of the Grants and
Facilities Administration Sec
tion in the Controller's office, is
that the regional office of the
Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare (HEW), recent
ly opened in San Francisco, is
being strict about letting new
contracts with government
money.
The University ha ; - already
been granted $1 miJilon from
the National Science Founda
tion, $522,000 from the National
Institutes of Health, and $210.-
000 from the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare
under the Higher Education
Facilities Act.
McCammon says the National

Science Foundation is very co
operative, and would be glad
for the University to start the
renovation of the building now.
But the other two government
agencies demand a long series
of checks before they will sign
over the money to Stanford.
And they would not pay for
anything the University started
building before they give their
approval.
"The delay is really nobody's
fault," McCammon said. "We
didn't know just what to ex
pect from the HEW regional
office, and they have been
issuing procedural bulletins at
a fast rate. I think I have about
33 bulletins that they've recently
issued."
The most recent requirements
Jordan Hall plans had to meet
were that the building be built
so handicapped people could use
it easily and it would be able
to withstand the highest flood
recorded in the area within the
last 50 years.
How long it will take to get
started on the renovation Mc-
Cammon said he could not say.
But the University is losing Vfe
per cent a month as construc
tion costs rise and the project
is not sent to bid.
A funding application like

Jordan Hall's goes first to the
State of California for approval
and then to Washington, where
the blueprints are studied and
sometimes changed. If the State
approves, according to McCam
mon, the contract is usually
awarded the grant in Washing
ton.
Stanford got a notice of
award for one of the grants for
Jordan last spring and another
in August. The University theft
had to give the HEW regional
office the working drawings for
the project, the blueprints which
the constructor will use.
The regional office has not yet
approved the drawings and the
rest of the "bid package," how
ever, and thus the University
cannot go ahead.
The next stop would be for
HEW in Washington to approve
a bid date and for the regional
office to assent to it. This last is
necessary because of an anti-in
flationary executive order issued
recently by the President to
check rising prices in the con
struction industry.

When the regional office has
given the go-ahead, Stanford can
accept bids for a month, study
the bids, and choose a contractor.
But the process does not end

there. The regional office of HEW
must clear the bidder the Univer
sity has chosen especially as re
gards equal opportunity employ
ment. If the University has not
chosen the lowest bidder, it must
explain in detail why.
If the regional office approves
the bidder and the reasons for his
having been chosen, then Stan
ford can at last sign the contract.
"That could come in mid-winter,"
McCammon said, "but it might be
later."
He estimated the University so
far is about two weeks behind
schedule on the project. Among
other things Stanford has
learned it has to take bids on all
moveable furnishings of the
building as well as the basic con
struction work.
The renovation of Encina Hall's
west wing for the Food Research
Institute may be tied up in gov
ernment red tape much like Jor
dan Hall, but the process has not
yet gone so far. The planned
Earth Sciences Building may also
run afoul of HEW when it is
closer to being ready for con
struction, according to McCam
mon.
"But I think the tightened re
strictions from the regional of
fice are something we'll get used
to in time," McCammon said.


GHOST TOWN? —No, just one of the old bio labs in Jordan Hall waiting to b«' torn out and replaced

HEW in Washington to approve
a bid date and for the regional

flationary executive order issued
recently by the President to
check rising prices in the con
struction industry.

When the regional office has
given the go-ahead, Stanford can
accept bids for a month, study
the bids, and choose a contractor.
But the process does not end

there. The regional office of HEW
must clear the bidder the Univer
sity has chosen especially as re
gards equal opportunity employ
ment. If the University has not
chosen the lowest bidder, it must
explain in detail why.
If the regional office approves
the bidder and the reasons for his
having been chosen, then Stan
ford can at last sign the contract.
"That could come in mid-winter,"
McCammon said, "but it might be
later."
He estimated the University so
far is about two weeks behind
schedule on the project. Among
other things Stanford has
learned it has to take bids on all
moveable furnishings of the
building as well as the basic con
struction work.
The renovation of Encina Hall's
west wing for the Food Research
Institute may be tied up in gov
ernment red tape much like Jor
dan Hall, but the process has not
yet gone so far. The planned
Earth Sciences Building may also
run afoul of HEW when it is
closer to being ready for con
struction, according to McCam
mon.
"But I think the tightened re
strictions from the regional of
fice are something we'll get used
to in time," McCammon said.


GHOST TOWN? —No, just one of the old bio labs in Jordan Hall waiting to b«' torn out and replaced
with the psych department. For details, read the story at right, Make your blood boll? Well, I should
say.
Jordan Hall on Outer Quad
is being slowly emptied of the
biologists, but the psychologists
have not yet moved in, largely
because of the federal govern
ment's refusal to release funds
for remodeling.
The $4.7 million renovation of
the building for the Department
of Psychology is being funded
mostly from University money.
But roughly $1.7 million has
been applied for and granted
from three branches of the fed
eral government.
The problem, according to Bill
McCammon of the Grants and
Facilities Administration Sec
tion in the Controller's office, is
that the regional office of the
Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare (HEW), recent
ly opened in San Francisco, is
being strict about letting new
contracts with government
money.
The University ha ; - already
been granted $1 miJilon from
the National Science Founda
tion, $522,000 from the National
Institutes of Health, and $210.-
000 from the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare
under the Higher Education
Facilities Act.
McCammon says the National

Science Foundation is very co
operative, and would be glad
for the University to start the
renovation of the building now.
But the other two government
agencies demand a long series
of checks before they will sign
over the money to Stanford.
And they would not pay for
anything the University started
building before they give their
approval.
"The delay is really nobody's
fault," McCammon said. "We
didn't know just what to ex
pect from the HEW regional
office, and they have been
issuing procedural bulletins at
a fast rate. I think I have about
33 bulletins that they've recently
issued."
The most recent requirements
Jordan Hall plans had to meet
were that the building be built
so handicapped people could use
it easily and it would be able
to withstand the highest flood
recorded in the area within the
last 50 years.
How long it will take to get
started on the renovation Mc-
Cammon said he could not say.
But the University is losing Vfe
per cent a month as construc
tion costs rise and the project
is not sent to bid.
A funding application like

Jordan Hall's goes first to the
State of California for approval
and then to Washington, where
the blueprints are studied and
sometimes changed. If the State
approves, according to McCam
mon, the contract is usually
awarded the grant in Washing
ton.
Stanford got a notice of
award for one of the grants for
Jordan last spring and another
in August. The University theft
had to give the HEW regional
office the working drawings for
the project, the blueprints which
the constructor will use.
The regional office has not yet
approved the drawings and the
rest of the "bid package," how
ever, and thus the University
cannot go ahead.

under the Higher Education
Facilities Act.
McCammon says the National

Science Foundation is very co
operative, and would be glad
for the University to start the
renovation of the building now.
But the other two government
agencies demand a long series
of checks before they will sign
over the money to Stanford.
And they would not pay for
anything the University started
building before they give their
approval.
"The delay is really nobody's
fault," McCammon said. "We
didn't know just what to ex
pect from the HEW regional
office, and they have been
issuing procedural bulletins at
a fast rate. I think I have about
33 bulletins that they've recently
issued."
The most recent requirements
Jordan Hall plans had to meet
were that the building be built
so handicapped people could use
it easily and it would be able
to withstand the highest flood
recorded in the area within the
last 50 years.
How long it will take to get
started on the renovation Mc-
Cammon said he could not say.
But the University is losing Vfe
per cent a month as construc
tion costs rise and the project
is not sent to bid.
A funding application like

Jordan Hall's goes first to the
State of California for approval
and then to Washington, where
the blueprints are studied and
sometimes changed. If the State
approves, according to McCam
mon, the contract is usually
awarded the grant in Washing
ton.
Stanford got a notice of
award for one of the grants for
Jordan last spring and another
in August. The University theft
had to give the HEW regional
office the working drawings for
the project, the blueprints which
the constructor will use.
The regional office has not yet
approved the drawings and the
rest of the "bid package," how
ever, and thus the University
cannot go ahead.
The next stop would be for
HEW in Washington to approve
a bid date and for the regional
office to assent to it. This last is
necessary because of an anti-in
flationary executive order issued
recently by the President to
check rising prices in the con
struction industry.

When the regional office has
given the go-ahead, Stanford can
accept bids for a month, study
the bids, and choose a contractor.
But the process does not end

there. The regional office of HEW
must clear the bidder the Univer
sity has chosen especially as re
gards equal opportunity employ
ment. If the University has not
chosen the lowest bidder, it must
explain in detail why.
If the regional office approves
the bidder and the reasons for his
having been chosen, then Stan
ford can at last sign the contract.
"That could come in mid-winter,"
McCammon said, "but it might be
later."
He estimated the University so
far is about two weeks behind
schedule on the project. Among
other things Stanford has
learned it has to take bids on all
moveable furnishings of the
building as well as the basic con
struction work.
The renovation of Encina Hall's
west wing for the Food Research
Institute may be tied up in gov
ernment red tape much like Jor
dan Hall, but the process has not
yet gone so far. The planned
Earth Sciences Building may also
run afoul of HEW when it is
closer to being ready for con
struction, according to McCam
mon.
"But I think the tightened re
strictions from the regional of
fice are something we'll get used
to in time," McCammon said.


GHOST TOWN? —No, just one of the old bio labs in Jordan Hall waiting to b«' torn out and replaced
with the psych department. For details, read the story at right, Make your blood boll? Well, I should
say.
Jordan Hall on Outer Quad
is being slowly emptied of the
biologists, but the psychologists
have not yet moved in, largely
because of the federal govern
ment's refusal to release funds
for remodeling.
The $4.7 million renovation of
the building for the Department
of Psychology is being funded
mostly from University money.
But roughly $1.7 million has
been applied for and granted
from three branches of the fed
eral government.
The problem, according to Bill
McCammon of the Grants and
Facilities Administration Sec
tion in the Controller's office, is
that the regional office of the
Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare (HEW), recent
ly opened in San Francisco, is
being strict about letting new
contracts with government
money.
The University ha ; - already
been granted $1 miJilon from
the National Science Founda
tion, $522,000 from the National
Institutes of Health, and $210.-
000 from the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare
under the Higher Education
Facilities Act.
