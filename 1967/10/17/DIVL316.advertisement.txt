SCHOLARSHIPS
BY COMPUTER
Last year $30 million in college schol
arships went unclaimed — because no
qualified persons applied . . . because
no qualified persons knew of them
• Now ECS engineers and educators
have programmed a high-speed com
puter with 700,000 items of scholastic
aid, worth over $500 million, to permit
students to easily and quickly locate
scholarships for which they qualify
• The student fills out a detailed, con
fidential questionnaire and returns it tD
ECS, with a one-time computer-proces
sing fee of $15. In seconds the compu
ter compares his qualifications against
requirements of grants set up by foun
dations, business, civic, fraternal, re
ligious, and government organizations,
and prints a personalized report to
the student telling him where and when
to apply for grants for which he qual
ifies. Thousands of these do not depend
on scholastic standing or financial need
