At 9:45 PM. EST on February 27, a Pan-American Boeing 727 jetliner
with 98 passengers on board made a fully automatic landing at John
F. Kennedy Airport in New York — the first operational automatic
landing in the history of aviation in the United States.
Sperry Flight Systems Division participated as a member of the
Boeing-Sperry engineering team which made this event possible. Our
SP-50 Automatic Flight Control System played a key role. It put the
Boeing //J down smooth as a feather,'' less than four feet to the
right of the runway s center line under conditions of snow and fog —
with a crosswind of twelve knots.
This is just another reason why Sperry Flight Systems Division is
recognized as the leader in the development of Flight Control Sys
tems and Flight Instruments and Displays. Our engineering team is
second to none.

At 9:45 PM. EST on February 27, a Pan-American Boeing 727 jetliner
with 98 passengers on board made a fully automatic landing at John
F. Kennedy Airport in New York — the first operational automatic
landing in the history of aviation in the United States.
Sperry Flight Systems Division participated as a member of the
Boeing-Sperry engineering team which made this event possible. Our
SP-50 Automatic Flight Control System played a key role. It put the
Boeing //J down smooth as a feather,'' less than four feet to the
right of the runway s center line under conditions of snow and fog —
with a crosswind of twelve knots.
This is just another reason why Sperry Flight Systems Division is
recognized as the leader in the development of Flight Control Sys
