# Stanford Students Surrender Cards In Draft Protest
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Nineteen members of the
Stanford community were
among 236 young men who yes
terday placed draft documents
in a basket and tried to present
them to U.S. District Attorney
Cecil Poole on the front steps
of the Federal Building in San
Francisco.
The men belong to the Re
sistance, an independent anti
draft movement, coordinated by
former student body president
David Harris, former student
Dennis Sweeney, and Lenny
Heller of Berkeley.
Poole came out on the front
steps of the Federal Building
but refused to accept the cards

or address the crowd of 1500
which had gathered to support
the non-cooperation.
Dumped At Feet
The leaders dumped the
basket of draft cards and docu
ments at his feet. After Poole
turned and reentered the build
ing, a large part of the crowd
followed him and nearly filled
the huge lobby of the building.
A group led by David Harris
took elevators to Poole's office
on the sixteenth floor to attempt
to present the basket again. On
discovering the office locked, the
group placed the basket of docu
ments in front of the door and
left. A newsman counted 236
documents, including 180 draft
cards in the basket.
The Resistance demonstration
was one of several in cities
throughout the nation. Harris
estimated that over one thous
and men turned in their cards
yesterday.
London Protest
In London several young men
pasted their draft cards to the
door of the U.S. Embassy as
part of the Resistance protest.
By turning in their draft
cards, the men subjected them
selves to a five year jail sen
tence and a large fine. As yet
no one has been convicted for
non-cooperation under the Selec
tive Service Act of 1967. The
first case comes up in San Fran
cisco next week.
Participating in the support
demonstration were Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier, Profes
sor of Religion Robert McAfee
Brown, History Professor Mark
Mancall, and others.
Basket of Cards
The demonstration began
when Harris and other leaders
climbed a few steps in front of
the Federal Building with a
microphone and a basket
covered with signs reading: "Re
sist." As men came forward to
place their cards in the basket,
Harris held it up and with the
other hand made the V for vic
tory sign.
The basket was then passed
through the crowd and large
cheers rose whenever someone
placed a draft card in the
basket. Harris told the crowd:


RESISTANCE —Gesturing "V for Victory," an estimated 1500 Re
sistance members and sympathizers cheered as their "brothers"
pushed forward to hand in their draft cards on the steps of the Fed
eral Building in San Francisco yesterday.
