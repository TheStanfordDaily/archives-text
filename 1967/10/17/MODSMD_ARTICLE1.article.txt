## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Nineteen members of the
Stanford community were
among 236 young men who yes
terday placed draft documents
in a basket and tried to present
them to U.S. District Attorney
Cecil Poole on the front steps
of the Federal Building in San
Francisco.
The men belong to the Re
sistance, an independent anti
draft movement, coordinated by
former student body president
David Harris, former student
Dennis Sweeney, and Lenny
Heller of Berkeley.
Poole came out on the front
steps of the Federal Building
but refused to accept the cards

or address the crowd of 1500
which had gathered to support
the non-cooperation.
Dumped At Feet
The leaders dumped the
basket of draft cards and docu
ments at his feet. After Poole
turned and reentered the build
ing, a large part of the crowd
followed him and nearly filled
the huge lobby of the building.
A group led by David Harris
took elevators to Poole's office
on the sixteenth floor to attempt
to present the basket again. On
discovering the office locked, the
group placed the basket of docu
ments in front of the door and
left. A newsman counted 236
documents, including 180 draft
cards in the basket.
The Resistance demonstration
was one of several in cities
throughout the nation. Harris
estimated that over one thous
and men turned in their cards
yesterday.
London Protest
In London several young men
pasted their draft cards to the
door of the U.S. Embassy as
part of the Resistance protest.
By turning in their draft
cards, the men subjected them
selves to a five year jail sen
tence and a large fine. As yet
no one has been convicted for
non-cooperation under the Selec
tive Service Act of 1967. The
first case comes up in San Fran
cisco next week.
Participating in the support
demonstration were Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier, Profes
sor of Religion Robert McAfee
Brown, History Professor Mark
Mancall, and others.
Basket of Cards
The demonstration began
when Harris and other leaders
climbed a few steps in front of
the Federal Building with a
microphone and a basket
covered with signs reading: "Re
sist." As men came forward to
place their cards in the basket,
Harris held it up and with the
other hand made the V for vic
tory sign.
The basket was then passed
through the crowd and large
cheers rose whenever someone
placed a draft card in the
basket. Harris told the crowd:


RESISTANCE —Gesturing "V for Victory," an estimated 1500 Re
sistance members and sympathizers cheered as their "brothers"
pushed forward to hand in their draft cards on the steps of the Fed
eral Building in San Francisco yesterday.
"What we say to a society of
racism and murder is no. The
struggle continues until there is
no instrument of military con
scription in this country."
Girls Say Yes
Members of the shouting
crowd carried signs reading "No
Draft No War," "The Draft
Means Death, Say No," and
"Girls Say Yes To Men Who
Say No."
During the rally which pre
ceded Poole's appearance on the
front steps, Leroy Boles an
nounced he would burn his dis
charge papers. When he did so,
an unidentified man rushed
through the crowd and angrily
grabbed the papers from him.
The crowd quickly surrounded

the man and retrieved the
papers from him. Two Federal
Building guards, the only police
in sight, led the man to safety.
In an interview with the Daily
outside Cecil Poole's office, Har
ris said the demonstration
"went very well. There were
many more than we expected."
Harris and others had earlier
estimated 200 men would turn
in draft cards.
When asked why Resistance
was trying to turn the cards
in to Poole, Harris stated "He's
the most available symbol of
the government which made us
carry these cards.
"But it is irrelevant whether
Cecil Poole takes these cards",
he continued, "The important
thing is that none of us are

ever going to carry a draft card
again."
Harris claimed most Resis
tance members were expressing
their opposition to the Vietnam
war. "But the thing that has
happened is that the people are
building a whole new way of
life," he said.
Asked if he intended to par
ticipate in the attempt to shut
down the Oakland Induction
Center this morning, Harris re
plied: "I think I'll watch but I
won't get arrested. I'm sure
many people from the Resis
tance will get busted in this, but
it is not one of our activities."
The Resistance now plans a
repeat demonstration of non-co
operation on December 4. Harris
says he hopes another 100 men
gather around the country and
again at San Francisco's Fed
eral Building to turn in their
draft cards on that day.
Asked about the possibility
that he might now go to jail,
Harris replied "If they lock me
up, they lock me up. But they'll
know that when I get out, I'll
do the same thing."
The Stanford students who
turned in their cards yeserday
were: Barry Kast, Dick Lee,
Dick Baxstresser, Jeff Brown
ing, Mark Silverman, Mark
Riley, Guy Smythe, Tom Gris
som, Mark Abel, and Chris
Ledfirerwoorl
A meeting of the Resistance
will be held tonight in Tres

The purpose of the meeting
is to ctiseuss the group's plans
for the near future.

of the Federal Building in San
Francisco.
The men belong to the Re

draft movement, coordinated by
former student body president
David Harris, former student
Dennis Sweeney, and Lenny
Heller of Berkeley.
Poole came out on the front
steps of the Federal Building
but refused to accept the cards

or address the crowd of 1500
which had gathered to support
the non-cooperation.
Dumped At Feet
The leaders dumped the
basket of draft cards and docu
ments at his feet. After Poole
turned and reentered the build
ing, a large part of the crowd
followed him and nearly filled
the huge lobby of the building.
A group led by David Harris
took elevators to Poole's office
on the sixteenth floor to attempt
to present the basket again. On
discovering the office locked, the
group placed the basket of docu
ments in front of the door and
left. A newsman counted 236
documents, including 180 draft
cards in the basket.
The Resistance demonstration
was one of several in cities
throughout the nation. Harris
estimated that over one thous
and men turned in their cards
yesterday.
London Protest
In London several young men
pasted their draft cards to the
door of the U.S. Embassy as
part of the Resistance protest.
By turning in their draft
cards, the men subjected them
selves to a five year jail sen
tence and a large fine. As yet
no one has been convicted for
non-cooperation under the Selec
tive Service Act of 1967. The
first case comes up in San Fran
cisco next week.
Participating in the support
demonstration were Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier, Profes
sor of Religion Robert McAfee
Brown, History Professor Mark
Mancall, and others.
Basket of Cards
The demonstration began
when Harris and other leaders
climbed a few steps in front of
the Federal Building with a
microphone and a basket
covered with signs reading: "Re
sist." As men came forward to
place their cards in the basket,
Harris held it up and with the
other hand made the V for vic
tory sign.
The basket was then passed
through the crowd and large
cheers rose whenever someone
placed a draft card in the
basket. Harris told the crowd:


RESISTANCE —Gesturing "V for Victory," an estimated 1500 Re
sistance members and sympathizers cheered as their "brothers"
pushed forward to hand in their draft cards on the steps of the Fed
eral Building in San Francisco yesterday.
"What we say to a society of
racism and murder is no. The
struggle continues until there is
no instrument of military con
scription in this country."
Girls Say Yes
Members of the shouting
crowd carried signs reading "No
Draft No War," "The Draft
Means Death, Say No," and
"Girls Say Yes To Men Who
Say No."
During the rally which pre
ceded Poole's appearance on the
front steps, Leroy Boles an
nounced he would burn his dis
charge papers. When he did so,
an unidentified man rushed
through the crowd and angrily
grabbed the papers from him.
The crowd quickly surrounded

the man and retrieved the
papers from him. Two Federal
Building guards, the only police
in sight, led the man to safety.
In an interview with the Daily
outside Cecil Poole's office, Har
ris said the demonstration
"went very well. There were
many more than we expected."
Harris and others had earlier
estimated 200 men would turn
in draft cards.
When asked why Resistance
was trying to turn the cards
in to Poole, Harris stated "He's
the most available symbol of
the government which made us
carry these cards.
"But it is irrelevant whether
Cecil Poole takes these cards",
he continued, "The important

covered with signs reading: "Re
sist." As men came forward to
place their cards in the basket,
Harris held it up and with the
other hand made the V for vic
tory sign.
The basket was then passed
through the crowd and large
cheers rose whenever someone
placed a draft card in the
basket. Harris told the crowd:


RESISTANCE —Gesturing "V for Victory," an estimated 1500 Re
sistance members and sympathizers cheered as their "brothers"
pushed forward to hand in their draft cards on the steps of the Fed
eral Building in San Francisco yesterday.
"What we say to a society of
racism and murder is no. The
struggle continues until there is
no instrument of military con
scription in this country."
Girls Say Yes
Members of the shouting
crowd carried signs reading "No
Draft No War," "The Draft
Means Death, Say No," and
"Girls Say Yes To Men Who
Say No."
During the rally which pre
ceded Poole's appearance on the
front steps, Leroy Boles an
nounced he would burn his dis
charge papers. When he did so,
an unidentified man rushed
through the crowd and angrily
grabbed the papers from him.
The crowd quickly surrounded

the man and retrieved the
papers from him. Two Federal
Building guards, the only police
in sight, led the man to safety.
In an interview with the Daily
outside Cecil Poole's office, Har
ris said the demonstration
"went very well. There were
many more than we expected."
Harris and others had earlier
estimated 200 men would turn
in draft cards.
When asked why Resistance
was trying to turn the cards
in to Poole, Harris stated "He's
the most available symbol of
the government which made us
carry these cards.
"But it is irrelevant whether
Cecil Poole takes these cards",
he continued, "The important
thing is that none of us are

ever going to carry a draft card
again."
Harris claimed most Resis
tance members were expressing
their opposition to the Vietnam
war. "But the thing that has
happened is that the people are
building a whole new way of
life," he said.
Asked if he intended to par
ticipate in the attempt to shut
down the Oakland Induction
Center this morning, Harris re
plied: "I think I'll watch but I
won't get arrested. I'm sure
many people from the Resis
tance will get busted in this, but
it is not one of our activities."
The Resistance now plans a
repeat demonstration of non-co
operation on December 4. Harris
says he hopes another 100 men
gather around the country and
again at San Francisco's Fed
eral Building to turn in their
draft cards on that day.
Asked about the possibility
that he might now go to jail,
Harris replied "If they lock me
up, they lock me up. But they'll
know that when I get out, I'll
do the same thing."
The Stanford students who
turned in their cards yeserday
were: Barry Kast, Dick Lee,
Dick Baxstresser, Jeff Brown

in a basket and tried to present
them to U.S. District Attorney

of the Federal Building in San
Francisco.
The men belong to the Re
sistance, an independent anti
draft movement, coordinated by
former student body president
David Harris, former student
Dennis Sweeney, and Lenny
Heller of Berkeley.
Poole came out on the front
steps of the Federal Building
but refused to accept the cards

or address the crowd of 1500
which had gathered to support
the non-cooperation.
Dumped At Feet
The leaders dumped the
basket of draft cards and docu
ments at his feet. After Poole
turned and reentered the build
ing, a large part of the crowd
followed him and nearly filled
the huge lobby of the building.
A group led by David Harris
took elevators to Poole's office
on the sixteenth floor to attempt
to present the basket again. On
discovering the office locked, the
group placed the basket of docu
ments in front of the door and
left. A newsman counted 236

throughout the nation. Harris
estimated that over one thous
and men turned in their cards
yesterday.

pasted their draft cards to the
door of the U.S. Embassy as
part of the Resistance protest.
By turning in their draft
