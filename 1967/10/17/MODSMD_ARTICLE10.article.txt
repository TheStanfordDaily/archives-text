# Letters To The Editor
## Morality Lives As Long As Men Do 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
On Sunday evening I heard the
rumor (it doesn't matter whether
it was true) that a girl burned
herself to death before the Los
Angeles Federal Building. With
in a few minutes I arose from my
daze and decided to return my
draft card.
Two things made this relevant
to a Stanford editorial page.
First: In part, this is a protest
against Wallace Sterling and the
Stanford Research Institute for
all their efforts to make such a
war as that in Vietnam technol
ogically possible: lest they know
not where they stray, we need not
follow (and we are, beware, more
intimately related to them than
we tend to realize).
Second: For all of us, scholars
though we seek to be, who visual
ise the thousands of innocent
men, women, and children who
are killed for a barbaric concept
of humanitarianism as numbers
on lengthy casualty lists (phony
or otherwise) rather than as lives
whose sanctity has been cruelly
violated, it takes a nearby indi
vidual death for us to compre
hend other than abstractly what
this means in terms of people
rather than in terms of ideology.
Perhaps we may, in the near
future, witness a similar death
here at Stanford, in White Plaza,
by a Stanford girl or boy, exer
cised through personal freedom
rather than through military en
slavement.
And perhaps, then, a few more
Stanford students will become
aware that turning in draft cards
(among a host of similar anti

war enterprises) is not to be
judged in terms of "what good
would it do?" or else we employ
the identical analytic criterion to
reality that Lyndon Johnson and
his followers and his tolerators
apply in their avoidance of moral
considerations.
To those in all places, whether
high government officials or un
dergraduate existentialists, who
decry or acclaim the death of
God at the hands of 20th century
technology, do not forget that
morality will not die except with
the death of all men.

I wish to contest a statement
appearing in The Stanford Daily
of October 13th, in the article en
titled, .. Medical Students Sign
'We Won't Go' Pledge," by Rob
ert Brody, which notes that 84
faculty members support the
students. The statement is made
that, "The support of the Stan
ford Medical School faculty has
been overwhelming" (for these
students).
I believe the opposite may be
true, for I was asked by three dif
ferent individuals to "sign the
pledge," and I assume all 300
faculty members were likewise
approached. Indeed, many of the
names appearing on the faculty
pledge are those of individuals
having no clinical responsibili
ties, and some clinical depart
ments are conspicuous by their
absence of faculty representa
tives.

Editor, the Dally:
The article about the proposed
Bay Area Students Union (Fri
day, October 13) elicits my sup
port and induces me to give a

personal opinion of Stanford.
Rather than add another com
ment to the many that ask for
a clarification of the adminis
tration's educational philosophy,
I would like to suggest that in
lieu of that clarification, the
University momentarily drop
several of its present policies, at
least until they can defend
them.
Some of these policies can be
specified. First, all vestiges of
in loco parentis, which despite
recent efforts, still surround us.
The administration also
should not compromise the Uni
versity with any political views
whatsoever.
The administration should not
have the power to exepl any
student from the University,
once admitted. The student
should not have to attend
classes, or pass exams, or do

Editor, the Dally:

anything, as far as the adminis
tration is concerned. He is here
to learn and is free to do it as
he pleases. The idea of coercive
education is a contradiction in
terms.
I think these proposals are
becoming more and more ob
vious, and the proposed student
union is an example of the stu
dent's awareness of the inability
of the administration to defend
itself.
If the administration thinks
that because it is a private
school it has special perogatives
to exercise in connection with
its students, it is then working
in contradiction with the aims
of education. The University
should enact radical changes or
drop the facade of being an edu
cational institution altogether.

Is it safe for us to be sitting quietly here

Dead still in the supply lines of murder

Is it safe for us to be sitting quietly here
Talking of freedoms and tomorrows promises
While these wild young seed carriers
Protest our systems of violence, standing
Dead still in the supply lines of murder
Chaining live, young hands and arms across
The doors of induction, and only for a moment

While these hash smoking, unlikely prophets
Fly in the face of the deadliest institutions

Pulling the gargoyle leaders down off their

To call them by name and say we understand them,

On Sunday evening I heard the
rumor (it doesn't matter whether
it was true) that a girl burned
herself to death before the Los
Angeles Federal Building. With
in a few minutes I arose from my
daze and decided to return my
draft card.
Two things made this relevant
to a Stanford editorial page.
First: In part, this is a protest
against Wallace Sterling and the
Stanford Research Institute for
all their efforts to make such a
war as that in Vietnam technol
ogically possible: lest they know
not where they stray, we need not
follow (and we are, beware, more
intimately related to them than
we tend to realize).
Second: For all of us, scholars
though we seek to be, who visual
ise the thousands of innocent
men, women, and children who
are killed for a barbaric concept
of humanitarianism as numbers
on lengthy casualty lists (phony
or otherwise) rather than as lives
whose sanctity has been cruelly
violated, it takes a nearby indi
vidual death for us to compre
hend other than abstractly what
this means in terms of people
rather than in terms of ideology.
Perhaps we may, in the near
future, witness a similar death
here at Stanford, in White Plaza,
by a Stanford girl or boy, exer
cised through personal freedom
rather than through military en
slavement.
And perhaps, then, a few more
Stanford students will become
aware that turning in draft cards
(among a host of similar anti

war enterprises) is not to be
judged in terms of "what good
would it do?" or else we employ
the identical analytic criterion to
reality that Lyndon Johnson and
his followers and his tolerators
apply in their avoidance of moral
considerations.
To those in all places, whether
high government officials or un
dergraduate existentialists, who
decry or acclaim the death of
God at the hands of 20th century
technology, do not forget that
morality will not die except with
the death of all men.

of humanitarianism as numbers
on lengthy casualty lists (phony
or otherwise) rather than as lives
whose sanctity has been cruelly
violated, it takes a nearby indi
vidual death for us to compre
hend other than abstractly what
this means in terms of people
rather than in terms of ideology.
Perhaps we may, in the near
future, witness a similar death
here at Stanford, in White Plaza,
by a Stanford girl or boy, exer
cised through personal freedom
rather than through military en
slavement.
And perhaps, then, a few more
Stanford students will become
aware that turning in draft cards
(among a host of similar anti

war enterprises) is not to be
judged in terms of "what good
would it do?" or else we employ
the identical analytic criterion to
reality that Lyndon Johnson and
his followers and his tolerators
apply in their avoidance of moral
considerations.
To those in all places, whether
high government officials or un

morality will not die except with

I wish to contest a statement
appearing in The Stanford Daily
of October 13th, in the article en
titled, .. Medical Students Sign
'We Won't Go' Pledge," by Rob
ert Brody, which notes that 84
faculty members support the
students. The statement is made
that, "The support of the Stan
ford Medical School faculty has
been overwhelming" (for these
students).
I believe the opposite may be
true, for I was asked by three dif
ferent individuals to "sign the
pledge," and I assume all 300
faculty members were likewise
approached. Indeed, many of the
names appearing on the faculty
pledge are those of individuals
having no clinical responsibili
ties, and some clinical depart
ments are conspicuous by their
absence of faculty representa

The article about the proposed

Rather than add another com

a clarification of the adminis

I would like to suggest that in
lieu of that clarification, the
University momentarily drop
several of its present policies, at
least until they can defend
them.
Some of these policies can be
specified. First, all vestiges of
in loco parentis, which despite
recent efforts, still surround us.
