# The 						Black Maze-Saddha
## Facing The Invisible Man's Dilemma 
### T. Spearman J. Scott 
This column is addressed to
a different sort of America, an
America not too often seen by
you members of the Stanford
reading audience simply because
your eyes are different from
those of 25 million Americans,
different in a radically different
sense—different because yours
is a world of dreams realized
while those of the 25 million
see only dreams deferred.
Have you yet, you of affluent
homes, have you yet to curse
the Invisible Man? Today!
Curses, fresh from the hot fum
ing cabalistic vaults that are
yours—bend these fumes into
another form and you have a
grotesque commercial in which
the Leading Lady's Hair Spray
blinds her, the spray something
clogging the eyes rather than
preening the locks.
Today, we can see where the
city of Milwaukee rejects a Fair
Housing Act. Rejects, because
bottles and bricks and clenched
fists greeted the faces of people
who, in an era where sit-ins and
march-ins are rapidly disappear
ing, still choose the the way of
decency.
Travels With George
Governor Romney, Today,
travels the nation's ghettos
meeting with known "gang
leaders" (a fiendish fashion, or
form, the politician who does
everything that the despairing
expect him to do: walk, talk,
and then, leave).
America, a Fair Housing Act,
the two seem anachronistic.
Antimonies, or the Mystic
Mountain upon which men turn
to the worship of Baal now that
the State of California can re
ject The Rumford Act, can cur

tail welfare expenditures (in the
Name of Greater Taxation), can
speed up communications be
tween National Guard and City
officials on outbreaks in the
grottoes of human existence.
All of this aptly detailed and
photographed in Life Magazine!
'Talented Tenth'
So that we, as members of
a Black Student Union on the
campus of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University are aware that
our fellow American students
here are as aware of surface
problems as we, the "Talented
Tenth", happen to be. No doubt
about it!
We have to talk about Prop
erty, and this item specifically
in connection with the plight of
the American Negro: that
charge assigned him by the tides
of historical prophecy, that he
subdue the monsters of man's
mind with nary a tool but the
lessons gleaned from his own
bitter experiences. A difficult
task, as we are all aware, living
in the land of capitalism under
the aegis of Property.
Property — America's God —
America's Soul — America's
Love. Property, and the Holy
Trinity is made complete. But,
an E. Franklin Frazier (remem
ber him, Black Bourgeoisie?),
made note of a side feature of
Property — it is ail white!
Screaming From Today
The Founding Fathers (of
America), when building a Su
preme Law of the land, had a
problem—the meaning or sig
nificance, if such existed, of
Black Property. Specifically,
black slaves.
Rather than scream to you as
voices out of the past (Words

worth saying, "Let the Dead
Past bury its dead."), we deal
only with the present voice, the
sound of the matured whiplash,
of the unexaberated sore—we
talk of the lessons of Justice:
"That Justice is a blind goddess
Is a thing to which we blacks
are wise:
Her bandage hides two fester
ing sores
That once perhaps were eyes."
• 1865 —Death became Free
dom. Lives had burned and yet
the unmitigated stance for life
was lost. Lost to dreams, lost
to blood, and the Invisible Man
again reaped the hate that had
been born of love.
• 1954 —Words for Freedom.
Schools had been churned and
still America accepted delay for
compliance. It had rebuked its
own "separate but equal" pomp.
Your other words, mighty,
prophesized that this sort of
justice would take Time. More
delay. The Invisible Man looked
on, at the blind, no, eyeless
Statue of Liberty. For all of the
desegregation clauses, there has
been but 12 per cent compliance
in liberalizing Southern schools.
• 1964—Public freedom! Toi
lets and ballot boxes, both open!
But it's hard living on a toilet
stool, and why vote when there
are no candidates? No one with
sight, or maybe something
worse, like vision. But SNCC
began to grow, and the Panther
started its low growl. America
shuddered in its own cavern of
darkness. The Supreme Law
was Supreme, and had only be
gun to show itself. "To be close
to God, be close to people."
• 1967—Shakespeare is vindi

cated at last! Othello can marry
in Alabama and then live there!
Progress, of sorts. But then,
what is Progress, or Justice, or
Law, or being involved in some
thing America intrinsically ab
hors: dialogue, like criticism!
The Question
So much for capsule sum
maries of American history, and
we send the most craven of
apologies to all shocked schol
ars (and true believers) of Am
ican social history. We say (we
do not ask!) this to you:
America, see that your society
still incarcerates the Invisible
One! See that subtle excuses
predicated upon delay act to
deny the flow of Justice. You
have upset the Cosmic Men
strual Cycle! Interrupted by
property laws! A defunct state
of existence: the belief that Mr.
Spock of Star Trek is the New
Man. Civil Rights now no more
than a corpse in the American
body, or a worm. Human Rights
a bleeding thing, with pus in its
eyes. Where have all the Char
ters gone?; or have you signed
any, O Mystic Mountain?
Where Are You Going?
For those of you who may
have gotten lost in the poetry,
for those among you who may
have gotten lost in the emotion
alism, for those in your ranks
who think that to be able to
emphasize somehow qualifies
college graduates and conscien
tious objectors to the black con
ditions, we will say in closing
what the exact scene is at Stan
ford, why it exists, what it
means, and where it is leading
us (or at least, where it has led
YOU).
. . . long beards notwithstand

ing, Flower Children of the
World United!
Understand that although
Karl Marx was a teacher of
Socratic principles, he exist
only in the hallowed walls of the
Hoover Institution of War Stu
dies. Stanford has opened an
other chapter in the American
Dilemma — — — place bars
around the bells of the tower
so that its students cannot take
that great leap ofl into Life.
Life Is Death
What life? That life that
exists no matter the property:
Death. A plot in a cemetery, an
urn, or perhaps rites in the Na
tional Cemetery with Honor
Guard while Bishops explain
away your suicide.
Flower Children of the World,
Unite!
Take up your flowers and
wild weeds, your chemicals and
your Talmuds, your Tibetan
Books of Death and your feel
ings—stay away from the rug
ged individual, that sinewy be
liever in the wholesome life,
that constituent of the body
"status quo." And for what pur
pose, if it is only to save a man
from turning into a cockroach
overnight:
"Whenever any form of gov
ernment becomes destructive of
these ends (individuals enjoying
their natural rights and the
blessings of life), it is the right
of the people to alter or to abol
ish it, an to instiute new gov
ernment, laying its foundations
on such principles and organiz
ing its powers in such form, as
to them shall seem most likely
to effect their safety and happi
ness."

'Talented Tenth'
So that we, as members of
a Black Student Union on the
campus of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University are aware that
our fellow American students
here are as aware of surface
problems as we, the "Talented
Tenth", happen to be. No doubt
about it!
We have to talk about Prop
erty, and this item specifically
in connection with the plight of
the American Negro: that
charge assigned him by the tides
of historical prophecy, that he
subdue the monsters of man's
mind with nary a tool but the
lessons gleaned from his own
bitter experiences. A difficult
task, as we are all aware, living
in the land of capitalism under
the aegis of Property.
Property — America's God —
America's Soul — America's
Love. Property, and the Holy
Trinity is made complete. But,
an E. Franklin Frazier (remem
ber him, Black Bourgeoisie?),
made note of a side feature of
Property — it is ail white!
Screaming From Today
The Founding Fathers (of
America), when building a Su
preme Law of the land, had a
problem—the meaning or sig
nificance, if such existed, of
Black Property. Specifically,
black slaves.
Rather than scream to you as
voices out of the past (Words

worth saying, "Let the Dead
Past bury its dead."), we deal
only with the present voice, the
sound of the matured whiplash,
of the unexaberated sore—we
talk of the lessons of Justice:
"That Justice is a blind goddess
Is a thing to which we blacks
are wise:
Her bandage hides two fester
ing sores
That once perhaps were eyes."
• 1865 —Death became Free
dom. Lives had burned and yet
the unmitigated stance for life
was lost. Lost to dreams, lost
to blood, and the Invisible Man
again reaped the hate that had
been born of love.
• 1954 —Words for Freedom.
Schools had been churned and
still America accepted delay for
compliance. It had rebuked its
own "separate but equal" pomp.
Your other words, mighty,
prophesized that this sort of
justice would take Time. More
delay. The Invisible Man looked
on, at the blind, no, eyeless
Statue of Liberty. For all of the
desegregation clauses, there has
been but 12 per cent compliance
in liberalizing Southern schools.
• 1964—Public freedom! Toi
lets and ballot boxes, both open!
But it's hard living on a toilet
stool, and why vote when there
are no candidates? No one with
sight, or maybe something
worse, like vision. But SNCC
began to grow, and the Panther
started its low growl. America
shuddered in its own cavern of
darkness. The Supreme Law
was Supreme, and had only be
gun to show itself. "To be close
to God, be close to people."
• 1967—Shakespeare is vindi

cated at last! Othello can marry
in Alabama and then live there!
Progress, of sorts. But then,
what is Progress, or Justice, or
Law, or being involved in some
thing America intrinsically ab
hors: dialogue, like criticism!
The Question
So much for capsule sum

deny the flow of Justice. You
have upset the Cosmic Men
strual Cycle! Interrupted by
property laws! A defunct state
of existence: the belief that Mr.
Spock of Star Trek is the New
Man. Civil Rights now no more
than a corpse in the American

a bleeding thing, with pus in its

'Talented Tenth'
So that we, as members of
a Black Student Union on the
campus of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University are aware that
our fellow American students
here are as aware of surface
problems as we, the "Talented
Tenth", happen to be. No doubt
about it!
We have to talk about Prop
erty, and this item specifically
in connection with the plight of
the American Negro: that
charge assigned him by the tides
of historical prophecy, that he
subdue the monsters of man's
mind with nary a tool but the
lessons gleaned from his own
bitter experiences. A difficult
task, as we are all aware, living
in the land of capitalism under
the aegis of Property.
Property — America's God —
America's Soul — America's
Love. Property, and the Holy
Trinity is made complete. But,
an E. Franklin Frazier (remem
ber him, Black Bourgeoisie?),
made note of a side feature of
Property — it is ail white!
Screaming From Today
The Founding Fathers (of
America), when building a Su
preme Law of the land, had a
problem—the meaning or sig
nificance, if such existed, of
Black Property. Specifically,
black slaves.
Rather than scream to you as
voices out of the past (Words

worth saying, "Let the Dead
Past bury its dead."), we deal
only with the present voice, the
sound of the matured whiplash,
of the unexaberated sore—we
talk of the lessons of Justice:
"That Justice is a blind goddess
Is a thing to which we blacks
are wise:
Her bandage hides two fester
ing sores
That once perhaps were eyes."
• 1865 —Death became Free
dom. Lives had burned and yet
the unmitigated stance for life
was lost. Lost to dreams, lost
to blood, and the Invisible Man
again reaped the hate that had
been born of love.
• 1954 —Words for Freedom.
Schools had been churned and
still America accepted delay for
compliance. It had rebuked its
own "separate but equal" pomp.
Your other words, mighty,
prophesized that this sort of
justice would take Time. More
delay. The Invisible Man looked
on, at the blind, no, eyeless
Statue of Liberty. For all of the
desegregation clauses, there has
been but 12 per cent compliance
in liberalizing Southern schools.
• 1964—Public freedom! Toi
lets and ballot boxes, both open!
But it's hard living on a toilet
stool, and why vote when there
are no candidates? No one with
sight, or maybe something
worse, like vision. But SNCC
began to grow, and the Panther
started its low growl. America
shuddered in its own cavern of
darkness. The Supreme Law
was Supreme, and had only be
gun to show itself. "To be close
to God, be close to people."
• 1967—Shakespeare is vindi

cated at last! Othello can marry
in Alabama and then live there!
Progress, of sorts. But then,
what is Progress, or Justice, or
Law, or being involved in some
thing America intrinsically ab
hors: dialogue, like criticism!
The Question
So much for capsule sum
maries of American history, and
we send the most craven of
apologies to all shocked schol
ars (and true believers) of Am
ican social history. We say (we
do not ask!) this to you:
America, see that your society
still incarcerates the Invisible
One! See that subtle excuses
predicated upon delay act to
deny the flow of Justice. You
have upset the Cosmic Men
strual Cycle! Interrupted by
property laws! A defunct state
of existence: the belief that Mr.
Spock of Star Trek is the New
Man. Civil Rights now no more
than a corpse in the American
body, or a worm. Human Rights
a bleeding thing, with pus in its
eyes. Where have all the Char
ters gone?; or have you signed
any, O Mystic Mountain?
Where Are You Going?
For those of you who may
have gotten lost in the poetry,
for those among you who may
have gotten lost in the emotion
alism, for those in your ranks
who think that to be able to
emphasize somehow qualifies
college graduates and conscien
tious objectors to the black con

what the exact scene is at Stan
ford, why it exists, what it
means, and where it is leading
us (or at least, where it has led
YOU).

'Talented Tenth'
So that we, as members of
a Black Student Union on the
campus of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University are aware that
our fellow American students
here are as aware of surface
problems as we, the "Talented
Tenth", happen to be. No doubt
about it!
We have to talk about Prop
erty, and this item specifically
in connection with the plight of
the American Negro: that
charge assigned him by the tides
of historical prophecy, that he
subdue the monsters of man's
mind with nary a tool but the
lessons gleaned from his own
bitter experiences. A difficult
task, as we are all aware, living
in the land of capitalism under
the aegis of Property.
Property — America's God —
America's Soul — America's
Love. Property, and the Holy
Trinity is made complete. But,
an E. Franklin Frazier (remem
ber him, Black Bourgeoisie?),
made note of a side feature of
Property — it is ail white!
Screaming From Today
The Founding Fathers (of
America), when building a Su
preme Law of the land, had a
problem—the meaning or sig
nificance, if such existed, of
Black Property. Specifically,
black slaves.
Rather than scream to you as
voices out of the past (Words

worth saying, "Let the Dead
Past bury its dead."), we deal
only with the present voice, the
sound of the matured whiplash,
of the unexaberated sore—we
talk of the lessons of Justice:
"That Justice is a blind goddess
Is a thing to which we blacks
are wise:
Her bandage hides two fester
ing sores
That once perhaps were eyes."
• 1865 —Death became Free
dom. Lives had burned and yet
the unmitigated stance for life
was lost. Lost to dreams, lost
to blood, and the Invisible Man
again reaped the hate that had
been born of love.
• 1954 —Words for Freedom.
Schools had been churned and
still America accepted delay for
compliance. It had rebuked its
own "separate but equal" pomp.
Your other words, mighty,
prophesized that this sort of
justice would take Time. More
delay. The Invisible Man looked
on, at the blind, no, eyeless
Statue of Liberty. For all of the
desegregation clauses, there has
been but 12 per cent compliance
in liberalizing Southern schools.
• 1964—Public freedom! Toi
lets and ballot boxes, both open!
But it's hard living on a toilet
stool, and why vote when there
are no candidates? No one with
sight, or maybe something
worse, like vision. But SNCC
began to grow, and the Panther
started its low growl. America
shuddered in its own cavern of
darkness. The Supreme Law
was Supreme, and had only be
gun to show itself. "To be close
to God, be close to people."
• 1967—Shakespeare is vindi

cated at last! Othello can marry
in Alabama and then live there!
Progress, of sorts. But then,
what is Progress, or Justice, or
Law, or being involved in some
thing America intrinsically ab
hors: dialogue, like criticism!
The Question
So much for capsule sum
maries of American history, and
we send the most craven of
apologies to all shocked schol
ars (and true believers) of Am
ican social history. We say (we
do not ask!) this to you:
America, see that your society
still incarcerates the Invisible
One! See that subtle excuses
predicated upon delay act to
deny the flow of Justice. You
have upset the Cosmic Men
strual Cycle! Interrupted by
property laws! A defunct state
of existence: the belief that Mr.
Spock of Star Trek is the New
Man. Civil Rights now no more
than a corpse in the American
body, or a worm. Human Rights
a bleeding thing, with pus in its
eyes. Where have all the Char
ters gone?; or have you signed
any, O Mystic Mountain?
Where Are You Going?
For those of you who may
have gotten lost in the poetry,
for those among you who may
have gotten lost in the emotion
alism, for those in your ranks
who think that to be able to
emphasize somehow qualifies
college graduates and conscien
tious objectors to the black con
ditions, we will say in closing
what the exact scene is at Stan
ford, why it exists, what it
means, and where it is leading
us (or at least, where it has led
YOU).

Karl Marx was a teacher of
Socratic principles, he exist

Dilemma — — — place bars
around the bells of the tower
so that its students cannot take
that great leap ofl into Life.
Life Is Death
What life? That life that

Death. A plot in a cemetery, an

from turning into a cockroach
overnight:
"Whenever any form of gov

these ends (individuals enjoying
their natural rights and the
blessings of life), it is the right
of the people to alter or to abol
