## ROTC Has Undeserved Academic Equality? 
### DANIEL BERNSTEIN 
Editor's note: This paper was
written one year ago (October
6, 1967) and reflects the feelings
of the author at that time. It is
the result of his reading of the
Army Regulations concerning
ROTC and the contract between
Stanford and the U.S. Army. It
was given to Dean Sears of Hu
manities and Sciences on the
understanding that he would
pass it on to the office of the
President for consideration and
action.
First I should like to state
what I feel is a very basic as
sumption one must make when
discussing the academic nature
of the Stanford community. It is
hoped that the University is a
place for both acquisition of
knowledge and inquiry into the
concepts presented.

The classroom is the forum
for these processes, and in this
forum there is a dialogue be
tween the learned and the
searching members of the com
munity. In the classroom both
professor and student learn and,
when possible, discuss.
In my understanding, this
principle has always been ac
ceptable at our University.
Practical Limitations
In connection, though, with the
practicalities of running the
"ideal" classroom there are of
ten reasons for limiting or se
lecting the participants in this
dialogue. Size can play a deci
sive role, for a class which is
too large will inhibit meaning
ful contact and discussion be
tween teacher and student.
It is also clear that in order
to contribute to the learning

process students must enter with
a certain requisite knowledge.
Students, then, are selected on
the basis of prior experience in
the field.
Also, universities often main
tain research of a classified or
secret nature, the exclusion on
grounds that classified informa
tion is presented appears to be
part of Stanford's system. In
these practical cases limitation
and selection of participants are
considered part of our Univer
sity's procedure.
Enrollment Required
In the Department of Military
Science there is a policy of se
lecting students for the classes
based on Army Regulation 145-
350. As quoted to me by Mr.
Glover, "Pursuance of ROTC
training other than in an en
rolled status ... is not author

ized." The regulation also states
that, "there is no provision for
provisional or informal or simi
lar terms." This has been inter
preted to prohibit auditing the
classes. In order to participate
in classes of this department
one must enroll in the AROTC
program.
I feel there is some question
as to how well this requirement
fits into the general exceptions
to open enrollment as suggested
above.
Although there are provisions
for limiting the number of cadets
if desired, the Stanford unit is
constantly seeking more mem
bers. It seems size here is not
their consideration.
For advanced courses there
are basic knowledge require
ments, but the restriction applies
even to the very first course, so
the need for requisite training
can not be used to justify the
overall requirement of enroll
ment.
Finally, the materials covered
in the basic AROTC courses
could hardly be considered clas
sified or of high security value.
Therefore the third procedure
accepted in our community is
also not applicable.
Contract Requires Equality
At this point it is appropriate
to determine exactly the place
of the Department of Military
Science in the University. The
contract between the Army and
Stanford requires the equality of
the department within the aca
demic community.
The following statements are
taken from paragraphs 2a, 2d,
and 4 of the contract signed by
Mr. Brandin for the University
in 1965. The University shall "es
tablish a Department of Mili
tary Science as an integral aca
demic and administrative depart
ment of the institution."
Stanford "shall grant appro
priate academic credit applicable
toward graduation for successful
completion of courses offered by
the Department of Military Sci
ence."
Privileges and Responsibilities
Also "no unit may be estab
lished or maintained at an in
stitution unless the senior com
missioned officer assigned to the
institution is given the rank of
professor." In fact, at Stanford
the rank of the officers listed
in the Courses and Degrees Bul
letin is not lower than Assistant
Professor, and therefore all are
members of the academic coun
cil.
The whole point is that Mili

tary Science is an academic de
partment of Stanford University
with all the privileges and re
sponsibilities which accompany
such rank.
In this department, however,
one must enroll in the Army
ROTC program in order to par
ticipate in the classroom activi
ties.
Here I raise my objection.
Army Regulation 145-350, Sec
tion V, paragraphs lib and lie
exclude from enrollment "a stu
dent who is a conscientious ob
jector" or "a student who fails
to satisfy the loyalty require
ments." The requirement pre
scribed is the swearing of a
loyalty oath.
Not Acceptable
Where does this leave a stu
dent desiring to take this Uni
versity course?
He must allow himself to be
enrolled in ARTOC. But here he
is faced by a religious and a po
litical test — for enrollment in
a legitimate Stanford University
course. Previous resistance to
such tests at many public insti
tutions indicates that this is not
a practice to which only a "lu
natic fringe" would object.
Loyalty and religious require
ments simply are no longer ac
ceptable in a university of Stan
ford's stature or any institution
of higher learning.
Dialogue Eliminated
Stanford has a Department

of Military Science with equal
standing for its courses and staff
but with a screening process in
cluding religious and political
tests. The net result appears to
be the elimination of a construc
tive dialogue in the classroom —
the forum of inquiry. Those sour
ces of potential doubt or ques
tion are neatly eliminated from
the place of learning.
It might be said that the De
partment of Military Science is
a service which the University
provides for its students, but I
feel this is an incomplete defini
tion. Stanford officially recog
nizes Military Science as an
equal acadom"c unit, but the De
partment is not living up to its
responsibilities to the academic
community.

understanding that he would
pass it on to the office of the
President for consideration and
action.
First I should like to state
what I feel is a very basic as
sumption one must make when
discussing the academic nature
of the Stanford community. It is
hoped that the University is a
place for both acquisition of
knowledge and inquiry into the
concepts presented.

The classroom is the forum
for these processes, and in this
forum there is a dialogue be
tween the learned and the
searching members of the com
munity. In the classroom both
professor and student learn and,
when possible, discuss.
In my understanding, this
principle has always been ac
ceptable at our University.
Practical Limitations
In connection, though, with the
practicalities of running the
"ideal" classroom there are of
ten reasons for limiting or se
lecting the participants in this
dialogue. Size can play a deci
sive role, for a class which is
too large will inhibit meaning
ful contact and discussion be
tween teacher and student.
It is also clear that in order
to contribute to the learning

process students must enter with
a certain requisite knowledge.
Students, then, are selected on
the basis of prior experience in
the field.
Also, universities often main
tain research of a classified or
secret nature, the exclusion on
grounds that classified informa
tion is presented appears to be
part of Stanford's system. In
these practical cases limitation
and selection of participants are
considered part of our Univer
sity's procedure.
Enrollment Required
In the Department of Military
Science there is a policy of se
lecting students for the classes
based on Army Regulation 145-
350. As quoted to me by Mr.
Glover, "Pursuance of ROTC
training other than in an en
rolled status ... is not author

ized." The regulation also states
that, "there is no provision for
provisional or informal or simi
lar terms." This has been inter
preted to prohibit auditing the
classes. In order to participate
in classes of this department
one must enroll in the AROTC
program.
I feel there is some question
as to how well this requirement
fits into the general exceptions
to open enrollment as suggested
above.
Although there are provisions
for limiting the number of cadets
if desired, the Stanford unit is
constantly seeking more mem
bers. It seems size here is not
their consideration.
For advanced courses there
are basic knowledge require
ments, but the restriction applies
even to the very first course, so
the need for requisite training
can not be used to justify the
overall requirement of enroll
ment.
Finally, the materials covered
in the basic AROTC courses
could hardly be considered clas
sified or of high security value.
Therefore the third procedure
accepted in our community is
also not applicable.
Contract Requires Equality
At this point it is appropriate
to determine exactly the place
of the Department of Military
Science in the University. The
contract between the Army and
Stanford requires the equality of
the department within the aca
demic community.
The following statements are
taken from paragraphs 2a, 2d,
and 4 of the contract signed by
Mr. Brandin for the University
in 1965. The University shall "es
tablish a Department of Mili
tary Science as an integral aca
demic and administrative depart
ment of the institution."
Stanford "shall grant appro
priate academic credit applicable
toward graduation for successful
completion of courses offered by
the Department of Military Sci
ence."
Privileges and Responsibilities
Also "no unit may be estab
lished or maintained at an in
stitution unless the senior com
missioned officer assigned to the
institution is given the rank of
professor." In fact, at Stanford
the rank of the officers listed
in the Courses and Degrees Bul
letin is not lower than Assistant
Professor, and therefore all are
members of the academic coun
cil.
The whole point is that Mili

tary Science is an academic de
partment of Stanford University
with all the privileges and re
sponsibilities which accompany
such rank.
In this department, however,
one must enroll in the Army
ROTC program in order to par
ticipate in the classroom activi
ties.
Here I raise my objection.
Army Regulation 145-350, Sec
tion V, paragraphs lib and lie
exclude from enrollment "a stu
dent who is a conscientious ob
jector" or "a student who fails
to satisfy the loyalty require
ments." The requirement pre
scribed is the swearing of a
loyalty oath.
Not Acceptable
Where does this leave a stu
dent desiring to take this Uni
versity course?
He must allow himself to be
enrolled in ARTOC. But here he
is faced by a religious and a po
litical test — for enrollment in
a legitimate Stanford University
course. Previous resistance to
such tests at many public insti
tutions indicates that this is not
a practice to which only a "lu
natic fringe" would object.
Loyalty and religious require
ments simply are no longer ac
ceptable in a university of Stan
ford's stature or any institution
of higher learning.
Dialogue Eliminated
Stanford has a Department

of Military Science with equal
standing for its courses and staff
but with a screening process in
cluding religious and political
tests. The net result appears to
be the elimination of a construc
tive dialogue in the classroom —
the forum of inquiry. Those sour
ces of potential doubt or ques
tion are neatly eliminated from
the place of learning.
It might be said that the De
partment of Military Science is
a service which the University
provides for its students, but I
feel this is an incomplete defini
tion. Stanford officially recog
nizes Military Science as an
equal acadom"c unit, but the De
partment is not living up to its
responsibilities to the academic
community.

for these processes, and in this
forum there is a dialogue be
tween the learned and the
searching members of the com
munity. In the classroom both
professor and student learn and,
when possible, discuss.
In my understanding, this
principle has always been ac
ceptable at our University.
Practical Limitations
In connection, though, with the
practicalities of running the
"ideal" classroom there are of
ten reasons for limiting or se
lecting the participants in this
dialogue. Size can play a deci
sive role, for a class which is
too large will inhibit meaning
ful contact and discussion be
tween teacher and student.
It is also clear that in order
to contribute to the learning

process students must enter with
a certain requisite knowledge.
Students, then, are selected on
the basis of prior experience in
the field.
Also, universities often main
tain research of a classified or
secret nature, the exclusion on
grounds that classified informa
tion is presented appears to be
part of Stanford's system. In
these practical cases limitation
and selection of participants are
considered part of our Univer
sity's procedure.
Enrollment Required
In the Department of Military
Science there is a policy of se
lecting students for the classes
based on Army Regulation 145-
350. As quoted to me by Mr.
Glover, "Pursuance of ROTC
training other than in an en
rolled status ... is not author

ized." The regulation also states
that, "there is no provision for
provisional or informal or simi
lar terms." This has been inter
preted to prohibit auditing the
classes. In order to participate
in classes of this department
one must enroll in the AROTC
program.
I feel there is some question
as to how well this requirement
fits into the general exceptions
to open enrollment as suggested
above.
Although there are provisions
for limiting the number of cadets
if desired, the Stanford unit is
constantly seeking more mem
bers. It seems size here is not
their consideration.
For advanced courses there
are basic knowledge require
ments, but the restriction applies
even to the very first course, so
the need for requisite training
can not be used to justify the
overall requirement of enroll
ment.
Finally, the materials covered
in the basic AROTC courses
could hardly be considered clas
sified or of high security value.
Therefore the third procedure
accepted in our community is
also not applicable.
Contract Requires Equality
At this point it is appropriate
to determine exactly the place
of the Department of Military
Science in the University. The
contract between the Army and
Stanford requires the equality of
the department within the aca
demic community.
The following statements are
taken from paragraphs 2a, 2d,
and 4 of the contract signed by
Mr. Brandin for the University
in 1965. The University shall "es
tablish a Department of Mili
tary Science as an integral aca
demic and administrative depart
ment of the institution."
Stanford "shall grant appro
priate academic credit applicable
toward graduation for successful
completion of courses offered by
the Department of Military Sci
ence."
Privileges and Responsibilities
Also "no unit may be estab
lished or maintained at an in
stitution unless the senior com
missioned officer assigned to the
institution is given the rank of
professor." In fact, at Stanford
the rank of the officers listed
in the Courses and Degrees Bul
letin is not lower than Assistant
Professor, and therefore all are
members of the academic coun
cil.
The whole point is that Mili

tary Science is an academic de
partment of Stanford University
with all the privileges and re
sponsibilities which accompany
such rank.
In this department, however,
one must enroll in the Army
ROTC program in order to par
ticipate in the classroom activi
ties.
Here I raise my objection.
Army Regulation 145-350, Sec
tion V, paragraphs lib and lie
exclude from enrollment "a stu
dent who is a conscientious ob
jector" or "a student who fails
to satisfy the loyalty require
ments." The requirement pre
scribed is the swearing of a
loyalty oath.
Not Acceptable
Where does this leave a stu
dent desiring to take this Uni
versity course?
He must allow himself to be
enrolled in ARTOC. But here he
is faced by a religious and a po
litical test — for enrollment in
a legitimate Stanford University
course. Previous resistance to
such tests at many public insti
tutions indicates that this is not
a practice to which only a "lu
natic fringe" would object.
Loyalty and religious require
ments simply are no longer ac
ceptable in a university of Stan
ford's stature or any institution
of higher learning.
Dialogue Eliminated
Stanford has a Department

of Military Science with equal
standing for its courses and staff
but with a screening process in
cluding religious and political
tests. The net result appears to
be the elimination of a construc
tive dialogue in the classroom —
the forum of inquiry. Those sour
ces of potential doubt or ques
tion are neatly eliminated from
the place of learning.
It might be said that the De
partment of Military Science is
a service which the University
provides for its students, but I
feel this is an incomplete defini
tion. Stanford officially recog
nizes Military Science as an
equal acadom"c unit, but the De
partment is not living up to its
responsibilities to the academic
community.
Editor's note: This paper was
written one year ago (October
6, 1967) and reflects the feelings
of the author at that time. It is
the result of his reading of the

ten reasons for limiting or se
lecting the participants in this
dialogue. Size can play a deci
sive role, for a class which is
too large will inhibit meaning
ful contact and discussion be
tween teacher and student.
It is also clear that in order
to contribute to the learning

process students must enter with
a certain requisite knowledge.
Students, then, are selected on
the basis of prior experience in
the field.
Also, universities often main
tain research of a classified or
secret nature, the exclusion on
grounds that classified informa
tion is presented appears to be
part of Stanford's system. In
these practical cases limitation
and selection of participants are
considered part of our Univer
sity's procedure.
Enrollment Required
In the Department of Military
Science there is a policy of se
lecting students for the classes
based on Army Regulation 145-
350. As quoted to me by Mr.
Glover, "Pursuance of ROTC
training other than in an en
rolled status ... is not author

ized." The regulation also states
that, "there is no provision for
provisional or informal or simi
lar terms." This has been inter
preted to prohibit auditing the
classes. In order to participate
in classes of this department
one must enroll in the AROTC
program.
I feel there is some question
as to how well this requirement
fits into the general exceptions
to open enrollment as suggested
above.
Although there are provisions
for limiting the number of cadets
if desired, the Stanford unit is
constantly seeking more mem
bers. It seems size here is not
their consideration.
For advanced courses there
are basic knowledge require
ments, but the restriction applies
even to the very first course, so
the need for requisite training
can not be used to justify the
overall requirement of enroll
ment.
Finally, the materials covered
in the basic AROTC courses
could hardly be considered clas
sified or of high security value.
Therefore the third procedure
accepted in our community is
also not applicable.
Contract Requires Equality
At this point it is appropriate
to determine exactly the place
of the Department of Military
Science in the University. The
contract between the Army and
Stanford requires the equality of
the department within the aca
demic community.
The following statements are
taken from paragraphs 2a, 2d,
and 4 of the contract signed by
Mr. Brandin for the University
in 1965. The University shall "es
tablish a Department of Mili
tary Science as an integral aca
demic and administrative depart
ment of the institution."
Stanford "shall grant appro
priate academic credit applicable
toward graduation for successful
completion of courses offered by
the Department of Military Sci
ence."
Privileges and Responsibilities
Also "no unit may be estab
lished or maintained at an in
stitution unless the senior com
missioned officer assigned to the
institution is given the rank of
professor." In fact, at Stanford
the rank of the officers listed
in the Courses and Degrees Bul
letin is not lower than Assistant
Professor, and therefore all are
members of the academic coun
cil.
The whole point is that Mili

tary Science is an academic de
partment of Stanford University
with all the privileges and re
sponsibilities which accompany
such rank.
In this department, however,
one must enroll in the Army
ROTC program in order to par
ticipate in the classroom activi
ties.
Here I raise my objection.
Army Regulation 145-350, Sec
tion V, paragraphs lib and lie
exclude from enrollment "a stu
dent who is a conscientious ob
jector" or "a student who fails
to satisfy the loyalty require
ments." The requirement pre
scribed is the swearing of a
loyalty oath.
Not Acceptable
Where does this leave a stu
dent desiring to take this Uni
versity course?
He must allow himself to be
enrolled in ARTOC. But here he
is faced by a religious and a po
litical test — for enrollment in
a legitimate Stanford University
course. Previous resistance to
such tests at many public insti
tutions indicates that this is not
a practice to which only a "lu
natic fringe" would object.
Loyalty and religious require
ments simply are no longer ac
ceptable in a university of Stan
ford's stature or any institution
of higher learning.
Dialogue Eliminated
Stanford has a Department

of Military Science with equal
standing for its courses and staff
but with a screening process in
cluding religious and political
tests. The net result appears to
be the elimination of a construc
tive dialogue in the classroom —
the forum of inquiry. Those sour
ces of potential doubt or ques
tion are neatly eliminated from
the place of learning.
It might be said that the De
partment of Military Science is
a service which the University
provides for its students, but I
feel this is an incomplete defini
tion. Stanford officially recog
nizes Military Science as an
equal acadom"c unit, but the De
partment is not living up to its
responsibilities to the academic
community.
