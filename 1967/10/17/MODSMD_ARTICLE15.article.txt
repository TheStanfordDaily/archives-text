(AP) — Americans demon
strated by the thousands from
coast to coast Monday against
the Vietnam war, burning draft
cards or trying to turn them in.
Others sought to blockade in
duction centers.
In New York, where 300 pro
tested, demonstrators said their
actions were part of a nation
wide mobilization of those re
sisting the draft. A group of
Americans in London also took
part.
Some of the protests had the
backing of religious figures, in
cluding a demonstration in Bos
ton, where 70 draft cards were
burned and more than 220
others surrendered to clergymen
of various faiths.
Buses brought demonstrators
to the Boston rally from col
leges throughout New England.
There was some counterpicket
ing.
An estimated 3,500 marched
from Boston Common to the Ar
lington Street church. There Dr.
Dana Mclean Greeley, presi
dent of the Unitarian-Universal
ist Association, told them in a
statement: "I would not submit
to conscription myself if I were
eligible."
In Philadelphia, the Rev. Da

vid M. Grade, urban missionary
for the Episcopal diocese of
Pennsylvania, lauded the "cour
age and imagination" of 175
persons who demonstrated out
side Independence Hall, within
sight of the Liberty Bell. Hostile
bystanders shouted and jeered
as five draft cards were burned.
About 200 Cornell University
students, backed by some pro
fessors, demonstrated in Ithaca,

leave, Van Fleet walked toward
the door and shoved the induc
tion notice into Whatley's face,
the guard reported.

LOS ANGELES (AP)—About

tance for Peace" movement
chanted for half an hour before

CHICAGO (CPS) — More
than 500 University of Chicago
students heard speakers rang
ing from Yale History Professor
Staughton Lynd to ex-Green
Beret Gary Rader urge non-com
pliance with the Selective Ser
vice System at the campus' first
learn-in on Vietnam, which
stretched into the morning
hours Thursday night and Fri
day morning.
Sponsored by Chicago Area
Draft Resisters (CADRE) which

proudly announced that over 100
young men are making use of
its draft counseling facilities
each week, the meeting began
with a report from Richard
Flacks, a Chicago sociology
professor recently returned
from a meeting with members
of the National Liberation Front
in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
"They were not despairing,
frustrated, or feeling powerless
like we were," he said of the
NLF. "These Vietnamese are
supremely confident of securing
their objectives. They believe
they defeated the Americans on
the ground, that the political
situation is quite good for them
and that they are successfully
protecting citizens in the North.
Further, they feel that the
bombing has done them little
damage while unifying and
boosting the morale of the Viet
namese people."
"Not only have these people
not given up hope," Flacks said,
"They have prevailed."
"The success of the NLF, he
continued, "creates the condi
tions for building a movement
against the anti-communism
racist politics, and militarism
underlying our politics."
Flacks concluded by discuss

ing the idea that American men
could send their draft cards to
the NLF to demonstrate that we
are not at war with them. "It
is a healthy experience to be rid
of that piece of paper," he said.
"Why not stop carrying yours?"
Next, Gary Rader, a tall, blond
ex-Green Beret reservist, who
made national headlines last
April by burning his draft card,
told the audience, "I was in the
Army and I've spent the last six
months washing the blood off
my hands. Armies kill people
easy and simple, and if you go
in, then that's what you're into."
Rader, former vice president
of Northwestern University's
student body, said the Army is
"repressive and absolutely terri
fying. It's almost rehumanizing;
you can disappear into the brig
and never be heard from again."
Rader said that rather than
associate with the Army he was
facing up to ten years in prison,
but that even philosophical con
siderations aside, he preferred
jail. Rader claimed that those
who accept deferments while
criticising a system are in fact
the system's greatest support
ers, and that those who remain
in a university are only exploit
ing the people of Vietnam.

"I don't like not being able to
stand for the national anthem,
but we've made all this progress
in science and absolutely none in
human relations. Jail is one of
the few places for a human be
ing to be."
A number of speakers inter
vened, including Robert
Schwartz of CADRE who
burned his draft card on stage.
Then Staughton Lynd, the
ousted Yale professor currently
teaching at Roosevelt University
in downtown Chicago, addressed
the students.
'The important lesson we
have learned about the war in
Vietnam is that it is not an acci
dent but rather the character
istic expression of this decadent,
capitalistic, imperialistic society
and that when and if the war in
Vietnam ends we have to expect
similar wars in similar circum
stances —drafting men to put
down third world rebellions of
oppressed people. Handing in
the draft card announces that
one will have nothing to do with
the coming wars as well as this
one."

LONDON (AP) A group
of young Americans went to the
U.S. Embassy today to hand in

their draft cards as a legal chal
lenge to the U.S. war effort in
Vietnam.
An Embassy official refused to
accept them because, he said,
that would have meant he was
aiding an illegal act. The grou - .
then put the cards in a larg«.
brown envelope, passed it to the
Embassy's front door and left
officials puzzling what to do next.
The embassy finally decided
to treat the cards as lost prop
erty and leave them in its lost
and found department. The
names, however, are expected to
be forwarded to Washington. No
legal action is believed possible
here — at least until the men
are called for the draft year.
Most already have student de
ferments. Eight draft cards were
in the envelope.
The demonstration was timed
to coincide with similar actions
in the United States aimed at
"actively intervening in the op
eration of the U.S. military ma
chinery," a statement said.
Frank Brodhead of Lexington,
Mass., a Princeton graduate, said
the men hoped to encourage oth
ers to follow their example, and
to mobilize opposition to the
war among the British.

is a healthy experience to be rid
of that piece of paper," he said.
"Why not stop carrying yours?"
Next, Gary Rader, a tall, blond
ex-Green Beret reservist, who
made national headlines last
April by burning his draft card,
told the audience, "I was in the
Army and I've spent the last six
months washing the blood off
my hands. Armies kill people
easy and simple, and if you go
in, then that's what you're into."
Rader, former vice president
of Northwestern University's
student body, said the Army is
"repressive and absolutely terri
fying. It's almost rehumanizing;
you can disappear into the brig
and never be heard from again."
Rader said that rather than
associate with the Army he was
facing up to ten years in prison,
but that even philosophical con
siderations aside, he preferred
jail. Rader claimed that those
who accept deferments while
criticising a system are in fact
the system's greatest support
ers, and that those who remain
in a university are only exploit
ing the people of Vietnam.

"I don't like not being able to
stand for the national anthem,
but we've made all this progress
in science and absolutely none in
human relations. Jail is one of
the few places for a human be
ing to be."
A number of speakers inter
vened, including Robert
Schwartz of CADRE who
burned his draft card on stage.
Then Staughton Lynd, the
ousted Yale professor currently
teaching at Roosevelt University
in downtown Chicago, addressed
the students.
'The important lesson we
have learned about the war in
Vietnam is that it is not an acci
dent but rather the character
istic expression of this decadent,
capitalistic, imperialistic society
and that when and if the war in
Vietnam ends we have to expect
similar wars in similar circum

LONDON (AP) A group
of young Americans went to the
U.S. Embassy today to hand in

their draft cards as a legal chal
lenge to the U.S. war effort in
Vietnam.
An Embassy official refused to
accept them because, he said,
that would have meant he was
aiding an illegal act. The grou - .
then put the cards in a larg«.
brown envelope, passed it to the
Embassy's front door and left
officials puzzling what to do next.
The embassy finally decided
to treat the cards as lost prop
erty and leave them in its lost
and found department. The
names, however, are expected to
be forwarded to Washington. No
legal action is believed possible
here — at least until the men
are called for the draft year.
Most already have student de
ferments. Eight draft cards were
in the envelope.
The demonstration was timed
to coincide with similar actions
in the United States aimed at
"actively intervening in the op
eration of the U.S. military ma
chinery," a statement said.
Frank Brodhead of Lexington,

the men hoped to encourage oth

to mobilize opposition to the

(AP) — Americans demon
strated by the thousands from
coast to coast Monday against
the Vietnam war, burning draft
cards or trying to turn them in.
Others sought to blockade in

In New York, where 300 pro

actions were part of a nation
wide mobilization of those re

Americans in London also took
part.
Some of the protests had the
backing of religious figures, in

burned and more than 220
others surrendered to clergymen
of various faiths.
Buses brought demonstrators
to the Boston rally from col

There was some counterpicket
ing.
An estimated 3,500 marched
from Boston Common to the Ar

Dana Mclean Greeley, presi

In Philadelphia, the Rev. Da

Arrested on a battery charge

the guard reported.

CHICAGO (CPS) — More

students heard speakers rang

Staughton Lynd to ex-Green
Beret Gary Rader urge non-com
pliance with the Selective Ser
vice System at the campus' first
learn-in on Vietnam, which
stretched into the morning
hours Thursday night and Fri
day morning.
Sponsored by Chicago Area
Draft Resisters (CADRE) which

proudly announced that over 100
young men are making use of
its draft counseling facilities
each week, the meeting began
with a report from Richard
Flacks, a Chicago sociology
professor recently returned
from a meeting with members
of the National Liberation Front
in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
"They were not despairing,
frustrated, or feeling powerless
like we were," he said of the
NLF. "These Vietnamese are
supremely confident of securing
their objectives. They believe
they defeated the Americans on
the ground, that the political
situation is quite good for them
and that they are successfully
protecting citizens in the North.
Further, they feel that the
bombing has done them little
damage while unifying and
boosting the morale of the Viet
namese people."
"Not only have these people
not given up hope," Flacks said,
"They have prevailed."
"The success of the NLF, he
continued, "creates the condi
tions for building a movement
against the anti-communism
racist politics, and militarism
underlying our politics."
Flacks concluded by discuss

ing the idea that American men
could send their draft cards to
the NLF to demonstrate that we
are not at war with them. "It
is a healthy experience to be rid
of that piece of paper," he said.
"Why not stop carrying yours?"

CHICAGO (CPS) — More
than 500 University of Chicago
students heard speakers rang
ing from Yale History Professor
Staughton Lynd to ex-Green
Beret Gary Rader urge non-com
pliance with the Selective Ser
vice System at the campus' first
learn-in on Vietnam, which
stretched into the morning
hours Thursday night and Fri
day morning.
Sponsored by Chicago Area
Draft Resisters (CADRE) which

proudly announced that over 100
young men are making use of
its draft counseling facilities
each week, the meeting began
with a report from Richard
Flacks, a Chicago sociology
professor recently returned
from a meeting with members
of the National Liberation Front
in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
"They were not despairing,
frustrated, or feeling powerless
like we were," he said of the
NLF. "These Vietnamese are
supremely confident of securing
their objectives. They believe
they defeated the Americans on
the ground, that the political
situation is quite good for them
and that they are successfully
protecting citizens in the North.
Further, they feel that the
bombing has done them little
damage while unifying and
boosting the morale of the Viet
namese people."
"Not only have these people
not given up hope," Flacks said,
"They have prevailed."
"The success of the NLF, he
continued, "creates the condi
tions for building a movement
against the anti-communism
racist politics, and militarism
underlying our politics."
Flacks concluded by discuss

ing the idea that American men
could send their draft cards to
the NLF to demonstrate that we
are not at war with them. "It
is a healthy experience to be rid
of that piece of paper," he said.
"Why not stop carrying yours?"
Next, Gary Rader, a tall, blond
ex-Green Beret reservist, who
made national headlines last
April by burning his draft card,
told the audience, "I was in the
Army and I've spent the last six
months washing the blood off
my hands. Armies kill people
easy and simple, and if you go
in, then that's what you're into."
Rader, former vice president
of Northwestern University's
student body, said the Army is
"repressive and absolutely terri
fying. It's almost rehumanizing;
you can disappear into the brig
and never be heard from again."
Rader said that rather than
associate with the Army he was
facing up to ten years in prison,
but that even philosophical con
siderations aside, he preferred
jail. Rader claimed that those
who accept deferments while
criticising a system are in fact
the system's greatest support
ers, and that those who remain
in a university are only exploit
ing the people of Vietnam.

"I don't like not being able to
stand for the national anthem,
but we've made all this progress
in science and absolutely none in
human relations. Jail is one of
the few places for a human be
ing to be."
A number of speakers inter
vened, including Robert
Schwartz of CADRE who
burned his draft card on stage.
Then Staughton Lynd, the
ousted Yale professor currently
teaching at Roosevelt University
in downtown Chicago, addressed
the students.
'The important lesson we
have learned about the war in
Vietnam is that it is not an acci
dent but rather the character
istic expression of this decadent,
capitalistic, imperialistic society
and that when and if the war in
Vietnam ends we have to expect
similar wars in similar circum
stances —drafting men to put
down third world rebellions of
oppressed people. Handing in
the draft card announces that
one will have nothing to do with
the coming wars as well as this
one."

LONDON (AP) A group
of young Americans went to the
U.S. Embassy today to hand in

their draft cards as a legal chal
lenge to the U.S. war effort in
Vietnam.
An Embassy official refused to
accept them because, he said,
that would have meant he was
aiding an illegal act. The grou - .
then put the cards in a larg«.
brown envelope, passed it to the
Embassy's front door and left
officials puzzling what to do next.
The embassy finally decided
to treat the cards as lost prop
erty and leave them in its lost
and found department. The
names, however, are expected to
be forwarded to Washington. No
legal action is believed possible
here — at least until the men
are called for the draft year.
Most already have student de
ferments. Eight draft cards were
in the envelope.
The demonstration was timed
to coincide with similar actions
in the United States aimed at
"actively intervening in the op
eration of the U.S. military ma
chinery," a statement said.
Frank Brodhead of Lexington,
Mass., a Princeton graduate, said
the men hoped to encourage oth
ers to follow their example, and
to mobilize opposition to the
war among the British.

jail. Rader claimed that those
who accept deferments while

the system's greatest support
ers, and that those who remain
in a university are only exploit
ing the people of Vietnam.

"I don't like not being able to
stand for the national anthem,
but we've made all this progress
in science and absolutely none in
human relations. Jail is one of
the few places for a human be
ing to be."
A number of speakers inter
vened, including Robert

Then Staughton Lynd, the
ousted Yale professor currently
teaching at Roosevelt University
in downtown Chicago, addressed
the students.

dent but rather the character

LONDON (AP) A group
of young Americans went to the
U.S. Embassy today to hand in

their draft cards as a legal chal
lenge to the U.S. war effort in
Vietnam.
An Embassy official refused to
accept them because, he said,
that would have meant he was
aiding an illegal act. The grou - .
then put the cards in a larg«.
brown envelope, passed it to the
Embassy's front door and left
officials puzzling what to do next.
The embassy finally decided
to treat the cards as lost prop
erty and leave them in its lost
and found department. The
names, however, are expected to
be forwarded to Washington. No
legal action is believed possible
here — at least until the men
are called for the draft year.
Most already have student de
ferments. Eight draft cards were
in the envelope.
The demonstration was timed
to coincide with similar actions
in the United States aimed at
"actively intervening in the op
eration of the U.S. military ma
chinery," a statement said.
Frank Brodhead of Lexington,

the men hoped to encourage oth

to mobilize opposition to the

(AP) — Americans demon
strated by the thousands from
coast to coast Monday against
the Vietnam war, burning draft
cards or trying to turn them in.
Others sought to blockade in
duction centers.
In New York, where 300 pro
tested, demonstrators said their
actions were part of a nation
wide mobilization of those re
sisting the draft. A group of
Americans in London also took
part.
Some of the protests had the
backing of religious figures, in
cluding a demonstration in Bos

burned and more than 220
others surrendered to clergymen
of various faiths.
Buses brought demonstrators
to the Boston rally from col

There was some counterpicket
ing.
An estimated 3,500 marched
from Boston Common to the Ar

Dana Mclean Greeley, presi

statement: "I would not submit
to conscription myself if I were

In Philadelphia, the Rev. Da

LOS ANGELES (AP) — While
40 antiwar demonstrators picket

and accused him of assaulting a
security guard.
The flarrup ended quickly at
the center, located at 1033 South
Broadway.
Arrested on a battery charge
was John Steven Van Fleet, 20, of
Lakewood. The guard, V. L.
Whatley, 58, told police Van Fleet
entered the center with his in
duction notice in his hand and
began screaming.
When Whatley asked him to
leave, Van Fleet walked toward
the door and shoved the induc

the guard reported.

LOS ANGELES (AP)—About

Members of the "Draft Resis

CHICAGO (CPS) — More
than 500 University of Chicago
students heard speakers rang
ing from Yale History Professor
Staughton Lynd to ex-Green
Beret Gary Rader urge non-com
pliance with the Selective Ser
vice System at the campus' first
learn-in on Vietnam, which
stretched into the morning
hours Thursday night and Fri
day morning.
Sponsored by Chicago Area
Draft Resisters (CADRE) which

proudly announced that over 100
young men are making use of
its draft counseling facilities
each week, the meeting began
with a report from Richard
Flacks, a Chicago sociology
professor recently returned
from a meeting with members
of the National Liberation Front
in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
"They were not despairing,
frustrated, or feeling powerless
like we were," he said of the
NLF. "These Vietnamese are
supremely confident of securing
their objectives. They believe
they defeated the Americans on
the ground, that the political
situation is quite good for them
and that they are successfully
protecting citizens in the North.
Further, they feel that the
bombing has done them little
damage while unifying and
boosting the morale of the Viet
namese people."
"Not only have these people
not given up hope," Flacks said,
"They have prevailed."
"The success of the NLF, he
continued, "creates the condi
tions for building a movement
against the anti-communism
racist politics, and militarism
underlying our politics."
Flacks concluded by discuss

ing the idea that American men
could send their draft cards to
the NLF to demonstrate that we
are not at war with them. "It
is a healthy experience to be rid
of that piece of paper," he said.
"Why not stop carrying yours?"
Next, Gary Rader, a tall, blond
ex-Green Beret reservist, who
made national headlines last
April by burning his draft card,
told the audience, "I was in the
Army and I've spent the last six
months washing the blood off
my hands. Armies kill people
easy and simple, and if you go
in, then that's what you're into."
Rader, former vice president
of Northwestern University's
student body, said the Army is
"repressive and absolutely terri
fying. It's almost rehumanizing;
you can disappear into the brig
and never be heard from again."
Rader said that rather than
associate with the Army he was
facing up to ten years in prison,
but that even philosophical con
siderations aside, he preferred
jail. Rader claimed that those
who accept deferments while
criticising a system are in fact

CHICAGO (CPS) — More
than 500 University of Chicago
students heard speakers rang
ing from Yale History Professor
Staughton Lynd to ex-Green
Beret Gary Rader urge non-com
pliance with the Selective Ser
vice System at the campus' first
learn-in on Vietnam, which
stretched into the morning
hours Thursday night and Fri
day morning.
Sponsored by Chicago Area
Draft Resisters (CADRE) which

proudly announced that over 100
young men are making use of
its draft counseling facilities
each week, the meeting began
with a report from Richard
Flacks, a Chicago sociology
professor recently returned
from a meeting with members
of the National Liberation Front
in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
"They were not despairing,
frustrated, or feeling powerless
like we were," he said of the
NLF. "These Vietnamese are
supremely confident of securing
their objectives. They believe
they defeated the Americans on
the ground, that the political
situation is quite good for them
and that they are successfully
protecting citizens in the North.
Further, they feel that the
bombing has done them little
damage while unifying and
boosting the morale of the Viet
namese people."
"Not only have these people
not given up hope," Flacks said,
"They have prevailed."
"The success of the NLF, he
continued, "creates the condi
tions for building a movement
against the anti-communism
racist politics, and militarism
underlying our politics."
Flacks concluded by discuss

ing the idea that American men
could send their draft cards to
the NLF to demonstrate that we
are not at war with them. "It
is a healthy experience to be rid
of that piece of paper," he said.
"Why not stop carrying yours?"
Next, Gary Rader, a tall, blond
ex-Green Beret reservist, who
made national headlines last
April by burning his draft card,
told the audience, "I was in the
Army and I've spent the last six
months washing the blood off
my hands. Armies kill people
easy and simple, and if you go
in, then that's what you're into."
Rader, former vice president
of Northwestern University's
student body, said the Army is
"repressive and absolutely terri
fying. It's almost rehumanizing;
you can disappear into the brig
and never be heard from again."
Rader said that rather than
associate with the Army he was
facing up to ten years in prison,
but that even philosophical con
siderations aside, he preferred
jail. Rader claimed that those
who accept deferments while
criticising a system are in fact
the system's greatest support
ers, and that those who remain
in a university are only exploit
ing the people of Vietnam.

"I don't like not being able to
stand for the national anthem,
but we've made all this progress
in science and absolutely none in
human relations. Jail is one of
the few places for a human be
ing to be."
A number of speakers inter
vened, including Robert
Schwartz of CADRE who
burned his draft card on stage.
Then Staughton Lynd, the
ousted Yale professor currently
teaching at Roosevelt University
in downtown Chicago, addressed
the students.
'The important lesson we
have learned about the war in
Vietnam is that it is not an acci
dent but rather the character
istic expression of this decadent,
capitalistic, imperialistic society
and that when and if the war in
Vietnam ends we have to expect
similar wars in similar circum
stances —drafting men to put
down third world rebellions of
oppressed people. Handing in
the draft card announces that
one will have nothing to do with
the coming wars as well as this
one."

LONDON (AP) A group
of young Americans went to the
U.S. Embassy today to hand in

their draft cards as a legal chal
lenge to the U.S. war effort in
Vietnam.
An Embassy official refused to
accept them because, he said,
that would have meant he was
aiding an illegal act. The grou - .
then put the cards in a larg«.
brown envelope, passed it to the
Embassy's front door and left
officials puzzling what to do next.
The embassy finally decided
to treat the cards as lost prop
erty and leave them in its lost
and found department. The
names, however, are expected to
be forwarded to Washington. No
legal action is believed possible
here — at least until the men
are called for the draft year.
Most already have student de
ferments. Eight draft cards were
in the envelope.
The demonstration was timed
to coincide with similar actions
in the United States aimed at
"actively intervening in the op
eration of the U.S. military ma
chinery," a statement said.
Frank Brodhead of Lexington,
Mass., a Princeton graduate, said
the men hoped to encourage oth
ers to follow their example, and
to mobilize opposition to the
war among the British.

(AP) — Americans demon
strated by the thousands from
coast to coast Monday against
the Vietnam war, burning draft
cards or trying to turn them in.
Others sought to blockade in
duction centers.
In New York, where 300 pro
tested, demonstrators said their
actions were part of a nation
wide mobilization of those re
sisting the draft. A group of
Americans in London also took
part.
Some of the protests had the
backing of religious figures, in
cluding a demonstration in Bos
ton, where 70 draft cards were
burned and more than 220
others surrendered to clergymen
of various faiths.
Buses brought demonstrators
to the Boston rally from col
leges throughout New England.
There was some counterpicket
ing.
An estimated 3,500 marched
from Boston Common to the Ar
lington Street church. There Dr.
Dana Mclean Greeley, presi
dent of the Unitarian-Universal
ist Association, told them in a
statement: "I would not submit
to conscription myself if I were
eligible."
In Philadelphia, the Rev. Da

vid M. Grade, urban missionary
for the Episcopal diocese of
Pennsylvania, lauded the "cour
age and imagination" of 175
persons who demonstrated out
side Independence Hall, within
sight of the Liberty Bell. Hostile
bystanders shouted and jeered
as five draft cards were burned.
