# Reagan Staff Ready For Draft Protest

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” Lt.
Gov. Robert H. Finch received
reports every half hour Monday
on the anti-draft demonstration
at the Oakland Army Induction
Center.
Finch also said he expected
to consult by radio-telephone
with Gov. Reagan, or members
of his staff, attending a session
of the National Governor's Con
ference aboard the ocean liner
Independence which sailed from
New York Monday.
Finch declined to comment on
any possibility the National
Guard might be activated to
help control the situation at the
center, where anti-war demon
strators attempted to block en
trances.
About 100 California Highway
Patrol officers were assigned to
the center earlier in the day
and Paul Beck, Reagan's press
secretary, said "We are always
in a state of preparedness."
Finch said he met with top
members of the governor's staff
last Friday for a briefing on the
planned Oakland demonstration.
In New York City Sunday,
Reagan said he made certain
arrangements could be made to
fly him by helicopter from the
Independence should it be nec
essary to return to California.

But Reagan said he would
not yield to a threat from a
"noisy minority."
Reagan said he had done a
lot of "soul-searching" before
going on the conference trip
because he expected trouble
from the Stop the Draft Com
mittee demonstration.
Meanwhile, 40 antiwar demon
strators picketed the Sacra
mento draft board headquarters
Monday morning as five buses
full of possible draftees left for
the Oakland induction center.
The half-hour demonstration
was peaceful and was watched
at the predawn hour only by the
youths headed for Oakland and
a few policemen.
The youths, bound for pre
induction physical examinations
at the Oakland center, expressed
mixed feelings about the anti
war protest. Several said they
oppose the war in Vietnam and
don't want to go there, but they
also saw little use in the picket
ing.
In nearby Davis, six youths
protesting the draft put their
draft cards into envelopes and
mailed them back to their local
draft boards. Four of the youths
said they were students at the
University of California Davis
campus.
