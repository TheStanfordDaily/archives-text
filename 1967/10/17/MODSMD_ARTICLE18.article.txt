SAN FRANCISCO (AP)â€”U.S.
Sen. Thomas Kuchel, (R., Calif.),
bluntly rejected an invitation
Monday from an anti-draft group
to support an attempted shut
down of the Oakland Induction
Center.
Kuchel denounced the Stop The
Draft Committee of Berkeley for
creating a "reprehensible threat
to weaken the people and the gov
ernment of the U.S. in a fashion
that the constitution gives the
right to no man."
Kuchel, who arrived in San
Francisco to speak at a League
of California Cities conference,
said the effort to close the induc
tion center "goes beyond the lim
its of free speech."
"You ought to recognize that
there is a case of criminal action
against the government," said
Kuchel in turning down the invi
tation sent him two weeks ago in
a wire.
But Unruh said that if the af
fair should turn out to be a stag
ing area for protesters, some
way would have to be found to
deal with it.
"I do not think the university
campus should be used as a stag
ing area to sally forth against
the unprotected countryside,"
Unruh said.
