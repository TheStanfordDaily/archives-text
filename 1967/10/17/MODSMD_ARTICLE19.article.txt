# 'Mixed-Up Priorities'
## King Blasts War, Slowdown Of Poverty Fight 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€”Civil
rights leader Martin Luther
King told several thousand col
lege students yesterday that he
must condemn the Vietnam war
"because it is an unjust war"
that also works against the
drive for Negro equality.
"Our nation is trying to fight
two wars at the same time, the
war in Vietnam and the war on
poverty, and is losing both,"
King declared in a speech on
the Sacramento State College
football field.

King, referring to Vietnam,
maintained that "because of
that unjust war we are not put
ting our resources into the war
on poverty."
In fighting a war thousands
of miles away which takes mon
ey from the domestic war on
poverty, King declared, the na
tion has "mixed up its priorities.
It is high time for our nation
to get its priorities right."
He noted that his war criti
cism has drawn comments that
he should stick to civil rights
activity, but replied that as a

Baptist minister, his business is
peace and when it comes to
Vietnam "I will continue to take
that stand."
Solid applause greeted his
stand against the war.
King said that while he un
derstood why Negroes rioted in
big cities, "I still believe . . .
firmly in nonviolence. I don't
believe we can win a violent
revolution."
Whites must realize, he added,
that while they may condemn
riots, "It is just as important
to condemn the intolerable con

ditions . . . which lead persons
to violence ... to call attention
to problems. A riot is the lan
guage of the unheard."
King laid the blame for Ne
gro poverty, inferior education
and a feeling of hopelessness on
the "policy makers of white
society. Thr problem is that our
Congress, our people don't use
the cold winters creatively
enough to get rid of the prob
lems that cause long, hot sum
mers."
The civil rights movement has
moved into a new and in many

ways tougher stage from the
drive against legal segregation,
the Nobel Peace Prize winner
said. Now, things are "more dif
ficult because it is going to cost
the nation something. It is much
easier to integrate a lunch coun
ter than it is to eradicate
slums."
King said he still favors an
integrated society as opposed to
a blaek-white split advocated by
white segregationists and some
Negro militants, but added that
"integration . . . must be shared
power."
