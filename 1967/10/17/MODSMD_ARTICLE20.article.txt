# WSU's Peculiar Strategy 'Gives' Tribe A Pac-8 Win

Stanford's football team Sat
urday changed from its season
long offense of controlling the
ball with a running game and
went to the air with devastating
results for a 31-10 victory over
Washington State.
What was amazing about the
change was that the Cougars
practically invited the Tribe to
throw the ball. In a sense, they
"gave" the game to the Cards.
Game Plan Falls
Stanford's game plan had been
to attempt to control the ball
with sweeps and traps on run
ning plays. But Washington
State came out with what
amounted to an eight man line.
The linebackers were playing
so closely behind the defensive
lino that the trap blocking be
came impossible because there
were too many men up front.
At the start of the second
quarter, the Cards decided to go
to a passing attack, a fact sig
nalled by Chuck Williams' long,
if incomplete, pass to Gene
Washington.
C ougars Don't Charge
But the Cougars continued to
stick with their eight man line,
meaning that they had only
three defensive backs for pass
coverage. The defensive backs
also had to cover Stanford re
ceivers man-for-man.
In another inexplicable piece
of strategy, the Cougars rushed
only four of the eight men at
quarterback Williams. The other
four held at the line to prevent
any runs.
Williams therefore had ages to

throw, and his receivers had
only to work themselves clear
of one defender.
What A Gift
The results of this gift: Wil
liams had his best day ever as
a Stanford quarterback, com
pleting 14 of 23 for 133 yards.
Gene Washington continued his
five catches a game average
and Jim Cross nabbed four
passes.
All the receivers were full of
praise for Williams' passing. "It

was just fantastic," said Cross,
"the ball was right in my hands
every time."
George Buehler, Stanford
tight end who caught one pass
on a beautiful one-handed leap
ing catch, said, "I didn't have
trouble getting open at ail. No
one is going to cover Gene
Washington man-for-man."
Washington, when told of
Buehler's praise, said, "I'd sure
like to think so too, but .
Cass Scores
Bruce Cass caught one of
William's passes for his first
score.
Cass said he was very hungry
for some action. "When you play

only one play in five games you
need to do something."
The TD pass came on a look
in play made possible by the
Cougar defensive backs, who
were back in the end zone to
stop Washington from getting
behind them.
The coaches saw that the mid
dle was open and called for Cass
to slant in quickly for the pass.
Defense Gets Sparked
On defense, the Cards be
came fired up after falling be
hind 10-0 in the first quarter.
Said defensive safety Tom
Massey, who started for the first
time and made an interception,
"We had one mix-up in signals
in the first quarter which re
sulted in a long completion to
the seven, but after that we had
no trouble stopping them."
Defensive end Don Parish was
lineman of the game. He said
the Cougars got fired up after
Stanford's first two fumbles and
"felt they had us."
"But the coaches had been af
ter us all week about their coach
saying we were their easiest
team," he continued, "and we
just got mad and took over.
"At the start of the second
half, they really let up. They
were barely hitting us," Parish
concluded.
No Decision
Stanford coach John Ralston
had praise for Williams' perfor
mance but said he hadn't decided
on a starting quarterback for the
UCLA game.
"We'll formulate a game plan
and analyze the films before we
make a decision," he said.

SUB ORBITAL LEAP FOR TD: Almost in the manner of a high jumper going head first over the bar,
Stanford fullback Jack Root dives into the end zone to put the Cards ahead 17-10 in the third quarter
of Saturday's Washington State game. The touchdown was the decisive marker in the Cards' 31-10
win. Blocking for Root is center Tom Giallonardo (59). Chuck Williams (11), the Tribe quarterback,
watches after he made the handoff to Root.
