# Schultz, Honey Rush Spartan Frosh Defenses To Death
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Coach Terry De Sylvia was all
smiles Saturday morning as his
freshman football machine deci
mated the San Jose freshmen
41-12.
Featuring the devasting run
ning of Jack Sehultz and Clar
ence Honey, the frosh could not
have been more impressive in
De Sylvia's debut as a coach.
The frosh took the opening
kickoff and marched 67 yards
in nine plays for their first score,
with Honey driving in from the
two.
Steve Biegranzahn made the
first of four conversions and the
Papooses led 7-0.
Ground Game Goes!
Five minutes later Honey
plowed in from the six. Stan
ford's running game was clearly
established, and by the end of
the game, Sehultz had scored
three times on scampers from
one, five, and fifteen yards out.
Mark Brown also scored on a
one yard plunge.
Sehultz gained 170 yards in 25

carries for a fine workhorse per
formance, and Honey picked
up key yardage on each touch
down drive.
Quarterback Don Bunce turn
ed to the air more in the second
half. He and flanker Damea
Washington collaborated for five
completed passes worth 73
yards.
The offensive line, led by
guards Charlie Sable and Pete
Crosby, opened so many holes
that the backs totaled 251 yards
rushing during the contest.
Bough Defense
The defensive line was even
more phenomenal as it held the
Spartan frosh to a minus 19
yards rushing figure. The line
men caught San Jose quarter
back Steve Oreglia nine times
for 61 yards behind the line of
scrimmage while he attempted
to pass.
But when Oreglia did get time
to pass, he was very effective.
He completed 14 of 21 passes
for 185 yards, including two

touchdown tosses of 32 and nine
yards.
DeSylvia had said before the
game that his team would be
fast, aggressive, and tough de
fensively. He was almost too
accurate, as his aggressive
squad was penalized over 100
yards. But he was only too
proud of the squad in its first
game.
The Card frosh meet a tough
UCLA frosh team Saturday.
