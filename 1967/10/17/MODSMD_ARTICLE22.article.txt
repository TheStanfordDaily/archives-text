each other no mercy when they
meet on the IM touchfootball
field. Yesterday proved that rule
as El Toro overwhelmed El Cam
po 52-0 and El Cuadro humiliated
El Capitan 41-0.
Don Swift's passing was the
margin of victory for Grove in
a battle of the intellectual coed
houses as Serra B fell 14-6. Cro
Mem topped the Caminos 13-6.
The Neutrinos overcame intra
team squabbles that led to a
half-time fist fight and walloped
the Sheiks 32-7 to get back on
the track toward a league cham
pionship.
Whitacre topped Law I 13-7,
and Chen passed two TD strikes
to Bendick and Storelie for a
22-6 El Tigre win over Los Arcos.

the IM office, the Betas forfeited
