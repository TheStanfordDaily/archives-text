# Brown Advises Draft Evasion In 'Look' Article, Risks Jail
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Robert McAfee Brown, Profes
sor of Religion, has written that
he has been counseling students
to evade the draft.
The statement appears in an
article by Brown in the October
31 issue of Look magazine, on
sale today.
He also writes that he is
willing to face jail with any of
the students he has counseled if
they are convicted of evading
"service in the armed forces,"
an act prohibited by the Military
Selective Service Act of 1967.
The law also makes counsel
ing, aiding, or abetting someone
in evading service a Federal of
fense. This is what Brown could
be arrested for.

"My concerns about Vietnam
will be explicitly focused on
counseling, aiding, and abetting
all students who declare that out
of moral conviction they will not
fight in Vietnam," he writes.
Counsel, Aid and Abet
"I will 'counsel, aid, and abet'
such students to find whatever
level of moral protest is conson
ant with their consciences, and
when for them this means refus
ing service in the armed forces,
I will support them in that
stand," Brown continued.
In an interview with the Daily,
Brown said that even in writing
the article he was breaking the
law, because in it he advises stu
dents to protest against the Viet
nam war, and to carry this as
far as they feel is right.
This includes draft evasion.
Professor Brown wrote that
his attitude on Vietnam and the
draft had gone "from unconcern,
to curiosity, to study, to mild
concern, to deep concern, to sign
ing statements, to genteel pro
test, to marching, to moral out
rage, to increasingly vigorous
protest, to civil disobedience."
Escalating Opposition
He feels that he has been
forced to "escalate" his own op
position to the war because, as
he wrote, "I have utterly lost
confidence in the Johnson Ad
ministration."
"Mr. Johnson is not calling
us (those who have been pro
testing against U.S. Vietnam pol
icy) unpatriotic," Brown noted,
"he is simply ignoring the
mounting chorus of moral hor
ror with benign disdain and pro
ceeding day by day ... to es
calate the war far past the point
of no return."
Therefore, he felt he had to
escalate his protests.
Brown said that he was will
ing to advise anyone who had
any doubts about Vietnam.
"It isn't necessary for every
one to come to the same level
of dissent," he added. "Where
ever one finds himself in con
science able to function he
should do so, because what we
need is to drive home to the
country that profound dissatis
faction with the war is not limit
ed to one segment of society."

Brown remarked that he felt
that the U.S. had no "grand de
sign" for conquest in South-
East Asia.
"We stumbled into this by a
series of little mistakes, and
now it's almost irretrievable," he
said, and now we have no real
goal.
Since we are presently at an
impasse, "some very bold initia
tive has to be taken by the
stronger nation — which is us
and this step has to be taken
at a risk."
Although negotiation would be
a risk, he feels, this would be
a risk "we can take when con
fronted with the immense risks
in following a policy of escala
tion," and thereby inviting a con
flict with Communist China.
Desire To Negotiate
What is also important, Brown
feels, is persuading "not just Ho
Chi Minh, but also the rest of
the world, that we really desire
to negotiate."
This is now necessary, he
stated, because of the many lies
that the Administration has
made about its actions and aims
in Vietnam.
The Look article was original
ly written last summer. Brown
at first intended to send it to
some small religious journal. But
then, in line with his increased
opposition to the war, he decided
that it should have wider publi
city if at all possible, such as
in a mass circulation magazine.
Brown had previously written
an article for Look on the Vat
ican Council, so it was a logical
publication for him to approach.
He noted that he has been
counseling students on Vietnam
and the draft for several years.
He has been concerned mainly
with their moral views of the
issues, however, leaving the tech
nical details of draft avoidance
to more expert people such as
Professor Paul Seaver and, now,
Hank Maiden.
Brown also remarked that "if
the government decides to ar
rest students, it will be a great
travesty of justice if they do
not also arrest the older people
who, "by counseling them," in
the light of the law are now just
as guilty as the students."

he wrote, "I have utterly lost
confidence in the Johnson Ad
ministration."
"Mr. Johnson is not calling
us (those who have been pro
testing against U.S. Vietnam pol
icy) unpatriotic," Brown noted,
"he is simply ignoring the
mounting chorus of moral hor
ror with benign disdain and pro
ceeding day by day ... to es
calate the war far past the point
of no return."
Therefore, he felt he had to
escalate his protests.
Brown said that he was will
ing to advise anyone who had
any doubts about Vietnam.
"It isn't necessary for every
one to come to the same level
of dissent," he added. "Where
ever one finds himself in con
science able to function he
should do so, because what we
need is to drive home to the
country that profound dissatis
faction with the war is not limit
ed to one segment of society."

Brown remarked that he felt
that the U.S. had no "grand de
sign" for conquest in South-
East Asia.
"We stumbled into this by a
series of little mistakes, and
now it's almost irretrievable," he
said, and now we have no real
goal.
Since we are presently at an
impasse, "some very bold initia
tive has to be taken by the
stronger nation — which is us
and this step has to be taken
at a risk."
Although negotiation would be
a risk, he feels, this would be
a risk "we can take when con
fronted with the immense risks
in following a policy of escala
tion," and thereby inviting a con
flict with Communist China.
Desire To Negotiate
What is also important, Brown
feels, is persuading "not just Ho
Chi Minh, but also the rest of
the world, that we really desire
to negotiate."
This is now necessary, he
stated, because of the many lies
that the Administration has
made about its actions and aims
in Vietnam.
The Look article was original
ly written last summer. Brown
at first intended to send it to
some small religious journal. But
then, in line with his increased
opposition to the war, he decided
that it should have wider publi
city if at all possible, such as
in a mass circulation magazine.
Brown had previously written
an article for Look on the Vat
ican Council, so it was a logical
publication for him to approach.
He noted that he has been
counseling students on Vietnam
and the draft for several years.
He has been concerned mainly
with their moral views of the
issues, however, leaving the tech
nical details of draft avoidance
to more expert people such as
Professor Paul Seaver and, now,
Hank Maiden.
Brown also remarked that "if
the government decides to ar
rest students, it will be a great
travesty of justice if they do
not also arrest the older people
who, "by counseling them," in
the light of the law are now just
as guilty as the students."


ROBERT McAFEE BROWN, Professor of Religion, has written
an article for Look magazine, appearing: today, in which he states
that he has been counseling: students to evade the draft.
Robert McAfee Brown, Profes
sor of Religion, has written that
he has been counseling students
to evade the draft.
The statement appears in an
article by Brown in the October
31 issue of Look magazine, on
sale today.
He also writes that he is
willing to face jail with any of
the students he has counseled if
they are convicted of evading
"service in the armed forces,"
an act prohibited by the Military
Selective Service Act of 1967.
The law also makes counsel
ing, aiding, or abetting someone
in evading service a Federal of
fense. This is what Brown could
be arrested for.

"My concerns about Vietnam
will be explicitly focused on
counseling, aiding, and abetting
all students who declare that out
of moral conviction they will not
fight in Vietnam," he writes.
Counsel, Aid and Abet
"I will 'counsel, aid, and abet'
such students to find whatever
level of moral protest is conson
ant with their consciences, and
when for them this means refus
ing service in the armed forces,
I will support them in that
stand," Brown continued.
In an interview with the Daily,
Brown said that even in writing
the article he was breaking the
law, because in it he advises stu
dents to protest against the Viet
nam war, and to carry this as
far as they feel is right.
This includes draft evasion.
Professor Brown wrote that
his attitude on Vietnam and the
draft had gone "from unconcern,
to curiosity, to study, to mild
concern, to deep concern, to sign
ing statements, to genteel pro
test, to marching, to moral out
rage, to increasingly vigorous
protest, to civil disobedience."

stated, because of the many lies
that the Administration has
made about its actions and aims
in Vietnam.
The Look article was original
ly written last summer. Brown
at first intended to send it to
some small religious journal. But
then, in line with his increased
opposition to the war, he decided
that it should have wider publi
city if at all possible, such as
in a mass circulation magazine.
Brown had previously written
an article for Look on the Vat
ican Council, so it was a logical
publication for him to approach.
He noted that he has been
counseling students on Vietnam
and the draft for several years.
He has been concerned mainly
with their moral views of the
issues, however, leaving the tech
nical details of draft avoidance
to more expert people such as
Professor Paul Seaver and, now,
Hank Maiden.
Brown also remarked that "if
the government decides to ar
rest students, it will be a great
travesty of justice if they do
not also arrest the older people
who, "by counseling them," in
the light of the law are now just
as guilty as the students."


ROBERT McAFEE BROWN, Professor of Religion, has written
an article for Look magazine, appearing: today, in which he states
that he has been counseling: students to evade the draft.
Robert McAfee Brown, Profes
sor of Religion, has written that
he has been counseling students
to evade the draft.
The statement appears in an
article by Brown in the October
31 issue of Look magazine, on
sale today.
He also writes that he is
willing to face jail with any of
the students he has counseled if
they are convicted of evading
"service in the armed forces,"
an act prohibited by the Military
Selective Service Act of 1967.
The law also makes counsel
ing, aiding, or abetting someone
in evading service a Federal of
fense. This is what Brown could
be arrested for.

"My concerns about Vietnam
will be explicitly focused on
counseling, aiding, and abetting
all students who declare that out
of moral conviction they will not
fight in Vietnam," he writes.
Counsel, Aid and Abet
"I will 'counsel, aid, and abet'
such students to find whatever
level of moral protest is conson
ant with their consciences, and
when for them this means refus
ing service in the armed forces,
I will support them in that
stand," Brown continued.
In an interview with the Daily,
Brown said that even in writing
the article he was breaking the
law, because in it he advises stu
dents to protest against the Viet
nam war, and to carry this as
far as they feel is right.
This includes draft evasion.
Professor Brown wrote that
his attitude on Vietnam and the
draft had gone "from unconcern,
to curiosity, to study, to mild
concern, to deep concern, to sign
ing statements, to genteel pro
test, to marching, to moral out
rage, to increasingly vigorous
protest, to civil disobedience."
Escalating Opposition
He feels that he has been
forced to "escalate" his own op
position to the war because, as
he wrote, "I have utterly lost
confidence in the Johnson Ad
ministration."
"Mr. Johnson is not calling
us (those who have been pro
testing against U.S. Vietnam pol
icy) unpatriotic," Brown noted,
"he is simply ignoring the
mounting chorus of moral hor
ror with benign disdain and pro
ceeding day by day ... to es
calate the war far past the point
of no return."
Therefore, he felt he had to
escalate his protests.
Brown said that he was will
ing to advise anyone who had
any doubts about Vietnam.
"It isn't necessary for every
one to come to the same level
of dissent," he added. "Where
ever one finds himself in con
science able to function he
should do so, because what we
need is to drive home to the
country that profound dissatis
faction with the war is not limit
ed to one segment of society."

Brown remarked that he felt
that the U.S. had no "grand de
sign" for conquest in South-
East Asia.
"We stumbled into this by a
series of little mistakes, and
now it's almost irretrievable," he
said, and now we have no real
goal.
Since we are presently at an
impasse, "some very bold initia
tive has to be taken by the
stronger nation — which is us
and this step has to be taken
at a risk."
Although negotiation would be
a risk, he feels, this would be
a risk "we can take when con
fronted with the immense risks
in following a policy of escala
tion," and thereby inviting a con
flict with Communist China.
Desire To Negotiate
What is also important, Brown
feels, is persuading "not just Ho
Chi Minh, but also the rest of
the world, that we really desire
to negotiate."
This is now necessary, he
stated, because of the many lies
that the Administration has
made about its actions and aims
in Vietnam.
