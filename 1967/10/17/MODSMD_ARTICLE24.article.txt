# Ex-FS Mer Weissman At Stanford
## 
### 
Steve Weissman, one of the
leading figures of the Berkeley
Free Spech Movement of 1964
(FSM) is now a student in the
Latin American Studies Pro
gram at Stanford.
Weissman said he did not see
much value in casting reflec
tions on past activities with the
FSM And as far as making com
parisons between Stanford and
UC at Berkeley, he felt this is
something on which he was not
really qualified to speak.
As for any similar activities
going on at Stanford, he indi
cated that he was not involved.
Weissman was the chairman
of the Berkeley Graduate Coor
dinating Council which lent con
siderable support to the FSM
strike of 1964, when Berkeley
students beseiged Sproul Hall,
the administration offices.
The Committee threatened a
strike of graduate teaching as
sistants if punitive measures
were taken against the striking
members of the FSM.
