# Rep Theater To Present Revivals Of Two Plays
## 
### 
Visions of fortune and success,
a long-lost benefactor, and a
mythical bird all work their
way into characterizations as
the Stanford Repertory Theater
opens with the work of one of
its own artists.
In a bill of two one-act plays
openirg Thursday, artist-in-resi
dence Paul E. Richards will di
rect his own play, There Is a
Meeting Place, and will perform
in Out at Sea by Polish author
Slawomir Mrozek.
The two plays are revivals of
successful SRT products from
last season. Performances will
be at 8 p.m., Oct. 19-21 and Oct.
26-28 in the Little Theater.

There Is a Meeting Place was
produced last spring as a project
of the master of fine ares stu
dents, playing to full houses in
the Nitery. The play is now a
part of the SRT repertory. For
mer MFA candidates Sheldon
Feldner, Ruth Hunt, and Stephen
D. Newman, who originally star
red in the production, will re
create their roles as members of
the professional company.
Richards started writing the
play at the Actor's Studio in
New York in 1958. Putting his
work aside to play in "Once
More with Feeling," he finished
it when he joined the new resi
dent theater at Stanford in 1965.
At Stanford, Richards rewrote
the script, using the play as a
workshop tool for student ac
tors. Many of the changes came
out of class work and rehearsal
improvisations.
The setting and imagery of his
play were strongly influenced by
his family background.
The plot concerns an egotisti
cal rock-and-roll singer fleeing
the reality of declining popu
larity; his manager, who feeds
the singer assurances of great
ness while nursing memories of
his own long-since vanished vau
deville successes; and a hero
worshipping teen-age girl who
comes to a hotel room for a
glimpse of her idol.
Richards drew many of his
images from memories of his
father's stories.
Richards' father, who had been
a blacksmith in Russia, worked
as a janitor in New York during
the depression. Even when he
had no food for his family he
promised them a mansion in the
country, with white bulldogs to
guard the estate, and a Pierce
Arrow in the driveway.

the professional company.
Richards started writing the
play at the Actor's Studio in
New York in 1958. Putting his
work aside to play in "Once
More with Feeling," he finished
it when he joined the new resi
dent theater at Stanford in 1965.
At Stanford, Richards rewrote
the script, using the play as a
workshop tool for student ac
tors. Many of the changes came
out of class work and rehearsal
improvisations.
The setting and imagery of his
play were strongly influenced by
his family background.
The plot concerns an egotisti
cal rock-and-roll singer fleeing
the reality of declining popu
larity; his manager, who feeds
the singer assurances of great
ness while nursing memories of
his own long-since vanished vau
deville successes; and a hero
worshipping teen-age girl who
comes to a hotel room for a
glimpse of her idol.
Richards drew many of his
images from memories of his
father's stories.
Richards' father, who had been
a blacksmith in Russia, worked
as a janitor in New York during
the depression. Even when he
had no food for his family he
promised them a mansion in the
country, with white bulldogs to
guard the estate, and a Pierce
Arrow in the driveway.
Visions of fortune and success,
a long-lost benefactor, and a
mythical bird all work their
way into characterizations as
the Stanford Repertory Theater
opens with the work of one of
its own artists.
In a bill of two one-act plays
openirg Thursday, artist-in-resi
dence Paul E. Richards will di
rect his own play, There Is a
Meeting Place, and will perform
in Out at Sea by Polish author
Slawomir Mrozek.
The two plays are revivals of
successful SRT products from
last season. Performances will
be at 8 p.m., Oct. 19-21 and Oct.
26-28 in the Little Theater.

There Is a Meeting Place was
produced last spring as a project
of the master of fine ares stu
dents, playing to full houses in
the Nitery. The play is now a
part of the SRT repertory. For
mer MFA candidates Sheldon
Feldner, Ruth Hunt, and Stephen
D. Newman, who originally star
red in the production, will re
create their roles as members of
the professional company.
