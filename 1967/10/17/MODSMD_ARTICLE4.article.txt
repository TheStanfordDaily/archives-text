OAKLAND, (AP)—About 3,000 antidraft demonstrators invaded
the University of California's Berkeley campus Monday night in de
fying a court injunction banning any campus antiwar teach-in.
The demonstrators marched through Sather Gate to the Sproul
Hall plaza on the campus after a rally in the Berkeley Civic Center
three blocks outside the university.
Campus police took no action against the demonstrators.

At least nineteen Stanford professors and students were arrested
yesterday morning by Oakland police when they sat in at the Oak
land Induction Center.
By late last night over 130 demonstrators had been arrested and
booked at the Oakland City Jail or the Santa Rita County Prison
Farm. Many of those arrested will be arraigned in Oakland at 9 a.m.
this morning.
The sit-in continued all day and into the evening in anticipation of
today's "shut-down" demonstration at the Induction Center. A group
from Stanford will be led this morning by Rick Bogard, a sophomore
physics student.
Injunction Granted
Alameda County Supervisors yesterday afternoon were granted
an injunction forbidding Cal students from holding an all-night teach
in on the Berkeley campus.
Late last night it seemed possible that demonstrators might defy

case, the court order is not expected to diminish the militancy of to
dav's action*
About 800 demonstrators initiated "Stop The Draft Week" yester
day in Oakland. The Daily confirmed the following were among those
arrested: Professor of Economics John Gurley, the editor of the
American Economic Review, Professor of Anatomy Hadley Kirkman,
Professor of Pathology Leland Rather, and Instructor of Psychiatry
Robert Spitzer.
Support Picketing
Picketing in support of those arrested were another 150 to 200
Stanford students and faculty. Other people were ready to commit
civil disobedience by blocking one of the three doors of the draft
building, but were unable to do so as the Oakland police were some
what hesitant to make arrests. Professor Michael Novak, one of
those who was not arrested, said "I think we've made our point.
Arriving well before the six o'clock opening of the draft center,
demonstrators wearing white arm bands blocked the doorways of
the building, preventing a half dozen inductees from entering at 7:30.
The supporting crowd chanted "don't go" and began cheering when
the group of draftees marched away down the street.
The first paddy wagon rolled up before 8:00, and police made 17
arrests including pacifist Ira Sandperl and several elderly ladies.

Toward 9:30, another group of 21 were arrested including folk singer
Joanßaez. , , . , ~,
By ten o'clock only a handful of inductees had gone into the build
ing for their physicals. At this time, about 200 state troopers with
billy clubs, helmets, and guns marched out of a nearby parking ga
rage and lined the street as Oakland police cleared the side entrance.
Nine buses of inductees then passed between the police lines and un
loaded while the crowd again shouted "don't go."
About fifteen demonstrators subsequently sat down in the street
at the end of the police lines hoping to block any following buses. In
this group were Stanford professors Gurley and Kirkman, students
David Pugh and John Shippee, and local bookstore owner Roy Kep
ler. The Oakland police encircled and quickly arrested these war pro
testors.
By eieven o'clock, the arrests appeared to be over since no more
inductees were expected to arrive and force entrance into the build
ing. But at 11:40, another paddy wagon stopped in front ol the side
door on 15th street where employees were unable to get by sitting
demonstrotors.
Among those arrested were Ron Sox of the linear accelerator staff,
and students Mary Hanson, Debbie Weiner, Sue Haley, Dawn Mey
ners, and John Gostovich.
The arrested demonstrators were charged with from one to four
violations of the penal code including trespassing, disturbing the

peace, and creating a public nuisance. Bail was set at $220.00 on each
charge.
Around noon, the crowd began drifting away as many people lett
for the Resistance rally in San Francisco. However, some of the pro
testors made ready to spend the night at the Induction Centei.
Except for several draftees and federal employees who "walked
over" protestors blocking entrances to the building, yesterday's dem
onstration was without violent incident.
Possible Violence
This morning's demonstration may erupt in violence as organizers
are giving individuals the option of "defending themselves" against
the police. The protestors hope to stop all incoming traffic by tying
up intersections and by using their large numbers to confound police.
Other professors who participated in the support demonstration in
cluded George Leppert (mechanical engineering), Charles Drekmier
(political science), Roland Finston (health physics), Julian Ripley
(physical science), and Charles Stein (statistics), who was the first
Stanford faculty member to be arrested last summer.
Ten to fifteen Stanford medical students looking dapper in white
coats handed out leaflets calling upon draftees to choose an alterna
tive to induction, "the first step towards dehumanization."
John Shippee, "de facto Stanford organizer for the demonstration,"
described it as a "non-violent act of civil disobedience in the Gan
dhian tradition."

Other professors who participated in the support demonstration in
cluded George Leppert (mechanical engineering), Charles Drekmier
(political science), Roland Finston (health physics), Julian Ripley
(physical science), and Charles Stein (statistics), who was the first
Stanford faculty member to be arrested last summer.
Ten to fifteen Stanford medical students looking dapper in white
coats handed out leaflets calling upon draftees to choose an alterna

John Shippee, "de facto Stanford organizer for the demonstration,"
described it as a "non-violent act of civil disobedience in the Gan

OAKLAND, (AP)—About 3,000 antidraft demonstrators invaded
the University of California's Berkeley campus Monday night in de
fying a court injunction banning any campus antiwar teach-in.
The demonstrators marched through Sather Gate to the Sproul
Hall plaza on the campus after a rally in the Berkeley Civic Center
three blocks outside the university.
Campus police took no action against the demonstrators.

At least nineteen Stanford professors and students were arrested
yesterday morning by Oakland police when they sat in at the Oak
land Induction Center.
By late last night over 130 demonstrators had been arrested and
booked at the Oakland City Jail or the Santa Rita County Prison
Farm. Many of those arrested will be arraigned in Oakland at 9 a.m.
this morning.
The sit-in continued all day and into the evening in anticipation of
today's "shut-down" demonstration at the Induction Center. A group
from Stanford will be led this morning by Rick Bogard, a sophomore
physics student.
Injunction Granted
Alameda County Supervisors yesterday afternoon were granted
an injunction forbidding Cal students from holding an all-night teach
in on the Berkeley campus.

case, the court order is not expected to diminish the militancy of to
dav's action*
About 800 demonstrators initiated "Stop The Draft Week" yester
day in Oakland. The Daily confirmed the following were among those
arrested: Professor of Economics John Gurley, the editor of the
American Economic Review, Professor of Anatomy Hadley Kirkman,
Professor of Pathology Leland Rather, and Instructor of Psychiatry
Robert Spitzer.
Support Picketing
Picketing in support of those arrested were another 150 to 200
Stanford students and faculty. Other people were ready to commit
civil disobedience by blocking one of the three doors of the draft
building, but were unable to do so as the Oakland police were some
what hesitant to make arrests. Professor Michael Novak, one of
those who was not arrested, said "I think we've made our point.
Arriving well before the six o'clock opening of the draft center,
demonstrators wearing white arm bands blocked the doorways of
the building, preventing a half dozen inductees from entering at 7:30.
The supporting crowd chanted "don't go" and began cheering when
the group of draftees marched away down the street.
The first paddy wagon rolled up before 8:00, and police made 17
arrests including pacifist Ira Sandperl and several elderly ladies.

Toward 9:30, another group of 21 were arrested including folk singer
Joanßaez. , , . , ~,
By ten o'clock only a handful of inductees had gone into the build
ing for their physicals. At this time, about 200 state troopers with
billy clubs, helmets, and guns marched out of a nearby parking ga
rage and lined the street as Oakland police cleared the side entrance.
Nine buses of inductees then passed between the police lines and un
loaded while the crowd again shouted "don't go."
About fifteen demonstrators subsequently sat down in the street
at the end of the police lines hoping to block any following buses. In
this group were Stanford professors Gurley and Kirkman, students
David Pugh and John Shippee, and local bookstore owner Roy Kep
ler. The Oakland police encircled and quickly arrested these war pro
testors.
By eieven o'clock, the arrests appeared to be over since no more
inductees were expected to arrive and force entrance into the build
ing. But at 11:40, another paddy wagon stopped in front ol the side
door on 15th street where employees were unable to get by sitting
demonstrotors.
Among those arrested were Ron Sox of the linear accelerator staff,
and students Mary Hanson, Debbie Weiner, Sue Haley, Dawn Mey
ners, and John Gostovich.
The arrested demonstrators were charged with from one to four
violations of the penal code including trespassing, disturbing the

peace, and creating a public nuisance. Bail was set at $220.00 on each
charge.
Around noon, the crowd began drifting away as many people lett
for the Resistance rally in San Francisco. However, some of the pro
testors made ready to spend the night at the Induction Centei.
Except for several draftees and federal employees who "walked
over" protestors blocking entrances to the building, yesterday's dem
onstration was without violent incident.
Possible Violence
This morning's demonstration may erupt in violence as organizers
are giving individuals the option of "defending themselves" against
the police. The protestors hope to stop all incoming traffic by tying
up intersections and by using their large numbers to confound police.

The arrested demonstrators were charged with from one to four
violations of the penal code including trespassing, disturbing the

peace, and creating a public nuisance. Bail was set at $220.00 on each
charge.
Around noon, the crowd began drifting away as many people lett
for the Resistance rally in San Francisco. However, some of the pro
testors made ready to spend the night at the Induction Centei.
Except for several draftees and federal employees who "walked
over" protestors blocking entrances to the building, yesterday's dem
onstration was without violent incident.
Possible Violence
This morning's demonstration may erupt in violence as organizers
are giving individuals the option of "defending themselves" against
the police. The protestors hope to stop all incoming traffic by tying
up intersections and by using their large numbers to confound police.
Other professors who participated in the support demonstration in
cluded George Leppert (mechanical engineering), Charles Drekmier
(political science), Roland Finston (health physics), Julian Ripley
(physical science), and Charles Stein (statistics), who was the first
Stanford faculty member to be arrested last summer.
Ten to fifteen Stanford medical students looking dapper in white
coats handed out leaflets calling upon draftees to choose an alterna
tive to induction, "the first step towards dehumanization."
John Shippee, "de facto Stanford organizer for the demonstration,"
described it as a "non-violent act of civil disobedience in the Gan
dhian tradition."

At least nineteen Stanford professors and students were arrested
yesterday morning by Oakland police when they sat in at the Oak
land Induction Center.
By late last night over 130 demonstrators had been arrested and
booked at the Oakland City Jail or the Santa Rita County Prison
Farm. Many of those arrested will be arraigned in Oakland at 9 a.m.
this morning.
The sit-in continued all day and into the evening in anticipation of
today's "shut-down" demonstration at the Induction Center. A group
from Stanford will be led this morning by Rick Bogard, a sophomore
physics student.
Injunction Granted
Alameda County Supervisors yesterday afternoon were granted
an injunction forbidding Cal students from holding an all-night teach

About 800 demonstrators initiated "Stop The Draft Week" yester
day in Oakland. The Daily confirmed the following were among those
arrested: Professor of Economics John Gurley, the editor of the
American Economic Review, Professor of Anatomy Hadley Kirkman,
Professor of Pathology Leland Rather, and Instructor of Psychiatry
Robert Spitzer.
Support Picketing
Picketing in support of those arrested were another 150 to 200
Stanford students and faculty. Other people were ready to commit
civil disobedience by blocking one of the three doors of the draft
building, but were unable to do so as the Oakland police were some
what hesitant to make arrests. Professor Michael Novak, one of
those who was not arrested, said "I think we've made our point.
Arriving well before the six o'clock opening of the draft center,
demonstrators wearing white arm bands blocked the doorways of
the building, preventing a half dozen inductees from entering at 7:30.
The supporting crowd chanted "don't go" and began cheering when
the group of draftees marched away down the street.
The first paddy wagon rolled up before 8:00, and police made 17
arrests including pacifist Ira Sandperl and several elderly ladies.

Toward 9:30, another group of 21 were arrested including folk singer
Joanßaez. , , . , ~,
By ten o'clock only a handful of inductees had gone into the build
ing for their physicals. At this time, about 200 state troopers with
billy clubs, helmets, and guns marched out of a nearby parking ga
rage and lined the street as Oakland police cleared the side entrance.
Nine buses of inductees then passed between the police lines and un
loaded while the crowd again shouted "don't go."
About fifteen demonstrators subsequently sat down in the street
at the end of the police lines hoping to block any following buses. In
this group were Stanford professors Gurley and Kirkman, students
David Pugh and John Shippee, and local bookstore owner Roy Kep
ler. The Oakland police encircled and quickly arrested these war pro
testors.
By eieven o'clock, the arrests appeared to be over since no more
inductees were expected to arrive and force entrance into the build
ing. But at 11:40, another paddy wagon stopped in front ol the side
door on 15th street where employees were unable to get by sitting
demonstrotors.
Among those arrested were Ron Sox of the linear accelerator staff,
and students Mary Hanson, Debbie Weiner, Sue Haley, Dawn Mey
ners, and John Gostovich.
