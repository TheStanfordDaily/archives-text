# Berkeley's Higher
## Are Student Pay Scales Too Low? 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
Pay scales for par Mime work
ers at Stanford are lower than at
Berkeley, but few student em
ployees have complaints about
the money they make.
A random poll of library work
ers, hashers and student guides
indicated that they consider extra
benefits of working on the cam
pus adequate compensation fol
low wages.
According to lan Jacobsen of
the personnel department, Ber
keley hashers start at a wage
higher than the overall average
for Stanford hashers.
Although most student food
service employees "never see the
money they make (hashers re
ceive free room and board in ex
change for their work) hourly
wages begin at $1.50 and go up
with the length of time on the
job. Head hasher salaries vary
among residences, but average
around $1.85.

Berkeley hashers begin with
twenty cents more an hour and
may work up to $1.95 an hour in
some jobs.
Well Paid Guides
Stanford guides make more
money than any other part-time
student workersâ€”as much as
$2.00 an hour for senior guides.
But according to Mrs. Jayne
Dungan of the Hoover Institu
tion guide service, Berkeley stu
dents doing the same job may
earn $2.45.
Stanford libraries pay the low
est wages, beginning at $1.40 and
rarely going over $1.80. The aver
age hourly wage for all student
librarians is currently $1.53. Ac
cording to L. C. Pearson, person
nel director of the library sys
tem, the average will soon rise
twenty cents as a result of the
Fair Labor Standards act passed
by Congress earlier this year.
"The whole salary structure,"
Jacobsen said, is higher at Ber

keley than at Stanford. They can
sock the taxpayer, while we have
to rely on gifts to the university.
"The problem for us," he said,
"is that no one gives an endowed
hasher position. Doners almost
invariably want their name asso
ciated with their gift, so there are
few unrestricted funds."
Government Funds
According to Pearson, the li
brary has had to wait until fed
eral legislation could be used as
a "crowbar" to obtain more funds
for student salaries.
"Because only employees in
volved in interstate commerce
are affected by the law, our stu
dents in circulation and reference
might not have to be paid the
new minimum wage," she said.
"But we've elected not to pay
only a few of the students more
because we're interested in rais
ing the base and average wages,"
Pearson remarked.
Although a union open to li-

brary workers has recently been
formed on campus, Pearson said
he thought the complaints were
due to problems other than sala
ries.
None of the students inter
viewed by The Daily in any Uni
versity jobs had ever requested
higher pay. Although many said
they thought the pay was poor,
they said there were so many ad
vantages to working on campus
they didn't feel they should com
plain about wages.
Convenience
"The convenience of working
within walking distance is more
important to me than a big sal
ary," said one girl. "I could work
at a similar job in Palo Alto and
be paid a lot more, but it just
wouldn't be worth it."
Another boy agreed and added,
"I'm not trying to make a killing
off the University."
Many students said their jobs
were given to them as part of a

scholarship, so they had never
thought about pay scales. "I felt
lucky to get a hashing job," one
girl said. "They may be taking
advantage of me, but it's just
never occurred to me."
"The work isn't hard," another
girl pointed out. "In fact it's fun.
Besides, I wouldn't know who to
ask "for a raise."
One librarian commented that
he had thought of requesting a
wage increase, but since he
worked at night and never came
to the library during the day, he
had only seen his superior once.
Bucking- The University
A hasher said he had also con
sidered it one time. "But," he
said, "you're bucking the Univer
sity, and they give you the schol
arships and the jobs as well as
the grades.
"I figured it just wasn't worth
the bother." Like most of the
other employees, he was under
the impression that part-time stu
dent jobs on campus are scarce,
and that he was lucky to find any
kind of convenient work.
Several hashers pointed out
that one convenience of their job
is the flexibility of hours. "It's
nice to be able to know you can
get a substitute," one comment
ed. "You probably wouldn't have
that advantage working outside
somewhere."
Most of the students said they
thought one of the reasons pay
was low was that there was so
much turnover in student jobs
and that the university could not
afford to pay as much as outside
businesses did to old employees.
"Working in a university job
seems to be really temporary,"
one boy commented, so it doesn't
seem worth it to gripe about
money. But I sure wouldn't
mind," he added, "if somebody up
there raised them."
