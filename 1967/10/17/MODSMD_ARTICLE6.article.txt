## Health Center Watching Its Figures 
### HERBERT TERRY 
After four years of study the
Cowell Student Health Center is
on its way towards becoming the
first college health service with
complete statistical data about
the illnesses it treats and the
services it renders.
Because of a computer-assist
ed survey begun under former
health service director Dr. Mau
rice Osborne, Stanford's health
service may soon have the most
accurate health profile of a
university and its students avail
able in this country.
Dr. Marion Shikamur'a who,
with Dr. Osborne, orginally be
gan the survey, explained that

there have been many problems
in conducting the study and that
the health center is just begin
ning to get reliable information.
No Precedent
"We have been working on
this in a trial and error man
ner," she said. "There was . . .
no precedent for what we've
been doing. . . . The Kaiser Med
ical Plan, with more time and
money than we've had, did some
work of this nature, but it took
them three or four years to get
less complete results than we
have now."
"Up until this quarter we've
been having a lot of trouble with
the machine-systems ... all we

can say from the data we have
at this moment is that it points
to trends, we can't rely upon it
enough to release specific num
bers . . . although we expect this
year's results to provide such
information," she concluded.
One trend is a high instance of
upper respiratory infections,
such as colds and flu, during the
first six weeks of fall quarter
and early in spring quarter.
"This is probably the result
of it being just the time of year
for these things," said Dr. Shi
kamura. She explained, "Of the
25 to 30 patients I will see to
day, probably 15 will have vari

ations of the theme of 'the com
mon cold.'" She also said the
survey is providing information
about the seasonal nature of
allergies in the Stanford area.
Skiing Injuries
During fall and spring the
health service treats a large
number of "traumatic injuries,"
accident-caused injuries, includ
ing fractures, sprains and con
cussions. She blamed the wet
weather and an increase of out
door skiing activities for the sea
sonal increase.
Psychological problems treat
ed by the health center are divid
ed into what Dr. Shikamura calls
"large category-type diagnoses
. "Nearly one-fourth of the
cases seen are called "anxiety
reaction cases," while another
quarter falls into the "adolescent
adjustment" category. During
dead week and finals week a
large number of "psycho-viscer
al" cases are treated, in which
anxiety has brought about up
set stomachs and indigestion.
According to Dr. Shikamura,
Stanford students are intensely
concerned about their health.
"Just the pressure of being
here, whether it is academic or
personal, makes health prob
lems important to students.
There's a desire to get well
quickly and get back to school
which intensifies concern over
health matters."
In addition, she described the
college years as "a generally
healthy period of life as far as
serious illnesses go." But she
added, for many students col
lege is " . . . really the first time
they've been forced to seek med
ical care on their own . . . and

sometimes they're overly con
cern about small matters—such
as 'the common cold.'"
Computerized
Based on some 1500 record-of
entry forms filled out weekly at
the health center, the IBM sur
vey will give complete informa
tion on office services, nursing
services, physician services, diag
noses and both infirmary and
hospital care.
Dr. James B. McClenahan, act
ing director of the health ser
vice, explained that the health
center had four goals in mind
when it undertook the computer
study of Stanfora ailments.
First, he said, was a desire
to gather data for administra
tive purposes. The health cen
ter, he noted, needed informa
tion on clerical, medical, psy
chiatric and lab services in order
to plan for future expansion.
The discovery of medical or
psychological trends among
Stanford's students was the sec
ond goal cited by McClenahan.
He said the University was in
terested in the general health
atmosphere of Stanford and hop-

Ed to see what effects college
life might have on health.
The third reason for the sur
vey, said McClcnahan, was a
medical questionnaire admini
stered three years ago to what
is now the class of 1968. That
questionnaire attempted to de
termine the then-incoming fresh
man's attitudes toward medicine
and medical care and, according
to McClenahan, another ques
tionnaire will be administered
before the class leaves Stanford,
if funding can be arranged. He
said a complete profile of the use
of the health service would be
valuable in interpreting changes
in health attitudes between the
freshman and senior year.
The final reason for the study,
was to enable the health service,
with the aid of the computer,
to keep a constantly updated in
dividual record of a student's
health and use of on-campus
medical facilities. The goal of
the health center, he said, was
to continually review and add to
the basic health record each stu
dent submits when he is admit
ted to Stanford.

questionnaire attempted to de
termine the then-incoming fresh
man's attitudes toward medicine
and medical care and, according
to McClenahan, another ques
tionnaire will be administered
before the class leaves Stanford,
if funding can be arranged. He
said a complete profile of the use
of the health service would be
valuable in interpreting changes
in health attitudes between the
freshman and senior year.
The final reason for the study,
was to enable the health service,
with the aid of the computer,
to keep a constantly updated in
dividual record of a student's
health and use of on-campus
medical facilities. The goal of
the health center, he said, was
to continually review and add to
the basic health record each stu
dent submits when he is admit
ted to Stanford.
After four years of study the
Cowell Student Health Center is
on its way towards becoming the
first college health service with
complete statistical data about
the illnesses it treats and the
services it renders.
Because of a computer-assist
ed survey begun under former
health service director Dr. Mau
rice Osborne, Stanford's health
service may soon have the most
accurate health profile of a
university and its students avail
able in this country.
Dr. Marion Shikamur'a who,
with Dr. Osborne, orginally be
gan the survey, explained that

there have been many problems
in conducting the study and that
the health center is just begin
ning to get reliable information.
No Precedent
"We have been working on
this in a trial and error man
ner," she said. "There was . . .
no precedent for what we've
been doing. . . . The Kaiser Med
ical Plan, with more time and
money than we've had, did some
work of this nature, but it took
them three or four years to get
less complete results than we
have now."
"Up until this quarter we've
been having a lot of trouble with
the machine-systems ... all we

can say from the data we have
at this moment is that it points
to trends, we can't rely upon it
enough to release specific num
bers . . . although we expect this
year's results to provide such
information," she concluded.
One trend is a high instance of
upper respiratory infections,
such as colds and flu, during the
first six weeks of fall quarter
and early in spring quarter.
"This is probably the result
of it being just the time of year
for these things," said Dr. Shi
kamura. She explained, "Of the
25 to 30 patients I will see to
day, probably 15 will have vari

ations of the theme of 'the com
mon cold.'" She also said the
survey is providing information
about the seasonal nature of
allergies in the Stanford area.
Skiing Injuries
During fall and spring the
health service treats a large
number of "traumatic injuries,"
accident-caused injuries, includ
ing fractures, sprains and con
cussions. She blamed the wet
weather and an increase of out
door skiing activities for the sea
sonal increase.
Psychological problems treat
ed by the health center are divid
ed into what Dr. Shikamura calls
"large category-type diagnoses
. "Nearly one-fourth of the
cases seen are called "anxiety
reaction cases," while another
quarter falls into the "adolescent
adjustment" category. During
dead week and finals week a
large number of "psycho-viscer
al" cases are treated, in which
anxiety has brought about up
set stomachs and indigestion.
According to Dr. Shikamura,
Stanford students are intensely
concerned about their health.
"Just the pressure of being
here, whether it is academic or
personal, makes health prob
lems important to students.
There's a desire to get well
quickly and get back to school
which intensifies concern over
health matters."
In addition, she described the
college years as "a generally
healthy period of life as far as
serious illnesses go." But she
added, for many students col
lege is " . . . really the first time
they've been forced to seek med
ical care on their own . . . and

sometimes they're overly con
cern about small matters—such
as 'the common cold.'"
Computerized
Based on some 1500 record-of
entry forms filled out weekly at
the health center, the IBM sur
vey will give complete informa
tion on office services, nursing
services, physician services, diag
noses and both infirmary and
hospital care.
Dr. James B. McClenahan, act
ing director of the health ser
vice, explained that the health
center had four goals in mind
when it undertook the computer
study of Stanfora ailments.
First, he said, was a desire
to gather data for administra
tive purposes. The health cen
ter, he noted, needed informa
tion on clerical, medical, psy
chiatric and lab services in order
to plan for future expansion.
The discovery of medical or
psychological trends among
Stanford's students was the sec
ond goal cited by McClenahan.
He said the University was in
terested in the general health
atmosphere of Stanford and hop-

Ed to see what effects college
life might have on health.
The third reason for the sur
vey, said McClcnahan, was a
medical questionnaire admini
stered three years ago to what
is now the class of 1968. That
questionnaire attempted to de

center had four goals in mind
when it undertook the computer
study of Stanfora ailments.
First, he said, was a desire
to gather data for administra
tive purposes. The health cen
ter, he noted, needed informa
tion on clerical, medical, psy
chiatric and lab services in order
to plan for future expansion.
The discovery of medical or
psychological trends among
Stanford's students was the sec
ond goal cited by McClenahan.
He said the University was in
terested in the general health
atmosphere of Stanford and hop-

Ed to see what effects college
life might have on health.
The third reason for the sur
vey, said McClcnahan, was a
medical questionnaire admini
stered three years ago to what
is now the class of 1968. That
questionnaire attempted to de
termine the then-incoming fresh
man's attitudes toward medicine
and medical care and, according
to McClenahan, another ques
tionnaire will be administered
before the class leaves Stanford,
if funding can be arranged. He
said a complete profile of the use
of the health service would be
valuable in interpreting changes
in health attitudes between the
freshman and senior year.
The final reason for the study,
was to enable the health service,
with the aid of the computer,
to keep a constantly updated in
dividual record of a student's
health and use of on-campus
medical facilities. The goal of
the health center, he said, was
to continually review and add to
the basic health record each stu
dent submits when he is admit
ted to Stanford.
After four years of study the
Cowell Student Health Center is
on its way towards becoming the
first college health service with
complete statistical data about
the illnesses it treats and the
services it renders.
Because of a computer-assist
ed survey begun under former
health service director Dr. Mau
rice Osborne, Stanford's health
service may soon have the most
accurate health profile of a
university and its students avail
able in this country.
Dr. Marion Shikamur'a who,
with Dr. Osborne, orginally be
gan the survey, explained that

there have been many problems
in conducting the study and that
the health center is just begin
ning to get reliable information.
No Precedent
"We have been working on
this in a trial and error man
ner," she said. "There was . . .
no precedent for what we've
been doing. . . . The Kaiser Med
ical Plan, with more time and
money than we've had, did some
work of this nature, but it took
them three or four years to get
less complete results than we
have now."
"Up until this quarter we've
been having a lot of trouble with
the machine-systems ... all we

can say from the data we have
at this moment is that it points
to trends, we can't rely upon it
enough to release specific num
bers . . . although we expect this
year's results to provide such
information," she concluded.
One trend is a high instance of
upper respiratory infections,
such as colds and flu, during the
first six weeks of fall quarter
and early in spring quarter.
"This is probably the result
of it being just the time of year
for these things," said Dr. Shi
kamura. She explained, "Of the
25 to 30 patients I will see to
day, probably 15 will have vari

ations of the theme of 'the com
mon cold.'" She also said the
survey is providing information
about the seasonal nature of
allergies in the Stanford area.
Skiing Injuries
During fall and spring the
health service treats a large
number of "traumatic injuries,"
accident-caused injuries, includ
ing fractures, sprains and con
cussions. She blamed the wet
weather and an increase of out
door skiing activities for the sea
sonal increase.
Psychological problems treat
ed by the health center are divid
ed into what Dr. Shikamura calls
"large category-type diagnoses
. "Nearly one-fourth of the
cases seen are called "anxiety
reaction cases," while another
quarter falls into the "adolescent
adjustment" category. During
dead week and finals week a
large number of "psycho-viscer
al" cases are treated, in which
anxiety has brought about up
set stomachs and indigestion.
According to Dr. Shikamura,
Stanford students are intensely
concerned about their health.
"Just the pressure of being
here, whether it is academic or
personal, makes health prob
lems important to students.
There's a desire to get well
quickly and get back to school
which intensifies concern over
health matters."
In addition, she described the
college years as "a generally
healthy period of life as far as
serious illnesses go." But she
added, for many students col
lege is " . . . really the first time
they've been forced to seek med
ical care on their own . . . and

sometimes they're overly con
cern about small matters—such
as 'the common cold.'"
Computerized
Based on some 1500 record-of
entry forms filled out weekly at
the health center, the IBM sur
vey will give complete informa
tion on office services, nursing
services, physician services, diag
noses and both infirmary and
hospital care.
