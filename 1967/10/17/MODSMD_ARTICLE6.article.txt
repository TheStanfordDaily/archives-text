## Health Center Watching Its Figures 
### HERBERT TERRY 
After four years of study the
Cowell Student Health Center is
on its way towards becoming the
first college health service with
complete statistical data about
the illnesses it treats and the
services it renders.
Because of a computer-assist
ed survey begun under former
health service director Dr. Mau
rice Osborne, Stanford's health
service may soon have the most
accurate health profile of a
university and its students avail
able in this country.
Dr. Marion Shikamur'a who,
with Dr. Osborne, orginally be
gan the survey, explained that

there have been many problems
in conducting the study and that
the health center is just begin
ning to get reliable information.
No Precedent
"We have been working on
this in a trial and error man
ner," she said. "There was . . .
no precedent for what we've
been doing. . . . The Kaiser Med
ical Plan, with more time and
money than we've had, did some
work of this nature, but it took
them three or four years to get
less complete results than we
have now."
"Up until this quarter we've
been having a lot of trouble with
the machine-systems ... all we

can say from the data we have
at this moment is that it points
to trends, we can't rely upon it
enough to release specific num
bers . . . although we expect this
year's results to provide such
information," she concluded.
One trend is a high instance of
upper respiratory infections,
such as colds and flu, during the
first six weeks of fall quarter
and early in spring quarter.
"This is probably the result
of it being just the time of year
for these things," said Dr. Shi
kamura. She explained, "Of the
25 to 30 patients I will see to
day, probably 15 will have vari

ations of the theme of 'the com
mon cold.'" She also said the
survey is providing information
about the seasonal nature of
allergies in the Stanford area.
Skiing Injuries
During fall and spring the
health service treats a large
number of "traumatic injuries,"
accident-caused injuries, includ
ing fractures, sprains and con
cussions. She blamed the wet
weather and an increase of out
door skiing activities for the sea
sonal increase.
