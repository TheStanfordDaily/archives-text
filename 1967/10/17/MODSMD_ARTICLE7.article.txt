# Academic Freedom Declining In University Communities
## 
### WALTER GRANT 
WASHINGTON (CPS)—
Although lip service to aca
demic freedom is increasing in
college and university commun
ities, academic freedom itself
may be waning, according to a
university president.
Dr. W. Allen Wallis, president
of the University of Rochester,
says there are a variety of aca
demic freedoms which seem to
bo diminishing, and as a result
universities are likely to have
less control than ever before
over their own coherence and
priorities.
Wallis' remarks were made in
a background paper presented
Friday at the 50th annual meet
ing of the American Council on
Education here. The paper was
entitled "Institutional Coher
ence and Priorities."
The freedom to present con
troversial views on campus
exists at few institutions of
higher learning, Wallis said.
"Stokely Carmichael can
speak without hindrance, but

George Wallace creates so grave
a threat of disorder as to pre
clude the possibility that he
would be listened to calmly and
fairly.
"Senator Fulbright would be
given a respectful hearing on
any campus; few would dare
invite Secretary McNamara,
since his appearance would
almost certainly precipitate ten
sions, probably protests, and
possibly disorders that would
prevent free and open discus
sion.
"Timothy Leary enjoys free
dom of speech on most cam
puses, J. Edgar Hoover on few;
Nelson Rockefeller and Robert
Kennedy on many, Richard Nix
on and Hubert Humphrey on
few," Wallis said.
Hands Tied
Administrators cannot take
steps to preserve genuine free
dom of speech for unpopular
speakers "without incurring the
charge of suppressing free
speech," he added.

Wallis also said the freedom
of institutions to set their own
priorities is being further limit
ed as faculty members become
more and more subject to out
side influence.
In addition, he said, the free
dom of universities has been
eroded as the importance of
funds from the government has
grown.
"The constraints operate not
because these funds are of pub
lic rather than private origin
but because the source of funds
is centralizied," he said, adding
that centralization brings about
the loss of institutional auto
nomy.
No Ivory Tower
However, Wallis does not ad
vocate that universities with
draw and convert themselves
into "ivory towers" in order to
resist these threats. Rather, he
savs institutions of higher learn
ing must define their central
and unique role and adhere to
that role.

ities, academic freedom itself
may be waning, according to a
university president.
Dr. W. Allen Wallis, president
of the University of Rochester,
says there are a variety of aca
demic freedoms which seem to
bo diminishing, and as a result
universities are likely to have
less control than ever before
over their own coherence and
priorities.
Wallis' remarks were made in
a background paper presented
Friday at the 50th annual meet
ing of the American Council on
Education here. The paper was
entitled "Institutional Coher
ence and Priorities."
The freedom to present con
troversial views on campus
exists at few institutions of
higher learning, Wallis said.
"Stokely Carmichael can
speak without hindrance, but

George Wallace creates so grave
a threat of disorder as to pre
clude the possibility that he
would be listened to calmly and
fairly.
"Senator Fulbright would be
given a respectful hearing on
any campus; few would dare
invite Secretary McNamara,
since his appearance would
almost certainly precipitate ten
sions, probably protests, and
possibly disorders that would
prevent free and open discus
sion.
"Timothy Leary enjoys free
dom of speech on most cam
puses, J. Edgar Hoover on few;
Nelson Rockefeller and Robert
Kennedy on many, Richard Nix
on and Hubert Humphrey on
few," Wallis said.
Hands Tied
Administrators cannot take
steps to preserve genuine free
dom of speech for unpopular
speakers "without incurring the
charge of suppressing free
speech," he added.

Wallis also said the freedom
of institutions to set their own
priorities is being further limit
ed as faculty members become
more and more subject to out
side influence.
In addition, he said, the free
dom of universities has been
eroded as the importance of
funds from the government has
grown.
"The constraints operate not
because these funds are of pub
lic rather than private origin
but because the source of funds
is centralizied," he said, adding
that centralization brings about
the loss of institutional auto
nomy.
No Ivory Tower
However, Wallis does not ad
vocate that universities with
draw and convert themselves
into "ivory towers" in order to
resist these threats. Rather, he
savs institutions of higher learn
ing must define their central
and unique role and adhere to
that role.
