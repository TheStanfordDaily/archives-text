# The 						Protests
## 
### 
Three years ago, it would have been incon
ceivable that so many citizens across the coun
try could be so incensed that they would drop
their daily routines and physically oppose their
mighty government.
But three years ago, the United States had
less than a tenth as many men in Southeast
Asia as it has now.
Three years ago America's able-bodied men
were being drafted at the same rate they were
being drafted three years before that.
And three years ago there still seemed a
chance that President Johnson meant what he
said about peace in Vietnam.
Today things are different. Talking is wast
ed; our leaders no longer listen, so convinced
are they of their Tightness. Writing letters is
futile; written pleas are answered with form
letters, so large is the volume of correspondence.
Even the electoral process seems to fail us
when we see Johnson elected in 1964 on what
amounted to a peace platform and then an
nouncing a major troop escalation nine months
later.
It is time to "lay our bodies on the line." Dave
Harris said it last year, and he is still saying it.
Hundreds more actually did it yesterday in
Oakland.

The Oakland police, it seems, were instructed
to be polite. For this we can be grateful; we
have seen in the past what the Oakland police
are capable of.
But both the police and the protesters are
victims of a system that tells us to fear commu
nism more than death, to fear loss of face more
than loss of life, to fear retreat more than the
near certainty of nuclear war — that compels
protesters to attack this system and police
to defend it.
A head-on collision may be unavoidable; we
will see more today of the confrontation be
tween these two implacable foes.
The whole spectacle — the war, the sit-ins,
the draft, the protests, the police, the arrests,
— the whole spectacle is a profoundly sad
dening thing.
This country faced worse crises of confidence
in the early years of the Depression, before the
First World War, before the Civil War, indeed,
in the first years of independence. But the pro
tests failed. The momentum of the government
and the lethargy of the people were, and are,
too great.
All we are left with is a growing feeling of
futility and a desperate kind of hope.

Today things are different. Talking is wast
ed; our leaders no longer listen, so convinced
are they of their Tightness. Writing letters is
futile; written pleas are answered with form
letters, so large is the volume of correspondence.
Even the electoral process seems to fail us
when we see Johnson elected in 1964 on what
amounted to a peace platform and then an
nouncing a major troop escalation nine months
later.
It is time to "lay our bodies on the line." Dave
Harris said it last year, and he is still saying it.
Hundreds more actually did it yesterday in
Oakland.

The Oakland police, it seems, were instructed
to be polite. For this we can be grateful; we
have seen in the past what the Oakland police
are capable of.
But both the police and the protesters are
victims of a system that tells us to fear commu
nism more than death, to fear loss of face more
than loss of life, to fear retreat more than the
near certainty of nuclear war — that compels
protesters to attack this system and police
to defend it.
A head-on collision may be unavoidable; we
will see more today of the confrontation be
tween these two implacable foes.
The whole spectacle — the war, the sit-ins,
the draft, the protests, the police, the arrests,
— the whole spectacle is a profoundly sad
dening thing.
This country faced worse crises of confidence
in the early years of the Depression, before the
First World War, before the Civil War, indeed,
in the first years of independence. But the pro
tests failed. The momentum of the government
and the lethargy of the people were, and are,
too great.
All we are left with is a growing feeling of
futility and a desperate kind of hope.
Three years ago, it would have been incon
ceivable that so many citizens across the coun
try could be so incensed that they would drop
their daily routines and physically oppose their
mighty government.
But three years ago, the United States had
less than a tenth as many men in Southeast
Asia as it has now.
Three years ago America's able-bodied men
were being drafted at the same rate they were
being drafted three years before that.
And three years ago there still seemed a
chance that President Johnson meant what he
said about peace in Vietnam.
