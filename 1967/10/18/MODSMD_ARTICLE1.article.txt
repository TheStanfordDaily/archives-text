# Oakland Police Rout Demonstrators
## 
### DANIEL SNELL 
More than 200 club-wielding
Oakland Police yesterday morn
ing routed 3500 anti-war demon
strators who tried to shut down
the Oakland Induction Center.
The police formed a wedge
and moved along streets and
sidewalks clubbing and shoving
protestors who tried to block the
entrances to the center. The
Oakland Police were reinforced
by highway patrolmen at times
standing ten deep.
The opening of the Center was
delayed for about three hours
while police secured the area
around the building. Twenty
two persons were arrested in the
fracas, and about 20 were treated
at Oakland's Highland Hospital.
Demonstrators began to arrive
at the Center at 15th and Clay
about 5 a.m. Many had spent the
night at a Sproul Hall teach-in
which had been banned by a
court injunction that was not en
forced. A group of about 50 who
had pledged to sit in at the Cen
ter began to take positions with
their backs to the doors of the
Center at 5:28.
The rest of the demonstrators
paraded in picket lines in a fairly
orderly fashion, shouting "Hell
no, we won't go," and occasion
ally, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?" and
"1, 2, 3, 4 —We won't fight in
Johnson's war; 5, 6, 7, B—We
don't want no fascist hate."
Protesters Circle
An estimated 3,500 protesters
moved into Clay Street in front
of the Center, wheeling in large
circles and chanting their slo
gans. A police sound truck sta
tioned across the street in the
multi-storied parking garage
across from the Center ordered
the students out of the street,
but they ignored the order. 1
At 7:02 more than 200 Oakland
Police and California Highway
Patrol officers moved in a wedge
up Clay Street, and the demon
strators fell back. Estimations of
the total number of police in the
area vary from 400 to 1000. Some
students who attempted to sit
down in front of the advancing
line were clubbed.
The police swept away the sit

inners from the two doors of the
Center on Clay Street and had
cleared the street in 15 minutes.
The demonstrators retreated
slowly. When some student be
gan to run from the police,
others shouted, "Walk, Walk."
Resort To 'Mace'
At the third door of the Cen
ter, on 15th Street, sit-inners
tried to be more tenacious. Po
lice resorted to "Mace," an aero
sol bomb which then squirted in
the demonstrator's' eyes caused
them to sting.
Several persons were observed
to be bleeding after having been
driven away from the door.
"All of a sudden the cops
started hitting me all over my
face . . . with sticks aimed for
the crotch and the groin," a 19-
year-old San Jose State co-ed
said. "It was horrible."
Police Hold Doors
By 7:22 the doors of the Cen
ter were all in possession of the
police, and they began to expand
the area they controlled by ad
vances down Clay and its side
streets.
Demonstrators, most of them
students between the ages of 18
and 25, retreated before the po
lice. Several students burned
their draft cards in front of the
police lines.
The protestors fanned out
into adjacent streets, some of
them sitting down, others mere
ly standing, to halt traffic. In
reaction to this the police cor
dons again advanced, pressing
the demonstrators back.
Traffic Halts
When the police had cordonned
off about six city blocks, their
lines in many places were only
one rank deep. Demonstrators
continued to halt traffic, some
times talking to irate commu
ters, but the police made no ef
fort to stop them, except along
Clay Street.
In reaction to the traffic stop
page some by-standers shouted,
"Respect the law!" But on the
whole there was little such al
tercation, and the demonstra
tors, the vast majority of whom
were white continued the tactic.
At 9:02 a cordon of police
moved down Clay Street and
surrounded seven buses of in

ductees, two of Center employ
ees, and four empty buses from
the Sheriff's Department and the
Department of Correction. As
the police were escorting the
buses into the secured area sev
eral demonstrators attempted to
sit or lie in front of them.
Doctor Beaten
The police beat one of these
persons severely and also at
tacked Dr. John Betinis, a High
land Hospital intern who at
tempted to go to the aid of the
man.
When the buses had entered,
several demonstrators intensi
fied their taunting of the police.
"If that guy dies," Lisa Mendel,
a girl, yelled, "you'll be mur
derers."
At that about ten of the hel
meted California Highway Pa
trolmen lashed forward and
grabbed her. The girl was then
arrested.
Demonstrators Retreat
The demonstrators moved to
Lafayette Park, at 11th and Jef
ferson, where they decided at
about 9:30 not to move again on
the Center.
At the rally in the park one
organizer, Karin Koonan, leader
of the segment that was to have
sat in, told the students, "after
what they did to Lisa Mendel
today, I don't want to hear any
more talk about non-violence.
We've got to destroy this sys



tern, and we've got to destroy it
soon."
Nearby a Cal student who had
been a student leader in one of
Oakland's high schools and who
had been sitting in at the 15th
Street door of the center reacted
to Koonan's statement. "I don't
know," he said after a long
pause. "It's something you've
got to think a lot about. When
you start being violent, so much
can happen ... I just don't
know."
Newsmen Complain
Don Brice, news director for
KFIX-TV and president of the
Radio-TV Directors Association
chapter complained of unneces
sary brutality shown to news
men at the demonstration in a
telegram to Chief Charles Gain
of the Oakland Police and Com
missioner H. W. Sullivan of the
Highway Patrol.
The telegram said Brice's or
ganization "strenuously objects
to the uncalled for and unneces
sarily rought treatment given by
Oakland police to newsmen and
photographers . . . Monday and
Tuesday mornings." "... it ap
peared to reporters on the scene
that some members of the Oak
land Police Department were
deliberately selecting news peo
ple as targets for the treatment."
Alexander Bodi, Palo Alto Times
editor, lodged a similar com
plaint on behalf of a newspaper
fraternity.

A DRAFT PROTESTOR does
his bit by letting the air out of
a tire of an Oakland municipal
bus which had been stopped
when other demonstrators
blocked the street.
More than 200 club-wielding
Oakland Police yesterday morn
ing routed 3500 anti-war demon
strators who tried to shut down
the Oakland Induction Center.
The police formed a wedge
and moved along streets and
sidewalks clubbing and shoving
protestors who tried to block the
entrances to the center. The
Oakland Police were reinforced
by highway patrolmen at times
standing ten deep.
The opening of the Center was
delayed for about three hours
while police secured the area
around the building. Twenty
two persons were arrested in the
fracas, and about 20 were treated
at Oakland's Highland Hospital.
Demonstrators began to arrive
at the Center at 15th and Clay
about 5 a.m. Many had spent the
night at a Sproul Hall teach-in
which had been banned by a
court injunction that was not en
forced. A group of about 50 who
had pledged to sit in at the Cen
ter began to take positions with
their backs to the doors of the
Center at 5:28.
The rest of the demonstrators
paraded in picket lines in a fairly
orderly fashion, shouting "Hell
no, we won't go," and occasion
ally, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?" and
"1, 2, 3, 4 —We won't fight in
Johnson's war; 5, 6, 7, B—We
don't want no fascist hate."
Protesters Circle
An estimated 3,500 protesters
moved into Clay Street in front
of the Center, wheeling in large
circles and chanting their slo
gans. A police sound truck sta
tioned across the street in the
multi-storied parking garage
across from the Center ordered
the students out of the street,
but they ignored the order. 1
At 7:02 more than 200 Oakland
Police and California Highway
Patrol officers moved in a wedge
up Clay Street, and the demon
strators fell back. Estimations of
the total number of police in the
area vary from 400 to 1000. Some
students who attempted to sit
down in front of the advancing
line were clubbed.
The police swept away the sit

inners from the two doors of the
Center on Clay Street and had
cleared the street in 15 minutes.
The demonstrators retreated
slowly. When some student be
gan to run from the police,
others shouted, "Walk, Walk."
Resort To 'Mace'
At the third door of the Cen
ter, on 15th Street, sit-inners
tried to be more tenacious. Po
lice resorted to "Mace," an aero
sol bomb which then squirted in
the demonstrator's' eyes caused
them to sting.
Several persons were observed
to be bleeding after having been
driven away from the door.
"All of a sudden the cops
started hitting me all over my
face . . . with sticks aimed for
the crotch and the groin," a 19-
year-old San Jose State co-ed
said. "It was horrible."
Police Hold Doors
By 7:22 the doors of the Cen
ter were all in possession of the
police, and they began to expand
the area they controlled by ad
vances down Clay and its side
streets.
Demonstrators, most of them
students between the ages of 18
and 25, retreated before the po
lice. Several students burned
their draft cards in front of the
police lines.
The protestors fanned out
into adjacent streets, some of
them sitting down, others mere
ly standing, to halt traffic. In
reaction to this the police cor
dons again advanced, pressing
the demonstrators back.
Traffic Halts
When the police had cordonned
off about six city blocks, their
lines in many places were only
one rank deep. Demonstrators
continued to halt traffic, some
times talking to irate commu
ters, but the police made no ef
fort to stop them, except along
Clay Street.
In reaction to the traffic stop
page some by-standers shouted,
"Respect the law!" But on the
whole there was little such al
tercation, and the demonstra
tors, the vast majority of whom
were white continued the tactic.
At 9:02 a cordon of police
moved down Clay Street and
surrounded seven buses of in

ductees, two of Center employ
ees, and four empty buses from
the Sheriff's Department and the
Department of Correction. As
the police were escorting the
buses into the secured area sev
eral demonstrators attempted to
sit or lie in front of them.
Doctor Beaten
The police beat one of these
persons severely and also at
tacked Dr. John Betinis, a High
land Hospital intern who at
tempted to go to the aid of the
man.
When the buses had entered,
several demonstrators intensi
fied their taunting of the police.
"If that guy dies," Lisa Mendel,
a girl, yelled, "you'll be mur
derers."
At that about ten of the hel
meted California Highway Pa
trolmen lashed forward and
grabbed her. The girl was then
arrested.
Demonstrators Retreat
The demonstrators moved to
Lafayette Park, at 11th and Jef
ferson, where they decided at
about 9:30 not to move again on
the Center.
At the rally in the park one
organizer, Karin Koonan, leader
of the segment that was to have
sat in, told the students, "after
what they did to Lisa Mendel
today, I don't want to hear any
more talk about non-violence.
We've got to destroy this sys



tern, and we've got to destroy it
soon."
Nearby a Cal student who had
been a student leader in one of
Oakland's high schools and who
had been sitting in at the 15th
Street door of the center reacted
to Koonan's statement. "I don't
know," he said after a long
pause. "It's something you've
got to think a lot about. When
you start being violent, so much
can happen ... I just don't
know."
Newsmen Complain
Don Brice, news director for
KFIX-TV and president of the
Radio-TV Directors Association
chapter complained of unneces
sary brutality shown to news
men at the demonstration in a
telegram to Chief Charles Gain
of the Oakland Police and Com
missioner H. W. Sullivan of the
Highway Patrol.
The telegram said Brice's or
ganization "strenuously objects
to the uncalled for and unneces
sarily rought treatment given by
Oakland police to newsmen and
photographers . . . Monday and
Tuesday mornings." "... it ap
peared to reporters on the scene
that some members of the Oak
land Police Department were
deliberately selecting news peo
ple as targets for the treatment."
Alexander Bodi, Palo Alto Times
editor, lodged a similar com
plaint on behalf of a newspaper
fraternity.

U.S. District Attorney Cecil
Poole, who was on hand to meet
the inductees at the Center,
praised the police. "They've done
a tough job with a minimum of
excess force," he said.
In Sacramento Governor Ron
ald Reagan and Lt. Governor
Robert Finch said that the work
of the police yesterday "in meet

Demonstrators Retreat
The demonstrators moved to

about 9:30 not to move again on
the Center.
At the rally in the park one
organizer, Karin Koonan, leader
of the segment that was to have
sat in, told the students, "after
what they did to Lisa Mendel
today, I don't want to hear any
more talk about non-violence.
We've got to destroy this sys

soon."
Nearby a Cal student who had
been a student leader in one of
Oakland's high schools and who
had been sitting in at the 15th
Street door of the center reacted
to Koonan's statement. "I don't
know," he said after a long
pause. "It's something you've
got to think a lot about. When
you start being violent, so much
can happen ... I just don't
know."

A DRAFT PROTESTOR does
his bit by letting the air out of
a tire of an Oakland municipal
bus which had been stopped
when other demonstrators
blocked the street.
More than 200 club-wielding
Oakland Police yesterday morn
ing routed 3500 anti-war demon
strators who tried to shut down
the Oakland Induction Center.
The police formed a wedge
and moved along streets and
sidewalks clubbing and shoving
protestors who tried to block the
entrances to the center. The
Oakland Police were reinforced
by highway patrolmen at times
standing ten deep.
The opening of the Center was
delayed for about three hours
while police secured the area
around the building. Twenty
two persons were arrested in the
fracas, and about 20 were treated
at Oakland's Highland Hospital.
Demonstrators began to arrive
at the Center at 15th and Clay
about 5 a.m. Many had spent the
night at a Sproul Hall teach-in
which had been banned by a
court injunction that was not en
forced. A group of about 50 who
had pledged to sit in at the Cen
ter began to take positions with
their backs to the doors of the
Center at 5:28.
The rest of the demonstrators
paraded in picket lines in a fairly
orderly fashion, shouting "Hell
no, we won't go," and occasion
ally, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?" and
"1, 2, 3, 4 —We won't fight in
Johnson's war; 5, 6, 7, B—We
don't want no fascist hate."
Protesters Circle
An estimated 3,500 protesters
moved into Clay Street in front
of the Center, wheeling in large
circles and chanting their slo
gans. A police sound truck sta
tioned across the street in the
multi-storied parking garage
across from the Center ordered
the students out of the street,
but they ignored the order. 1
At 7:02 more than 200 Oakland
Police and California Highway
Patrol officers moved in a wedge
up Clay Street, and the demon
strators fell back. Estimations of
the total number of police in the
area vary from 400 to 1000. Some
students who attempted to sit
down in front of the advancing
line were clubbed.
The police swept away the sit

inners from the two doors of the
Center on Clay Street and had
cleared the street in 15 minutes.
The demonstrators retreated
slowly. When some student be
gan to run from the police,
others shouted, "Walk, Walk."
Resort To 'Mace'
At the third door of the Cen
ter, on 15th Street, sit-inners
tried to be more tenacious. Po
lice resorted to "Mace," an aero
sol bomb which then squirted in
the demonstrator's' eyes caused
them to sting.
Several persons were observed
to be bleeding after having been
driven away from the door.
"All of a sudden the cops
started hitting me all over my
face . . . with sticks aimed for
the crotch and the groin," a 19-
year-old San Jose State co-ed
said. "It was horrible."
Police Hold Doors
By 7:22 the doors of the Cen
ter were all in possession of the
police, and they began to expand
the area they controlled by ad
vances down Clay and its side
streets.
Demonstrators, most of them
students between the ages of 18
and 25, retreated before the po
lice. Several students burned
their draft cards in front of the
police lines.
The protestors fanned out
into adjacent streets, some of
them sitting down, others mere
ly standing, to halt traffic. In
reaction to this the police cor
dons again advanced, pressing
the demonstrators back.
Traffic Halts
When the police had cordonned
off about six city blocks, their
lines in many places were only
one rank deep. Demonstrators
continued to halt traffic, some
times talking to irate commu
ters, but the police made no ef
fort to stop them, except along
Clay Street.
In reaction to the traffic stop
page some by-standers shouted,
"Respect the law!" But on the
whole there was little such al
tercation, and the demonstra
tors, the vast majority of whom
were white continued the tactic.
At 9:02 a cordon of police
moved down Clay Street and
surrounded seven buses of in

ductees, two of Center employ
ees, and four empty buses from
the Sheriff's Department and the
Department of Correction. As
the police were escorting the
buses into the secured area sev
eral demonstrators attempted to
sit or lie in front of them.
Doctor Beaten
The police beat one of these
persons severely and also at
tacked Dr. John Betinis, a High
land Hospital intern who at
tempted to go to the aid of the
man.
When the buses had entered,
several demonstrators intensi
fied their taunting of the police.
"If that guy dies," Lisa Mendel,
a girl, yelled, "you'll be mur
derers."
At that about ten of the hel
meted California Highway Pa
trolmen lashed forward and
grabbed her. The girl was then
arrested.

multi-storied parking garage
across from the Center ordered
the students out of the street,
but they ignored the order. 1
At 7:02 more than 200 Oakland
Police and California Highway
Patrol officers moved in a wedge
up Clay Street, and the demon
strators fell back. Estimations of
the total number of police in the
area vary from 400 to 1000. Some
students who attempted to sit
down in front of the advancing
line were clubbed.
The police swept away the sit

inners from the two doors of the
Center on Clay Street and had
cleared the street in 15 minutes.
The demonstrators retreated
slowly. When some student be
gan to run from the police,
others shouted, "Walk, Walk."
Resort To 'Mace'
At the third door of the Cen
ter, on 15th Street, sit-inners
tried to be more tenacious. Po
lice resorted to "Mace," an aero
sol bomb which then squirted in
the demonstrator's' eyes caused
them to sting.
Several persons were observed
to be bleeding after having been
driven away from the door.
"All of a sudden the cops
started hitting me all over my
face . . . with sticks aimed for
the crotch and the groin," a 19-
year-old San Jose State co-ed
said. "It was horrible."
Police Hold Doors
By 7:22 the doors of the Cen
ter were all in possession of the
police, and they began to expand
the area they controlled by ad
vances down Clay and its side
streets.
Demonstrators, most of them
students between the ages of 18
and 25, retreated before the po
lice. Several students burned
their draft cards in front of the
police lines.
The protestors fanned out
into adjacent streets, some of
them sitting down, others mere
ly standing, to halt traffic. In
reaction to this the police cor
dons again advanced, pressing
the demonstrators back.
Traffic Halts
When the police had cordonned
off about six city blocks, their
lines in many places were only
one rank deep. Demonstrators
continued to halt traffic, some
times talking to irate commu
ters, but the police made no ef
fort to stop them, except along
Clay Street.
In reaction to the traffic stop
page some by-standers shouted,
"Respect the law!" But on the
whole there was little such al
tercation, and the demonstra
tors, the vast majority of whom
were white continued the tactic.
At 9:02 a cordon of police
moved down Clay Street and
surrounded seven buses of in

ductees, two of Center employ
ees, and four empty buses from
the Sheriff's Department and the
Department of Correction. As
the police were escorting the
buses into the secured area sev
eral demonstrators attempted to
sit or lie in front of them.
Doctor Beaten
The police beat one of these
persons severely and also at
tacked Dr. John Betinis, a High
land Hospital intern who at
tempted to go to the aid of the
man.
When the buses had entered,
several demonstrators intensi
fied their taunting of the police.
"If that guy dies," Lisa Mendel,
a girl, yelled, "you'll be mur
derers."
At that about ten of the hel
meted California Highway Pa
trolmen lashed forward and
grabbed her. The girl was then
arrested.
Demonstrators Retreat
The demonstrators moved to
Lafayette Park, at 11th and Jef
ferson, where they decided at
about 9:30 not to move again on
the Center.
At the rally in the park one
organizer, Karin Koonan, leader
of the segment that was to have
sat in, told the students, "after
what they did to Lisa Mendel
today, I don't want to hear any
more talk about non-violence.
We've got to destroy this sys



tern, and we've got to destroy it
soon."
Nearby a Cal student who had
been a student leader in one of
Oakland's high schools and who
had been sitting in at the 15th
Street door of the center reacted
to Koonan's statement. "I don't
know," he said after a long
pause. "It's something you've
got to think a lot about. When
you start being violent, so much
can happen ... I just don't
know."

A DRAFT PROTESTOR does
his bit by letting the air out of
a tire of an Oakland municipal
bus which had been stopped
when other demonstrators
blocked the street.
More than 200 club-wielding
Oakland Police yesterday morn
ing routed 3500 anti-war demon
strators who tried to shut down
the Oakland Induction Center.
The police formed a wedge
and moved along streets and
sidewalks clubbing and shoving
protestors who tried to block the
entrances to the center. The
Oakland Police were reinforced
by highway patrolmen at times
standing ten deep.
The opening of the Center was
delayed for about three hours
while police secured the area
around the building. Twenty
two persons were arrested in the
fracas, and about 20 were treated
at Oakland's Highland Hospital.
Demonstrators began to arrive
at the Center at 15th and Clay
about 5 a.m. Many had spent the
night at a Sproul Hall teach-in
which had been banned by a
court injunction that was not en
forced. A group of about 50 who
had pledged to sit in at the Cen
ter began to take positions with
their backs to the doors of the
Center at 5:28.
The rest of the demonstrators
paraded in picket lines in a fairly
orderly fashion, shouting "Hell
no, we won't go," and occasion
ally, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?" and
"1, 2, 3, 4 —We won't fight in
Johnson's war; 5, 6, 7, B—We
don't want no fascist hate."
Protesters Circle
An estimated 3,500 protesters
moved into Clay Street in front
of the Center, wheeling in large
circles and chanting their slo
gans. A police sound truck sta
tioned across the street in the
multi-storied parking garage
across from the Center ordered
the students out of the street,
but they ignored the order. 1

them to sting.
Several persons were observed
to be bleeding after having been
driven away from the door.

started hitting me all over my
face . . . with sticks aimed for
the crotch and the groin," a 19-
year-old San Jose State co-ed
said. "It was horrible."

A DRAFT PROTESTOR does
his bit by letting the air out of
a tire of an Oakland municipal
bus which had been stopped
when other demonstrators
blocked the street.
More than 200 club-wielding
Oakland Police yesterday morn
ing routed 3500 anti-war demon
strators who tried to shut down
the Oakland Induction Center.
The police formed a wedge
and moved along streets and
sidewalks clubbing and shoving
protestors who tried to block the
entrances to the center. The
Oakland Police were reinforced
by highway patrolmen at times
standing ten deep.
The opening of the Center was
delayed for about three hours
while police secured the area
around the building. Twenty
two persons were arrested in the
fracas, and about 20 were treated
at Oakland's Highland Hospital.
Demonstrators began to arrive
at the Center at 15th and Clay
about 5 a.m. Many had spent the
night at a Sproul Hall teach-in
which had been banned by a
court injunction that was not en
forced. A group of about 50 who
had pledged to sit in at the Cen
ter began to take positions with
their backs to the doors of the
Center at 5:28.
The rest of the demonstrators
paraded in picket lines in a fairly
orderly fashion, shouting "Hell
no, we won't go," and occasion
ally, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?" and
"1, 2, 3, 4 —We won't fight in
Johnson's war; 5, 6, 7, B—We
don't want no fascist hate."
Protesters Circle
An estimated 3,500 protesters
moved into Clay Street in front
of the Center, wheeling in large
circles and chanting their slo
gans. A police sound truck sta
tioned across the street in the
multi-storied parking garage
across from the Center ordered
the students out of the street,
but they ignored the order. 1
At 7:02 more than 200 Oakland
Police and California Highway
Patrol officers moved in a wedge
up Clay Street, and the demon
strators fell back. Estimations of
the total number of police in the
area vary from 400 to 1000. Some
students who attempted to sit
down in front of the advancing
line were clubbed.
The police swept away the sit

inners from the two doors of the
Center on Clay Street and had
cleared the street in 15 minutes.
The demonstrators retreated
slowly. When some student be
gan to run from the police,
others shouted, "Walk, Walk."
Resort To 'Mace'
At the third door of the Cen
ter, on 15th Street, sit-inners
tried to be more tenacious. Po
lice resorted to "Mace," an aero
sol bomb which then squirted in
the demonstrator's' eyes caused
them to sting.
Several persons were observed
to be bleeding after having been
driven away from the door.
"All of a sudden the cops
started hitting me all over my
face . . . with sticks aimed for
the crotch and the groin," a 19-
year-old San Jose State co-ed
said. "It was horrible."
Police Hold Doors
By 7:22 the doors of the Cen
ter were all in possession of the
police, and they began to expand
the area they controlled by ad
vances down Clay and its side
streets.
Demonstrators, most of them
students between the ages of 18
and 25, retreated before the po
lice. Several students burned
their draft cards in front of the
police lines.
The protestors fanned out
into adjacent streets, some of
them sitting down, others mere
ly standing, to halt traffic. In
reaction to this the police cor
dons again advanced, pressing
the demonstrators back.
Traffic Halts
When the police had cordonned
off about six city blocks, their
lines in many places were only
one rank deep. Demonstrators
continued to halt traffic, some
times talking to irate commu
ters, but the police made no ef
fort to stop them, except along
Clay Street.
In reaction to the traffic stop
page some by-standers shouted,
"Respect the law!" But on the
whole there was little such al
tercation, and the demonstra
tors, the vast majority of whom
were white continued the tactic.
At 9:02 a cordon of police
moved down Clay Street and
surrounded seven buses of in

ductees, two of Center employ
ees, and four empty buses from
the Sheriff's Department and the
Department of Correction. As
the police were escorting the
buses into the secured area sev
eral demonstrators attempted to
sit or lie in front of them.
Doctor Beaten
The police beat one of these
persons severely and also at
tacked Dr. John Betinis, a High
land Hospital intern who at
tempted to go to the aid of the
man.
When the buses had entered,
several demonstrators intensi
fied their taunting of the police.
"If that guy dies," Lisa Mendel,
a girl, yelled, "you'll be mur
derers."
At that about ten of the hel
meted California Highway Pa
trolmen lashed forward and
grabbed her. The girl was then
arrested.
Demonstrators Retreat
The demonstrators moved to
Lafayette Park, at 11th and Jef
ferson, where they decided at
about 9:30 not to move again on
the Center.
At the rally in the park one
organizer, Karin Koonan, leader
of the segment that was to have
sat in, told the students, "after
what they did to Lisa Mendel
today, I don't want to hear any
more talk about non-violence.
We've got to destroy this sys



tern, and we've got to destroy it
soon."
Nearby a Cal student who had
been a student leader in one of
Oakland's high schools and who
had been sitting in at the 15th
Street door of the center reacted
to Koonan's statement. "I don't
know," he said after a long
pause. "It's something you've
got to think a lot about. When
you start being violent, so much
can happen ... I just don't
know."
Newsmen Complain
Don Brice, news director for
KFIX-TV and president of the
Radio-TV Directors Association
chapter complained of unneces

The telegram said Brice's or

U.S. District Attorney Cecil

the inductees at the Center,
praised the police. "They've done
a tough job with a minimum of
excess force," he said.
In Sacramento Governor Ron

Robert Finch said that the work
of the police yesterday "in meet

A DRAFT PROTESTOR does
his bit by letting the air out of
a tire of an Oakland municipal
bus which had been stopped
when other demonstrators
blocked the street.
More than 200 club-wielding
Oakland Police yesterday morn
ing routed 3500 anti-war demon
strators who tried to shut down
the Oakland Induction Center.
The police formed a wedge
and moved along streets and
sidewalks clubbing and shoving
protestors who tried to block the
entrances to the center. The
Oakland Police were reinforced
by highway patrolmen at times
standing ten deep.
The opening of the Center was
delayed for about three hours
while police secured the area
around the building. Twenty
two persons were arrested in the
fracas, and about 20 were treated
at Oakland's Highland Hospital.
Demonstrators began to arrive
at the Center at 15th and Clay
about 5 a.m. Many had spent the
night at a Sproul Hall teach-in
which had been banned by a
court injunction that was not en
forced. A group of about 50 who
had pledged to sit in at the Cen
ter began to take positions with
their backs to the doors of the
Center at 5:28.
The rest of the demonstrators
paraded in picket lines in a fairly
orderly fashion, shouting "Hell
no, we won't go," and occasion
ally, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?" and
"1, 2, 3, 4 —We won't fight in
Johnson's war; 5, 6, 7, B—We
don't want no fascist hate."
Protesters Circle
An estimated 3,500 protesters
moved into Clay Street in front
of the Center, wheeling in large
circles and chanting their slo
gans. A police sound truck sta
tioned across the street in the
multi-storied parking garage
across from the Center ordered
the students out of the street,
but they ignored the order. 1
At 7:02 more than 200 Oakland
Police and California Highway
Patrol officers moved in a wedge
up Clay Street, and the demon
strators fell back. Estimations of
the total number of police in the
area vary from 400 to 1000. Some
students who attempted to sit
down in front of the advancing
line were clubbed.
The police swept away the sit

inners from the two doors of the
Center on Clay Street and had
cleared the street in 15 minutes.
The demonstrators retreated
slowly. When some student be
gan to run from the police,
others shouted, "Walk, Walk."
Resort To 'Mace'
At the third door of the Cen
ter, on 15th Street, sit-inners
tried to be more tenacious. Po
lice resorted to "Mace," an aero
sol bomb which then squirted in
the demonstrator's' eyes caused
them to sting.
Several persons were observed
to be bleeding after having been
driven away from the door.
"All of a sudden the cops
started hitting me all over my
face . . . with sticks aimed for
the crotch and the groin," a 19-
year-old San Jose State co-ed
said. "It was horrible."
Police Hold Doors
By 7:22 the doors of the Cen
ter were all in possession of the
police, and they began to expand
the area they controlled by ad
vances down Clay and its side
streets.
Demonstrators, most of them
students between the ages of 18
and 25, retreated before the po
lice. Several students burned
their draft cards in front of the
police lines.
The protestors fanned out
into adjacent streets, some of
them sitting down, others mere
ly standing, to halt traffic. In
reaction to this the police cor
dons again advanced, pressing
the demonstrators back.
Traffic Halts
When the police had cordonned
off about six city blocks, their
lines in many places were only
one rank deep. Demonstrators
continued to halt traffic, some
times talking to irate commu
ters, but the police made no ef
fort to stop them, except along
Clay Street.
In reaction to the traffic stop
page some by-standers shouted,
"Respect the law!" But on the
whole there was little such al
tercation, and the demonstra
tors, the vast majority of whom
were white continued the tactic.
At 9:02 a cordon of police
moved down Clay Street and
surrounded seven buses of in

ductees, two of Center employ
ees, and four empty buses from
the Sheriff's Department and the
Department of Correction. As
the police were escorting the
buses into the secured area sev
eral demonstrators attempted to
sit or lie in front of them.
Doctor Beaten
The police beat one of these
persons severely and also at
tacked Dr. John Betinis, a High
land Hospital intern who at
tempted to go to the aid of the
man.
When the buses had entered,
several demonstrators intensi
fied their taunting of the police.
"If that guy dies," Lisa Mendel,
a girl, yelled, "you'll be mur
derers."
At that about ten of the hel
meted California Highway Pa
trolmen lashed forward and
grabbed her. The girl was then
arrested.
Demonstrators Retreat
The demonstrators moved to
Lafayette Park, at 11th and Jef
ferson, where they decided at
about 9:30 not to move again on
the Center.
At the rally in the park one
organizer, Karin Koonan, leader
of the segment that was to have
sat in, told the students, "after
what they did to Lisa Mendel
today, I don't want to hear any
more talk about non-violence.
We've got to destroy this sys



tern, and we've got to destroy it
soon."
Nearby a Cal student who had
been a student leader in one of
Oakland's high schools and who
had been sitting in at the 15th
Street door of the center reacted
to Koonan's statement. "I don't
know," he said after a long
pause. "It's something you've
got to think a lot about. When
you start being violent, so much
can happen ... I just don't
know."
Newsmen Complain
Don Brice, news director for
KFIX-TV and president of the
Radio-TV Directors Association
chapter complained of unneces
sary brutality shown to news
men at the demonstration in a
telegram to Chief Charles Gain
of the Oakland Police and Com
missioner H. W. Sullivan of the
Highway Patrol.
The telegram said Brice's or
ganization "strenuously objects
to the uncalled for and unneces
sarily rought treatment given by
Oakland police to newsmen and
photographers . . . Monday and
Tuesday mornings." "... it ap
peared to reporters on the scene
that some members of the Oak
land Police Department were
deliberately selecting news peo
ple as targets for the treatment."
