# Hoover Institution Series Challenged
## 
### 
We have had a series of four articles
in The Daily on the Hoover Institution
during the past week, accompanied on
Thursday by an editorial and, as a final
example of editorial taste, a cartoon of
the Institution's director. These literary
events merit a few comments.
Dismantling the Hoover Institution has
long been a popular campus pasttime.
The Institution's relations with Stanford
were particularly stormy in 1959 and
1960, when the late Herbert Hoover for
mulated a statement of purpose for the
Institution and obtained from the Trus
tees guarantees of a large measure of
autonomy for it.
We were opposed to Mr. Hoover's posi
tion at the time and we are opposed to it
now. But his statement of purpose was
effectively disowned by the University,
and has not, we feel, produced a climate
which endangers objective research.
Structure Evolution
The administrative structures govern
ing the Institution and its relationship to
Stanford as a whole must inevitably enter
into the evolutionary processes going on
throughout this University, which is, by
other than local standards, still very
young.
What is important now is not what
was done and said in 1960 but what has
happened since then and what is happen
ing today.
There are undeniably delicate spots in
the Hoover picture. As in any school or
department, questions arise concerning
the way some appointments have been

made and the quality and competence of
certain staff members.
Easing Difficulties
We submit that whatever these diffi
culties, they are ameliorable and have
over time eased somewhat; that consul
tation with the faculty has taken place
in areas of mutual concern; that in any
case, by their very nature these matters
cannot be given effective, detailed, and
dispassionate discussion in print, and re
course to journalistic sandblasting is at
the present time likely to be injurious
to those very objectives The Daily writers
may have wished to support.
In any event we cannot agree, on the
basis of the evidence at hand, that there
exist ideological preconditions that im
pede the day-to-day operations of the
Institution. To assert that "the internal
workings and most research of the In
stitution are colored by a closed-minded
ness which can hardly be considered scho
larly" is to argue in the face of indisput
able fact.
The resources of the Institution are
by The Daily's own admission "among
the finest in the world." The acquisitions
program is not, however (as Mr. Taub
man reports via the anonymous "some
say" formula), a formless, ad hoe lunge
after "exotic material at any price."
Acquisitions
Political ephemera contribute, to be
sure, to the uniqueness of the library, but
it is the deliberate, carefully planned ac
quisitions policies — subject to frequent
reviews — that are the key to the iin

portance of the library. While research
and publications have been taking a
greater share of the total budget, the ac
quisitions budget has actually greatly
increased over the past years.
The Hoover, now a major academic
publisher, has issued under three series
in the recent years of the present admini
stration some 20 to 30 titles a year, vir
tually all of which would have been be
yond the criticism of Mr. Taubman, had
he taken the trouble to glance at them,
and most of which have received favor
able reviews in academic journals.
In addition to its own publications, the
Institution has also published a not incon
siderable number of books with major
published houses. To suggest that the
program suffers from mediocrity or bias
is to implicate, for example, the Cam
bridge University Press, the University
of Chicago Press, and the Stanford Uni
versity Press itself, all of which have in
dependently evaluated — and published
— Hoover-sponsored manuscripts.
Hoover Publications
Members of the Institution have also
privately published scholarly works with
reputable domestic and foreign publish
ing houses which have not been accused
of bias of whatever sort. Moreover, Stan
ford faculty members, past and present,
hardly noted for right-wing leanings —
among them Professors North, Triska,
Fagen, Harris, and Rue — have published
works under the auspices of the Insti
tution.
One book subsirized by the Hoover —
Afriean Socialism, edited by Friedland

and Rosberg — had four essays by so
cialists and one by a leading communist,
and outside authors in the Hoover pros
pectus for the years 1963 to 1966 include
scholars such as Leopold Haimson and
ten or eleven Mensheviks whose bias —
if anything — is to the left.
Not Out Of Line
Parenthetically, two technical points
should be clarified. First, Hoover publica
tions, while often expensive, are not, ac
cording to the editor of a major Eastern
university press, out of line with com
parable publications of other publishers.
Second, it is not the practice of any
press to release even to the writers the
names of manuscript readers; this is not
a matter of secrecy but of professional
ethics.
In view of events eight years ago, we
can understand that many still harbor
anxieties, and we do not mean to dis
courage responsible concern. But a
meaningful evaluation must rest on ans
wers to very specific questions.
In terms of library acquisitions policy,
what areas have been neglected? What
areas have been too heavily emphasized?
In terms of publications, what manu
scripts worthy of publication have been
turned away? What projects should have
been dropped, which ones should have
been undertaken, and why? The burden
of proof now rests clearly on those who
think criticism is in order.
