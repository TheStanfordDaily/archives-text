## Vietnam: Draft, Disobedience, And Dogmatism 
### 
Editor, The Daily
Although it is encouraging to
see that there are people who
have the courage of their convic
tions and are willing to protest
the war, I am saddened because
the protestors exemplify the
very thing they protest against.
The cause of the war in Viet
nam is the moral dogmatism of
the American people, but David
Harris and Professor Robert Mc-
Afee Brown are even more dog
matic than their opponents. Pro
fessor Brown is more certain
that God is on his side than is
President Johnson.
I do not wish to disagree with
Professor Brown's position, but
I would like to know what the
foundation of his certainty is. I,
too, would like to have a direct
pipeline to God to enable me to
solve my ethical problems.
Please, Professor Brown, won't
you help me, and tell me how
it is that you can be so sure
that you are right?

• I\o Disobedience
Editor, The Dally:
I strongly urge that you bring
before your readers the essential
distinction between protest and
operations of the United States
government. The rights of free
speech and assembly do not ex
tend to deliberate violation of
law.
While it is perfectly proper for
citizens to assemble and petition
for a revision of the draft law,
and an end to the Vietnam war,
any action to interfere with the
operations of a governmental
office is not only unlawful, but
will jeopardize the very goals
which the protestants seek to
achieve.
We should not confuse civil
disobedience to unjust laws in
the southern states with deliber
ate disobedience to federal laws
which we know to be consti
tutional. The sit-ins in the south
could be justified on the basis
that the protestors honestly be
lieved that the laws of Alabama
and Mississippi would be held
unconstitutional when adjudicat
ed by the United States Supreme
Court.
No such reasonable expectancy
can exist with respect to the
draft laws and procedures of
the U.S. government. If we wish
to change such laws, our rem
edies are at the ballot box,
through due process of law.
The rights of free speech and
assembly would not exist but for
the constant readiness of the
armed forces of the United
States. We may disagree with
the war, but we cannot disagree
with the necessity for the main
tenance of an armed force ca
pable of fighting to preserve the
freedoms and privileges we pres
ently enjoy.
To students of principle and
courageous idealism, it may
seem an honorable thing to play
the part of a martyr and spend
six months in jail in order to
demonstrate sincerity of pur
pose. Certainly a willful inter
ference with federal process will

justify such a penalty, but I be
lieve such conduct will be more
foolish than courageous.
I urge you to bring before
your readers the constructive al
ternatives to action of this sort.
I am confident that we are on the
threshold of a major change of
both public opinion and in the
Congress with respect to present
policies in Vietnam.
A thorough study of the his
tory of that country and our
involvement there, coupled with
continued vigorous debate, can
do more to change the present
administration attitudes than can
any defiance to law and order
which hardens the resolve of
those who oppose your views.
We have the rights of free
speech and assembly only be
cause our forbearers fought also
for the companion rights of law
and order. These rights go to
gether, and all justify respect in
these difficult times.

• Defensive War
Editor, the Daily:
The transparency of your edi
torial on "Draft Resistance" was
balanced only by the weight of
its contradiction. You prattle
about the way you "support
these men in their act of con
science, in what they feel is the
only way to stop the Vietnam
war."
OK, good. But yet you show
your every intention of placing
yourself firmly in the long Amer
ican tradition of complete-edi
torial-nonsense.
Your subsequent statement,
"However, we cannot give sup
port to those who turn in their
cards to oppose all conscription,
or all wars . . . demonstrates a
typical shallowness of intent on
the part of most of "anti-war"
America today.
The most final of solutions and
genocides can be justified by
your and Johnson's phrase, "the
nation has the right to conscript
men in a defensive action . . . "
What do you imagine Rusk, Mc
namara, and Col. Robin Olds
have most recently dubbed the
Viet-Nam War???
Obviously Hitler convinced his
German Aryans that the very
existence of Jewish human be
ings was a need for "defensive
action". The United Klans of
America has been a "defensive"
society for well nigh 100 years.

• Same Arrogance
Editor, The Daily:
One might expect that since
the Young Americans for Free
dom have taken a position
against the draft, they would act
in support of the policies and
tactics of Draft Resistance Week.
This is not in fact the case.

First, Young Americans for
Freedom is not opposed either
to the presence or functions of
the military in society, or to
the war Vietnam; in fact, the
Young Americans for Freedom
feels that a volunteer or pro

fessional military would be the
most efficient instrument for
carrying out a policy of victory
in Vietnam.
Second, Young Americans for
Freedom feels that the tactics of
civil disobedience are not the
proper instrument for social
and/or political changc. It is a
fundamental principle underly
ing law and order, without which
true freedom of individual ac
tion is impossible, that even if
a law is unjust, one must obey
it until it is changed.
Hence, members of Young
Americans for Freedom, though
most are opposed to the draft,
will continue to co-operate with
it. If people do not co-operate
with existing laws, even though
they are unjust, they are in fact
denying the principle of law and
order.
If any significant number of
people so deny the principle of
law and order, the result will
be anarchy, a state of society in
which no man can be sufficiently
free of fear of his neighbor's ag
gressive tendencies to take ad
vantage of the many opportuni
ties for individual expression and
accomplishment which the so
ciety offers him.
Fear would limit freedom of
individual action much more
than some of our unjust laws
limit it now.
The arrogance of those who
put themselves above the law, as
do those who practice or sup
port civil disobedience, is clear
ly illustrated by yesterday's
Daily editorial:
Today things are different.
Talking is wasted; our leaders
no longer listen, so convinced
are they of their rightness.
Writing letters is futile; writ
ten letters are answered with
form letters, so large is the
volume of correspondence.
The implication here is not just
that dissenters from the war in
Vietnam should be listened to,
but also that our leaders have a
moral responsibility to be con
vinced by that dissent.
The Daily is here guilty of the
same arrogance and righteous
ness of which it accuses our lead
ers. It is just this sort of atti
tude which Eric Hoffer (whose
speech last night The Daily con
spicuously neglected to cover in
today's Daily) condemns as the
feeling of the intellectual 61ite
that it was born to rule, or at
least to direct policy, because no
body elses' moral consciousness
is sophisticated enough. He is
essentially right.

• Broken Skulls
Editor, the Daily:
Broken faces and skulls will
not stop the Vietnam war. The
people who courageously and
non-violently faced the billy
clubs of the Oakland police got
smashed. We cannot successfully
engage in mass military activity
against the Oakland police. We
cannot storm and hold the draft
center.
Meaningful resistance to the
war does not necessarily grow
out of an eruptable situation. But
it does grow out of activity. Each
of us who oppose the war should
choose someway of realizing our
common belief that this war
must be stopped.

• Suicide
Editor, The Daily:
What's to be said for the re
cent suicide?
No doubt the panic and apathy
that drove Mr. Meyer to the act
is the very thing that keeps
everyone else from exclaiming
against it. I don't believe that
suicide is a secret thought few
people encounter.
I mentioned the suicide to a
stranger today and he said, "Why
not?" I mentioned it to a friend
and he said he hoped he didn't
know the kid. And I went back
to a john in Mem. Aud. and beat
my firsts against a mirror.

• From Vietnam
Editor, The Daily:
There is no doubt in my mind
that some of you will read this
and say, "This guy must be some
kind of nut." By no means am I
a writer. I am a Paratrooper in
the Army. Some people call us
hired or professional killers. I
guess in a small way this is
true. We are trained and paid
to fight a war.
The Republic of Vietnam is a
small poor country, but in an
other way is a rich country.
Since it doesn't get cold here,
crops can be raised year round;
there is gold here and trees for
lumber. It is hard to believe, but
Vietnam use to raise enough rice
for export. Now it doesn't have
enough to feed its own people.
This is what the VC have done.
The war here has taken a toll
of American lives. I have had
many good friends killed here in
Vietnam, because we have been
asked to help. It isn't a shame
to have to ask for help. How
many times have you asked a

classmate for help, such as a
loan or help on a term paper?
You students will be the lead
ers of tomorrow. Some of you
men will be in the military and
because of your education, you
will more than likely be officers
with men under you looking to
you for advice and leadership.
Look around your class-room.
Some of your friends you see
there may be killed in Vietnam
just as friends of mine have been
killed. But let it never be said
that we have died for no reason,
because freedom is the best rea
son in the world to die for.

Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to Harry
Press on another edition of the
Stanford Observer.
The publication, appropriately,

apes the format of the National
Observer, published by Dow
Jones.
But Harry, to conceal this fact,
and to appeal to a wider audi
ence, couldn't you change the
name of the newspaper to Busi
ness Week?
