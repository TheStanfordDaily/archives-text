# Provost Lyman Discusses Draft With Mothers
## 
### JAN WELLS 
Ramifications of the 1967
Selective Service Act were the
main concern of members of the
Stanford Mothers' club in a dis
cussion with Provost Richard W.
Lyman yesterday afternoon.
Questioned about the pro
jected effects of the new draft
law on graduate schools, Lyman
predicted that "unless something
is done, every non-exempt, physi
cally fit man in the Class of '68
will be drafted ..."
"The University will be in a
dangerously vulnerable position
next year. We will still have
medical, and perhaps engineer
ing, students, as well as women
and those who are judged unfit,
but many spaces will go unfilled
in law schools, business schools,
and many other graduate pro
grams."
Lyman recently attended a
meeting of the American Council
on Education in Washington,
D.C., which established a com
miLtee to study the draft situa
tion. Federal administration of
ficials are also deeply concerned,
he added.
Legal Dodging*
However, everyone's "hands
are tied by the extent of the Con
gressional legislation . . . and
Congress is not about to take the
subject up again." Many Con

gressmen fear that constituents
would view substitution of Peace
corps or VISTA service for the
military obligation as legalized
"Draft Dodging."
"What's done within the limits
of the present law will probably
not be more constructive, or even
more equitable than the present
system," Lyman concluded. "It
is likely that the number of
draft-exempt areas of study will
be expanded to include such addi
tional subjects as engineering."
Several mothers asked about
the organization and choice of
academic themes for the demon
stration houses. Lyman did not
foresee unlimited growth of the
program because of difficulties
in finding faculty participants,
but he is enthusiastic about the
initial success of the demonstra
tion houses.
Too Limited
The Provost added that, "as
a former student at a co-ed insti
tution, I firmly believe that co-ed
living is too limited without at
least the chance to share lounges
and dining rooms."
Mothers were also curious
about selection of Teaching As
sistants, advisor assignments,
and the on-campus housing
shortage for sophomore men this
fall.
The discussion followed Ly

man's planned talk, "Stanford:
The View from the Provost's Of
fice," in which he spoke on the
"state of the University in the
United States today."
After citing reasons that the
University looms so large in
American society, Lyman turned
to the subject of student activism
and criticism of the University
as an educational institution. He
pointed out that while activists
and critics comprise a minority
of all students, it is not clear
whether they are also a minority
of all concerned students.
"Student critics should not be
brushed aside because they are
sometimes too shrill in their de
mands, nor because they are
often readier to criticize than
suggest," he concluded. He cited
the need for students and the
generation of their parents, ad
ministration, and faculty to lis
ten to each other, ask intelligent
questions and answer honestly.

United States today."
After citing reasons that the
University looms so large in
American society, Lyman turned
to the subject of student activism
and criticism of the University
as an educational institution. He
pointed out that while activists
and critics comprise a minority
of all students, it is not clear
whether they are also a minority
of all concerned students.
"Student critics should not be
brushed aside because they are
sometimes too shrill in their de
mands, nor because they are
often readier to criticize than
suggest," he concluded. He cited
the need for students and the
generation of their parents, ad
ministration, and faculty to lis
ten to each other, ask intelligent
questions and answer honestly.

at yesterday afternoon's tea. p aUy Photo hy A , Weiner
Ramifications of the 1967
Selective Service Act were the
main concern of members of the
Stanford Mothers' club in a dis
cussion with Provost Richard W.
Lyman yesterday afternoon.
Questioned about the pro
jected effects of the new draft
law on graduate schools, Lyman
predicted that "unless something
is done, every non-exempt, physi
cally fit man in the Class of '68
will be drafted ..."
"The University will be in a
dangerously vulnerable position
next year. We will still have
medical, and perhaps engineer
ing, students, as well as women
and those who are judged unfit,
but many spaces will go unfilled
in law schools, business schools,
and many other graduate pro
grams."
Lyman recently attended a
meeting of the American Council
on Education in Washington,
D.C., which established a com
miLtee to study the draft situa
tion. Federal administration of
ficials are also deeply concerned,
he added.
Legal Dodging*
However, everyone's "hands
are tied by the extent of the Con
gressional legislation . . . and
Congress is not about to take the
subject up again." Many Con

gressmen fear that constituents
would view substitution of Peace
corps or VISTA service for the
military obligation as legalized
"Draft Dodging."
"What's done within the limits
of the present law will probably
not be more constructive, or even
more equitable than the present
system," Lyman concluded. "It
is likely that the number of
draft-exempt areas of study will
be expanded to include such addi
tional subjects as engineering."
Several mothers asked about
the organization and choice of
academic themes for the demon
stration houses. Lyman did not
foresee unlimited growth of the
program because of difficulties
in finding faculty participants,
but he is enthusiastic about the
initial success of the demonstra
tion houses.
Too Limited
The Provost added that, "as
a former student at a co-ed insti
tution, I firmly believe that co-ed
living is too limited without at
least the chance to share lounges
and dining rooms."
Mothers were also curious
about selection of Teaching As
sistants, advisor assignments,
and the on-campus housing
shortage for sophomore men this
fall.
The discussion followed Ly

man's planned talk, "Stanford:
The View from the Provost's Of
fice," in which he spoke on the
"state of the University in the
United States today."
