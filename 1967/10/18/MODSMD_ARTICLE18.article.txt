# Austrians Assemble Organ In Dink
## 
### CONNIE COLLIER 
Inside Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
down the left aisle, up the stage
steps, through the curtains and
straight ahead, one may witness
the construction of an organ, a
second-of-its-kind in the United
States.
Two Austrian organ builders
from Krems, Gerhard Stradet
zky (Gair-heart Ra-det-ski) and
Oswald Wagner (Ooos-wold
Vaug-ner,) are now assembling
the organ. Stradetzky's father is
head of the industry which was
incorporated into the family in
1914 by his grandfather.
Daily, the men spend much of
their time in Florence Moore
Hall where they eat and occupy
guest room "B." They have been

on campus approximately three
weeks. Wagner speaks no En
glish although Stradetzky does.
Organ-Making ("enter
Krems has been the center of
organ-making in Austria since
the sixteenth century. Its organs
are well-known throughout Aus
tria and are now being built for
the first time in the United
States.
Stanford's organ is small. It
has sixteen stops, twenty-one
rows and 1200 pipes and each
pipe is inserted by hand. All the
connections between the keys
and the pipes are made through
purely mechanical parts, a fact
or which gives the name "track
er action" organ.
Each organ piece was shipped

separately from Austria. After
a two-week delay in New York
during the recent hurricane, the
organ builders began their work.
They are presently attempting
to make up for the two week de
lay. Another non-English speak
ing Austrian, Walter Kunesch,
recently arrived at Stanford to
help.
Reaction To America
Stradetzky stated that Aus
trian life could best be described
by the word "gemvetlick." There
is no proper translation for this
word, since what it describes
does not exist in the United
States. It means vaguely a quiet,
subdued, low-key way of living.
He explained that Austria is
small and not ambitious; Aus

trians are not extremely excit
able like the Italians, nor ex
tremely thorough like the Ger
mans. They are a relaxed people
with little need for perpetual ac
tivity.
However, Stradetzky acknowl
edged the American need for
perpetual activity, saying, "The
United States must be that way.

They couldn't exist" unless they
did.
Next week they return to Aus
tria to assemble another organ.
Wagner is anxious to return and
misses his country. But says
Stradetsky, "When I go home, I
will go home. Until then . .
and he shrugged his shoulders.
