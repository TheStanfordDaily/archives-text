# Ram's Head Rushes 'Gaieties' Rehearsals
## 
### 
Rehearsals are now well un
der way for the 1967 version of
Ram's Head's annual BIG GAME
GAIETIES. As the November 10
opening date draws closer, the
resultant activity in and around
Memorial Auditorium is "grow
ing to feverish proportions,"
said Bob Stone, GAIETIES pro
ducer.
"We really put ourselves on
the spot this year," Stone
claimed. "By scheduling our
opening one week earlier than
usual, we have effectively given
the cast and crew one less week
to prepare."
According to GAIETIES Di
rector, Alan Mokler, the shorter
length of preparation time may
have a beneficial effect. "It has
often happened in the past,"
Mokler said, "that the show
would be ready and at its peak
a week or so before it opened.
Then it would begin to run
downhill. I don't think that is
going to happen this year."
High Interest
On stage is not the only place
that the shortage of time is be
ing felt. Lisa Gonzalez, Techni
cal Director for the production,
put it this way: "Technical pro

duction is usually Ram's Head's
weakest area. There are very
few TD's who like the way their
sets look from the actor's side
regardless of how they look to
the audience. Interest has been
so high this year, however, that
I am going to be much happier
than I had any right to expect."
Stone sums up the general
feeling about this year's produc
tion in the following manner:
"Every year everyone in Ram's
Head starts off by telling every
one else in the University how
great GAIETIES is going to be.
For some reason that didn't hap
pen this year.
"Maybe it was the time factor
—I'm not really sure. In any
event, everybody in the cast and
crew — everyone connected with
this year's show — will tell you
now that it is certainly the best
GAIETIES since the immortal
"Once Around The Quad."
After opening on November
10, GAIETIES will continue on
the 11th, 16th, and 17th. Tickets
are now on sale at the Tresidder
Ticket Office. Block tickets may
be ordered through the Ram's
Head Office upstairs in the Un
ion.
