# 'Violence And Joe College'
## 
### TIM HAIGHT 
At six yesterday morning a
young hippie clad only in mad
ras bermudas was making a
statement to a reporter in front
of the Oakland Induction Center.
"It lets everybody get into the
spirit of Christmas and do their
thing," he said. "It's really
groovy.
"I don't think there will be
any violence," he continued. "I
really don't." By 7:07 yesterday

News Analysis

morning we knew the hippie was
very, very wrong.
What you saw depended on
where you were. Some of us,
pushed aside by the wings of
that first flying wedge, only saw
clubs rise and fall in the melee
across the street. Others, who
were sitting by the doors to the
center saw skulls fractured,
teeth knocked out, men and
women who were sitting down
clubbed again and again.
Hospitalized
"Five guys got taken to the
hospital," one witness said.
(Later reports indicate 26 hos
pitalized with 2 admitted.) "One

guy came back towards me. His
skull was broken open here." He
indicated his forehead.
"There was this girl," another
said. "The whole side of her head
was bloody. She fell on me. The
cops pulled her up. That's the
last I saw of her."
Witnesses close to the doors
say that a leader of the pro
testers tried to stop the beating,
yelling "This is a sit-in! Arrest
us! Arrest us!" They say the
police clubbed him.
The testimony goes on and on.
Almost everybody had some
first-hand story. If you weren't
on Clay Street at seven o'clock,
perhaps you were on 15th be
tween Clay and Washington at
7:33. There, many of us saw a
young man hit, walked over by
three ranks of police, and then
dragged along the advancing line
for over fifty feet.
Sudden Reality
Perhaps this seems in bad
taste. It was. For most of us,
innocent (more or less) children
of the white middle class, par
ticipants or observers, this was
an explosion of reality for which,
although we might have predict
ed it, we were not prepared.
Before the phalanx of police

had started to move, college-age
demonstrators danced ring
around-the-rosy in the street,
chanting "Hell no, nobody goes."
Before the sun rose and the
clubs fell young organizers
threatened violence as if they
possessed some power against
those 400 armed men.
As the line of police formed
and stood opposite the crowd,
monitors gave directions to their
charges. They named courses of
action that were never taken and
suggested regrouping rendez
vous that were never kept.
Not that people became unruly
or fled from the scene. Once
most of the demonstrators had
gotten out from under the ad
vancing line, they stood and
taunted their attackers. But all
they had were words.
Sound And Fury
Some got personal, in a poi
gnant way — "Number 609,
you're a son of a bitch." Others
shouted more conventional and
less printable epithets. The
police were impassive, dumb,
fearful, angry, bloodthirsty, jok
ing, bored or anguished. It de
pended on what you projected.
They reacted little, if at all.
They stood in their lines, sur

veying the situation. About half
of them chewed gum. Night
sticks tapped quietly in leather
gloved hands. The peace officers
were in control of the situation,
and they knew it.
The crowd of demonstrators,
pushed away from the induction
center, tried new techniques.
They blocked traffic. The police
extended their perimeter and the
protesters retreated — more
knowingly now, and with less in
jury.
New objects of scorn were
found, some deserving, some less
so. Two motorists roared
through the massed pickets, nar
rowly missing people. The police
took no action. The cars were
pounded as they passed. After
these near-murderers departed,
many other passing cars were
pounded for less reason.
Object Of Protest
Up on the third open-air level
of the parking lot building,
where the FBI and National
Guard officials stood watching,
was a haughty woman in a green
scarf. For some reason, a dem
onstrator singled her out for
abuse.
Something in her superior
police-protected position bother
ed him. The crowd around him
took up his cry until the woman
drew back. Was she an adequate
object for our protest? Who
knows? The cops were too tough,
so someone had to be found.
So what happened yesterday
in Oakland? Different people say
different things. To one, the fact
that the buses came at 9:05 in
stead of 7:30 was a major
achievement. They had never
been that late. Another said,
"This is a big first step. Maybe
tomorrow Oakland will burn.
Maybe they'll shut the city's
power off.
Power
"You don't fight power by be
ing good," this protester added.

"You fight power with power."
Another comment in the same
vein—"Today those cops are
turning those white students in
to revolutionaries."
In a way, that may be true.
They might have seen it on tele
vision during the Civil Rights
movement or read about riots in
underdeveloped countries. Only
a week or so ago they had some
big fracas i"n Japan. But this time
it was here, for real.
"These cops have showed us a
taste of the violence we are try
ing to stop in Vietnam," a Stan
ford student on the scene said.
Perhaps they feel now, where
hefore they only thought.
This has dangers, too. When
police beat seated girls, many
who feel deep concern about the

uselessness of violence start
looking for helmets and billy
clubs and tear gas of their own.
No philosophy is involved in this
pi-ocess; one thinks "with one's
blood."
In this direction lies unreason.
In the other direction, away
from the violence, lies a regres
sion to the past—to the faded
techniques of the civil rights
movement and that feeling of
frustration.
At this point, protests are
somewhere in the middle. The
anti-war coalition includes reli
gious pacifists, open revolution
aries, advocates of black power
and flower power. While many
preach violence in this company,
most recoil from it.
Most are neither in the rioting

ghetto nor on the non-violent
picket line. They are hunting for
a tactic that will allow them to
be as tough and effective as the
police, but they have too much
sensitivity to adopt police meth
ods. And perhaps that sensitivi
ty is what makes them oppose
the war in the first place.
At Oakland the demonstrators
were disorganized in the face of
shocking force. Somehow, while
the "leaders" preached resist
ance to police strong-arm tactics,
none led. While they wanted to
be "violent" they didn't want to
hurt anybody or get hurt.
The violence the protesters ac
cepted, they didn't commit. It
was committed instead by the
guardians of the peace, in the
name of law and order.

SOON AFTER THE COPS started to move against
the draft protesters outside the Induction Center,
they sprayed this young man in the face with an
aerosol can of tear gas.

indicated his forehead.
"There was this girl," another
said. "The whole side of her head
was bloody. She fell on me. The
cops pulled her up. That's the
last I saw of her."
Witnesses close to the doors
say that a leader of the pro
testers tried to stop the beating,
yelling "This is a sit-in! Arrest
us! Arrest us!" They say the
police clubbed him.
The testimony goes on and on.
Almost everybody had some
first-hand story. If you weren't
on Clay Street at seven o'clock,
perhaps you were on 15th be
tween Clay and Washington at
7:33. There, many of us saw a
young man hit, walked over by
three ranks of police, and then
dragged along the advancing line
for over fifty feet.
Sudden Reality
Perhaps this seems in bad
taste. It was. For most of us,
innocent (more or less) children
of the white middle class, par
ticipants or observers, this was
an explosion of reality for which,
although we might have predict
ed it, we were not prepared.
Before the phalanx of police

had started to move, college-age
demonstrators danced ring
around-the-rosy in the street,
chanting "Hell no, nobody goes."
Before the sun rose and the
clubs fell young organizers
threatened violence as if they
possessed some power against
those 400 armed men.
As the line of police formed
and stood opposite the crowd,
monitors gave directions to their
charges. They named courses of
action that were never taken and
suggested regrouping rendez
vous that were never kept.
Not that people became unruly
or fled from the scene. Once
most of the demonstrators had
gotten out from under the ad
vancing line, they stood and
taunted their attackers. But all
they had were words.
Sound And Fury
Some got personal, in a poi
gnant way — "Number 609,
you're a son of a bitch." Others
shouted more conventional and
less printable epithets. The
police were impassive, dumb,
fearful, angry, bloodthirsty, jok
ing, bored or anguished. It de
pended on what you projected.
They reacted little, if at all.
They stood in their lines, sur

veying the situation. About half
of them chewed gum. Night
sticks tapped quietly in leather
gloved hands. The peace officers
were in control of the situation,
and they knew it.
The crowd of demonstrators,
pushed away from the induction
center, tried new techniques.
They blocked traffic. The police
extended their perimeter and the
protesters retreated — more
knowingly now, and with less in
jury.
New objects of scorn were
found, some deserving, some less
so. Two motorists roared
through the massed pickets, nar
rowly missing people. The police
took no action. The cars were
pounded as they passed. After
these near-murderers departed,
many other passing cars were
pounded for less reason.
Object Of Protest
Up on the third open-air level
of the parking lot building,
where the FBI and National
Guard officials stood watching,
was a haughty woman in a green
scarf. For some reason, a dem
onstrator singled her out for
abuse.
Something in her superior
police-protected position bother
ed him. The crowd around him
took up his cry until the woman
drew back. Was she an adequate
object for our protest? Who
knows? The cops were too tough,
so someone had to be found.
So what happened yesterday
in Oakland? Different people say
different things. To one, the fact
that the buses came at 9:05 in
stead of 7:30 was a major
achievement. They had never
been that late. Another said,
"This is a big first step. Maybe
tomorrow Oakland will burn.
Maybe they'll shut the city's
power off.
Power
"You don't fight power by be
ing good," this protester added.

"You fight power with power."
Another comment in the same
vein—"Today those cops are
turning those white students in
to revolutionaries."
In a way, that may be true.
They might have seen it on tele
vision during the Civil Rights
movement or read about riots in
underdeveloped countries. Only
a week or so ago they had some
big fracas i"n Japan. But this time
it was here, for real.
"These cops have showed us a
taste of the violence we are try
ing to stop in Vietnam," a Stan
ford student on the scene said.
Perhaps they feel now, where
hefore they only thought.
This has dangers, too. When
police beat seated girls, many
who feel deep concern about the

uselessness of violence start
looking for helmets and billy
clubs and tear gas of their own.
No philosophy is involved in this
pi-ocess; one thinks "with one's
blood."
In this direction lies unreason.
In the other direction, away
from the violence, lies a regres
sion to the past—to the faded
techniques of the civil rights
movement and that feeling of
frustration.
At this point, protests are
somewhere in the middle. The
anti-war coalition includes reli
gious pacifists, open revolution
aries, advocates of black power
and flower power. While many
preach violence in this company,
most recoil from it.
Most are neither in the rioting

ghetto nor on the non-violent
picket line. They are hunting for
a tactic that will allow them to
be as tough and effective as the
police, but they have too much
sensitivity to adopt police meth
ods. And perhaps that sensitivi
ty is what makes them oppose
the war in the first place.
At Oakland the demonstrators
were disorganized in the face of
shocking force. Somehow, while
the "leaders" preached resist
ance to police strong-arm tactics,
none led. While they wanted to
be "violent" they didn't want to
hurt anybody or get hurt.
The violence the protesters ac
cepted, they didn't commit. It
was committed instead by the
guardians of the peace, in the
name of law and order.

At six yesterday morning a

of the Oakland Induction Center.

News Analysis

morning we knew the hippie was
very, very wrong.
What you saw depended on
where you were. Some of us,
pushed aside by the wings of
that first flying wedge, only saw
clubs rise and fall in the melee
across the street. Others, who
were sitting by the doors to the
center saw skulls fractured,
teeth knocked out, men and
women who were sitting down
clubbed again and again.
Hospitalized

hospital," one witness said.

pitalized with 2 admitted.) "One

ed it, we were not prepared.
Before the phalanx of police

had started to move, college-age
demonstrators danced ring
around-the-rosy in the street,
chanting "Hell no, nobody goes."
Before the sun rose and the
clubs fell young organizers
threatened violence as if they
possessed some power against
those 400 armed men.
As the line of police formed
and stood opposite the crowd,
monitors gave directions to their
charges. They named courses of
action that were never taken and
suggested regrouping rendez
vous that were never kept.
Not that people became unruly
or fled from the scene. Once
most of the demonstrators had
gotten out from under the ad
vancing line, they stood and
taunted their attackers. But all
they had were words.
Sound And Fury
Some got personal, in a poi
gnant way — "Number 609,
you're a son of a bitch." Others
shouted more conventional and
less printable epithets. The
police were impassive, dumb,
fearful, angry, bloodthirsty, jok
ing, bored or anguished. It de
pended on what you projected.
They reacted little, if at all.
They stood in their lines, sur

veying the situation. About half
of them chewed gum. Night
sticks tapped quietly in leather
gloved hands. The peace officers
were in control of the situation,
and they knew it.
The crowd of demonstrators,
pushed away from the induction
center, tried new techniques.
They blocked traffic. The police
extended their perimeter and the
protesters retreated — more
knowingly now, and with less in
jury.
New objects of scorn were
found, some deserving, some less
so. Two motorists roared
through the massed pickets, nar
rowly missing people. The police
took no action. The cars were
pounded as they passed. After
these near-murderers departed,
many other passing cars were
pounded for less reason.
Object Of Protest
Up on the third open-air level
of the parking lot building,
where the FBI and National
Guard officials stood watching,
was a haughty woman in a green
scarf. For some reason, a dem
onstrator singled her out for
abuse.
Something in her superior
police-protected position bother
ed him. The crowd around him
took up his cry until the woman
drew back. Was she an adequate
object for our protest? Who
knows? The cops were too tough,
so someone had to be found.
So what happened yesterday
in Oakland? Different people say
different things. To one, the fact
that the buses came at 9:05 in
stead of 7:30 was a major
achievement. They had never
been that late. Another said,
"This is a big first step. Maybe
tomorrow Oakland will burn.
Maybe they'll shut the city's
power off.
Power
"You don't fight power by be
ing good," this protester added.

"You fight power with power."
Another comment in the same
vein—"Today those cops are
turning those white students in
to revolutionaries."
In a way, that may be true.
They might have seen it on tele
vision during the Civil Rights
movement or read about riots in
underdeveloped countries. Only
a week or so ago they had some
big fracas i"n Japan. But this time
it was here, for real.
"These cops have showed us a
taste of the violence we are try
ing to stop in Vietnam," a Stan
ford student on the scene said.
Perhaps they feel now, where
hefore they only thought.
This has dangers, too. When
police beat seated girls, many
who feel deep concern about the

uselessness of violence start
looking for helmets and billy
clubs and tear gas of their own.
No philosophy is involved in this
pi-ocess; one thinks "with one's
blood."
In this direction lies unreason.
In the other direction, away
from the violence, lies a regres
sion to the past—to the faded
techniques of the civil rights
movement and that feeling of
frustration.
At this point, protests are
somewhere in the middle. The
anti-war coalition includes reli
gious pacifists, open revolution
aries, advocates of black power
and flower power. While many
preach violence in this company,
most recoil from it.
Most are neither in the rioting

ghetto nor on the non-violent
picket line. They are hunting for
a tactic that will allow them to
be as tough and effective as the
police, but they have too much
sensitivity to adopt police meth
ods. And perhaps that sensitivi
ty is what makes them oppose
the war in the first place.
At Oakland the demonstrators
were disorganized in the face of
shocking force. Somehow, while
the "leaders" preached resist
ance to police strong-arm tactics,
none led. While they wanted to
be "violent" they didn't want to
hurt anybody or get hurt.
The violence the protesters ac
cepted, they didn't commit. It
was committed instead by the
guardians of the peace, in the
name of law and order.

A PHALANX OF POLICE march out of their staffing area, a park
ing parage opposite th<> Induction Center, before Oakland's finest
proceeded t*> sweep the demonstrators out of the street.
At six yesterday morning a
young hippie clad only in mad
ras bermudas was making a
statement to a reporter in front
of the Oakland Induction Center.
"It lets everybody get into the
spirit of Christmas and do their
thing," he said. "It's really
groovy.
"I don't think there will be
any violence," he continued. "I
really don't." By 7:07 yesterday

News Analysis

morning we knew the hippie was
very, very wrong.
What you saw depended on
where you were. Some of us,
pushed aside by the wings of
that first flying wedge, only saw
clubs rise and fall in the melee
across the street. Others, who
were sitting by the doors to the
center saw skulls fractured,
teeth knocked out, men and
women who were sitting down
clubbed again and again.
Hospitalized
"Five guys got taken to the
hospital," one witness said.
(Later reports indicate 26 hos
pitalized with 2 admitted.) "One

guy came back towards me. His
skull was broken open here." He
indicated his forehead.
"There was this girl," another
said. "The whole side of her head
was bloody. She fell on me. The
cops pulled her up. That's the
last I saw of her."
Witnesses close to the doors
say that a leader of the pro
testers tried to stop the beating,
yelling "This is a sit-in! Arrest
us! Arrest us!" They say the
police clubbed him.
The testimony goes on and on.
Almost everybody had some
first-hand story. If you weren't
on Clay Street at seven o'clock,
perhaps you were on 15th be
tween Clay and Washington at
7:33. There, many of us saw a
young man hit, walked over by
three ranks of police, and then
dragged along the advancing line
for over fifty feet.
Sudden Reality
Perhaps this seems in bad
taste. It was. For most of us,
innocent (more or less) children
of the white middle class, par
ticipants or observers, this was
an explosion of reality for which,
although we might have predict
ed it, we were not prepared.

pended on what you projected.
They reacted little, if at all.
They stood in their lines, sur

veying the situation. About half
of them chewed gum. Night
sticks tapped quietly in leather
gloved hands. The peace officers
were in control of the situation,
and they knew it.
The crowd of demonstrators,
pushed away from the induction
center, tried new techniques.
They blocked traffic. The police
extended their perimeter and the
protesters retreated — more
knowingly now, and with less in
jury.
New objects of scorn were
found, some deserving, some less
so. Two motorists roared
through the massed pickets, nar
rowly missing people. The police
took no action. The cars were
pounded as they passed. After
these near-murderers departed,
many other passing cars were
pounded for less reason.
Object Of Protest
Up on the third open-air level
of the parking lot building,
where the FBI and National
Guard officials stood watching,
was a haughty woman in a green
scarf. For some reason, a dem
onstrator singled her out for
abuse.
Something in her superior
police-protected position bother
ed him. The crowd around him
took up his cry until the woman
drew back. Was she an adequate
object for our protest? Who
knows? The cops were too tough,
so someone had to be found.
So what happened yesterday
in Oakland? Different people say
different things. To one, the fact
that the buses came at 9:05 in
stead of 7:30 was a major
achievement. They had never
been that late. Another said,
"This is a big first step. Maybe
tomorrow Oakland will burn.
Maybe they'll shut the city's
power off.
Power
"You don't fight power by be
ing good," this protester added.

"You fight power with power."
Another comment in the same
vein—"Today those cops are
turning those white students in
to revolutionaries."
In a way, that may be true.
They might have seen it on tele
vision during the Civil Rights
movement or read about riots in
underdeveloped countries. Only
a week or so ago they had some
big fracas i"n Japan. But this time
it was here, for real.
"These cops have showed us a
taste of the violence we are try
ing to stop in Vietnam," a Stan
ford student on the scene said.
Perhaps they feel now, where
hefore they only thought.
This has dangers, too. When
police beat seated girls, many
who feel deep concern about the

uselessness of violence start
looking for helmets and billy
clubs and tear gas of their own.
No philosophy is involved in this
pi-ocess; one thinks "with one's
blood."
In this direction lies unreason.
In the other direction, away
from the violence, lies a regres
sion to the past—to the faded
techniques of the civil rights
movement and that feeling of
frustration.
At this point, protests are
somewhere in the middle. The
anti-war coalition includes reli
gious pacifists, open revolution
aries, advocates of black power
and flower power. While many
preach violence in this company,
most recoil from it.
Most are neither in the rioting

ghetto nor on the non-violent
picket line. They are hunting for
a tactic that will allow them to
be as tough and effective as the
police, but they have too much
sensitivity to adopt police meth
ods. And perhaps that sensitivi
ty is what makes them oppose
the war in the first place.
At Oakland the demonstrators
were disorganized in the face of
shocking force. Somehow, while
the "leaders" preached resist
ance to police strong-arm tactics,
none led. While they wanted to
be "violent" they didn't want to
hurt anybody or get hurt.
The violence the protesters ac
cepted, they didn't commit. It
was committed instead by the
guardians of the peace, in the
name of law and order.

proceeded t*> sweep the demonstrators out of the street.
At six yesterday morning a
young hippie clad only in mad
ras bermudas was making a
statement to a reporter in front
of the Oakland Induction Center.
"It lets everybody get into the
spirit of Christmas and do their
thing," he said. "It's really
groovy.
"I don't think there will be
any violence," he continued. "I
really don't." By 7:07 yesterday

News Analysis

morning we knew the hippie was
very, very wrong.
What you saw depended on
where you were. Some of us,
pushed aside by the wings of
that first flying wedge, only saw
clubs rise and fall in the melee
across the street. Others, who
were sitting by the doors to the
center saw skulls fractured,
teeth knocked out, men and
women who were sitting down
clubbed again and again.
Hospitalized
"Five guys got taken to the
hospital," one witness said.
(Later reports indicate 26 hos
pitalized with 2 admitted.) "One

guy came back towards me. His
skull was broken open here." He
indicated his forehead.
"There was this girl," another
said. "The whole side of her head
was bloody. She fell on me. The
cops pulled her up. That's the
last I saw of her."
Witnesses close to the doors
say that a leader of the pro
testers tried to stop the beating,
yelling "This is a sit-in! Arrest
us! Arrest us!" They say the
police clubbed him.
The testimony goes on and on.
Almost everybody had some
first-hand story. If you weren't
on Clay Street at seven o'clock,
perhaps you were on 15th be
tween Clay and Washington at
7:33. There, many of us saw a
young man hit, walked over by
three ranks of police, and then
dragged along the advancing line
for over fifty feet.
Sudden Reality
Perhaps this seems in bad
taste. It was. For most of us,
innocent (more or less) children
of the white middle class, par
ticipants or observers, this was
an explosion of reality for which,
although we might have predict
ed it, we were not prepared.
Before the phalanx of police

had started to move, college-age
demonstrators danced ring
around-the-rosy in the street,
chanting "Hell no, nobody goes."
Before the sun rose and the
clubs fell young organizers
threatened violence as if they
possessed some power against
those 400 armed men.
As the line of police formed
and stood opposite the crowd,
monitors gave directions to their
charges. They named courses of
action that were never taken and
suggested regrouping rendez
vous that were never kept.
Not that people became unruly
or fled from the scene. Once
most of the demonstrators had
gotten out from under the ad
vancing line, they stood and
taunted their attackers. But all
they had were words.
Sound And Fury
Some got personal, in a poi
gnant way — "Number 609,
you're a son of a bitch." Others
shouted more conventional and
less printable epithets. The
police were impassive, dumb,
fearful, angry, bloodthirsty, jok
ing, bored or anguished. It de
pended on what you projected.
