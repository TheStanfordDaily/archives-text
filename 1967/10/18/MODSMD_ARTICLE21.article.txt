# Ralston Posits UCLA Battle As Pivotal Game Of Season
## 
### NICK SELBY 
(An Interview with Stanford
football coach John Ralston.)
Q. Stanford's offense moved
very well against the Washing
ton State defense last Saturday
when Stanford won 31-10. Are
there any similarities in the
UCLA defense which would
help the team move well against
the Bruins this Saturday?
Coach Ralston: Basically, both
defenses are the same. They're
called either the wide guard, the
split six, or the Notre Dame de
fense. Washington State rushed
only four men and Chuck Wil
liams had plenty of time to pass.
UCLA, however, will rush five
and six men, usually sending in
an inside linebacker. Also, al
though UCLA is about the same
size as Washington State, and
should prove no problem for our
pass blockers in that regard, the
Bruins are a lot quicker and
more aggressive.
Don Manning, one of UCLA's
linebackers, will definitely be a
threat.
Q. Who will start at quarter
back Saturday against UCLA?
Coach Ralston: Chances are
Chuck Williams will start after
his fine performance last Satur
day. But we really haven't made
a final decision yet. Both Wil
liams and Mark Marquess will
play a lot.

Q. How about the flanker?
Can Cross play with his bruised
kidney?
Coach Ralston: Jim Crors is
very doubtful for Saturday's
game. In his place will play
either Bruce Cass, who caught
a TD, or Bill Shoemaker or
Mark Robinson.
We had a very strange injury
during practice Monday. Bob
Rinker somehow twisted his
back and had to be taken to the
hospital (not the Health Cen
ter). We don't know what's
wrong with him, but he definite
ly can't play Saturday.
Don Swartz and Andy Carri
gan should both see action af
ter missing the last two games.
Q. Was Stanford really up for
the WSU game?
Coach Ralston: It's hard to
get up for every game, and I
would say, as shown in the first
quarter, that we weren't fired
up. But the team came back to
win and showed a lot of confi
dence in itself. I was very
pleased with the leadership of
captains Jack Root and Marty
Brill in that tough situation.
Q. How do you get the team
up for the UCLA game? Are
you like Vince Lombard! in
making all the players very
angry?
Coach Ralston: Getting a team
fired up for a game is some
thing that a coach must have a

feel for. When we play the three
other major California teams,
Cal, USC, and UCLA, we have
a substantial state pride factor
involved. You have to work on
spirit week by week, and not
expect to excite the players with
Saturday morning orations.
Q. How do you plan to stop
Gary Beban and the UCLA of
fense? Would you rather force
Beban to throw or to run?
Coach Ralston: We'll have to
stick with our normal defense
and hope to get to him on as
many plays as we can. Some
times you can break down the
pass protection, other times you
can't. Penn State bottled him up
pretty well on the ground but
still lost 17-15.
As for running or passing, Be
ban can hurt a team either way.
Also, Greg Jones missed last
week's game with Cal because
of a bad shoulder and we don't
know if he'll play. Whether he
does or not will affect their
game plan.
Q. How important Is this
game?
Coach Ralston: I'd say it was
the pivotal game of the season.
If we can win this one, then I
think we'll win the last four
games against Army, Washing
ton, Oregon and Cal. This is
definitely a very important
game.

very well against the Washing
ton State defense last Saturday
when Stanford won 31-10. Are
there any similarities in the
UCLA defense which would
help the team move well against
the Bruins this Saturday?
Coach Ralston: Basically, both
defenses are the same. They're
called either the wide guard, the
split six, or the Notre Dame de
fense. Washington State rushed
only four men and Chuck Wil
liams had plenty of time to pass.
UCLA, however, will rush five
and six men, usually sending in
an inside linebacker. Also, al
though UCLA is about the same
size as Washington State, and
should prove no problem for our
pass blockers in that regard, the
Bruins are a lot quicker and
more aggressive.
Don Manning, one of UCLA's
linebackers, will definitely be a
threat.
Q. Who will start at quarter
back Saturday against UCLA?
Coach Ralston: Chances are
Chuck Williams will start after
his fine performance last Satur
day. But we really haven't made
a final decision yet. Both Wil
liams and Mark Marquess will
play a lot.

Q. How about the flanker?
Can Cross play with his bruised
kidney?
Coach Ralston: Jim Crors is
very doubtful for Saturday's
game. In his place will play
either Bruce Cass, who caught
a TD, or Bill Shoemaker or
Mark Robinson.
We had a very strange injury
during practice Monday. Bob
Rinker somehow twisted his
back and had to be taken to the
hospital (not the Health Cen
ter). We don't know what's
wrong with him, but he definite
ly can't play Saturday.
Don Swartz and Andy Carri
gan should both see action af
ter missing the last two games.
Q. Was Stanford really up for
the WSU game?
Coach Ralston: It's hard to
get up for every game, and I
would say, as shown in the first
quarter, that we weren't fired
up. But the team came back to
win and showed a lot of confi
dence in itself. I was very
pleased with the leadership of
captains Jack Root and Marty
Brill in that tough situation.
Q. How do you get the team
up for the UCLA game? Are
you like Vince Lombard! in
making all the players very
angry?
Coach Ralston: Getting a team
fired up for a game is some
thing that a coach must have a

feel for. When we play the three
other major California teams,
Cal, USC, and UCLA, we have
a substantial state pride factor
involved. You have to work on
spirit week by week, and not
expect to excite the players with
Saturday morning orations.
Q. How do you plan to stop
Gary Beban and the UCLA of
fense? Would you rather force
Beban to throw or to run?
Coach Ralston: We'll have to
stick with our normal defense
and hope to get to him on as
many plays as we can. Some
times you can break down the
pass protection, other times you
can't. Penn State bottled him up
pretty well on the ground but
still lost 17-15.
As for running or passing, Be
ban can hurt a team either way.
Also, Greg Jones missed last
week's game with Cal because
of a bad shoulder and we don't
know if he'll play. Whether he
does or not will affect their
game plan.
Q. How important Is this
game?
Coach Ralston: I'd say it was
the pivotal game of the season.
If we can win this one, then I
think we'll win the last four
games against Army, Washing
ton, Oregon and Cal. This is
definitely a very important
game.

UCLA defense which would
help the team move well against
the Bruins this Saturday?
Coach Ralston: Basically, both
defenses are the same. They're
called either the wide guard, the
split six, or the Notre Dame de
fense. Washington State rushed
only four men and Chuck Wil
liams had plenty of time to pass.
UCLA, however, will rush five
and six men, usually sending in
an inside linebacker. Also, al
though UCLA is about the same
size as Washington State, and
should prove no problem for our
pass blockers in that regard, the
Bruins are a lot quicker and
more aggressive.
Don Manning, one of UCLA's
linebackers, will definitely be a
threat.
Q. Who will start at quarter
back Saturday against UCLA?
Coach Ralston: Chances are
Chuck Williams will start after
his fine performance last Satur
day. But we really haven't made
a final decision yet. Both Wil
liams and Mark Marquess will
play a lot.

Q. How about the flanker?
Can Cross play with his bruised
kidney?
Coach Ralston: Jim Crors is
very doubtful for Saturday's
game. In his place will play
either Bruce Cass, who caught
a TD, or Bill Shoemaker or
Mark Robinson.
We had a very strange injury
during practice Monday. Bob
Rinker somehow twisted his
back and had to be taken to the
hospital (not the Health Cen
ter). We don't know what's
wrong with him, but he definite
ly can't play Saturday.
Don Swartz and Andy Carri
gan should both see action af
ter missing the last two games.
Q. Was Stanford really up for
the WSU game?
Coach Ralston: It's hard to
get up for every game, and I
would say, as shown in the first
quarter, that we weren't fired
up. But the team came back to
win and showed a lot of confi
dence in itself. I was very
pleased with the leadership of
captains Jack Root and Marty
Brill in that tough situation.
Q. How do you get the team
up for the UCLA game? Are
you like Vince Lombard! in
making all the players very
angry?
Coach Ralston: Getting a team
fired up for a game is some
thing that a coach must have a

feel for. When we play the three
other major California teams,
Cal, USC, and UCLA, we have
a substantial state pride factor
involved. You have to work on
spirit week by week, and not
expect to excite the players with
Saturday morning orations.
Q. How do you plan to stop
Gary Beban and the UCLA of
fense? Would you rather force
Beban to throw or to run?
Coach Ralston: We'll have to
stick with our normal defense
and hope to get to him on as
many plays as we can. Some
times you can break down the
pass protection, other times you
can't. Penn State bottled him up
pretty well on the ground but
still lost 17-15.
As for running or passing, Be
ban can hurt a team either way.
Also, Greg Jones missed last
week's game with Cal because
of a bad shoulder and we don't
know if he'll play. Whether he
does or not will affect their
game plan.
Q. How important Is this
game?
Coach Ralston: I'd say it was
the pivotal game of the season.
If we can win this one, then I
think we'll win the last four
games against Army, Washing
ton, Oregon and Cal. This is
definitely a very important
game.
