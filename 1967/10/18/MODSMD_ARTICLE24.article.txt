### 
Phil Murphy took a punt and
ran it back 75 yards for a TD
to lead the Phi Kap B team to
a 20-0 win in the finest personal
performance on the intramural
gridiron yesterday. The Theta
Xi B's were the losers.
Sigma Chi's B team fell 12-0
to the KA B's, and the Theta
Delt B's showed their house's
overall strength with a 27-0 win
over the Phi Sig B's. The Lassen-
Muir game was cancelled, and
the Madera B-Branner B game
was a double forfeit.
In other action, Fremont B up
set El Toro B 13-0, and the Theta
Delts continued their win streak
with a 20-0 victory over the Delta
Chi's.
