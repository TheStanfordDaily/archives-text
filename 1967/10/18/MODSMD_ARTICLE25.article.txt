# Miles, Sprints, And Flying Golf Balls Train Harriers
## 
### BOB RUND 
Many members of the Stan
ford Community have never
seen a cross-country meet and
and are even less aware of what
a harrier or thinlie, as cross
country runners are sometimes
called, must do in practice to
be ready to race four miles eac'i
Saturday.
The Stanford cross-country
team usually starts its week by
running a 10 to 16 mile road
run each Monday. This involves
approximately an hour to an
hour and forty-five minutes of
continuous running.
On Tuesdays the team goes
to the Stanford Golf Course to
run repeat miles. The Varsity
runs each of these eight mile
runs between four minutes and
twenty-seven seconds to five
minutes. Coach Jerry Barland
considered this one of the tough
est and most beneficial workouts
in his program.
15th Tee Horrors
Wednesdays are usually re
served for the 15th tee workout.
As all Stanford harriers know
the 15th tee means sprinting up
a very steep hill in sets of five.
Each set is then followed by
a 1000 yard run. This practice
is usually finished off by run
ning a set of 500-700 yard runs
where the body is badly jarred.
This jarring would have little
adverse effect except that the
run ends at the water fountain
and the urge to quench one's
thirst is irrestible. The dire con
sequences of this action is left to
the consideration of the reader.
Tune Up
On Thursdays the team usual
ly does a conglomeration of half
miles, miles, and two miles. This
practice is designed to tune up

the runner for the race on Sat
urday.
Friday's practice consists of a
warm-up and a few sprints to
loosen the runner up for the
meet.
Saturday is the day where all
the hard work and courage the
runners have built up is put to
use.
The team runs over distance
on its own on Sundays. This us
ually consists of an hour to two
hours of continuous running on
varried terrain.
This may seem like a lot of
work, but Coach Barland's run
ners don't stop here. Most run
in the mornings before their
classes and several are enrolled
in weightlifting classes.
Courageous Harriers
The Stanford cross-country
runner is also to be compliment
ed for his courage under fire.
On all the workouts on the golf
course the runner endangers his
life and limb as golf balls are
whizzing by him everywhere.
Sophomore Dave R e d w in e
seems to have a natural attrac
tion for the golf ball. Dave was
hit in the calf enroute to a two
mile run and could hardly walk
for the next day or so. On an
other occassion the ball came so
close to Dave that he caught it.
Although specifically instruct
ed to stay off the greens and
the middle of the fairways, the

team has found these to be much
safer to run on than the roughs
and the edges of the course.
Team Neglected
Despite the individual nature
of cross-country, it is a team
sport. The majority of the work
outs are run in groups with
teammates encouraging each
other on.
The team feels somewhat ne
glected because of the lack of
attention it receives. For those
interested in seeing how all this
seemingly masochistic training
pays off, Stanford has a meet
this Saturday at 10:00 a.m.
against a tough UCLA team.
The Fro s h will compete
against Foothill Junior College.
