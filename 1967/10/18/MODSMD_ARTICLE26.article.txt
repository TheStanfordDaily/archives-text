# 'Century 21' To Consider Population, Food Dilemma
## 
### 
"Trends in Population and
Food Resources" will be the
topic of the third lecture in the
"Century 21" series delivered to
day at 4:15 p.m. in Tresidder
Lounge by Dr. Paul Ehrlich,
Stanford biology professor.
Dr. Singh Wallia, director of
the series, points out that de
spite the enormity of the popu
lation explosion, little adequate
attention has been given to it.
"Myopic foresight with merely
ad hoc solutions will no longer
suffice," he states.
Ehrlich is a population biolo

gist, well-known through his
work with the dynamics of but
terfly populations. His hypothe
ses concerning human popula
tion have attracted wide atten
tion and have helped to en
courage public interest in the
problem.
He will consider the factors
in population growth, the imbal
ance between food production
and population growth, the con
dition of man's physical and
psychic environment, and the
chances for a 21st century.
Ehrlich advocates strong curb

ing of population growth and is
pessimistic about the efficiency
of stepped-up food production to
close the gap between food and
population.
He has little hope for a healthy
world environment without a
sharp decrease in the growth of
populations. "I suspect that
things will run steadily downhill
until a solution finds us," he
warns.
Ehrlich will discuss the human
population, not as an isolated
group, but as one population
among the many populations of
interrelated species.
