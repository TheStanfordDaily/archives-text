# In LASSU Tomorrow
## Dump NSA Bill Coming 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A bill that would effectively
sever Stanford's tie with the Na
tional Student Association
(NSA) will be introduced in the
legislature of the Associated
Students (LASSU) tomorrow
night.
LASSU will be asked to trans
fer $155, appropriated last May
as Stanford's NSA dues, to the
general contingency fund.
If the bill is passed, Stanford
won't pay its 1967-68 dues to
NSA.
Although no formal resolu
tion expressing Stanford's inten
tion to quit NSA is planned, the
bill's sponsors feel that a re
fusal to pay dues is a de facto
withdrawal from NSA.
Anderson Will Sponsor
Gail Anderson, the LASSU
representative from Grove
House, will introduce the bill. It
will require a majority vote for
passage.
"The structure of NSA itself
renders it inadequate to serve
Stanford's needs," Miss Ander
son said, "and it remains an in
herently undemocratic organiza
tion."
She claims that NSA, which
is based in Washington. D.C.,
does nothing for Stanford stu
dents. NSA's four permanent of
ficers in Washington are beyond

the control of member campus
es, she said.
"The entire operation is run
without check," Miss Anderson
said. "It is unresponsive to stu
dent desires, and beyond student
control."
NSA's secret ties to the CIA
were revealed last spring by
Ramparts magazine. Brandeis
University immediately quit the
association. The University of
Michigan severed its NSA ties
earlier this month, criticizing
the association as a "leftist"
group out of touch with its stu
dent members.
More Money Involved
Stanford's withdrawal from
NSA would actually involve con
siderably more money than the
$155 dues, according to LASSU
speaker Michael Weinstein.
Over $1200 would have to be ap
propriated later this year for
traveling expenses for Stan
ford's delegates to NSA's annual
convention.
Also entangled in the NSA
controversy is the Ravenswood
tutorial program, technically
sponsored by NSA but financed
by an $1800 appropriation by
LASSU. Weinstein said the tu
toring program could break its
NSA ties by "administrative ac
tion," and continue to receive
LASSU money.
"We can run our own tutori

als just as efficiently without an
NSA label on them," he said.
Vonda Crouse, student direc
tor of the Ravenswood program,
said she favors the bill to take
Stanford out of NSA.
Opposition to the "dump
NSA" bill has been voiced by
Gail Kitaji, one of Stanford's
delegates to NSA's convention
last August along with Wein
stein and Cesare Massarenti,
ASSU vice president.

Claiming that Stanford stu
dents have "never been ade
quately informed about NSA,"
she cites many NSA services
which Stanford hasn't bothered
to use. Among these are dis
count cards for students both
abroad and in the United States
and the Educational Travel Ser
vice, she said.
Miss Kitaji complained that
ASSU President Peter Lyman
"doesn't really care about NSA"
and has worsened the "lack of
communication" by not formal
ly appointing an NSA coordina
tor.
The movement at Stanford to
dump NSA started at the NSA
convention in August. Weinstein
and Massarenti worked closely
with a "radical caucus" of stu
dent leaders from Michigan,
Wayne State and other univer
sities in a vain attempt to "re
form" NSA's structure. Wein
stein in particular wanted NSA
to assist in setting up regional
student unions, with a strongly
democratic constitution. The
NSA convention defeated all the
proposals of the radical caucus.
NSA's involvement with the
CIA is not an issue, according
to Weinstein, except as it shows
how the national officers of NSA
can act without the knowledge
of the membership.
