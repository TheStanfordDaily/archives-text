# Hoffer Urges Negro Rebirth
## 
### CONNIE COLLIER 
"The Madhouse of Change,"
especially as it concerns the
American Negro, was the theme
of longshoreman • philosopher
Eric Hoffer's speech Monday
night in Tresidder Union.
"To adjust oneself to change,
one must undergo a process of
rebirth," said Hoffer.
"Only the Negro community as
a whole can obtain the sense of
belonging Negroes need," he
said. "Their problems would be
eliminated if they combined for
mutual aid and self-advance
ment.
"Build yourself a city," he di
rected, quoting a contemporary
poem. "Grab fate ... do not cry
for pity." He said that in this
way Negroes would cease to be
Negroes and would undergo a
process of rebirth.
Pride In Self
Hoffer said this is the only
way—"the most natural way"—
that they can gain the admira
tion of the world. Pride in them
selves follows.
"They need leaders now who
have a concern for the masses.
"Martin Luther King and Stoke
ly Carmichael do not possess
this quality," he said.
The Negroes who are now in
Vietnam are the Negro commu
nity's potential leaders. They
are learning "how to be Ameri
can," Hoffer said. "When they
enter the army they are, in a
sense, given a new identity; they
have the opportunity to prove
their worth."
Unite Classes
"Charismatic leaders are for
the dropouts. What the Negroes
need is common leaders who
will unite their lower class and
their middle class."
Regarding society in general,
Hoffer said that "happiness is
rarer than change. Change is
not the natural, self-evident
thing we take it to be. It is nei
ther smooth nor harmless," he
said.
"In history, change was a rare
phenomenon; now people have
no time to prepare themselves
because movement is so rapid."
