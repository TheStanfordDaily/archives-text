# Economics Professor
## Arrow Accepts Harvard Faculty Post 
### JEFF ROBISON 
Kenneth J. Arrow, Professor
of Economics and former head
of the department at Stanford,
will join Harvard University's
faculty next fall.
The announcement, made yes
terday, was not unexpected.
Nonetheless, it was generally
construed as a severe setback
for the University.
Current executive head of the

Economics Department Edward
S. Shaw called Arrow's resigna
tion "a really climatic loss."
"It's as regrettable as it could
possibly be. I consider Kenneth
the number-one economics pro
fessor in the country," Shaw
said.
Department Ranks High
In an interview with The Daily
Arrow conceded it would be dif
ficult to leave Stanford after

nineteen years. "The Department
here," he said, "ranks high on
all counts. It isn't a question of
dissatisfaction." Arrow joined
the Stanford faculty in 1949, and
became a professor in 1953.
Calling Harvard "the center
of the economic world," Arrow
added "I just feel I'll be better
able to influence the state of
economics there."
"I've completed one phase of
my life here. It's time to start
another."
"To round out the picture," he
concluded, "my family lives in
the East. This tipped the
scales," he said, "though it was
not a commanding reason."
Arrow, a 46 year-old native
of New York, began his distin
guished career with a B.S. degree
from the City College of New
York in 1940. He received his
M.A. (1941) and Ph.D. (1951)
from Columbia.
Scholarship Awards
Included in the professor's list
of awards and grants are the
Poll Medal for highest scholastic
achievement at City College, the
Ward Medal for studies in logic,
grants from the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Office of Na
val Research, and a Ford Foun
dation Fellowship in economics
and business administration.
In addition, Arrow is the au
thor of "Social Choice and In
dividual Values" for which he
received the John Bates Clard
Award for making a "significant
contribution to economic
thought and knowledge."
A one-time consultant to the
Rand Corporation and past pres
ident of the Econometric Socie
ty, Arrow is also affiliated with
the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics, the
American Economic Association,
the Institute of Management
Sciences, and the American Sta
tistical Association.
Welfare Economy
The thrust of Arrow's re
search has been in the fields of
price theory, mathematical anal
ysis of inventory and production
problems, and such specialized

areas as welfare economy and
theories of competitive economy.
Following a year of teaching
at the University of Chicago, Ar
row arrived at Stanford in 1949,
became a full professor in 1953,
and headed the Department of
Economics from 1953 to 1956. He
also served as Executive Head
during the 1962-63 academic
year.
Arrow has taught primarily in
the fields of public finance, eco
nomic statistics, and economet
rics.
In 1962 Resources for the Fu
ture, Inc. awarded him $36,225
to direct a study on "Criteria for
Public Investment."
While at Harvard Arrow plans
to continue along his previous
lines of research and teaching.

fessor in the country," Shaw
said.
Department Ranks High
In an interview with The Daily
Arrow conceded it would be dif
ficult to leave Stanford after

nineteen years. "The Department
here," he said, "ranks high on
all counts. It isn't a question of
dissatisfaction." Arrow joined
the Stanford faculty in 1949, and
became a professor in 1953.
Calling Harvard "the center
of the economic world," Arrow
added "I just feel I'll be better
able to influence the state of
economics there."
"I've completed one phase of
my life here. It's time to start
another."
"To round out the picture," he
concluded, "my family lives in
the East. This tipped the
scales," he said, "though it was
not a commanding reason."
Arrow, a 46 year-old native
of New York, began his distin
guished career with a B.S. degree
from the City College of New
York in 1940. He received his
M.A. (1941) and Ph.D. (1951)
from Columbia.
