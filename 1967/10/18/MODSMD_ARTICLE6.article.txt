ish soldier will give his expert
views here today on the explo

Glubb is well-known for his

commission and went to work

Arab Legion.
Under the command of "Glubb
Pasha" the Legion was turned
into the best Arab fighting force
in the Middle East. The Legion
fought alongside British forces
in World War 11.
When the United Nations at
tempted to partition Palestine in
1948, the Arab Legion advanced
from Jordan in the general at
tack on Israel. The Legion
seized the old city of Jerusalem,
and the Zionist forces were un
able to drive them out until last
June.
Glubb remained in command
of the Legion until 1956, when
he was sacked amid strong anti-
British feelings among Arabs.
