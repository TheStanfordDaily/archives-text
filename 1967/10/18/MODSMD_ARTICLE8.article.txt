# Oakland Tragedy
## 
### 
We are shocked by the violence and brutality
exercised by the police at the Oakland Induction
Center yesterday morning.
The hatred they showed for the demonstrators
was a tragedy for Oakland and for humanity.
The existence of freedom and the right to pro
test are in jeopardy, if yesterday's violence is
characteristic of how demonstrations will be
treated in the future.
Tear gas and club-swinging brutality was to
tally unnecessary in yesterday's action. Perhaps
the violence can be attributed to a small group
of cops who used the incident to vent intense
anger on the peaceful demonstrators. But the
police followed a well-conceived plan that made
violence inevitable from the start.
As the police lines encountered the non-violent
sit-in demonstrators, they initiated and intensi
fied an attack on those on the ground. The 26
taken to hospitals were only a few of those who
felt the impact of the brutal conflict.
Many had talked of violence before. In fact,
those who stated they would defend themselves
if attacked by police placed everyone in danger.
The police made no attempt to distinguish be
tween the violent and non-violent demonstrators.
They reacted indiscriminately and inhumanly.
The massed police, sheriff s deputies and high
way patrol from several counties moved into the
streets treating everyone as a violent demonstra
tor against whom violence could rightfully be
used. They attacked pacifists, newsmen, clergy
men, and non-violent demonstrators.

There were isolated acts of violence against
the police, but almost all were in self-defense. It
was not a violent demonstration by any stretch
of the imagination. Everyone pretended it was to
be violent. When it wasn't, they paid the price
of the hoaxâ€”in hatred and injury and robots
made of men.
Violence is hell, but non-violence seems little
better. As Joan Baez says "non-violence is a flop,
but the only greater flop is violence." Power be
got fear yesterday as the helmeted "guardians of
the peace" cracked heads and sprayed tear gas
and huddled forms were enveloped by the po
lice lines.
The anti-war movement is faced with a dilem
ma which cannot last long. Either it will stay
non-violent or it will move on to violent revolu
tion.
We must affirm the futility of the violent path.
The city police yesterday were followed by dep
uty sheriffs and highway patrolmen but could
have been followed, too, by the National Guard
and the Marines. There is no overcoming this
power. The suffering and hatred born of violence
can only destroy this generation's faith in the
cause of human dignity.
Yesterday may have been the beginning of the
dark ages of violence. The three days of protest
remaining this week may point the movement's
future direction. These days of protests will ei
ther prove the strength of non-violence or mark
the beginning of the revolution.
