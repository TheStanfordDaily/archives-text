## Oakland Escalation Of 'Semi-Violence' 
### Bob Fishman 
The wars have escalated, all of
of them. Even the conflict be
tween policemen and anti-draft
demonstrators has reached a
new stalemate at a higher level
of violence.
The Oakland demonstration
was planned by its organizers as
a "semi-violent" demonstration.
Protesters were instructed to re
sist force with force. Elaborate
chains of command, look-outs
equipped with walkie-talkies,
anti-tear gas procedures—these
were all part of the original
plans.
This protest was indeed "semi
violent," though not in the way
that the organizers had intended:
The police were violent and the
protesters were not.
For the Oakland police had a
plan, too. They knew that many
of the demonstrators sought ar
rest but feared flying night
sticks. Consequently, they broke
a great many heads but made
very few arrests.
Violence At Random
The police had one more weap
on: their violence was random,
gratuitous, wholly unrelated to
protecting the draftees, in fact
wholly unrelated to any purpose
at all except instilling fear.
"My God, it's the whole
Navy," gasped one demonstrator
as she saw the vast column of
men in blue marching briskly
down Clay Street to the Induc
tion Center.
It was not the Navy; it was
200 members of the Oakland
Police Force massed in a flying
wedge five men deep that
stretched from sidewalk to side
walk.
Behind them were the olive
drab buses that the demonstra
tors had vowed to stop. The po
lice had already cleared and cor
doned off the street ahead with
similar flying wedge tactics.
(Anyone who doesn't move fast
enough gets clubbed.)
Advancing' Column
Only one obstacle remained: a
young man who had managed to
elude police barricades and was

now sitting in the path of the ad
vancing column. The policeman
at its head marched smartly past
the young man, clubbing him in
the back of the neck as he went
by.
Some of the policemen in the
next three rows of the wedge
also clubbed him, while those in
the last two generally kicked or
walked over him.
A man on the sidewalk dressed
in medical whites—he was later
identified as a Stanford intern—
tried to move forward. The police
clubbed him and pushed him
back into the crowd. Several
other bystanders were also club
bed at that time.
Climbed Lightpole
The young man, still bleeding
in the middle of the street, began
to writhe convulsively. Tow po
licemen picked him up and threw
him to the sidewalk where the
intern could finally treat him.
Another young man had
climbed up a light pole to get a
better view of the proceedings.
But he underestimated the speed
of the flying wedge, and before
he could get down he was sur
rounded by clubwielding police
men.
While protesters were still be
ing clubbed down on the street,
a very fat lady suddenly ap
peared in a fire escape above
them shouting, "You people
think you can beat the whole
Oakland police force."
She, I suppose, had the last
word.
