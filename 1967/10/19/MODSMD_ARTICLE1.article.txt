# Prof. Urges Birth Curbs

### 
Stanford professor Dr. Paul
Ehrlich spoke on "Trends in
Population and Food Resources"
to a near-capacity crowd in the
Large Lounge in Tresidder. The
speech was the third in the Cen
tury 21 series.
The population biology spe
cialist went on, "Steadily in
creasing population pressures
continue to deny man the
breathing space he requires to
alter his socio-political systems.
Until such an opportunity can
be provided, the chance of find
ing a sane solution to world
problems seems nil."
Addressing an audience for
the Century 21 lecture series,
Ehrlich predicted that war will
probably break out "elsewhere—
in Thailand, the Philippines, Ko
rea, or California. Tensions are
increasing he claimed, and are
not liable to improve "when al
most everyone is hungry and
nations are competing for scarce
food resources."
To alleviate the problem of
over-population, Ehrlich urged

as a possible solution through
changing restrictive birth-con
trol and abortion laws. He also
advocated income tax revisions
to make "the people who im
pose the burden of excess chil
dren pay for the privilege."
At present the effort to feed
the world is failing. "In 1966 the
world's population increased by
some 70 million individuals. No
additional food was grown to
feed them." The burden of this
food shortage was unequal.
Some parts of the world, such as
the U.S., hardly feel the diffi
culty, but "starvation is already
a fact in many countries."
According to Ehrlich there are
only 10 countries that produce
more than they consume. How
ever these food reserves can not
be depended on to meet severe
shortages. If India's current
growth rate of a million and a
half more people a month con
tinue for the next ten years,
the entire U.S. grain production
would not be sufficient to meet
the food shortage there.
The professor said that most
experts agreed that a tripling of
the world's food supply will be
mandatory before the year 2000
if we expect to feed the six or
seven billion alive then. This in
crease can only be accomplished
"if a massive effort commences
immediately," and no such mo
bilization of our resources has
set about.
Meanwhile the population
count surges upward. "We now
stand at around three billion,
and our current doubling rate
seems to be about 37 years." To
compound the problem, this
doubling period is shrinking,
which will result in an even fast
er growth rate.
Prof. Ehrlich went on to de
scribe a world in which our chil

dren may wear smog masks and
go camping under vinyl trees
landscaped in asphalt. Seaweed
may substitute for steaks and
people should prepare to adapt
to strict government regimenta
tion.
Eventually we will have to
stabilize world population if we
are to survive. "Increasing food
production is treating a symp
tom, not the disease." Attitudes
and morals which have promo
ted reproduction are "obsolete,
dangerous, and immoral."
Prof. Ehrlich proposes that
the U.S. oblige all nations ac
cepting its foreign aid to coop
erate in limiting population. "To
coordinate the effort at home
and overseas, it is imperative
that we have a national policy
making committee concerned
with population biology."

Stanford professor Dr. Paul
Ehrlich spoke on "Trends in
Population and Food Resources"
to a near-capacity crowd in the
Large Lounge in Tresidder. The
speech was the third in the Cen
tury 21 series.
The population biology spe
cialist went on, "Steadily in
creasing population pressures
continue to deny man the
breathing space he requires to
alter his socio-political systems.
Until such an opportunity can
be provided, the chance of find
ing a sane solution to world
problems seems nil."
Addressing an audience for
the Century 21 lecture series,
Ehrlich predicted that war will
probably break out "elsewhere—
in Thailand, the Philippines, Ko
rea, or California. Tensions are
increasing he claimed, and are
not liable to improve "when al
most everyone is hungry and
nations are competing for scarce
food resources."
To alleviate the problem of
over-population, Ehrlich urged

as a possible solution through
changing restrictive birth-con
trol and abortion laws. He also
advocated income tax revisions
to make "the people who im
pose the burden of excess chil
dren pay for the privilege."
At present the effort to feed
the world is failing. "In 1966 the
world's population increased by
some 70 million individuals. No
additional food was grown to
feed them." The burden of this
food shortage was unequal.
Some parts of the world, such as
the U.S., hardly feel the diffi
culty, but "starvation is already
a fact in many countries."
According to Ehrlich there are
only 10 countries that produce
more than they consume. How
ever these food reserves can not
be depended on to meet severe
shortages. If India's current
growth rate of a million and a
half more people a month con
tinue for the next ten years,
the entire U.S. grain production
would not be sufficient to meet
the food shortage there.
The professor said that most
experts agreed that a tripling of
the world's food supply will be
mandatory before the year 2000
if we expect to feed the six or
seven billion alive then. This in
crease can only be accomplished
"if a massive effort commences
immediately," and no such mo
bilization of our resources has
set about.
Meanwhile the population
count surges upward. "We now
stand at around three billion,
and our current doubling rate
seems to be about 37 years." To
compound the problem, this
doubling period is shrinking,
which will result in an even fast
er growth rate.
Prof. Ehrlich went on to de
scribe a world in which our chil

dren may wear smog masks and
go camping under vinyl trees
landscaped in asphalt. Seaweed
may substitute for steaks and
people should prepare to adapt
to strict government regimenta
tion.
Eventually we will have to
stabilize world population if we
are to survive. "Increasing food
production is treating a symp
tom, not the disease." Attitudes
and morals which have promo
ted reproduction are "obsolete,
dangerous, and immoral."
Prof. Ehrlich proposes that
the U.S. oblige all nations ac
cepting its foreign aid to coop
erate in limiting population. "To
coordinate the effort at home
and overseas, it is imperative
that we have a national policy
making committee concerned
with population biology."
