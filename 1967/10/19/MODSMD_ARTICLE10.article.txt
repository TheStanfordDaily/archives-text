# Get Out Of NSA

### 
Stanford is once again considering disaffiliat
ing from the National Student Association
(NSA).
Stanford's stormy involvement with NSA be
gan in the summer of 1947 when Stanford dele
gates were present for the adoption of the
NSA constitution.
At that same conference, the NSA joined
the International Union of Students, an admit
tedly communist organization. NSA has come
a long way since then, as has Stanford.
The history of Stanford's involvement is a
patchwork of affiliation and non-affiliation. In
the 1949 Ex-Com (predecessor of LASSU),
member Mark Hatfield complained that NSA
was being run by people who represented only
their own views, not the views of the students.
Despite Daily support for disaffiliation, the Ex-
Com voted to remain in the organization.
Stanford did disaffiliate in 1950 but joined
again in 1953. "Permanent" membership in NSA
was approved by the legislature in 1954 but
Stanford resigned again in 1956.
In 1960 a proposal to rejoin NSA was soundly
trounced. However, a campaign for re-affilia
tion was successful two years later led by Fred
Goff, and former NSA President and Stanford
Dean A 1 Lowenstein.
The question tonight before LASSU is pri
marily a monetary one. LASSU speaker Michael
Weinstein and ASSU vice-president Cesare Mas
sarenti do not want to spend the more than $200
for the National and regional dues of NSA.
Stanford has also spent up to $1200 to send three
representatives to the NSA Congress each year.
They returned from the NSA Congress late
this summer unenthusiastic with NSA's concern
for Stanford's problems.
We urge Stanford to withdraw from NSA but
for somewhat different reasons than Weinstein
and Massarenti propose. The small dues figure
in question tonight is irrelevant — almost as

irrelevant as Massarenti's statement is ridicu
lous that to continue to belong to the NSA is
to endorse the NSA-CIA ties.
A much more serious question is the political
nature of the NSA. Is it wise or even practical
to support a politically-active national organiza
tion when the 380 member schools have little or
no control over what the organization actually
does?
The only time NSA has any semblance of rep
resentation is at the summer congress. Does
Stanford wish to spend up to $1400 to partici
pate in making a few yearly policy statements
reflecting very imperfectly the will of the stu
dents of the country?
Once the Congress is over and the delegates
have gone home, the control of the NSA rests
in the hands of a few national staff members
who then can speak freely for the organization.
This is the same question raised this summer
at the Congress of the United States Student
Press Association (USSPA). USSPA formerly
was affiliated with NSA but separated itself this
year.
USSPA's new national staff sought to make
theorganization politically active, while it re
mained in the hands of the national staff for all
but one week of the year. The USSPA Congress
fired the national staff ans made it clear USSPA
was to remain a service organization.
The services provided by NSA are very re
moved from Stanford. They apparently can be
made available by a local student union much
more effectively.
NSA is definitely acting as a political organi
zation. We recommend Stanford drop its as
sociation with NSA because of the absurdity of
this claim. We recommend that LASSU retract
the appropriation for the national dues tonight
and that the question of Stanford's NSA mem
bership be submitted to the student body for
a referendum.

Stanford is once again considering disaffiliat
ing from the National Student Association
(NSA).
Stanford's stormy involvement with NSA be
gan in the summer of 1947 when Stanford dele
gates were present for the adoption of the
NSA constitution.
At that same conference, the NSA joined
the International Union of Students, an admit
tedly communist organization. NSA has come
a long way since then, as has Stanford.
The history of Stanford's involvement is a
patchwork of affiliation and non-affiliation. In
the 1949 Ex-Com (predecessor of LASSU),
member Mark Hatfield complained that NSA
was being run by people who represented only
their own views, not the views of the students.
Despite Daily support for disaffiliation, the Ex-
Com voted to remain in the organization.
Stanford did disaffiliate in 1950 but joined
again in 1953. "Permanent" membership in NSA
was approved by the legislature in 1954 but
Stanford resigned again in 1956.
In 1960 a proposal to rejoin NSA was soundly
trounced. However, a campaign for re-affilia
tion was successful two years later led by Fred
Goff, and former NSA President and Stanford
Dean A 1 Lowenstein.
The question tonight before LASSU is pri
marily a monetary one. LASSU speaker Michael
Weinstein and ASSU vice-president Cesare Mas
sarenti do not want to spend the more than $200
for the National and regional dues of NSA.
Stanford has also spent up to $1200 to send three
representatives to the NSA Congress each year.
They returned from the NSA Congress late
this summer unenthusiastic with NSA's concern
for Stanford's problems.
We urge Stanford to withdraw from NSA but
for somewhat different reasons than Weinstein
and Massarenti propose. The small dues figure
in question tonight is irrelevant — almost as

irrelevant as Massarenti's statement is ridicu
lous that to continue to belong to the NSA is
to endorse the NSA-CIA ties.
A much more serious question is the political
nature of the NSA. Is it wise or even practical
to support a politically-active national organiza
tion when the 380 member schools have little or
no control over what the organization actually
does?
The only time NSA has any semblance of rep
resentation is at the summer congress. Does
Stanford wish to spend up to $1400 to partici
pate in making a few yearly policy statements
reflecting very imperfectly the will of the stu
dents of the country?
Once the Congress is over and the delegates
have gone home, the control of the NSA rests
in the hands of a few national staff members
who then can speak freely for the organization.
This is the same question raised this summer
at the Congress of the United States Student
Press Association (USSPA). USSPA formerly
was affiliated with NSA but separated itself this
year.
USSPA's new national staff sought to make
theorganization politically active, while it re
mained in the hands of the national staff for all
but one week of the year. The USSPA Congress
fired the national staff ans made it clear USSPA
was to remain a service organization.
The services provided by NSA are very re
moved from Stanford. They apparently can be
made available by a local student union much
more effectively.
NSA is definitely acting as a political organi
zation. We recommend Stanford drop its as
sociation with NSA because of the absurdity of
this claim. We recommend that LASSU retract
the appropriation for the national dues tonight
and that the question of Stanford's NSA mem
bership be submitted to the student body for
a referendum.
