## NSA: No Catering Service 
### 
As a typical Stanford student,
I do not usually take an active
interest in campus politics, but
after reading the article of Octo
ber 10 "University of Michigan
Drops NSA Ties," I could not
help but comment on the utter
ridiculousness of the arguments
as to why Stanford should with
draw from the NSA.
To begin with NSA does not
exist to cater to member student
bodies. The essence of NSA is
that it provides an adaptable
structure through which mem
ber student bodies may estab
lish educational and service pro
grams on their own campuses.
The basic fact that must be
recognized is that the national
staff can only make these pro
grams, information and advice
available to the campuses, the
job of breathing life into these
programs can only be accom
plished through the efforts of
the students themselves.
The major reason that NSA
has not been of continuing bene
fit to Stanford is that Stanford
students have not had sufficient
interest in NSA or its programs.
It seems that what Mr. Wein
stein is saying is that since NSA
will not hand us anything that
we want on a silver platter, then
we should get out.
Later in the article, Mr. Wein
stein says, "Besides, look at
Stanford and ask, 'what have
they done for us' (bold face
mine) The answer is very little."
The question which Mr. Wein
stein, in fact, should have asked
himself and the question which
all Stanford students should ask

themselves is, "What has NSA
made available to us?" The ans
wer is — Quite a lot!
NSA makes available a pro
gram which provides students
with a 10-50% discount on mer
chandise, theatre tickets, cloth
ing, ets., etc., within the imme
diate campus area. I am in full
agreement with Mr. Weinstein's
contention that it is only through
cooperation with local merchants
that this discount system can, in
deed, become a reality.
But in addition to these local
discounts, NSA, by incorporating
all of these local systems, makes
available discounts throughout
the country to every member
school.
Just as important and perhaps
more so is the fact that the struc
ture for such a discount system
is present and available through
NSA while the structure for the
proposed student union is non
existent. The goals are the same
but the time saved in instituting
the system by using the NSA
blue-print is, in itself, a good
reason why Stanford should re
main an NSA member.
In addition to the discount
system, NSA offers much more
to the student — life insurance,
international and national travel
services; to student groups —
talent booking agency, informa
tion service; and to the univer
sity community as a whole —
publications, leadership training
and conferences.
Mr. Massarenti said in the ar
ticle that if Stanford does not
withdraw from NSA, "it will
implicitly endorse NSA-CIA
ties." NSA no longer has any

ties with the CIA and therefore
cannot endorse what does not
exist.
The University of Michigan is
a poor example of student reac
tion to the NSA-CIA involve
ment. In my opinion, the Univer
sity of Michigan is a rather in
dependent and anti-establish
ment school to begin with, and I
suspect that the University of
Michigan would have ultimately
withdrawn from NSA whether
or not the NSA-CIA revelation
had come up.
Mr. Massarenti goes on to say
that "because Stanford and 380
other schools belong to the as
sociation, 'overseas students
shouldn't think it represents all
schools, like their student groups
do.'
If one interprets Mr. Massa
renti as meaning that overseas
student groups are representa
tive of the students in their
respective country and NSA is
not representative of the stu
dents in the United States, then
Mr. Massarenti is incorrect.
True, NSA is not the repre
sentative of all United States
students but by the same token,
the overseas student groups do
not represent all overseas stu
dents.
If the student body wishes to
turn its back on the opportu
nities which NSA provides, that
is its prerogative. However, I
feel that this decision should be
made only after Stanford stu
dents have learned what NSA is
and what it can do for them.

stein says, "Besides, look at
Stanford and ask, 'what have
they done for us' (bold face
mine) The answer is very little."
The question which Mr. Wein
stein, in fact, should have asked
himself and the question which
all Stanford students should ask

themselves is, "What has NSA
made available to us?" The ans
wer is — Quite a lot!
NSA makes available a pro
gram which provides students
with a 10-50% discount on mer
chandise, theatre tickets, cloth
ing, ets., etc., within the imme
diate campus area. I am in full
agreement with Mr. Weinstein's
contention that it is only through
cooperation with local merchants
that this discount system can, in
deed, become a reality.
But in addition to these local
discounts, NSA, by incorporating
all of these local systems, makes
available discounts throughout
the country to every member
school.
Just as important and perhaps
more so is the fact that the struc
ture for such a discount system
is present and available through
NSA while the structure for the
proposed student union is non
existent. The goals are the same
but the time saved in instituting
the system by using the NSA
blue-print is, in itself, a good
reason why Stanford should re
main an NSA member.
In addition to the discount
system, NSA offers much more
to the student — life insurance,
international and national travel
services; to student groups —
talent booking agency, informa
tion service; and to the univer
sity community as a whole —
publications, leadership training
and conferences.
Mr. Massarenti said in the ar
ticle that if Stanford does not
withdraw from NSA, "it will
implicitly endorse NSA-CIA
ties." NSA no longer has any

ties with the CIA and therefore
cannot endorse what does not
exist.
The University of Michigan is
a poor example of student reac
tion to the NSA-CIA involve
ment. In my opinion, the Univer
sity of Michigan is a rather in
dependent and anti-establish
ment school to begin with, and I
suspect that the University of
Michigan would have ultimately
withdrawn from NSA whether
or not the NSA-CIA revelation
had come up.
Mr. Massarenti goes on to say
that "because Stanford and 380
other schools belong to the as
sociation, 'overseas students
shouldn't think it represents all
schools, like their student groups
do.'
If one interprets Mr. Massa
renti as meaning that overseas
student groups are representa
tive of the students in their
respective country and NSA is
not representative of the stu
dents in the United States, then
Mr. Massarenti is incorrect.
True, NSA is not the repre
sentative of all United States
students but by the same token,
the overseas student groups do
not represent all overseas stu
dents.
If the student body wishes to
turn its back on the opportu
nities which NSA provides, that
is its prerogative. However, I
feel that this decision should be
made only after Stanford stu
dents have learned what NSA is
and what it can do for them.

As a typical Stanford student,
I do not usually take an active
interest in campus politics, but
after reading the article of Octo
ber 10 "University of Michigan
Drops NSA Ties," I could not
help but comment on the utter
ridiculousness of the arguments
as to why Stanford should with
draw from the NSA.
To begin with NSA does not
exist to cater to member student
bodies. The essence of NSA is
that it provides an adaptable
structure through which mem
ber student bodies may estab
lish educational and service pro
grams on their own campuses.
The basic fact that must be
recognized is that the national
staff can only make these pro
grams, information and advice
available to the campuses, the
job of breathing life into these
programs can only be accom
plished through the efforts of
the students themselves.
The major reason that NSA
has not been of continuing bene
fit to Stanford is that Stanford
students have not had sufficient
interest in NSA or its programs.
It seems that what Mr. Wein
stein is saying is that since NSA
will not hand us anything that
we want on a silver platter, then
we should get out.
Later in the article, Mr. Wein

Stanford and ask, 'what have

blue-print is, in itself, a good
reason why Stanford should re
main an NSA member.
In addition to the discount
system, NSA offers much more
to the student — life insurance,
international and national travel
services; to student groups —
talent booking agency, informa
tion service; and to the univer
sity community as a whole —
publications, leadership training
and conferences.
Mr. Massarenti said in the ar
ticle that if Stanford does not
withdraw from NSA, "it will
implicitly endorse NSA-CIA
ties." NSA no longer has any

ties with the CIA and therefore
cannot endorse what does not
exist.
The University of Michigan is
a poor example of student reac
tion to the NSA-CIA involve
ment. In my opinion, the Univer
sity of Michigan is a rather in
dependent and anti-establish
ment school to begin with, and I
suspect that the University of
Michigan would have ultimately
withdrawn from NSA whether
or not the NSA-CIA revelation
had come up.
Mr. Massarenti goes on to say
that "because Stanford and 380
other schools belong to the as
sociation, 'overseas students
shouldn't think it represents all
schools, like their student groups
do.'
If one interprets Mr. Massa
renti as meaning that overseas
student groups are representa
tive of the students in their
respective country and NSA is
not representative of the stu
dents in the United States, then
Mr. Massarenti is incorrect.
True, NSA is not the repre
sentative of all United States
students but by the same token,
the overseas student groups do
not represent all overseas stu
dents.
If the student body wishes to
turn its back on the opportu
nities which NSA provides, that
is its prerogative. However, I
feel that this decision should be
made only after Stanford stu
dents have learned what NSA is
and what it can do for them.

As a typical Stanford student,
I do not usually take an active
interest in campus politics, but
after reading the article of Octo
ber 10 "University of Michigan
Drops NSA Ties," I could not
help but comment on the utter
ridiculousness of the arguments
as to why Stanford should with
draw from the NSA.
To begin with NSA does not
exist to cater to member student
bodies. The essence of NSA is
that it provides an adaptable
structure through which mem
ber student bodies may estab
lish educational and service pro
grams on their own campuses.
The basic fact that must be
recognized is that the national
staff can only make these pro
grams, information and advice
available to the campuses, the
job of breathing life into these
programs can only be accom
plished through the efforts of
the students themselves.
The major reason that NSA
has not been of continuing bene
fit to Stanford is that Stanford
students have not had sufficient
interest in NSA or its programs.
It seems that what Mr. Wein
stein is saying is that since NSA
will not hand us anything that
we want on a silver platter, then
we should get out.
Later in the article, Mr. Wein
stein says, "Besides, look at
Stanford and ask, 'what have
they done for us' (bold face
mine) The answer is very little."
The question which Mr. Wein
stein, in fact, should have asked
himself and the question which
all Stanford students should ask

themselves is, "What has NSA
made available to us?" The ans
wer is — Quite a lot!
NSA makes available a pro
gram which provides students
with a 10-50% discount on mer
chandise, theatre tickets, cloth
ing, ets., etc., within the imme
diate campus area. I am in full
agreement with Mr. Weinstein's
contention that it is only through
cooperation with local merchants
that this discount system can, in
deed, become a reality.
But in addition to these local
discounts, NSA, by incorporating
all of these local systems, makes
available discounts throughout
the country to every member
school.
Just as important and perhaps
more so is the fact that the struc
ture for such a discount system
is present and available through
NSA while the structure for the
proposed student union is non
existent. The goals are the same
but the time saved in instituting
the system by using the NSA
blue-print is, in itself, a good
reason why Stanford should re
main an NSA member.
In addition to the discount
system, NSA offers much more
to the student — life insurance,
international and national travel
services; to student groups —
talent booking agency, informa
tion service; and to the univer
sity community as a whole —
publications, leadership training
and conferences.
Mr. Massarenti said in the ar

withdraw from NSA, "it will
implicitly endorse NSA-CIA
ties." NSA no longer has any

ties with the CIA and therefore
cannot endorse what does not
