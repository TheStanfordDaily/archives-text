The Black Power movement
has become associated in Amer
ican minds with the big city and
H. Rapp Brown. It is often
viewed exclusively as a destruc
tive force that broke into the
process of gradual improvement
that grew out of the civil rights
movement.
But this conception of Black
Power leaves out most of the
story. The press is quick to ex
ploit every act of violence, but
it rarely gets around to describ
ing the growth of a new self
respect and social awareness
that constitutes the center of
the Black Power movement.
In East Palo Alto last summer
constructive Black Power was
demonstrated in the Ravens

wood Teen Project. Black orga
nizers presented this program to
the War on Poverty as an alter
native to the Upward Bound
project which had been rejected
in the spring.
The Teen Project was notable
first of all because it was black
from top to bottom. Whites
were used only incidentally
where there was a shortage of
black man power.
In the second place, none of
the $50,000 in funds supplied to
it went into the pockets of adult
administrators. The project used
its money to hire about 200 East
Palo Alto teenagers.
Chance To Respond
These young people attended
three hours of classes in the

morning. Besides practicing
ic math and reading skills they
received instruction in Black
History, Black Culture, urban
politics, and community organi
zation.
Electives in creative writing,
sculpture, and other art forms
were offered to allow the young
people to respond in their own
ways to their cultural heritage.
The emphasis throughout the
program was on the proud black
man in the past and the present,
and his struggle against white
racism.
Fighting For Dignity
The heroes are not the "Un
cle Toms" that made good in
the white man's world, but men
like Nat Turner, Marcus Garvey,
and Malcolm X who fought for
the dignity and independence of
men of color everywhere.
The 200 teenagers spent their
afternoons with groups of pre
school children at homes all over
East Palo Alto. They taught
them the basic of reading and
phonics in order to give them a
head start at the beginning of
their formal education. The
young people also informed the
children's parents of community
political activities.
The teens learned from their
work and their studies that
black people could run their own
lives and their own communi
ties in their own way and that
they had been doing just this
throughout history. From this
realization grew an unavoidable
indignation at the present
powerlessness of black people in
America.
This consciousness of black

dignity and the injustices of
white society is the essence of
Black Power.
It is a destructive force when
it comes into conflict with un
yielding white structures and is
then led by frustration to out
bursts of violence.
But within black communities
like East Palo Alto it is produc
ing a new organization and
sense of purpose which in turn
are forming a dynamic society
pushing for political and eco
nomic self-determination.
Reverse Attitude
Black Power can be accused
of racism because it is building
self-esteem along racial lines,
but this is only a natural re
sponse to centuries of racial dis
crimination.
White liberals may theorize
about the meaninglessness of
color, but black leaders are deal
ing with the hard fact of men
who are ashamed of their black
ness.
The remedy for the ghetto is
a bold reversal of this negative
attitude, and that is what hap
pened in East Palo Alto last
summer, that's what happens
every time Muhammad Ali says,
"I'm black; I'm beautiful", that's
what happens when H. Rap p
Brown says they're going to
take what whitey owes them in
back wages.
It is the responsibility of
white society to understand the
new pride of black men and to
release its grasp on the political,
economic, and educational con
trols that have kept the ghet
toes down. Refusal to change
can only lead to more violence.

about the meaninglessness of
color, but black leaders are deal

who are ashamed of their black
ness.
The remedy for the ghetto is
a bold reversal of this negative
attitude, and that is what hap
pened in East Palo Alto last
summer, that's what happens
every time Muhammad Ali says,
"I'm black; I'm beautiful", that's
what happens when H. Rap p
Brown says they're going to
take what whitey owes them in
back wages.
It is the responsibility of
white society to understand the
new pride of black men and to
release its grasp on the political,
economic, and educational con
trols that have kept the ghet
toes down. Refusal to change
can only lead to more violence.
The Black Power movement
has become associated in Amer
ican minds with the big city and
H. Rapp Brown. It is often
viewed exclusively as a destruc
tive force that broke into the
process of gradual improvement
that grew out of the civil rights
movement.
But this conception of Black
Power leaves out most of the
story. The press is quick to ex
ploit every act of violence, but
it rarely gets around to describ
ing the growth of a new self
respect and social awareness
that constitutes the center of
the Black Power movement.
In East Palo Alto last summer
constructive Black Power was
demonstrated in the Ravens

wood Teen Project. Black orga
nizers presented this program to
the War on Poverty as an alter
native to the Upward Bound
project which had been rejected
in the spring.
The Teen Project was notable
first of all because it was black
from top to bottom. Whites
were used only incidentally
where there was a shortage of
black man power.
In the second place, none of
the $50,000 in funds supplied to
it went into the pockets of adult
administrators. The project used
its money to hire about 200 East
Palo Alto teenagers.
Chance To Respond
These young people attended
three hours of classes in the

morning. Besides practicing
ic math and reading skills they
received instruction in Black
History, Black Culture, urban
politics, and community organi
zation.
Electives in creative writing,
sculpture, and other art forms
were offered to allow the young
people to respond in their own
ways to their cultural heritage.
The emphasis throughout the
program was on the proud black
man in the past and the present,
and his struggle against white
racism.
Fighting For Dignity
The heroes are not the "Un
cle Toms" that made good in
the white man's world, but men
like Nat Turner, Marcus Garvey,
and Malcolm X who fought for
the dignity and independence of
men of color everywhere.
The 200 teenagers spent their
afternoons with groups of pre
school children at homes all over
East Palo Alto. They taught
them the basic of reading and
phonics in order to give them a
head start at the beginning of
their formal education. The
young people also informed the
children's parents of community
political activities.
The teens learned from their
work and their studies that
black people could run their own
lives and their own communi
ties in their own way and that
they had been doing just this
throughout history. From this
realization grew an unavoidable
indignation at the present
powerlessness of black people in
America.
This consciousness of black

dignity and the injustices of
white society is the essence of
Black Power.
It is a destructive force when
it comes into conflict with un
yielding white structures and is
then led by frustration to out
bursts of violence.
But within black communities
like East Palo Alto it is produc
ing a new organization and
sense of purpose which in turn
are forming a dynamic society
pushing for political and eco
nomic self-determination.

of racism because it is building
self-esteem along racial lines,

indignation at the present
powerlessness of black people in
America.
This consciousness of black

dignity and the injustices of
white society is the essence of
Black Power.
It is a destructive force when
it comes into conflict with un
yielding white structures and is
then led by frustration to out
bursts of violence.
But within black communities
like East Palo Alto it is produc
ing a new organization and
sense of purpose which in turn
are forming a dynamic society
pushing for political and eco
nomic self-determination.
Reverse Attitude
Black Power can be accused
of racism because it is building
self-esteem along racial lines,
but this is only a natural re
sponse to centuries of racial dis
crimination.
White liberals may theorize
about the meaninglessness of
color, but black leaders are deal
ing with the hard fact of men
who are ashamed of their black
ness.
The remedy for the ghetto is
a bold reversal of this negative
attitude, and that is what hap
pened in East Palo Alto last
summer, that's what happens
every time Muhammad Ali says,
"I'm black; I'm beautiful", that's
what happens when H. Rap p
Brown says they're going to
take what whitey owes them in
back wages.
It is the responsibility of
white society to understand the
new pride of black men and to
release its grasp on the political,
economic, and educational con
trols that have kept the ghet
toes down. Refusal to change
can only lead to more violence.
