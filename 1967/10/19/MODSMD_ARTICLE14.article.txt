## 1968 Pennant: Dugout Talk 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—"Good after
noon, ladies and gentlemen. This
is Curt Howdy speaking to you
from the White House Stadium
in Washington, D.C. Well, 1967
has been a whale of a baseball
season and it's time we started
to look into the future and see
what 1968 has to offer. Seated
with me here in the box is
Lyn Johnson, playing manager
of the American Patriots, the
team that everyone had put their
hopes on, but which finished
badly at the end of the season.
"Lyn, there seems to be a
lot of discontent on the team,
and there is even some talk of
firing you and getting a new
manager. How do you feel about
this?"
"Curt, Ah always felt a base
ball team was like a family. We
reserve the right to express our
selves freely, but when we com' 1
to finding someone better in
the kitchen that we would like
to trade with someone else, it's
another matter."
"Lyn, why do you think the
Americans are in so much
trouble?"
"Ah can't rightly say. Ah in
herited a very difficult situation
when Ah took over as manager,
and all Ah'm doing is carrying
out the policies of previous man
agers. Everyone has a different
solution to the problem. There
are some who want me to hit
harder. There are others who
want me to concentrate on pitch
ing, and there are others who
don't want me to play ball at all.
"But, Ah'm the manager, and
Ah have to make the final deci
sion."
"They say one of the reasons
your team isn't doing very well
is that the people think you're
throwing too many curve balls.
What do you have to say to
that?'"
"Ah've been throwing them
straight over the plate, and Ah
think that people who say things
like that are only giving aid and
comfort to the other league. Ah
don't mind dissent, but how do
you think the other league feels
when they read about the criti
cism of the way Ah'm managing
the ball club?"
"Lyn, it has been said that one

of the reasons the team is not
getting support is because of
your inability to defeat the
North Vietnam Raiders. You've
been playing them now for four
years and it's still a tie ball
game."
"Our chances against the Raid
ers have never looked better. If
it weren't for us, the Saigon De
fenders would be in the cellar
right now. We're hitting the
Raiders and hitting them hard.
What are we supposed to do,
pack up our bats and go home?"
Well, Lyn, your option is
up next year and in a recent
poll of the fans you seem to be
running behind such would-be
managers as Nelly Rockefeller,
Ron Reagan, Chuck Percy and
Milhouse Nixon. Aren't you wor
ried?"
"Ah never put any truck in
polls. Ah've done more for the
fans than any manager in his
tory. Ah've taken care of the
old fans. Ah've taken care of the
Negro fans. Ah've taken care of
the fans that live in the cities.
Ah've beautified the stadium.
Ah've provided parking for busi
ness executives. Ah've given em
ployment to the people. And
Ah've worked hard to make this
the best team that money can
buy. And the fans are going to
remember that on option day."
"One more question, Lyn, and
then I'll let you go back to fig
uring out how you're going to
win next year. There's a young
player on your team named Bob
by Kennedy, and there are some
people who are talking about
him as the new manager. What
about that?"
"Bobby Kennedy has never
played on my team."
