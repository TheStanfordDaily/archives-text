THERE ARE NO BAD TEACHERS;
THERE ARE ONLY BAD STUDENTS
The academic year has only just begun and already
one thing is clear: you're not ready for college.
What, then, should you do? Should you throw up your
hands and quit? I say no! I say you must attack, grapple,
cope! I say America did not become the world's leader in
motel construction and kidney transplants by running
away from a fight!
To the question then: You say you're not ready for col
lege. You're too green, too naive. You lack maturity.
Okay, the answer is simple: get mature. How? Well
sir, to achieve maturity you need two things:
a) a probing mind;
b) a vest.
A probing mind will be quickly yours if you'll remem
ber that education consists not of answers but of ques
tions. Blindly accepting information and dumbly
memorizing data is high school stuff. In college you don't
just accept. You dispute, you push, you pry, you chal
lenge. If, for instance, your physics prof says, "E equals
mc squared," don't just write it down. Say to the prof,
"Why?"
This will show him two things:
a) Your mind is a keen, thrusting instrument.
b) You are in the wrong major.
Ask questions, questions, and more questions. That is
the essence of maturity, the heart and liver of education.
Nothing will more quickly convince the teachers that you
are of college calibre. And the tougher your questions,
the better. Come to class with queries that dart and flash,
that make unexpected sallies into uncharted territory.
Ask things which have never been asked before, like
"How tall was Nietzsche?" and "Did the Minotaur have
ticks? If so, were they immortal?" and "How often did
Pitt the Elder shave?"

(Incidentally, you may never know the complete an
swer to Pitt the Elder's shaving habits, but of one thing
you can be positive: no matter how often he shaved and
no matter what blades he used, he never enjoyed the
shaving comfort that you do. I am assuming, of course,
that you use Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, a
logical assumption to make when one is addressing col
lege men—which is to say men of perspicacity, discrimi
nation, wit, taste, cognizance, and shrewdness—for
Personna is a blade to please the perspicacious, delight
the discriminating, win the witty, tickle the tasteful,
coddle the cognizer, and shave the shrewd.
(I bring up Personna Super Stainless Steel Rlades be
cause the makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel
Blades pay me to write this column, and they are in
clined to sulk if I omit to mention their product. I would
not like to see them unhappy, the makers of Personna,
for they are fine ruddy men, fond of morris dancing and
home brewed root beer, and they make a blade that
shaves closely and cleanly, nicklessly and hacklessly, and
is sharp and gleaming and durable and available both in
double-edge style and Injector style.
(And from these same bounteous blademakers comes
Burma-Shave, regular or menthol, a lather that out
lathers other lathers, brother. So if you'd rather lather
better, and soak your whiskers wetter, Burma-Shave's
your answer.)
But 1 digress. We have now solved the problem of
maturity. In subsequent columns we'll take up other is
sues, equally burning. Since 1953 when this column first
started running in your campus paper, we've tackled
such thorny questions as "Can a student of 19 find hap
piness with an economics professor of 90?" and "Should
capital punishment for pledges be abolished?" and "Are
room-mates sanitary?" Be assured that in this, our 14th
year, we will not be less bold.

The makers of Personna Super Stainless Sleel lllades
(double-edge or Injerlor) and Burma-Shave (regular
or menthol) are pleased (or apprehensive) to bring you
another year of Max Shulman's uninhibited, uncen
sored column.
