# Letters To The Editor
## Unpeople Are Ruining The People's System 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have just read The Daily of
Wednesday, October 18th. After
having finished puking my guts
out, I can now sit down, stop
shaking, and write.
But, "what do I say?", I ask
myself. "What, if anything, is
appropriate in the face of beat
en skulls, enraged screams, and
a suddenly militant student
rhetoric?" It is as if, all of a
sudden, all about us has col
lapsed into a regressive insanity.
And what, or should I ask
who, is to be blamed? I shiver
to think of it, and I, in all hon
esty, almost puke again as I
write it—for the most sacred
objects in the world have
brought this situation about —
PEOPLE.
The "system" that Karin Koo
nan says "we've got to destroy"
—it is a people's system (al
though many of the self-right
eous would hasten to argue lest
they somehow be placed on the
same spectrum with the "inhu
man systematizers"); neverthe
less, they are people. Those of
The Resistance, those who got
their skulls caved in as their
eyes were blinded with tear-gas
—they are people. Those who
watched—yes, even those who
taunted demonstrators — they
are people. The "haughty wom
an in a green scarf on the third
level of the parking lot building"
—she is a people.
Becoming 'Unpeople'
And yet, all of these people
seem to be disintegrating into
an "unpeople"-like state. And
the whole process slams at those
few precious tidbits that I cling
to and call my basic beliefs:
(1) Love is the single most
important word in the Human
language.
(2) People are basically good.
(3) Humankind is evolving
toward a state where he may
someday be a completely social
ized animal and possess all of
the psychic and ethical necessi
ties for this socialization.
(4) Openness and the desire
and ability to communicate can
lead only to understanding.
Simple as they may be, these
I like to call a part of me.
But, when I read of Oakland,
when I read the "knifiings" in
The Daily that go under the
phrase "Letters to the Editor"—
I have to wonder. Am I that
naive? Am I that overly-optimis
tic? overly-idealistic?
Please don't tell me that "we
have tried talking, and it didn't
work, so now . . ."—for there is
nothing that will convince me
that violence in pursuit of non
violence can be justified. To me.

that is just as warped as the
Crusaders who held their cross
es high, saying "Let us kill these
barbarians in the name of the
Lord." All that this does is set
up two teams, and there is noth
ing more natural when two
teams face each other than that
there be battle waged.
And "battle" does not equal
non-violence, "battle" does not
equal harmony. You can scream
at me all you want about "fight
ing fire with fire" being a neces
sity in this situation, but I can
not buy it.
You can wring the neck of
that hawk for as long as you
want, and, though it may die
and thereby make you a killer,
it will not turn into a dove.
There have been cases, however,
of hawks being tamed into a
dove-like state.
Be Human
Perhaps I am slipping into
the same type of dogmatism
which I so bitterly dislike; per
haps I am presenting a point of
view which is far too moderate
or passive for many of you to
accept—l don't know. I am as
frustrated as you are; I neither
know where to turn to find the
solution.
I can see you all pulling out
your sharpened pens, ready to
carve your rebuttal into tomor
row's issue. I don't give a damn.
I have said what I am thinking,
as mixed-up and dull-penned as
it is—so let it be attacked.
All I know is that I am ill,
physically ill. I want to run up
and down the avenues of the
world and shout, "Things, look
at us; we are indeed all people
—now let us take the next big
step — let us be Human. All
of us . . . You and me."

• Who's Responsible?
Editor, The Daily:
I too deplore the incidents of
unnecessary police brutality in
Oakland.
But let's be honest: would
those who are complaining most
loudly have been more satisfied
if the police had behaved non
violently, humanely? The conse
quences of that would have
been: better P.R. for the police,
less poignant symbolic effect for
the protest, no martyrs.
Those who organize or en
courage civil disobedience might
ask themselves:
(1) Does law-breaking win or
lose public support in this coun
try at this time?
(2) Am I, too, not responsible
for those who get hurt?

• Building Anarchy
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of 10-18-67, Mr.
Paine has expressed himself as
an idealist, par excellence. Like
so many extremists, whether
Left or Right, he has created for
himself an idyllic world which
he apparently believes is con
crete reality.
Mr. Paine feels that civil dis
obedience is not a "proper in
strument for social and/or polit
ical change." He suggests that
one must obey that law in ques
tion, even if it is unjust, until
it is changed.
But if any precedent is to be
taken by historical observation,
civil disobedience has been one
of the (if not the) primary meth
ods of initiating major change
in the law.
The alternatives Mr. Paine ha"
left of written and verbal pro
test (each in itself a modified
form of civil disobedience until
they have recourse in the
courts) have, historically speak
ing, invoked little major change
(here I stand on shaky grounds
— the ambiguity of the term
"change" presents itself as a
distinct problem; I would wel
come any qualified rebuttal or
affirmation of this observation.)
Look around carefully, Mr.
Paine. You say you are afraid of
anarchy, of a "state of society
in which no man can be suffi
ciently free of fear of his neigh
bor's aggressive tendencies . . ."
The principle of law and order
which you are so fond of is de
nied in many ways everyday:
some so subtly that they are
hardly recognizable as breaches
of the law; and, some so blatant
that the most illiterate are
aware of them. Look out, Mr.
Paine, there's anarchy in the air
—always has been, and prob
ably always will be.
During the past few years in
the U.S., anarchy has been some
what confined, but this is no in
dication that it will not break
out into revolution — yes, Mr.
Paine, that time when your
neighbors' "aggressive tenden
cies (will be allowed) to take
advantage of (your) many op
portunities for individual expres
s i on and accomplishment."
When this happens, your princi
ple of law and order, even if un
just, won't stand a chance.
Look around yourself, Mr.
Paine, you're living in an illu
sion.

Does our government today

Today the draft in our coun

the individual to make those
moral decisions as to whether

The 1967 draft law stipulates
that all men will serve in some
capacity in our military, as typ
is or infantryman according to
the discretion of the military.
Unless one is a member of an
institutional pacifist religion, he
is deprived of his moral right of
conscientious objection.
We believe that this is in clear
contradiction of our govern
ment's judgements at Nurem
berg. We believe that our gov
ernment's failure to recognize a
moral alternative to the draft
has forced persons of a particu
lar moral conviction to become
outlaws.
People who recognize the mor

must oppose military conscrip

• Go, Fuzz!
Editor, The Daily:
It was uplifting to note your
relatively objective reporting of
the incidents in Oakland. The
San Francisco press wasn't as
kind. Evidently, no Daily repre
sentatives were injured.
The peace keeping techniques
of the police, as reported, (I
wasn't there) were laudable. Let
all true supporters of current
Oakland police policy unite and
HELP YOUR FUZZ BUST A
HEAD TODAY. The same slo
gan (in different context) is
equally applicable to the SFPD.

• Double Standard
Editor, The Daily:
Candidate McCloskey's letter
to the Editor today was a
strange one; trying at one time
to please two diametrically op

posed groups, he ended up ex
pressing a double standard it is
a little hard to accept. I refer to
his simultaneous praise of the
Civil Rights marchers in the
South, who were violating the
law, and disapprobation of the
demonstrators in Oakland, be
cause they were violating the
law.
His theory is that it was all
right for the marchers to violate
the law because they knew it to
be unconstitutional. On the face
of it this is not technically true;
it is up to the Supreme Court
to declare a law unconstitution
al, and until it does it is just as
illegal to violate an unjust law
as a just one.
It would seem that any justi
fication for the marchers must
come, then, not legalistically but
rather on vague moral grounds
like equality of opportunity,
equality before the law, and
freedom of self-determination.

Surprisingly, however, one finds
that the Oakland demonstrations
can be justified on these same
tenuous grounds.
It would seem, then, that if
civil disobedience were justifia
ble in the South, it is equally
justifiable in Oakland.
On this issue, Mr. McCloskey
appears to have been out
thought even by the YAF, who
in their letter today presented a
backward but unusually consist
ent defense of the legal process.

• Double Standard
Editor, The Daily:
Candidate McCloskey's letter
to the Editor today was a
strange one; trying at one time
to please two diametrically op

posed groups, he ended up ex
pressing a double standard it is
a little hard to accept. I refer to
his simultaneous praise of the
Civil Rights marchers in the
South, who were violating the
law, and disapprobation of the
demonstrators in Oakland, be
cause they were violating the
law.
His theory is that it was all
right for the marchers to violate
the law because they knew it to
be unconstitutional. On the face
of it this is not technically true;
it is up to the Supreme Court
to declare a law unconstitution
al, and until it does it is just as
illegal to violate an unjust law
as a just one.
It would seem that any justi
fication for the marchers must
come, then, not legalistically but
rather on vague moral grounds
like equality of opportunity,
equality before the law, and
freedom of self-determination.

Surprisingly, however, one finds
that the Oakland demonstrations
can be justified on these same
tenuous grounds.
It would seem, then, that if
civil disobedience were justifia
ble in the South, it is equally
justifiable in Oakland.
On this issue, Mr. McCloskey
appears to have been out
thought even by the YAF, who
in their letter today presented a
backward but unusually consist
ent defense of the legal process.

Editor, The Daily:
I have just read The Daily of
Wednesday, October 18th. After
having finished puking my guts
out, I can now sit down, stop
shaking, and write.
But, "what do I say?", I ask
myself. "What, if anything, is
appropriate in the face of beat
en skulls, enraged screams, and
a suddenly militant student
rhetoric?" It is as if, all of a
sudden, all about us has col
lapsed into a regressive insanity.
And what, or should I ask
who, is to be blamed? I shiver
to think of it, and I, in all hon
esty, almost puke again as I
write it—for the most sacred
objects in the world have
brought this situation about —
PEOPLE.
The "system" that Karin Koo
nan says "we've got to destroy"
—it is a people's system (al
though many of the self-right
eous would hasten to argue lest
they somehow be placed on the
same spectrum with the "inhu
man systematizers"); neverthe
less, they are people. Those of
The Resistance, those who got
their skulls caved in as their
eyes were blinded with tear-gas
—they are people. Those who
watched—yes, even those who
taunted demonstrators — they
are people. The "haughty wom
an in a green scarf on the third
level of the parking lot building"
—she is a people.
Becoming 'Unpeople'
And yet, all of these people
seem to be disintegrating into
an "unpeople"-like state. And
the whole process slams at those
few precious tidbits that I cling
to and call my basic beliefs:
(1) Love is the single most
important word in the Human
language.
(2) People are basically good.
(3) Humankind is evolving
toward a state where he may
someday be a completely social
ized animal and possess all of
the psychic and ethical necessi
ties for this socialization.
(4) Openness and the desire
and ability to communicate can
lead only to understanding.
Simple as they may be, these
I like to call a part of me.
But, when I read of Oakland,
when I read the "knifiings" in
The Daily that go under the
phrase "Letters to the Editor"—
I have to wonder. Am I that
naive? Am I that overly-optimis
tic? overly-idealistic?
Please don't tell me that "we
have tried talking, and it didn't
work, so now . . ."—for there is
nothing that will convince me
that violence in pursuit of non
violence can be justified. To me.

that is just as warped as the
Crusaders who held their cross
es high, saying "Let us kill these
barbarians in the name of the
Lord." All that this does is set
up two teams, and there is noth
ing more natural when two
teams face each other than that
there be battle waged.
And "battle" does not equal
non-violence, "battle" does not
equal harmony. You can scream
at me all you want about "fight
ing fire with fire" being a neces
sity in this situation, but I can
not buy it.
You can wring the neck of
that hawk for as long as you
want, and, though it may die
and thereby make you a killer,
it will not turn into a dove.
There have been cases, however,
of hawks being tamed into a
dove-like state.
Be Human
Perhaps I am slipping into
the same type of dogmatism
which I so bitterly dislike; per
haps I am presenting a point of
view which is far too moderate
or passive for many of you to

frustrated as you are; I neither
know where to turn to find the
solution.
I can see you all pulling out
your sharpened pens, ready to
carve your rebuttal into tomor
row's issue. I don't give a damn.
I have said what I am thinking,
as mixed-up and dull-penned as
it is—so let it be attacked.
All I know is that I am ill,
physically ill. I want to run up

step — let us be Human. All

• Building Anarchy
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of 10-18-67, Mr.
Paine has expressed himself as
an idealist, par excellence. Like
so many extremists, whether
Left or Right, he has created for
himself an idyllic world which
he apparently believes is con
crete reality.
Mr. Paine feels that civil dis
obedience is not a "proper in
strument for social and/or polit
ical change." He suggests that
one must obey that law in ques
tion, even if it is unjust, until
it is changed.
But if any precedent is to be
taken by historical observation,
civil disobedience has been one
of the (if not the) primary meth
ods of initiating major change
in the law.
The alternatives Mr. Paine ha"
left of written and verbal pro
test (each in itself a modified
form of civil disobedience until
they have recourse in the
courts) have, historically speak
ing, invoked little major change
(here I stand on shaky grounds
— the ambiguity of the term
"change" presents itself as a
distinct problem; I would wel
come any qualified rebuttal or
affirmation of this observation.)
Look around carefully, Mr.
Paine. You say you are afraid of
anarchy, of a "state of society
in which no man can be suffi
ciently free of fear of his neigh
bor's aggressive tendencies . . ."
The principle of law and order
which you are so fond of is de
nied in many ways everyday:
some so subtly that they are
hardly recognizable as breaches
of the law; and, some so blatant
that the most illiterate are
aware of them. Look out, Mr.
Paine, there's anarchy in the air
—always has been, and prob
ably always will be.
During the past few years in
the U.S., anarchy has been some
what confined, but this is no in
dication that it will not break
out into revolution — yes, Mr.
Paine, that time when your
neighbors' "aggressive tenden
cies (will be allowed) to take
advantage of (your) many op
portunities for individual expres
s i on and accomplishment."
When this happens, your princi
ple of law and order, even if un
just, won't stand a chance.
Look around yourself, Mr.
Paine, you're living in an illu
sion.

Editor, The Daily:
After World War II our gov

ernment affirmed the right and
responsibility of the citizen to
make decisions as to his own
participation in his govern
ment's military involvements. A
citizen's actions within the mili
tary are still governed by the
demands of common morality.
These affirmations were made at
Nuremberg.
Does our government today
give its citizens the right to
make these decisions?
Today the draft in our coun
try eliminates the possibility of
the individual to make those
moral decisions as to whether
or not he will participate in war.
The 1967 draft law stipulates
that all men will serve in some
capacity in our military, as typ
is or infantryman according to
the discretion of the military.
Unless one is a member of an
institutional pacifist religion, he
is deprived of his moral right of
conscientious objection.
We believe that this is in clear

civil disobedience has been one
of the (if not the) primary meth
ods of initiating major change
in the law.
The alternatives Mr. Paine ha"
left of written and verbal pro
test (each in itself a modified
form of civil disobedience until
they have recourse in the
courts) have, historically speak
ing, invoked little major change
(here I stand on shaky grounds
— the ambiguity of the term
"change" presents itself as a
distinct problem; I would wel
come any qualified rebuttal or
affirmation of this observation.)
Look around carefully, Mr.
Paine. You say you are afraid of
anarchy, of a "state of society
in which no man can be suffi
ciently free of fear of his neigh
bor's aggressive tendencies . . ."
The principle of law and order
which you are so fond of is de
nied in many ways everyday:
some so subtly that they are
hardly recognizable as breaches
of the law; and, some so blatant
that the most illiterate are
aware of them. Look out, Mr.
Paine, there's anarchy in the air
—always has been, and prob
ably always will be.
During the past few years in
the U.S., anarchy has been some
what confined, but this is no in
dication that it will not break
out into revolution — yes, Mr.
Paine, that time when your
neighbors' "aggressive tenden
cies (will be allowed) to take
advantage of (your) many op
portunities for individual expres

When this happens, your princi

Editor, The Daily:
After World War II our gov

ernment affirmed the right and
responsibility of the citizen to
make decisions as to his own
participation in his govern
ment's military involvements. A
citizen's actions within the mili
tary are still governed by the
demands of common morality.
These affirmations were made at
Nuremberg.
Does our government today
give its citizens the right to
make these decisions?
Today the draft in our coun
try eliminates the possibility of
the individual to make those
moral decisions as to whether
or not he will participate in war.
The 1967 draft law stipulates
that all men will serve in some
capacity in our military, as typ
is or infantryman according to
the discretion of the military.
Unless one is a member of an
institutional pacifist religion, he
is deprived of his moral right of
conscientious objection.
We believe that this is in clear
contradiction of our govern
ment's judgements at Nurem
berg. We believe that our gov
ernment's failure to recognize a
moral alternative to the draft
has forced persons of a particu

• Double Standard
Editor, The Daily:
Candidate McCloskey's letter
to the Editor today was a
strange one; trying at one time
to please two diametrically op

posed groups, he ended up ex
pressing a double standard it is
a little hard to accept. I refer to
his simultaneous praise of the
Civil Rights marchers in the
South, who were violating the
law, and disapprobation of the
demonstrators in Oakland, be
cause they were violating the
law.
His theory is that it was all
right for the marchers to violate
the law because they knew it to
be unconstitutional. On the face
of it this is not technically true;
it is up to the Supreme Court
to declare a law unconstitution
al, and until it does it is just as
illegal to violate an unjust law
as a just one.
It would seem that any justi
fication for the marchers must
come, then, not legalistically but
rather on vague moral grounds
like equality of opportunity,
equality before the law, and
freedom of self-determination.

Surprisingly, however, one finds
that the Oakland demonstrations
can be justified on these same
tenuous grounds.
It would seem, then, that if
civil disobedience were justifia
ble in the South, it is equally
justifiable in Oakland.
On this issue, Mr. McCloskey
appears to have been out
thought even by the YAF, who
in their letter today presented a
backward but unusually consist
ent defense of the legal process.

JAMES ALLISON

Editor, The Daily:
I have just read The Daily of
Wednesday, October 18th. After
having finished puking my guts
out, I can now sit down, stop
shaking, and write.
But, "what do I say?", I ask
myself. "What, if anything, is
appropriate in the face of beat
en skulls, enraged screams, and
a suddenly militant student
rhetoric?" It is as if, all of a
sudden, all about us has col
lapsed into a regressive insanity.
And what, or should I ask
who, is to be blamed? I shiver
to think of it, and I, in all hon
esty, almost puke again as I
write it—for the most sacred
objects in the world have
brought this situation about —
PEOPLE.
The "system" that Karin Koo
nan says "we've got to destroy"
—it is a people's system (al
though many of the self-right
eous would hasten to argue lest
they somehow be placed on the
same spectrum with the "inhu
man systematizers"); neverthe
less, they are people. Those of
The Resistance, those who got
their skulls caved in as their
eyes were blinded with tear-gas
—they are people. Those who
watched—yes, even those who
taunted demonstrators — they
are people. The "haughty wom
an in a green scarf on the third
level of the parking lot building"
—she is a people.
Becoming 'Unpeople'
And yet, all of these people
seem to be disintegrating into
an "unpeople"-like state. And
the whole process slams at those
few precious tidbits that I cling
to and call my basic beliefs:
(1) Love is the single most
important word in the Human
language.
(2) People are basically good.
(3) Humankind is evolving
toward a state where he may
someday be a completely social
ized animal and possess all of
the psychic and ethical necessi
ties for this socialization.
(4) Openness and the desire
and ability to communicate can
lead only to understanding.
Simple as they may be, these
I like to call a part of me.
But, when I read of Oakland,
when I read the "knifiings" in
The Daily that go under the
phrase "Letters to the Editor"—
I have to wonder. Am I that
naive? Am I that overly-optimis
tic? overly-idealistic?
Please don't tell me that "we
have tried talking, and it didn't
work, so now . . ."—for there is
nothing that will convince me
that violence in pursuit of non
violence can be justified. To me.

that is just as warped as the
Crusaders who held their cross
es high, saying "Let us kill these
barbarians in the name of the
Lord." All that this does is set
up two teams, and there is noth
ing more natural when two
teams face each other than that
there be battle waged.
And "battle" does not equal
non-violence, "battle" does not
equal harmony. You can scream
at me all you want about "fight
ing fire with fire" being a neces
sity in this situation, but I can
not buy it.
You can wring the neck of
that hawk for as long as you
want, and, though it may die
and thereby make you a killer,
it will not turn into a dove.
There have been cases, however,
of hawks being tamed into a
dove-like state.
Be Human
Perhaps I am slipping into
the same type of dogmatism
which I so bitterly dislike; per
haps I am presenting a point of
view which is far too moderate
or passive for many of you to
accept—l don't know. I am as
frustrated as you are; I neither
know where to turn to find the
solution.
I can see you all pulling out
your sharpened pens, ready to
carve your rebuttal into tomor
row's issue. I don't give a damn.
I have said what I am thinking,
as mixed-up and dull-penned as
it is—so let it be attacked.
All I know is that I am ill,
physically ill. I want to run up
and down the avenues of the
world and shout, "Things, look
at us; we are indeed all people
—now let us take the next big
step — let us be Human. All
of us . . . You and me."

• Who's Responsible?
Editor, The Daily:
I too deplore the incidents of
unnecessary police brutality in
Oakland.
But let's be honest: would
those who are complaining most
loudly have been more satisfied
if the police had behaved non
violently, humanely? The conse
quences of that would have
been: better P.R. for the police,
less poignant symbolic effect for
the protest, no martyrs.
Those who organize or en
courage civil disobedience might
ask themselves:
(1) Does law-breaking win or
lose public support in this coun
try at this time?
(2) Am I, too, not responsible
for those who get hurt?

Mr. Paine feels that civil dis

• Who's Responsible?
Editor, The Daily:
I too deplore the incidents of
unnecessary police brutality in
Oakland.
But let's be honest: would
those who are complaining most
loudly have been more satisfied
if the police had behaved non
violently, humanely? The conse
quences of that would have
been: better P.R. for the police,
less poignant symbolic effect for
the protest, no martyrs.
Those who organize or en
courage civil disobedience might
ask themselves:
(1) Does law-breaking win or
lose public support in this coun
try at this time?
(2) Am I, too, not responsible
for those who get hurt?

• Building Anarchy
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of 10-18-67, Mr.
Paine has expressed himself as
an idealist, par excellence. Like
so many extremists, whether
Left or Right, he has created for
himself an idyllic world which
he apparently believes is con
crete reality.
Mr. Paine feels that civil dis
obedience is not a "proper in
strument for social and/or polit
ical change." He suggests that
one must obey that law in ques
tion, even if it is unjust, until
it is changed.
But if any precedent is to be
taken by historical observation,
civil disobedience has been one
of the (if not the) primary meth
ods of initiating major change
in the law.
The alternatives Mr. Paine ha"
left of written and verbal pro
test (each in itself a modified
form of civil disobedience until
they have recourse in the
courts) have, historically speak
ing, invoked little major change
(here I stand on shaky grounds
— the ambiguity of the term
"change" presents itself as a
distinct problem; I would wel
come any qualified rebuttal or
affirmation of this observation.)
Look around carefully, Mr.
Paine. You say you are afraid of
anarchy, of a "state of society
in which no man can be suffi
ciently free of fear of his neigh
bor's aggressive tendencies . . ."
The principle of law and order
which you are so fond of is de
nied in many ways everyday:
some so subtly that they are
hardly recognizable as breaches
of the law; and, some so blatant
that the most illiterate are
aware of them. Look out, Mr.
Paine, there's anarchy in the air
—always has been, and prob
ably always will be.
During the past few years in
the U.S., anarchy has been some
what confined, but this is no in
dication that it will not break
out into revolution — yes, Mr.
Paine, that time when your
neighbors' "aggressive tenden
cies (will be allowed) to take
advantage of (your) many op
portunities for individual expres
s i on and accomplishment."
When this happens, your princi

• Double Standard
Editor, The Daily:
Candidate McCloskey's letter
to the Editor today was a
strange one; trying at one time
to please two diametrically op

posed groups, he ended up ex
pressing a double standard it is
a little hard to accept. I refer to
his simultaneous praise of the
Civil Rights marchers in the
South, who were violating the
law, and disapprobation of the
demonstrators in Oakland, be
cause they were violating the
law.
His theory is that it was all
right for the marchers to violate
the law because they knew it to
be unconstitutional. On the face
of it this is not technically true;
it is up to the Supreme Court
to declare a law unconstitution
al, and until it does it is just as
illegal to violate an unjust law
as a just one.
It would seem that any justi
fication for the marchers must
come, then, not legalistically but
rather on vague moral grounds
like equality of opportunity,
equality before the law, and
freedom of self-determination.

Surprisingly, however, one finds
that the Oakland demonstrations
can be justified on these same
tenuous grounds.
It would seem, then, that if
civil disobedience were justifia
ble in the South, it is equally
justifiable in Oakland.
On this issue, Mr. McCloskey
appears to have been out

in their letter today presented a

JAMES ALLISON

Editor, The Daily:
I have just read The Daily of
Wednesday, October 18th. After
having finished puking my guts
out, I can now sit down, stop
shaking, and write.
But, "what do I say?", I ask
myself. "What, if anything, is
appropriate in the face of beat
en skulls, enraged screams, and
a suddenly militant student
rhetoric?" It is as if, all of a
sudden, all about us has col
lapsed into a regressive insanity.
And what, or should I ask
who, is to be blamed? I shiver
to think of it, and I, in all hon
esty, almost puke again as I
write it—for the most sacred
objects in the world have
brought this situation about —
PEOPLE.
The "system" that Karin Koo
nan says "we've got to destroy"
—it is a people's system (al
though many of the self-right
eous would hasten to argue lest
they somehow be placed on the
same spectrum with the "inhu
man systematizers"); neverthe
less, they are people. Those of
The Resistance, those who got
their skulls caved in as their
eyes were blinded with tear-gas
—they are people. Those who
watched—yes, even those who
taunted demonstrators — they
are people. The "haughty wom
an in a green scarf on the third
level of the parking lot building"
—she is a people.
Becoming 'Unpeople'
And yet, all of these people
seem to be disintegrating into
an "unpeople"-like state. And
the whole process slams at those
few precious tidbits that I cling
to and call my basic beliefs:
(1) Love is the single most
important word in the Human
language.
(2) People are basically good.
(3) Humankind is evolving
toward a state where he may
someday be a completely social
ized animal and possess all of
the psychic and ethical necessi
ties for this socialization.
(4) Openness and the desire
and ability to communicate can
lead only to understanding.
Simple as they may be, these
I like to call a part of me.
But, when I read of Oakland,
when I read the "knifiings" in
The Daily that go under the
phrase "Letters to the Editor"—
I have to wonder. Am I that
naive? Am I that overly-optimis
tic? overly-idealistic?
Please don't tell me that "we
have tried talking, and it didn't
work, so now . . ."—for there is
nothing that will convince me
that violence in pursuit of non
violence can be justified. To me.

that is just as warped as the
Crusaders who held their cross
es high, saying "Let us kill these
barbarians in the name of the
Lord." All that this does is set
up two teams, and there is noth
ing more natural when two
teams face each other than that
there be battle waged.
And "battle" does not equal
non-violence, "battle" does not
equal harmony. You can scream
at me all you want about "fight

lapsed into a regressive insanity.
And what, or should I ask
who, is to be blamed? I shiver
to think of it, and I, in all hon

write it—for the most sacred

PEOPLE.
The "system" that Karin Koo

though many of the self-right

less, they are people. Those of
The Resistance, those who got
their skulls caved in as their

watched—yes, even those who
taunted demonstrators — they
are people. The "haughty wom

Becoming 'Unpeople'
And yet, all of these people
seem to be disintegrating into
an "unpeople"-like state. And
the whole process slams at those
few precious tidbits that I cling
to and call my basic beliefs:
(1) Love is the single most
important word in the Human
language.
(2) People are basically good.
(3) Humankind is evolving
toward a state where he may
someday be a completely social

the psychic and ethical necessi
ties for this socialization.
(4) Openness and the desire
and ability to communicate can
lead only to understanding.
Simple as they may be, these
I like to call a part of me.
But, when I read of Oakland,
when I read the "knifiings" in
The Daily that go under the
phrase "Letters to the Editor"—
I have to wonder. Am I that
naive? Am I that overly-optimis
tic? overly-idealistic?
Please don't tell me that "we

work, so now . . ."—for there is
nothing that will convince me
that violence in pursuit of non
violence can be justified. To me.

that is just as warped as the
Crusaders who held their cross
es high, saying "Let us kill these
barbarians in the name of the
Lord." All that this does is set
up two teams, and there is noth
ing more natural when two

there be battle waged.
And "battle" does not equal
non-violence, "battle" does not

You can wring the neck of

Editor, The Daily:
I too deplore the incidents of
unnecessary police brutality in
Oakland.
But let's be honest: would
those who are complaining most
loudly have been more satisfied
if the police had behaved non
violently, humanely? The conse
quences of that would have
been: better P.R. for the police,
less poignant symbolic effect for

• Building Anarchy
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of 10-18-67, Mr.
Paine has expressed himself as
an idealist, par excellence. Like
so many extremists, whether
Left or Right, he has created for
himself an idyllic world which
he apparently believes is con
crete reality.
Mr. Paine feels that civil dis
obedience is not a "proper in
strument for social and/or polit
ical change." He suggests that
one must obey that law in ques
tion, even if it is unjust, until
it is changed.
But if any precedent is to be
taken by historical observation,
civil disobedience has been one
of the (if not the) primary meth
ods of initiating major change
in the law.
The alternatives Mr. Paine ha"
left of written and verbal pro
test (each in itself a modified
form of civil disobedience until
they have recourse in the
courts) have, historically speak
ing, invoked little major change
(here I stand on shaky grounds
— the ambiguity of the term
"change" presents itself as a
distinct problem; I would wel
come any qualified rebuttal or
affirmation of this observation.)
Look around carefully, Mr.
Paine. You say you are afraid of
anarchy, of a "state of society
in which no man can be suffi
ciently free of fear of his neigh
bor's aggressive tendencies . . ."
The principle of law and order
which you are so fond of is de
nied in many ways everyday:
some so subtly that they are
hardly recognizable as breaches
of the law; and, some so blatant
that the most illiterate are
aware of them. Look out, Mr.
Paine, there's anarchy in the air
—always has been, and prob
ably always will be.
During the past few years in
the U.S., anarchy has been some
what confined, but this is no in
dication that it will not break
out into revolution — yes, Mr.
Paine, that time when your
neighbors' "aggressive tenden
cies (will be allowed) to take
advantage of (your) many op
portunities for individual expres
s i on and accomplishment."
When this happens, your princi

• Double Standard
Editor, The Daily:
Candidate McCloskey's letter
to the Editor today was a
strange one; trying at one time
to please two diametrically op

posed groups, he ended up ex
pressing a double standard it is
a little hard to accept. I refer to
his simultaneous praise of the
Civil Rights marchers in the
South, who were violating the
law, and disapprobation of the
demonstrators in Oakland, be
cause they were violating the
law.
His theory is that it was all
right for the marchers to violate
the law because they knew it to
be unconstitutional. On the face
of it this is not technically true;
it is up to the Supreme Court
to declare a law unconstitution
al, and until it does it is just as
illegal to violate an unjust law
as a just one.
It would seem that any justi
fication for the marchers must
come, then, not legalistically but
rather on vague moral grounds
like equality of opportunity,
equality before the law, and
freedom of self-determination.

Surprisingly, however, one finds
that the Oakland demonstrations
can be justified on these same
tenuous grounds.
It would seem, then, that if
civil disobedience were justifia
ble in the South, it is equally
justifiable in Oakland.
On this issue, Mr. McCloskey
appears to have been out
thought even by the YAF, who
in their letter today presented a
backward but unusually consist
ent defense of the legal process.

• Go, Fuzz!
Editor, The Daily:
It was uplifting to note your
relatively objective reporting of
the incidents in Oakland. The
San Francisco press wasn't as
kind. Evidently, no Daily repre
sentatives were injured.
The peace keeping techniques
of the police, as reported, (I
wasn't there) were laudable. Let
all true supporters of current
Oakland police policy unite and
HELP YOUR FUZZ BUST A
HEAD TODAY. The same slo
gan (in different context) is
equally applicable to the SFPD.

• Double Standard
Editor, The Daily:
Candidate McCloskey's letter
to the Editor today was a
strange one; trying at one time
to please two diametrically op

posed groups, he ended up ex
pressing a double standard it is
a little hard to accept. I refer to
his simultaneous praise of the
Civil Rights marchers in the
South, who were violating the
law, and disapprobation of the
demonstrators in Oakland, be
cause they were violating the
law.
His theory is that it was all
right for the marchers to violate
the law because they knew it to
be unconstitutional. On the face
of it this is not technically true;
it is up to the Supreme Court
to declare a law unconstitution
al, and until it does it is just as
illegal to violate an unjust law
as a just one.
It would seem that any justi
fication for the marchers must
come, then, not legalistically but
rather on vague moral grounds
like equality of opportunity,
equality before the law, and
freedom of self-determination.

Surprisingly, however, one finds
that the Oakland demonstrations
can be justified on these same
tenuous grounds.
It would seem, then, that if
civil disobedience were justifia
ble in the South, it is equally
justifiable in Oakland.
On this issue, Mr. McCloskey
appears to have been out
thought even by the YAF, who
in their letter today presented a
backward but unusually consist
ent defense of the legal process.

JAMES ALLISON

Editor, The Daily:
I have just read The Daily of
Wednesday, October 18th. After
having finished puking my guts
out, I can now sit down, stop
shaking, and write.
But, "what do I say?", I ask
myself. "What, if anything, is
appropriate in the face of beat
en skulls, enraged screams, and
a suddenly militant student
rhetoric?" It is as if, all of a
sudden, all about us has col
lapsed into a regressive insanity.
And what, or should I ask
who, is to be blamed? I shiver
to think of it, and I, in all hon
esty, almost puke again as I
write it—for the most sacred
objects in the world have
brought this situation about —
PEOPLE.
The "system" that Karin Koo
nan says "we've got to destroy"
—it is a people's system (al
though many of the self-right
eous would hasten to argue lest
they somehow be placed on the
same spectrum with the "inhu
man systematizers"); neverthe
less, they are people. Those of
The Resistance, those who got
their skulls caved in as their
eyes were blinded with tear-gas
—they are people. Those who
watched—yes, even those who
taunted demonstrators — they
are people. The "haughty wom
an in a green scarf on the third
level of the parking lot building"
—she is a people.
Becoming 'Unpeople'
And yet, all of these people
seem to be disintegrating into
an "unpeople"-like state. And
the whole process slams at those
few precious tidbits that I cling
to and call my basic beliefs:
(1) Love is the single most
important word in the Human
language.
(2) People are basically good.
(3) Humankind is evolving
toward a state where he may
someday be a completely social
ized animal and possess all of
the psychic and ethical necessi
ties for this socialization.
(4) Openness and the desire
and ability to communicate can
lead only to understanding.
Simple as they may be, these
I like to call a part of me.
But, when I read of Oakland,
when I read the "knifiings" in
The Daily that go under the
phrase "Letters to the Editor"—
I have to wonder. Am I that
naive? Am I that overly-optimis
tic? overly-idealistic?
Please don't tell me that "we
have tried talking, and it didn't
work, so now . . ."—for there is
nothing that will convince me
that violence in pursuit of non
violence can be justified. To me.

that is just as warped as the
Crusaders who held their cross
es high, saying "Let us kill these
barbarians in the name of the
Lord." All that this does is set
up two teams, and there is noth
ing more natural when two
teams face each other than that
there be battle waged.
And "battle" does not equal
non-violence, "battle" does not
equal harmony. You can scream
at me all you want about "fight
ing fire with fire" being a neces
sity in this situation, but I can
not buy it.
You can wring the neck of
that hawk for as long as you
want, and, though it may die
and thereby make you a killer,
it will not turn into a dove.
There have been cases, however,
of hawks being tamed into a
dove-like state.
Be Human
Perhaps I am slipping into
the same type of dogmatism
which I so bitterly dislike; per
haps I am presenting a point of
view which is far too moderate
or passive for many of you to
accept—l don't know. I am as
frustrated as you are; I neither
know where to turn to find the
solution.
I can see you all pulling out
your sharpened pens, ready to
carve your rebuttal into tomor
row's issue. I don't give a damn.
I have said what I am thinking,
as mixed-up and dull-penned as
it is—so let it be attacked.
All I know is that I am ill,
physically ill. I want to run up
and down the avenues of the
world and shout, "Things, look
at us; we are indeed all people
—now let us take the next big
step — let us be Human. All
of us . . . You and me."

• Who's Responsible?
Editor, The Daily:
I too deplore the incidents of
unnecessary police brutality in
Oakland.
But let's be honest: would
those who are complaining most
loudly have been more satisfied
if the police had behaved non
violently, humanely? The conse
quences of that would have
been: better P.R. for the police,
less poignant symbolic effect for
the protest, no martyrs.
Those who organize or en
courage civil disobedience might
ask themselves:
(1) Does law-breaking win or
lose public support in this coun
try at this time?
(2) Am I, too, not responsible
for those who get hurt?

• Building Anarchy
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of 10-18-67, Mr.
Paine has expressed himself as
an idealist, par excellence. Like
so many extremists, whether
Left or Right, he has created for
himself an idyllic world which
he apparently believes is con
crete reality.
Mr. Paine feels that civil dis
obedience is not a "proper in
strument for social and/or polit
ical change." He suggests that
one must obey that law in ques
tion, even if it is unjust, until
it is changed.
But if any precedent is to be
taken by historical observation,
civil disobedience has been one
of the (if not the) primary meth
ods of initiating major change
in the law.
The alternatives Mr. Paine ha"
left of written and verbal pro
test (each in itself a modified
form of civil disobedience until
they have recourse in the
courts) have, historically speak
ing, invoked little major change
(here I stand on shaky grounds
— the ambiguity of the term
"change" presents itself as a
distinct problem; I would wel
come any qualified rebuttal or
affirmation of this observation.)
Look around carefully, Mr.
Paine. You say you are afraid of
anarchy, of a "state of society
in which no man can be suffi
ciently free of fear of his neigh
bor's aggressive tendencies . . ."
The principle of law and order
which you are so fond of is de
nied in many ways everyday:
some so subtly that they are
hardly recognizable as breaches
of the law; and, some so blatant
that the most illiterate are
aware of them. Look out, Mr.
Paine, there's anarchy in the air
—always has been, and prob
ably always will be.
During the past few years in
the U.S., anarchy has been some
what confined, but this is no in
dication that it will not break
out into revolution — yes, Mr.
Paine, that time when your
neighbors' "aggressive tenden
cies (will be allowed) to take
advantage of (your) many op
portunities for individual expres
s i on and accomplishment."
When this happens, your princi
ple of law and order, even if un
just, won't stand a chance.
Look around yourself, Mr.
Paine, you're living in an illu
sion.

• Nurembeg Again
Editor, The Daily:
After World War II our gov

ernment affirmed the right and
responsibility of the citizen to
make decisions as to his own
participation in his govern
ment's military involvements. A
citizen's actions within the mili
tary are still governed by the
demands of common morality.
These affirmations were made at
Nuremberg.
Does our government today
give its citizens the right to
make these decisions?
Today the draft in our coun
try eliminates the possibility of
the individual to make those
moral decisions as to whether
or not he will participate in war.
The 1967 draft law stipulates
that all men will serve in some
capacity in our military, as typ
is or infantryman according to
the discretion of the military.
Unless one is a member of an
institutional pacifist religion, he
is deprived of his moral right of
conscientious objection.
We believe that this is in clear
contradiction of our govern
ment's judgements at Nurem
berg. We believe that our gov
ernment's failure to recognize a
moral alternative to the draft
has forced persons of a particu
lar moral conviction to become
outlaws.
People who recognize the mor
al commitment of Nuremberg
must oppose military conscrip
tion.
