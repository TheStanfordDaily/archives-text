# Sterling Gives Keynote At Wert Inauguration
## 
### MICHAEL MORTON 
Amidst all the pomp and pag
entry of the academic world, Dr.
Robert J. Wert was inaugurated
yesterday as the ninth president
of Mills College in Oakland.
Wert is the third consecutive
president of this women's col
lege to come from Stanford. The
others are Lynn Townsend
White and C. Easton Rothwell,
the retiring president.
Highlights of the proceedings
were the inauguration itself, ad
dresses by Wert and J. E. Wal
lace Sterling, a congratulatory
message from Gov. Reagan to
the new president, and the sur

prise conferral of an honorary
Doctorate of Humane Letters
upon Sterling.
In his keynote address, Ster
ling said, "Beset as we are today
by a war which is unpopular,
far away, and undeclared, by
problems which stem in no small
measure from a too-long-delayed
concern for the plight of the un
derprivileged, there is much for
cynicism to feed on."
Answer To Cynicism
Institutions of higher learn
ing, he continued, provide the
buffer and answer for this cyni
cism.
"What other institution is so
challenged by the idealism of
youth? What other has a lamp
of learning which can burn
brightly enough to shed the
light of historical perspective on
current problems, a perspective
which knowledge can best con
fer?
"And what is there other than
knowledge, both old and new,
that can move man further
toward his own fulfillment in
peace, plenty, and human dig
nity?
"The attainment of this goal
- -if it is attainable—is far, far,
distant, but a college or a uni
versity must have the courage
and constancy to keep this goal
in sight; otherwise it would be
tray its nature and its purpose."
Cumulative Criticism
It is easy for critics to attack
universities, Sterling noted, and
because they "enjoy the luxury
of self-appointment, they tend
to be numerous." Thus the faults
critics point out "are piled one
on top of the other until they
seem to obscure virtue, value, or
theme."
But there are three major
themes existing in higher edu
cation today, Sterling said, de
spite the diversity and variety
among universities and colleges.
There is the "theme of
strength," which permits young
men and women "to obtain the
education which their abilities
permit."
The second theme is academic
independence, universities' "most
precious asset." Finally, Sterl
ing said, there is "accomodation
to change."
Every knowledge explosion in
history "has made the status
quo insecure," he said. "It is in

secure today within our colleges
and universities. What has been
and what is are not good enough.
That is why so much attention
and effort is being directed to
accomodate new knowledge, new
numbers, and new methods by
curricular and other change."
And there is no uniformity, he
concluded. Each institution "ex
presses in its own idiom its own
commitment to the educational
process."
In his first address as presi
dent of Mills, Wert stated that
the college is distinctive in a
world of bureaucracy and IBM
cards by virtue of its small size,
eleven-to-one student-t each e r
ration, and non-coeducational
policy.
Coordinate Education
He mentioned the possibility
of establishing a coordinate col
lege for men at Mills, stating
that "coeducation is becoming
the vogue." However, he said
that he is "far from persuaded
that Mills should pursue men
that actively."
He noted that considerations
which would suggest a coordi
nate college at other educational
institutions, especially the fact
or of isolation ,are not applica
ble to Mills.
"Mills has a deserved tradi
tion of being independent . . .
We are not isolated, we have
never been isolated," he said. "I
have not yet heard one compel
ling academic argument for a
coordinate men's college."

the retiring president.
Highlights of the proceedings
were the inauguration itself, ad
dresses by Wert and J. E. Wal
lace Sterling, a congratulatory
message from Gov. Reagan to
the new president, and the sur

prise conferral of an honorary
Doctorate of Humane Letters
upon Sterling.
In his keynote address, Ster
ling said, "Beset as we are today
by a war which is unpopular,
far away, and undeclared, by
problems which stem in no small
measure from a too-long-delayed
concern for the plight of the un
derprivileged, there is much for
cynicism to feed on."
Answer To Cynicism
Institutions of higher learn
ing, he continued, provide the
buffer and answer for this cyni
cism.
"What other institution is so
challenged by the idealism of
youth? What other has a lamp
of learning which can burn
brightly enough to shed the
light of historical perspective on
current problems, a perspective
which knowledge can best con
fer?
"And what is there other than
knowledge, both old and new,
that can move man further
toward his own fulfillment in
peace, plenty, and human dig
nity?
"The attainment of this goal
- -if it is attainable—is far, far,
distant, but a college or a uni
versity must have the courage
and constancy to keep this goal
in sight; otherwise it would be
tray its nature and its purpose."
Cumulative Criticism
It is easy for critics to attack
universities, Sterling noted, and
because they "enjoy the luxury
of self-appointment, they tend
to be numerous." Thus the faults
critics point out "are piled one
on top of the other until they
seem to obscure virtue, value, or
theme."
But there are three major
themes existing in higher edu
cation today, Sterling said, de
spite the diversity and variety
among universities and colleges.
There is the "theme of
strength," which permits young
men and women "to obtain the
education which their abilities
permit."
The second theme is academic
independence, universities' "most
precious asset." Finally, Sterl
ing said, there is "accomodation
to change."
Every knowledge explosion in
history "has made the status
quo insecure," he said. "It is in

secure today within our colleges
and universities. What has been
and what is are not good enough.
That is why so much attention
and effort is being directed to
accomodate new knowledge, new
numbers, and new methods by
curricular and other change."
And there is no uniformity, he
concluded. Each institution "ex
presses in its own idiom its own
commitment to the educational
process."
In his first address as presi
dent of Mills, Wert stated that
the college is distinctive in a
world of bureaucracy and IBM
cards by virtue of its small size,
eleven-to-one student-t each e r
ration, and non-coeducational
policy.
Coordinate Education
He mentioned the possibility
of establishing a coordinate col
lege for men at Mills, stating
that "coeducation is becoming
the vogue." However, he said
that he is "far from persuaded
that Mills should pursue men
that actively."
He noted that considerations
which would suggest a coordi
nate college at other educational
institutions, especially the fact
or of isolation ,are not applica
ble to Mills.
"Mills has a deserved tradi
tion of being independent . . .
We are not isolated, we have
never been isolated," he said. "I
have not yet heard one compel
ling academic argument for a
coordinate men's college."
