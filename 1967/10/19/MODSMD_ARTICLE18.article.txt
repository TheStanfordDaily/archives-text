# Glubb Says USSR Won In Mideast
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
Sir John Glubb, commander
of Jordan's Arab Legion from
1938 to 1966 told a Dinkelspiel
audience last night that the Rus
sians had urged the Egyptians
to fight the Israelis even though
the Russians knew the Israelis

would win.
Glubb, a guest of George
Rentz of the Hoover Institution,
explained, "An Israeli victory
put the Egyptians on the spot.
As soon as the Egyptians were
defeated, and the United States
and Britain had knocked them
selves out by supporting Israel,
»only the Russians were left."
The Russians hoped an Is
raeli victory would block the
Suez Canal and lead Egypt to
seek greater Russian support.
The Soviet price is greater ac
tivity in the Arab world, he said,
pointing to the example of 50
Russian warships now based at
Alexandria, a former British
base.
Thus, Russian naval activity
in the Mediterranean Sea has
increased, and Western Europe
has been made vulnerable to
Russian influence by the loss of
the Suez Canal.
Tracing the history of the
Middle East since the seventh
century, Glubb concluded Egypt
is the key to world power. "A
great power in Egypt could
move into Africa, Asia, or Eu
rope. Or it could prevent any
body else from moving."
Glubb cited the rise of Mo
hammedism in the seventh cen
tury, and added, for 500 years
Europe lived in constant fear of
Arab imperialism."
Current difficulties in the Mid
dle East result from the British
Balfour Declaration of 1917, said
Glubb. The British, in that dec
laration, promised both a na
tional homeland for Jews in
Palestine and maintenance of
Arab Palestine.
As to why Britain would offer
such a contradictory policy,
Glubb explained, "It was be
lieved at the time that a con
cession to the Jews in Palestine
would bring the United States
into World War I."
