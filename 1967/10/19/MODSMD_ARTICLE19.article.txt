# Blue Blood Hoover Goes Way Back When
## 
### 
Among the ancestors of the
late President Herbert Hoover—
born 93 years ago—were two
governors of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony on his mother's side
and, in the paternal line, Swiss
immigrants who supplied
money, grain and soldiers for
the American Revolution.
These and other nuggets of
history, gleaned from a search
of 13 generations, are published
for the first time in "Genealogy
of the Herbert Hoover Family"
($lO hardbound, $8 paperback;
486 pp.), issued as Volume 30 of
its Bibliographical Series by
Stanford's Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace.
