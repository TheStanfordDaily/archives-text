# LASSU To Ponder Rules, NSA Tonight
## 
### 
The student legislature will
meet tonight to consider an over
haul of its committee system.
Also on LASSU's agenda is
a resolution to remove Stanford
from the National Student Asso
ciation (NSA).
The meeting, LASSU's second
of the year, will take place at
7:30 p.m. in room 320 in the geo
olgy corner of Quad.
Speaker Michael Weinstein
will propose an amendment to
the Associated Students by-laws
providing that all bills concern
ing money be referred directly
to the finance committee of
LASSU, without first appearing
on the floor. The finance com
mittee would then consider the
bill, amend it, and present it to
the entire legislature.
Hopes To Save Time
"This change is necessary be
cause we'll only be meeting once
every two weeks," Weinstein
said. "Sending bills directly to
the finance committee will save
a lot of time."
Another proposed by - laws
change will set up five "autono
mous committees" of the legis
lature, which will report on legi
slation and conduct investiga
tions assigned them by the rules
committee.
The by-laws currently specify
that the student affairs and ser
vices committee will have five
subcommittees. Weinstein wants
to change their status to full
committees, so they can report
directly to the legislature.
The proposed changes are part
of a program announced earlier
this year by Weinstein to trans
fer much of LASSU's work to a
simplified committee structure.
The by-laws amendments can
not be voted on by LASSU soon
er than one week after being
proposed, according to the As
sociated Students constitution.
They will require a two-thirds
vote for passage.
Weinstein will announce his
appointments to the three key
LASSU committees — rules, ju
dicial and student affairs — as

well as the five autonomous com
mittees.
Four other bills will be intro
duced concerning the fundamen
tal standard, honor code, and a
conflict of ASSU laws. They will
be referred to the judicial com
mittee, Weinstein said:
The NSA bill would transfer
to the general contingency fund
the $155 appropriated last May
for NSA dues. Also involved is
$1200 which was intended to be
appropriated for travel expenses
to the NSA convention, if Stan
ford remains a member.
The bill has the support of
Weinstein and ASSU Vice Pres
ident Cesare Massarenti.
