co-director of the program, said

need of North American and Eu
ropean companies for a high
level executive program with in
ternational outlook and multi
national faculty and student
body."
Pond said, "There is a lot to
be gained from exchange of
ideas, teaching, research, and
management education. And to
gether with that we need to be
aware of cultural differences to
conduct our business effectively
from one country to another."
The class will be divided into
groups of about five for course
study and discussion. Among the
problems to be studied are the
Common Market, Great Britain,

talks, doing business in commu
nist countries, and labor union
