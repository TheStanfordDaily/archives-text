Theater revivals of two one-act
plays from last season, Slawo
mir Mrozek's "Out at Sea" and
Paul Richards' "There Is a Meet
ing Place."
But this season when it is time
for curtain calls at the reper
tory theater, the curtain itself
may be taking bows. The new
est addition to stage equipment
is a hand-painted sectional cur
tain made from burlap sacks.
On loan from Mrs. Virginia
Holt, a South Pasadena artist
and Stanford alumna, the "cur
tain-in-residence" will be used
throughout the year in its pro
ductions.
The curtain is a show in it
self, a splashy patch-work of
100 gunny sacks, each having
its own name and face. With
kaleidoscopic vibrant hues and
hieroglyphic designs in acrylic
paints, the curtain provides it
self some eye-exercising enter
tainment. The curtain has been
exhibited in Newport Beach, and
in Pasadena.
The curtain's SRT debut has
yet to be scheduled, but Gerald
Hiken, director, says he hopes
to find a variety of uses for the
curtain in both Memorial Audi
torium and The Little Theater.
