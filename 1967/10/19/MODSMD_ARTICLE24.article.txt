Dick Weisner fired a long aer
ial to Fred Hornsbruck to lead
the Alpha Bis intramural touch
football team to a 6-0 win over
Poly Sci in a grad school battle
yesterday.
In other IM gridiron action,
the Industrial Engineering team
looked like the "Big Red Ma
chine" itself as it rolled to a 41-0
thumping of Beta Biz. Crothers
B spoiled a perfect afternoon for
Alpha Biz as Alpha Biz II fell
6-0.
Soto aced Durant 6-0, ATO
topped Chi Psi 13-6, the Phi
Kaps accepted a forfeit from
Beta Chi, and despite some
wrong-way driving after the
game, the DU's held on to their
14-0 win over the Fijis.
