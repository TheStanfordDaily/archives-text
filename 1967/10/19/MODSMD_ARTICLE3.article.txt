## Black Union Formed 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford's Black Student Un
ion, a seven-month old group
whose name, activities and atti
tude have changed to reflect
growing Negro militancy, has
started lifting its veil of secrecy.
The philosophy of the union,
which claims to represent "the
majority" of the approximately
100 Negro students at Stanford,
is summarized by senior Ted
Spearman, a member:
"Stanford is just as hostile to
black people as the rest of the
country—perhaps more hostile
because of its apathy. Apathy is
the worst form of hostility."
Many members and officers of
the union have strong black na
tionalist views, which will be
aired soon in a new magazine
called "Black on Black," to be
written and published by the un
ion.
No Demonstrations
The union has staged no dem
onstration nor made demands on
the University, as did its coun
terpart at San Jose State Col
lege recently. Art Wilson, a

sophomore, explained "We're
just making policy now."
Union Won't Talk
Beyond that, the union has
kept silent about its activities
and membership. Spearman, al
though he has written several
militant columns for The Daily,
asserted "The only people that
need to know about the union
are the people that are going to
be affected by it—the members.
We'll say just what we want to
say."
The union will not reveal how
many members it has, nor when
they meet, nor what ties they
have with other Negro organiza
tions, nor what contact they
have had with the University,
Warren Hayman, co-chairman,
has said emphatically that such
matters are nobody else's busi
ness.
Basketballer Organizes
But the organization's chair
man Art Harris, varsity basket
ball player and member of Del
ta Tau Delta, insists that "We
don't want to be a secret organi
zation."

Harris estimates there are 130
Negro students at Stanford. Ac
cording to Wilson, "They're all
members, except the ones that
are afraid they'll be called 'sub
versive' if they join."
Today the union comes into
the open by sponsoring a poetry
reading at 4:30 p.m. in Tresid
der, room 275 by members Art
Wilson, John Scott, Leroy Good
win and A1 Young.
Black On Black
Some of their writings will
appear in "Black on Black," the
magazine around which the un
ions seems to be centering its
energy. Under the editorship of
graduate student Dolores Mack,
it will be printed by the Stan
ford press and sold on campus.
Harris said the receipts from
sale of the first magazine will
go mostly toward paying for
another issue. But eventually
the union hopes to make enough
profit out of "Black on Black"
to fund a scholarship for East
Palo Alto youths or to help sup
port a day school there.
Providing a scholarship for a
Negro student from a nearby
community was the stated pur
pose of the Black Student Un
ion's predecessor, Interact, or
ganized in February.
Not Black Power
Don Miller, an organizer of
Interact, told The Daily in Feb
ruary that it was "not intended
to be a black power organiza
tion."
As the organization's mem
bership grew, its goals changed.

Earlier this month it filed a new
constitution with the Dean of
Student's office, under the name
Black Student Union.
The constitution sets up a
strongly centralized government
under a chairman elected by
members. It states that the un
ion will hold general meetings
"at least twice a month." Dues
are given as $1.50 per quarter,
and like any student organiza
tion, the union keeps its funds
with the Associated Students fi
nancial manager.
A "legislative committee" ap

pointed by the chairman has the
power to "appropriate funds for
publications, donations, social
activities and scholarships."
One Negro student, who asked
that his name not be used, said
he refused to join the union be
cause of its black nationalist
sentiments and now is afraid of
some reprisal to force him to
join. Some Negro students at
San Jose who charged that the
black nationalist organization
there exerted similar pressure
on them to join.

Black On Black
Some of their writings will
appear in "Black on Black," the
magazine around which the un
ions seems to be centering its
energy. Under the editorship of
graduate student Dolores Mack,
it will be printed by the Stan
ford press and sold on campus.
Harris said the receipts from
sale of the first magazine will
go mostly toward paying for
another issue. But eventually
the union hopes to make enough
profit out of "Black on Black"
to fund a scholarship for East
Palo Alto youths or to help sup
port a day school there.
Providing a scholarship for a
Negro student from a nearby
community was the stated pur
pose of the Black Student Un
ion's predecessor, Interact, or
ganized in February.
Not Black Power
Don Miller, an organizer of
Interact, told The Daily in Feb
ruary that it was "not intended
to be a black power organiza
tion."
As the organization's mem
bership grew, its goals changed.

Earlier this month it filed a new
constitution with the Dean of
Student's office, under the name
Black Student Union.
The constitution sets up a
strongly centralized government
under a chairman elected by
members. It states that the un
ion will hold general meetings
"at least twice a month." Dues
are given as $1.50 per quarter,
and like any student organiza
tion, the union keeps its funds
with the Associated Students fi
nancial manager.
A "legislative committee" ap

pointed by the chairman has the
power to "appropriate funds for
publications, donations, social
activities and scholarships."
One Negro student, who asked
that his name not be used, said
he refused to join the union be
cause of its black nationalist
sentiments and now is afraid of
some reprisal to force him to
join. Some Negro students at
San Jose who charged that the
black nationalist organization
there exerted similar pressure
on them to join.
Stanford's Black Student Un
ion, a seven-month old group
whose name, activities and atti
tude have changed to reflect
growing Negro militancy, has
started lifting its veil of secrecy.
The philosophy of the union,
which claims to represent "the
majority" of the approximately
100 Negro students at Stanford,
is summarized by senior Ted
Spearman, a member:
"Stanford is just as hostile to
black people as the rest of the
country—perhaps more hostile
because of its apathy. Apathy is
the worst form of hostility."
Many members and officers of
the union have strong black na
tionalist views, which will be
aired soon in a new magazine
called "Black on Black," to be
written and published by the un
ion.
No Demonstrations
The union has staged no dem
onstration nor made demands on
the University, as did its coun
terpart at San Jose State Col
lege recently. Art Wilson, a

sophomore, explained "We're
just making policy now."
Union Won't Talk
Beyond that, the union has
kept silent about its activities
and membership. Spearman, al
though he has written several
militant columns for The Daily,
asserted "The only people that
need to know about the union
are the people that are going to
be affected by it—the members.
We'll say just what we want to
say."
The union will not reveal how
many members it has, nor when
they meet, nor what ties they
have with other Negro organiza
tions, nor what contact they
have had with the University,
Warren Hayman, co-chairman,
has said emphatically that such
matters are nobody else's busi
ness.

ion will hold general meetings
"at least twice a month." Dues
are given as $1.50 per quarter,
and like any student organiza
tion, the union keeps its funds
with the Associated Students fi
nancial manager.
A "legislative committee" ap

pointed by the chairman has the
power to "appropriate funds for
publications, donations, social
activities and scholarships."
One Negro student, who asked
that his name not be used, said
he refused to join the union be
cause of its black nationalist
sentiments and now is afraid of
some reprisal to force him to
join. Some Negro students at
San Jose who charged that the
black nationalist organization
there exerted similar pressure
on them to join.
Stanford's Black Student Un
ion, a seven-month old group
whose name, activities and atti
tude have changed to reflect
growing Negro militancy, has
started lifting its veil of secrecy.
The philosophy of the union,
which claims to represent "the
majority" of the approximately
100 Negro students at Stanford,
is summarized by senior Ted
Spearman, a member:
"Stanford is just as hostile to
black people as the rest of the
country—perhaps more hostile
because of its apathy. Apathy is
the worst form of hostility."
Many members and officers of
the union have strong black na
tionalist views, which will be
aired soon in a new magazine
called "Black on Black," to be
written and published by the un
ion.
No Demonstrations
The union has staged no dem
onstration nor made demands on
the University, as did its coun
terpart at San Jose State Col
lege recently. Art Wilson, a

sophomore, explained "We're
just making policy now."
Union Won't Talk
Beyond that, the union has
kept silent about its activities
and membership. Spearman, al
though he has written several
militant columns for The Daily,
asserted "The only people that
need to know about the union
are the people that are going to
be affected by it—the members.
We'll say just what we want to
say."
The union will not reveal how
many members it has, nor when
they meet, nor what ties they
have with other Negro organiza
tions, nor what contact they
have had with the University,
Warren Hayman, co-chairman,
has said emphatically that such
matters are nobody else's busi
ness.
Basketballer Organizes
But the organization's chair
man Art Harris, varsity basket
ball player and member of Del
ta Tau Delta, insists that "We
don't want to be a secret organi
zation."

Harris estimates there are 130
Negro students at Stanford. Ac
cording to Wilson, "They're all
members, except the ones that
are afraid they'll be called 'sub
versive' if they join."
Today the union comes into
the open by sponsoring a poetry
reading at 4:30 p.m. in Tresid
der, room 275 by members Art
Wilson, John Scott, Leroy Good
win and A1 Young.
Black On Black
Some of their writings will
appear in "Black on Black," the
magazine around which the un
ions seems to be centering its
energy. Under the editorship of
graduate student Dolores Mack,
it will be printed by the Stan
ford press and sold on campus.
Harris said the receipts from
sale of the first magazine will
go mostly toward paying for
another issue. But eventually
the union hopes to make enough
profit out of "Black on Black"
to fund a scholarship for East
Palo Alto youths or to help sup
port a day school there.
Providing a scholarship for a
Negro student from a nearby
community was the stated pur
pose of the Black Student Un
ion's predecessor, Interact, or
ganized in February.
Not Black Power
Don Miller, an organizer of
Interact, told The Daily in Feb
ruary that it was "not intended
to be a black power organiza
tion."
As the organization's mem
bership grew, its goals changed.

Earlier this month it filed a new
constitution with the Dean of
Student's office, under the name
Black Student Union.
The constitution sets up a
strongly centralized government
under a chairman elected by
members. It states that the un
ion will hold general meetings
"at least twice a month." Dues
are given as $1.50 per quarter,
and like any student organiza
tion, the union keeps its funds
with the Associated Students fi
nancial manager.
A "legislative committee" ap

pointed by the chairman has the
power to "appropriate funds for
publications, donations, social
activities and scholarships."
