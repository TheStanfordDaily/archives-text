# Demonstrators Plan Course Of Protests
## 
### 
Stanford students debated yes
terday what form today's sche
duled anti-draft demonstration in
Oakland should take. The debate
was held informally at a White
Plaza noon rally sponsored by
the Anti-Draft Union (ADU).
The rally was highlighted by
the reading of a telegram of
sympathy from Hanoi.
"We are going to close down
the induction center," said ADU

spokesman Leonard Siegel, echo
ing the rallying cry of Tuesday's
bloody demonstration. But he
added, "We will have no aggres
sive violence."
As Siegel and others spoke, a
box was passed through the au
dience to collect money on be
half of Christopher Chase-Dunn,
a sociology graduate student ar
rested on assault charges Tues

day in Oakland and being held
in lieu of $550 bail.
Hanoi Telegrams
Rodney Gage read a telegram
from Hanoi addressed simply to
2269 Cooley Ave., East Palo Alto,
Cal., U.S.A., the address of the
Peace and Liberation Commune,
a local resistance group.
It began, "Very elated hearing
thousands of white [and] colored
youths wage large scale draft
resistance drive Oct 16 to 21 1967
burning or returning draft cards
strongly protesting against US
unjust war in SVN.
"SVN youths people struggle
for national independence peace
and social progress as did hero
ically American people two cen
turies ago."
The telegram brought ap
plause from the audience of
about 300. The gathering also
cheered the announcement, made
by one of the audience, that Oak
land had spent "$30,000 on cops"
Tuesday.
Bogart Lands Protesters
The discussion about tactics
developed soon after ADU leader
Richarrl Bogart told the crowd
Stanford's group of Tuesday
demonstrators was the "best or
ganized, best coordinated, best
prepared of any group there."
"It was small," he said, "but
I think it had strength beyond
its numbers."
Siegel stated today's demon
strators would be militant, as on
Tuesday, but that he and they
were not advocating violence,
just trying to close the induction
center.
Hanson Criticizes
Senior social-thought major
Mary Hanson, who was arrested
Monday and released Tuesday
night, said, "It is physically im
possible to close the induction
center and keep it closed."
