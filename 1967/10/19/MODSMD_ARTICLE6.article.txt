# Harris Arrested In Oakland Strife
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Dave Harris, Resistance leader
and former student body presi
dent, was arrested yesterday in
front of the Oakland Induction
Center as he led the third con
secutive day of anti-draft pro
tests.
Harris was charged with tres
passing, disturbing the peace,
and creating a public nuisance.
He has been released on $220 bail.
Sixty-four others were arrested
during the demonstration, most
of them for blocking the en
trance to the Induction Center.
According to Dr. Bruce Frank
lin of the Stanford English De
partment at Stanford, it was de
cided last night in Berkeley to
stage only a small demonstration
today at the Induction Center. A
much larger protest will take
place Friday; there will be no
sit-ins in that demonstration.
Dr. Franklin also said there
was to be a noon rally in White
Plaza today at which speakers
will discuss the protests.
The key to yesterday's protest
was nonviolence, as anti-draft

leaders strove to avoid a repiti
tion of Tuesday's bloodletting.
The 2,500 plus protesters re
sponded to the pleas of their
leaders and there were no inci
dents of physical violence.
Unlike yesterday there .were no
serious incidents.
"We don't want a repeat of yes
terday—we want to insure the
safety of the people involved,"
remarked Dave Kemnitzer, one
of the monitors for yesterday's
demonstration.
Lafayette Park
Demonstrators began assembl
ing outside the Induction Center
and in Lafayette Park, five
blocks from the Induction Cen
ter, as early as 5:00 yesterday
morning.
There, they heard speeches by
various Stop the Draft Week
Committee members on the im
portance of nonviolence in avoid
ing injury to any of the demon
strators.
Demonstrators Picket
Shortly after 6:00, the group
marched from the park to the In
duction Center, and set up picket
lines around the block on which
the Center is located, and down
one side of two facing streets.
As their ranks grew the pro
testers increased these other two
lines until they were running
around the block.
The first arrest was made at
6:20, as police picked up George
Kehener on a felony charge.
Forty minutes later, Reese Er
lich, an SDS cordinator, was
arrested. It was reported that the
police had a warrant for his ar
rest because of his actions in
leading Tuesday's demonstra
tion.

Such chants and songs as "Hell
no, nobody goes," and "We Shall
Overcome," common to such
scenes, were popular among the
marchers, but "America the
Beautiful" was also heard.
"This is the first time some of
them have stood up for anything.
It's the first time some of them
have sung 'We Shall Overcome',"
one of the monitors said.
At about 6:30, an Episcopalian
priest on the staff of Bishop
Meyers, the Rev. Father Donald
Ganoung, tried to hold a com
munion service in the street, but
was prevented from doing so by
the police.
Rents Communion Space
He then rented a parking space
in a lot across Clay Street from
the Induction Center and gave
communion there, with the as
sistance of 18 other clergymen of
various faiths.
Some of the priests later of
fered communion to the picket
ers, but few accepted.
They did this "because we
wanted to show the need for
peace between the police and the
demonstrators," Father Gan
oung said. "We also wanted to
protest the Vietnam war, and to
do away with the sense of self
righteousness that many of the
demonstrators had yesterday."
The following members of the
Stanford community are being
held in the Santa Rita County
Jail:
Robert Abshear, Stephen
Durst, John Gostovich, Prof.
John Gurley, Prof. Hadley Kirk
man, David Pugh, Leland Rather,
Ronald Sax, John Shippee, Rob
ert Spitzer, and Stevens Trainer.

The following members of the
Stanford community are being
held in the Santa Rita County
Jail:
Robert Abshear, Stephen
Durst, John Gostovich, Prof.
John Gurley, Prof. Hadley Kirk

Ronald Sax, John Shippee, Rob

Dave Harris, Resistance leader
and former student body presi
dent, was arrested yesterday in
front of the Oakland Induction
Center as he led the third con
secutive day of anti-draft pro
tests.
Harris was charged with tres
passing, disturbing the peace,
and creating a public nuisance.
He has been released on $220 bail.
Sixty-four others were arrested
during the demonstration, most
of them for blocking the en
trance to the Induction Center.
According to Dr. Bruce Frank
lin of the Stanford English De
partment at Stanford, it was de
cided last night in Berkeley to
stage only a small demonstration
today at the Induction Center. A
much larger protest will take
place Friday; there will be no
sit-ins in that demonstration.
Dr. Franklin also said there
was to be a noon rally in White
Plaza today at which speakers
will discuss the protests.
The key to yesterday's protest
was nonviolence, as anti-draft

leaders strove to avoid a repiti
tion of Tuesday's bloodletting.
The 2,500 plus protesters re
sponded to the pleas of their
leaders and there were no inci
dents of physical violence.
Unlike yesterday there .were no
serious incidents.
"We don't want a repeat of yes
terday—we want to insure the
safety of the people involved,"
remarked Dave Kemnitzer, one
of the monitors for yesterday's
demonstration.
Lafayette Park
Demonstrators began assembl
ing outside the Induction Center
and in Lafayette Park, five
blocks from the Induction Cen
ter, as early as 5:00 yesterday
morning.
There, they heard speeches by
various Stop the Draft Week
Committee members on the im
portance of nonviolence in avoid
ing injury to any of the demon
strators.
Demonstrators Picket
Shortly after 6:00, the group
marched from the park to the In
duction Center, and set up picket
lines around the block on which
the Center is located, and down
one side of two facing streets.
As their ranks grew the pro
testers increased these other two
lines until they were running
around the block.
The first arrest was made at
6:20, as police picked up George
Kehener on a felony charge.
Forty minutes later, Reese Er
lich, an SDS cordinator, was
arrested. It was reported that the
police had a warrant for his ar
rest because of his actions in
leading Tuesday's demonstra
tion.

Such chants and songs as "Hell
no, nobody goes," and "We Shall
Overcome," common to such
scenes, were popular among the
marchers, but "America the
Beautiful" was also heard.
"This is the first time some of
them have stood up for anything.
It's the first time some of them
have sung 'We Shall Overcome',"
one of the monitors said.
At about 6:30, an Episcopalian
priest on the staff of Bishop
Meyers, the Rev. Father Donald
Ganoung, tried to hold a com
munion service in the street, but
was prevented from doing so by
the police.
Rents Communion Space
He then rented a parking space
in a lot across Clay Street from
the Induction Center and gave
communion there, with the as
sistance of 18 other clergymen of
various faiths.
Some of the priests later of
fered communion to the picket
ers, but few accepted.
They did this "because we
wanted to show the need for
peace between the police and the
demonstrators," Father Gan
oung said. "We also wanted to
protest the Vietnam war, and to
do away with the sense of self
righteousness that many of the
demonstrators had yesterday."
