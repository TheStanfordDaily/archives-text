# Resistance Re-Run Planned For Dec. 4
## 
### 
To the Resistance, October 16
marks the beginning of a long
range program during which, in
three-month intervals, college
men will turn in their draft
cards and refuse to participate
in American oppression and
murder.
On Monday more than 1,000
men in San Francisco, Los An
geles, Chicago, Boston, Denver,
New York, and Washington,
D.C. returned their draft cards.
Last night members of the Re
sistance held a meeting in Tres
idder to explain the significance
of Monday's demonstration and
to announce plans for further
Resistance action on December
4 to approximately 100 individ
uals. During the next three
months the Resistance will be
contacting as many students as
possible to give the movement
support and to turn in their
draft cards.
Women's Complicity Statement
Mark Silverman, presiding
over the meeting, passed out
four lists for interested mem
bers of the audience to sign,
volunteering assistance to the
Resistance. Among them was a
sign-up sheet to help formulate

a women's complicity petition
similar to a recent faculty com
plicity statement.
Much time was spent discuss
ing the value and effect of the
Oakland demonstrations. Silver
man stated, and was supported
by other Resistance members,
that each member has his own
impression of the demonstra
tions and can not speak for the
others, for the Resistance is an
action, not an organization.
'Spirit of Tuesday'
Plans for the remainder of the
anti-draft week were also out
lined and, after several phone
calls, it was decided that there
would be no formal action today
in Oakland, but that the Berke
ley steering committee has
planned another large demon
stration for Friday which will
be "in the spirit of Tuesday."
The "spirit" will be utilized to
delay busses, to try to not get
hurt, to not provoke violence
and to not get arrested. Several
members of the audience point
ed out that the demonstrations,
although they were not pacifis
tic, were definitely not violent.
Car pools will leave from behind
the bookstore at 5:00 tomorrow
morning.

calls, it was decided that there
would be no formal action today
in Oakland, but that the Berke
ley steering committee has
planned another large demon
stration for Friday which will
be "in the spirit of Tuesday."
The "spirit" will be utilized to
delay busses, to try to not get
hurt, to not provoke violence
and to not get arrested. Several
members of the audience point
ed out that the demonstrations,
although they were not pacifis
tic, were definitely not violent.
Car pools will leave from behind
the bookstore at 5:00 tomorrow
morning.
To the Resistance, October 16
marks the beginning of a long
range program during which, in
three-month intervals, college
men will turn in their draft
cards and refuse to participate
in American oppression and
murder.
On Monday more than 1,000
men in San Francisco, Los An
geles, Chicago, Boston, Denver,
New York, and Washington,
D.C. returned their draft cards.
Last night members of the Re
sistance held a meeting in Tres
idder to explain the significance
of Monday's demonstration and
to announce plans for further
Resistance action on December
4 to approximately 100 individ
uals. During the next three
months the Resistance will be
contacting as many students as
possible to give the movement
support and to turn in their
draft cards.
Women's Complicity Statement
Mark Silverman, presiding
over the meeting, passed out
four lists for interested mem
bers of the audience to sign,
volunteering assistance to the
Resistance. Among them was a
sign-up sheet to help formulate

a women's complicity petition
similar to a recent faculty com
plicity statement.
Much time was spent discuss
ing the value and effect of the
Oakland demonstrations. Silver
man stated, and was supported
by other Resistance members,
that each member has his own
impression of the demonstra
tions and can not speak for the
others, for the Resistance is an
action, not an organization.
'Spirit of Tuesday'
Plans for the remainder of the
anti-draft week were also out
lined and, after several phone
calls, it was decided that there
would be no formal action today
in Oakland, but that the Berke
ley steering committee has
planned another large demon
stration for Friday which will
be "in the spirit of Tuesday."
The "spirit" will be utilized to
delay busses, to try to not get
hurt, to not provoke violence
and to not get arrested. Several
members of the audience point
ed out that the demonstrations,
although they were not pacifis
tic, were definitely not violent.
Car pools will leave from behind
the bookstore at 5:00 tomorrow
